Introduction The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is amending its regulationsregarding the authority it has delegated to its staff. This rule reorganizesthe existing regulations and adopts new regulations that delegates additionalauthority to office directors. II. Background The Commission has previously made several delegations to office directorsand members of its staff.\1\<NOTE/> This final rule grants designated officials the authorityto decide actions that are routine and warrant initial staff decision subjectto appeal to the Commission. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Commission has made several delegations through generalrulemakings. These were ``Delegations to Various Office Directors of CertainCommission Authority,'' 43 FR 36,433 (Aug. 17, 1978); ``Chief Authority,<T3>et al.,</T3> Delegation of Authority, Final Regulation,'' 44 FR 46,449(Aug. 8 1979); ``Delegation of the Commission's Authority to the Directorsof Office of Electric Power Regulation, Office of the Chief Accountant,and Office of Pipeline and Producer Regulation,'' 46 FR 29,700 (June 3,1981); and ``Delegation of Authority,'' 47 FR 17,806 (Apr. 26, 1982). Inaddition, the Commission has made numerous delegations in conjunction withspecific rulemakings and orders. The Commission has broad statutory authority to perform any and all actsand make such rules as are necessary or appropriate to carry out its statutoryfunctions.\2\<NOTE/> Courts have held that agencies may delegate these powersto their employees.\3\<NOTE/> Delegations which result in final decisions may be reviewedby the Commission. Such review acts as a safeguard in the exercise of delegatedauthority.\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Section 309 of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 825h;section 16 of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. 717o; and section 501(a) ofthe Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, 15 U.S.C. 3411. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Fleming v.

DiscussionGenerally, the Commission is granting authority to rule on matters thatare routine and do not raise new policy issues. The delegation regulationscontained in Subpart C of Part 375 are amended by this rule as describedbelow.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Conforming changes and changes made to update the regulationsare noted in the accompanying Appendix A. Office directors may generallydelegate their authority to designees as noted in past and current 18 CFR375.301(b).<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Delegations to the Secretary</ITAG>The Secretary currently has authority to waive requirements of the Commission'srules that govern matters of form and to reject late-filed documents. Inthis rule, the Commission is granting the Secretary additional authorityto reject any documents which do not meet the requirements of the Commission'srules governing matters of form.\9\<NOTE/> The Secretary is also delegated the authority to waive thisrequirement for good cause shown. This delegation rounds out the Secretary'sauthority to act expeditiously on filings that do not comply with the Commission'srequirements and thus cannot be acted on.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ New andSection; 375.302(h).The Commission is also delegating authority to the Secretary to instituteprocedures under Parts 41 and 158 of the Commission's regulations for consideringcontested audit issues.\10\<NOTE/> There are approximately 15 cases per year involving contestedaudit issues. The Commission makes this delegation concurrently with itsdelegation in this rule to the Chief Accountant to sign audit reports thatcontain contested issues, as is explained more fully below. Thus, if aperson subject to the Commission's accounting regulations does not agreeto a shortened procedure (the submission of memoranda) or if any partyin interest requests a hearing for a contested audit issue, the proceedingwill be assigned for hearing by the Secretary in accordance with the Commission'sprocedural rules.\11\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that this delegation will reducethe processing time for contested audits by 30 to 45 days and will assistthe prompt resolution of these audits.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ New andSection; 375.302(m). The proceedings are under Part41, ``Accounts, Records, and Memoranda'' under the Commission's regulationsimplementing the Federal Power Act, 18 CFR Part 41, and Part 158, ``Accounts,Records, and Memoranda'' under the Commission's regulations implementingthe Natural Gas Act, 18 CFR Part 158.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ 18 CFR 41.7 and 158.7 (1987). Sections 385.501 and 385.502of the Commission's rules which provide for setting matters for hearingare amended in this rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Delegations to the Chief Accountant</ITAG>The Commission is delegating new authority to the Chief Accountant in threeareas. First, the Chief Accountant may sign audit reports in cases in whichcompanies do not agree with the report, provided that notice is given ofthe opportunity for a hearing.\12\<NOTE/> Currently, if the staff and a company disagree, the Commissionissues a letter order summarizing the results of the audit, noting thecompany's disagreement, and requesting the company to advise the Commissionwhether it consents to disposition of the matters on which there is disagreementunder the shortened procedures provided in Part 41 or 158 of the Commission'sregulations. There are about fifteen financial audits that are contestedeach year. This delegation allows the Chief Accountant to issue the letterorder summarizing the results of audits which contain staff recommendationswith which the company disagrees. It would reduce the processing timesfor each contested audit by about 30 to 45 days, and, along with the delegationto the Secretary to institute procedures, expedite resolution of thesematters.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ New andSection; 375.303(f).Second, the Chief Accountant may approve requests by state and federalagencies to review audit working papers, subject to certain conditions,if the company being audited has no objection.\13\<NOTE/> Commission authorization is required to make this informationavailable.\14\<NOTE/> The primary reason to delegate such authority is to be moreresponsive to the needs of those requesting access to the papers. Thereare about ten requests per year from the General Accounting Office andstate public utility commissions. This delegation allows approval to begiven in a more timely manner.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ New andSection; 375.303(h).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ <T3>See </T3>section 8(b) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. 717g, section301(b) of the Federal Power Act 16 U.S.C. 825, and section 20(f) of theInterstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. 11901(c) (1987).Lastly, the Chief Accountant is authorized, in the absence of objectionsfrom the affected company, to require the company to take measures to correctbillings that are in violation of Commission approved automatic adjustmenttariffs or related regulations.\15\<NOTE/> The Office of the Chief Accountant examines billings madeby gas and electric companies under automatic adjustment tariffs approvedby the Commission to insure compliance with the terms and conditions ofthe tariffs and related Commission regulations. On occasion, technicalviolations of these regulations occur. In most cases, they do not havea significant dollar impact on tariff billings. The Commission is delegatingauthority to the Chief Accountant to resolve these violations, if the companyagrees, through approving corrective measures, including recomputationand refunds. This delegation will allow these issues to be resolved quickly.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ New andSection;375.303(i).<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Delegations to the Chief Administrative Law Judge</ITAG>The Chief Administrative Law Judge is given the authority to designateand substitute presided officers.\16\<NOTE/> Previously his explicit authority to designate or substitutea presiding officer applied where the judge who presiding over the receiptof evidence became unavailable.\17\<NOTE/> This delegation gives the Chief Administrative Law Judgeflexibility in assigning and substituting presiding officers. The Commissionbelieves this delegation will enable the Chief Administrative Law Judgeto manage the Commission's docket of cases set for hearing more effectivelysince he may now distribute or redistribute the caseload as the need arises.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ New andSection;375.304(b)(iii).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ 18 CFR 385.708(c)(2) (1987).<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Delegations to the Director of the Office of Pipeline and ProducerRegulation</ITAG>The Commission is delegating authority to the Director of the Office ofPipeline and Producer Regulation to grant or deny requests for waiversof the requirements for statements and reports under Part 260 (statementsand Reports (Schedules)) of the Commission's regulations.\18\<NOTE/> The Director has previously been able to extend the timefor filing of reports and waive requirements for filing.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ New andSection;375.307(f)(2).<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Delegations to the Director of the Office of Electric Power Regulation</ITAG>Formerly, the Director of the Office of Electric Power Regulation was authorizedto reject rate filings and other filings that failed to comply with therequirements of Section 405 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act(PURPA) relating to exemptions from Part I of the Federal Power Act. Inthis rule, the Commission is granting the Director authority to rejectrate filings that patently fail to comply with applicable statutory requirementsor Commission rules, regulations, or orders.\19\<NOTE/> The authority pertaining to other Section 405 PURPA filingshas been transferred to the Director of the Office of Hydropower Licensing.\20\<NOTE/> This delegation makes the authority of the Director of theOffice of Electric Power Regulation comparable to that of the Directorof the Office of Producer and Pipeline Regulation.\21\<NOTE/> It also permits prompt disposition of electric rate filings.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ New andSection; 375.308(a)(3).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ New andSection; 375.314(r).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ New andSection; 375.307(b)(2), formerly 18 CFR 375.307(b)(2).<ITAG tagnum="81">F. Delegations to the Director of the Office of Economic Policy</ITAG>The Commission is delegating authority to the Director of the Office ofEconomic Policy to issue quarterly updates of the benchmark rate of returnfor public utilities\22\<NOTE/> under the Federal Power Act.\23\<NOTE/> The updates are prepared by a mechanical application of theformula established in a proceeding which is conducted through informalrulemakings.\24\<NOTE/> Calculation of the updates is thus wholly ministerial anddoes not require formal action by the Commission itself.\25\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ 18 CFR 37.3(a) (1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ New andSection; 375.310(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ 18 CFR 37.4 (1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ In a recent final rule updating the benchmark rate ofreturn on common equity for the jurisdictional operations of electric publicutilities, the Commission stated it will hold another annual generic rateof return proceeding and in that proceeding will decide whether to holdsubsequent annual proceedings or to convert to periodic proceedings. <T3>See</T3> ``Generic Determination of Rate of Return on Common Equityfor Public Utilities,'' Docket No. RM87-35-000, Order No. 489 (Jan. 291988), 53 Fed. Reg. 3342, 3359 (Feb. 5, 1988). <ITAG tagnum="81">G.

Delegations to the Director of the Office of Hydropower Licensing</ITAG>The Commission is delegating authority to the Director of the Office ofHydropower Licensing to take additional action in two areas_enforcementand exemptions.The Commission is delegating to the Director the authority to require alicensee or an applicant to take actions necessary to comply with the Commission'sdam safety regulations \28\<NOTE/> or actions that are otherwise necessary to protect humanlife, health, property, or the environment.\29\<NOTE/> This delegation will make enforcement action by the Commissionmore rapid and effective.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\18 CFR Part 12 (1987).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\New andSection;375.314(g). Authority to require actionsto comply with Part 12 of the Commission's regulations, 18 CFR Part 12(1987) is already delegated in andSection;12.4 of Title 18 CFR.  The Commission is particularly concerned with the safety of projects thatmay be within its jurisdiction and are unlicensed. The Office of HydropowerLicensing is currently undertaking an inspection program to ensure thatthe owner of any unlicensed project within the Commission's jurisdictionobtains a license and takes any safety measures that may be necessary forthe safe operation of the project and the prevention of injury.  The delegation to the Director relating to an unlicensed project confirmsthe Director's authority to take action on an unlicensed project. It expresslystates that the Director may ascertain the Commission's jurisdiction overan unlicensed project, require filing of a license application, and requirethat actions necessary to comply with the Commission's dam safety regulationsor otherwise protect human life, health, property, or the environment areundertaken.\30\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\New andSection;375.314(h).  The Commission is also granting the Director authority to deny as wellas grant applications for exemption \31\<NOTE/> and the authority to reject or dismiss an application ifan applicant does not correct deficiencies in the application or if anapplicant fails to provide timely additional information \32\<NOTE/> as required under Commission regulations.\33\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\New andSection;375.314(a)(2). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\New andSection;andSection;375.314 (k)(2) and (k)(3).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\18 CFR 4.32 (a), (b), (d)(1), and (f) and 4.38 (1987). <ITAG tagnum="81">H.

Effective Date The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) \35\<NOTE/> requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking be publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and that an opportunity for comment be providedwhen an agency promulgates regulations. The APA sets forth exemptions tothe notice and comment requirements if the rule is, <T3>inter alia, </T3>a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice,or if the Commission for good cause finds that notice and comment proceduresthereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\5 U.S.C. 553(b) (1982).These regulations delegating authority set forth internal procedures tobe followed by the Commission's staff. They relate to the performance ofduties by the Commission staff and the way in which Commission businessis conducted. The Commission finds that the rule is one of agency organization,procedure, or practice and that notice and public procedure thereon arenot required. In addition, under the APA, a substantive rule does not become effectiveuntil 30 days after publication or service.\3\\6\<NOTE/> This rule is procedural, rather than substantive, and thereforemay become effective immediately.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\6\ 5 U.S.C. 553(d) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>18 CFR Part 375Authority delegations (Government agencies), Seals and insignia, SunshineAct.18 CFR Part 385Administrative practice and procedure, Pipelines, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.In consideration of the foregoing, the Commission amends Parts 375 and385, Chapter I of Title 18, Code of Federal Regulations, as set forth below,effective April 15, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission.

Trabandt, Dissenting in Part I dissent in part as to three new specific delegations to the Directorto the Office of Hydro Power Licensing (OHL).  First, I dissent from the new delegation on environmental matters in newsection 375.314(g). This allows the Director to require operators of projectsto undertake actions to protect the environment under the following conditions:(i) where the Commission has not acted yet to establish environmental protectionrequirements in the license or permit articles and conditions applicableto a project; or (ii) where required actions would not be consistent fullywith any such license articles or conditions already established by theCommission.  I object to the provision for several reasons. First of all, the majorityhas failed to demonstrate any need for such new delegated authority. Isee no reason for us to authorize the Director to impose on a project environmentalprotection measures before the Commission acts or outside any articlesor conditions the Commission has already established. Additionally, suchdelegated authority would grant the Director a virtual ``blank check''to order applicants, licensees and permittees to take almost any form ofaction the name of environmental protection, irrespective of pending orcompleted Commission action in the licensing process. We must not forgetthat current law requires that the licensing process reflect ``equal consideration''of all relevant values, not only environmental concerns.  My opposition to this delegation goes beyond that. Clearly, the Director'snew authority could also encompass issuing an order to an operating projectto modify or cease operations without any prior notice to or participationby the Full Commission. Such unlimited delegation also offends the generalnotion that delegations be accompanied by specific guidelines for actionand reflect already settled policy previously established by the Commission. Second, I dissent from the new delegation in new section 375.314(h). Here,the Commission empowers the Director to independently initiate an investigationof the jurisdictional status of an unlicensed existing project, make thejurisdictional determination, require the filing of a license, and requireactions equivalent to those of section 375.314(g). This new jurisdictionaldetermination authority will codify an existing <T3>unauthorized</T3> practice of the Director over the past year, discussedin my opinion dissenting in part in the order issued by the Commissionin Docket Nos. UL87-3-001 and UL87-9-001 in cases affecting two existingprojects of the Fairfax County Water Authority.  The threshold issue for me, as it should be for the Commission, in hydrolicensing regulation is the jurisdictional status of a project and whetherit must be licensed under the Federal Power Act. The mandatory licensingof existing projects under such jurisdictional determinations the Directormakes can impose on operators significant financial, operational and constructionrequirements. I am not persuaded that there is, in the first instance,any justification for the year-old nation wide investigatory program, whetheras a matter of law of policy as discussed in my opinion in the <T3>Fairfax County</T3> cases.  But, even if there was such a persuasive justification, the actual jurisdictionaldetermination should be vested in the Full Commission and <T3>not</T3> by delegation to the Director. The fact that the Directorhas already made 38 or more such wholly unauthorized determinations doesnot constitute persuasive justification. This delegation, in my judgment,is a plain and simple abdication of the Full Commission's jurisdictionaldetermination responsibilities with absolutely no redeeming public policypurpose.Finally, I dissent from the new delegation, in new sections 375.314(k)(2)and (k)(3), to the Director to reject or dismiss an application if an applicantdoes not correct deficiencies in the application or if an applicant failsto provide timely additional information. The Director of OHL in Septemberand October 1985, used similar actions to dismiss over a 150 then pendingapplications as deficient. All but a few of those projects were lost asa result of that dismissal effort. Eventually, when the occasional appealsof the Director's actions reached the Full Commission, we granted furtherconsideration to the projects and adopted a new ``reasonable man'' reviewstandard for reversal of Director actions in place of the prior ``arbitraryand capricious'' standard. This new delegation effectively ratifies thegeneral approach which lead to the 1985 Director actions and codifies itfor the future.Permitting project owners to appeal the Director's determinations to theFull Commission offers scant comfort. The appeal process, taking many monthsand much effort, especially on the part of the large number of smallerand less financially capable project sponsors, does not provide a reasonableand practical procedural opportunity for them to challenge the Director'sactions. That was the result in 1985 and, unfortunately, could be the resultagain under this new delegation if projects are dismissed by the Directorand then, as it were, financially drowned by the delays and expenses inthe appeal process to a clearly unsympathetic, if not completely uninterested,Full Commission. I am concerned seriously that this delegation will, ata minimum, create the delegated authority and procedural dynamics to bringabout that irresponsible result time and time again.In conclusion, I am reminded of a recent letter of March 17, 1988, fromCong. John D. Dingell, in his capacity as Chairman of the Subcommitteeon Oversight and Investigations, of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.In that letter, which was critical of the Commission's handling of cumulativeimpact assessments, Chairman Dingell commented that, ``the subcommitteeis interested in the FERC staff view * * * they are undoubtedly very capable,but under the law they are not the policy makers and they are not the peopleaccountable to Congress * * * That is the role of the Commissioners.''I could not agree more completely with the distinguished Chairman of theSubcommittee.The Commissioners are the policy makers and hydro licensing authoritiesunder the Federal Power Act and the Full Commission, not the staff, isaccountable by law to Congress. The three areas of this delegation orderdiscussed above, in the aggregate, constitute a significant delegationof our authority in hydro licensing to the staff and therefore to thatextent an abdication of our statutory responsibilities. I cannot and willnot support that clear and unambiguous result in this order.<ITAG tagnum="6">Charles A.
