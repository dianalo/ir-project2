Filmsdeposited onto (100) MgO show x-ray diffraction patterns characteristicof c-axis textured Bi{sub 2}(Sr,Ca,Bi){sub 3}Cu{sub 2}O/sub x/ phasefollowing annealing for 10 min at 850 {sup 0}C in 20% O{sub 2}-80% N{sub2}. These textured films have zero resistance at 78 K and show resistancedrops near 110 K. The effects of the annealing environment on the electricaland structural properties are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
