Robert Abboud has recruited a group of executives from the last two companies he ran to head up First City Bancorp. of Texas, and they are planning deep cost cuts -- including perhaps laying off as many as 1,200 workers, banking sources said.    Houston-based First City, which is expected late this year to receive the second biggest federal banking bailout ever (after the 1984 rescue of Continental Illinois Corp.), would immediately return to profitability under forecasts Mr. Abboud's group is circulating among investors.    The sources, who have access to a confidential stock offering circular, said the group is forecasting profit for next year of $84 million, or a 15.23% return on First City's post-bailout equity, which would place it among the better-performing bank holding companies in the U.S.    Even without large and immediate personnel cuts, Mr. Abboud said in an interview yesterday, First City's earnings would rebound quickly. And he said any big personnel cuts would enhance those earnings.    Barring yet another plunge in the fortunes of the Texas economy, or some broader business downturn, Mr. Abboud would appear from the offering circular to have cut a sweet deal with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The agency has agreed to inject $970 million into First City, which has been tottering near collapse because of bad loans. Nearly all problem loans would be transferred to a separate bank. While the bailout's terms previously were disclosed, what hadn't been known was the extent of First City's projected profitability.    As reported earlier, in addition to the FDIC money, Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., New York, has agreed to raise about $500 million from private investors to recapitalize First City. The stock market plunge could make selling that stock more difficult, but officials close to the offering, which is due before year end, don't expect any problems.    Meanwhile, the new management team plans to move quickly, the sources said, to consolidate First City's bloated organization. The staffs of the holding company and lead bank in Houston probably will be combined over time, and many back-office functions performed at individual banks will be centralized. Altogether, about 16% of the 7,427 workers, or 1,200, could be cut. First City would establish a $48 million reserve for severance payments.    Mr. Abboud expects to slash annual operating expenses by about $90 million in 1988 alone. That figure doesn't include any big and immediate personnel cuts.    The reduction in operating expenses, together with the removal of the problem loans, would be enough to make First City highly profitable again. In addition, the Abboud group forecasts strong loan growth of 6% next year and about 11% in each of the following two years.    Mr. Abboud until 1980 was chairman and chief executive officer of the bank holding company First Chicago Corp., and was ousted after a board struggle. He was named president of Occidental Petroleum Corp. that same year, and left in 1984 after clashing with the oil concern's chairman, Armand Hammer. Following the recapitalization of First City, Mr. Abboud would be named chairman and chief executive officer.    Other members of management, the sources said, would include:    --Frank C. Cihak, a former vice president at First Chicago, who would be First City's vice chairman. Mr. Cihak, who would head up staff and planning functions, is described by former associates as a tough negotiator and investor. He bought into several small banks after leaving First Chicago in 1976.    --Thomas D. Jenkins, a former Occidental Petroleum executive, who would be chief executive officer of the so-called collecting bank, where First City will transfer and try to collect on $1.79 billion of problem loans, many of them to oil and gas borrowers. &quot;Tom's the kind of guy who can package up a lousy loan and sell it,&quot; an official said.    --Another banker with ties to Mr. Abboud, not named in the offering circular, is expected to be named president and chief operating officer of First City.    Twice before scarred by internal battles at large corporations, Mr. Abboud is insisting that managers around him be loyal, sources said.    In addition, the circular says Robert C. Baldwin, a former executive at MBank Houston, a unit of another big troubled Texas banking concern, MCorp, would become a First City executive vice president in charge of business development.    Mr. Abboud also has identified a number of existing First City officers he plans to retain and possibly promote. &quot;The real hard-core line management guys are solid,&quot; one official said. Those include Bookman Peters, who heads up First City's Bryan, Texas, bank, and C. Ivan Wilson, who heads up the Austin bank. It's known that Mr. Abboud wants to keep mostly Texans in the jobs that deal extensively with customers.    Mr. Abboud said federal regulators have agreed to allow J.A. Elkins Jr., the First City senior chairman who presided over the company's collapse, to remain as a director. The FDIC typically fires top managers at bailed-out banks. But Mr. Elkins's family is among the Houston business community's best known, and Mr. Abboud, a Chicagoan, wants all the contacts he can get.    ---                    First City's Prospects                         NET INCOME          RETURN ON          YEAR           (in millions)       EQUITY          1988           $ 84                15.23%          1989           $113                18.11%          1990           $133                18.71%   NOTE: All figures are forecasts.
