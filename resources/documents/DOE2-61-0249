Smith Company,Inc., Westfield, Massachusetts, due to concern over symptoms of breathingdifficulties experienced by workers. Workers at the foundry were involvedin coremaking, mold making, casting, shake out, and knockout operations.Possible exposures to carbon monoxide (CO), respirable free silica, dimethylethylamine(DMEA),and acrolein were determined. Acrolein was not detected. CO levels rangedfrom 0.3 to 95 parts per million (ppm), and DMEA was found at 0.9 to10.4mg/m{sup 3}. The respirable free silica ranged up to 0.54mg/m{sup3}. Pulmonary function tests and x rays showed no evidence of silicoticlung disease. The authors conclude that a health hazard existed due toworker exposures to respirable free silica, DMEA, and CO. The authorsrecommend measures to reduce worker exposures, including a mandatorypersonal protective-equipment policy, administrative and engineeringcontrols for CO, improvements in ventilation, and periodic medical examinations.</TEXT></DOC>
