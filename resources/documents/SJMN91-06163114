Belluomini willoutline how to provide those services for $195,000, less than half the formercost.;    &quot;We've cut a lot of units and we also cut the clerical staff ofthose who are left,&quot; trustee Loren Bainer said. &quot;We have to partially restorefunding so those who are left can pick up the slack. What we're in effecttrying to do is reduce management but give the administration the clericalstaff they need to get these jobs done.&quot;;    Under the plan, facilitiesmanager Tony Nieves would get $42,000 for extra staff to absorb the duties ofthe risk management department -- which oversees safety, self-insurance andenergy use. This year, risk management cost $87,000.;    The superintendent'soffice would get $108,000 to absorb the functions of the community relationsdepartment, the instructional services office and Partners in Education. Thisyear, community relations, which provides information to the news media andthe public, cost $117,000. The instructional services office cost $234,000 andPartners in Education, which fosters exchanges between business and schools,cost about $20,000.;    Directors of elementary and secondary education wouldget $45,000 to absorb the functions of the staff and curriculum developmentoffice, which cost $109,000 this year.;    Belluomini declined to say exactlyhow the $195,000 would be used, or whether staff members holding the positionswould be employed next fall. &quot;I want to wait and see if the school board givesme the money first before I approach these people,&quot; he said.;    Though theywill hear the plan Wednesday, trustees may wait until after a budget hearingJune 19 to vote on the proposal.;    The board also will consider other budgetproblems. For example, it has eliminated busing for high school and juniorhigh students to save $1 million. Many parents have called for restoringtransportation and offered to pay a bus fee. But trustees said the district islegally limited to charging $1.10 per day in bus fees, and that wouldn't coverall busing costs.;    The board is trying to fill an unprecedented $7.8million deficit in its $116 million budget. Besides the $5.4 million in cuts,trustees tentatively plan to use about $2 million in reserves and raise moneyto make up the shortfall.;     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The Fremont UnifiedSchool District board will discuss the management proposal at its meeting at7:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Fremont City Council chambers, City Hall.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RENEE KOURY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910611  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  491  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday June 11, 199100163114,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
