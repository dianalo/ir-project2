The operationalfunction of a modern building automation system with its attendant interfaceand communications networks is explained. Typically such systems consistof intelligent outstations which monitor environmental sensors and providecontrol signals direct to actuators and motors for the control of theplant. The use of such systems gives cost savings from the more efficientuse of fuel and manpower. Fuel savings come from the elimination of wastefuluse at non-occupied times and the control of maximum demand tariff onelectricity supplied systems. The article concludes by looking at sometypical applications.</TEXT></DOC>
