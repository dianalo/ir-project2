Based on recent trading prices, the purchase could cost about $126 million. Koppers has traded in the range of $26 to $30 in the past month. Koppers closed yesterday at $30, up $1.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Although Koppers said a year ago that it planned to buy back some stock as part of a restructuring, the size of the purchase is larger than anticipated, partly because the company realized more than expected on the sale of assets, said a spokesman for Koppers. He said the restructuring has yielded more than the $160 million anticipated, but wouldn't say exactly how much. The company has spent much of those proceeds on previously reported acquisitions and joint ventures, he said.    Koppers, a manufacturing, engineering and construction concern, will buy the stock on the open market or in block trades arranged with institutional investors, and will offer an odd-lot buyback to holders of fewer than 100 shares. </TEXT></DOC>
