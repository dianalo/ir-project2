Reports conflicted on whether the activists were armed.   Special National Police units surrounded the six-story CentralAmerican Building, but no violence was reported. The embassy is onthe third floor.   Costa Rican Ambassador Jesus Manuel Fernandez told TheAssociated Press by telephone from the embassy that he askedmilitary authorities at the scene to lift the cordon around thebuilding. He said his request was being considered. MonsignorArturo Rivera Damas, the Roman Catholic archbishop of San Salvador,entered the embassy shortly after nightfall, presumably trying toresolve the standoff.   Consul General Humberto Murillo and First Secretary Rene Aldamaalso were held. Most other hostages were people visiting theembassy on business. Fifteen journalists and five people from theGreen Cross, a local first aid group, also were inside but notconsidered hostages.   Red Cross personnel took sandwiches to those inside.   Fernandez, who has a heart condition, said he was ``fine ... Ihave been brought my medicine, and the Red Cross doctor examinedme.'' He said there were 20 demonstrators, most of them women.   Fernandez said earlier some demonstrators were armed, but he didnot identify the weapons.   Reporters said they saw a handgun tucked into the waistband ofat least one young man who stormed the mission. They also saiddemonstrators carried newspaper-wrapped packets that appeared tohave a fuse.   Government spokesman Mauricio Sandoval told reporters thetakeover was ``an act of provocation'' but was being dealt with``calmly, so no one gets hurt.''   The activists' spokeswoman, who refused to give her name, saidthey had no weapons.   The spokeswoman said the activists belonged to The Federation ofCommittees of Mothers and Relatives of Political Prisoners,Disappeared and Assassinated People of El Salvador. She said theyplanned to stay at the embassy until its demands were met.   The Federation of Committees for the past eight years hasprotested the kidnapping and killing of suspected leftists byrightist death squads.   ``It is very sad that there are people who believe that violencecan be the good instrument to get what they want,'' said PresidentOscar Arias of Costa Rica when informed of the embassy takeover.   Arias, winner of the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for devising aCentral American peace plan, spoke at a news conference in SanJose, Calif., where he was visiting. He said he would return homeif the situation grew worse.   In San Jose, Costa Rica, Foreign Ministry spokesman DinoStarcewic said, ``Shortly after midday, a woman employee at theembassy called us to say that a group of attackers had seized theembassy and taken people hostage, and that they are heavily armed,with rifles and even hand grenades.''   The activists went past security guards pretending they wantedto apply for visas to go to Costa Rica, Starcewic said in atelephone interview.   More than 70,000 people have been killed since a leftistguerrilla war began a decade ago, and human rights groups say alarge number of the victims have been civilians slain by the deathsquads.</TEXT></DOC>
