Last year the Navy ordered its first such ship for anti-submarine warfare. And a Hawaiian company is building a $2 million ship that it may operate as a ferry in the stormy channels among the Hawaiian Islands.    The vessels, known as &quot;swath&quot; (small waterplane area, twin hull) ships, are stable even in extremely rough waters. They owe their stability to twin cigar-shaped hulls, which contain their engines and travel 10 feet under the water surface. Struts from the hulls rise out of the water and support the deck and cabin area, eight feet above the surface.    Because the ship's motion is insulated from the surface action, &quot;it has the pitch, roll and heave of a monohull four times its length,&quot; says Michael Schmicker, vice president of Pacific Marine, a closely held Honolulu company that has ordered a 131-foot swath ship.    SWATH BOOSTERS SAY the ships are faster than monohulls because they aren't slowed by pitching, rolling and wave drag. They are slower than hydrofoils, which skim the surface, but they can sail in rough water that would swamp hydrofoils. Swath boosters concede, though, that the vessels don't make good cargo ships because the hulls are too small and big deck loads make them top-heavy.    The Navy has operated an experimental swath ship called the Kimolina in Hawaii for about 15 years, and several Japanese companies have built similar vessels. But &quot;naval architects don't like them because they've spent their whole lives&quot; dealing with different design concepts, says John Craven, director of the Law of the Sea Institute at the University of Hawaii and a swath fan.    The Navy finally decided to build a swath ship for anti-submarine warfare, where a stable platform makes life more comfortable for the technicians glued to their instruments. McDermott Inc. is building the $25 million vessel at its Morgan City, La., yard. Scheduled for completion in 1990, it may be followed by three more.    Pacific Marine says that if its first boat works as expected, it plans a fleet of ferry and excursion boats. Swath designs may also find use as platforms for oceanographic researchers and as a way to transport harbor pilots to oceangoing vessels.    Passengers say swath ships make a difference. Mr. Craven once sailed on the Kimolina on a rough day when a comparably sized conventional excursion boat was nearby. &quot;We were watching them deposit their breakfasts while we were eating,&quot; he recalls.    ---   New Generation of Satellite Instruments    Oceanographers and meteorologists hope to capture much clearer pictures of the world's systems of wind, water currents and weather. They are designing satellite instruments to provide regular data on cloud-shrouded polar regions and large areas of the oceans that are only rarely visited by seaborne weather observers.    Traditionally, oceanographers &quot;thumbed their noses at satellite pictures,&quot; says Kathryn Kelly, an oceanographer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. &quot;They said real data comes from ships in the water.&quot; But after examining data produced by a 1978 satellite in just three months before its power failed, scientists saw a potential for instruments to go beyond the weather satellite's cloud photos and the infrared images that detect temperature differences.    For instance, Ms. Kelly is working on a device called a &quot;scatterometer.&quot; It uses radar technology to detect ocean wave motion. From that, she says, she will be able to use a computer program to analyze wind speed, wind direction and the roughness of the sea. The device is scheduled to go up on a Navy satellite in 1992.    Scientists are even more excited about a National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite called Earth Observing System, scheduled for launch in 1995. This satellite will carry a variety of instruments, some of which are already in use on other satellites. Jan Turkiewicz, an instrumentation specialist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Md., says, &quot;It's the simultaneity of their measurements that is of particular interest. We're looking for the synergy you get by looking at the same phenomenon with different sensors.&quot;    SPECTROMETERS MORE PRECISE than any now in space will be able to measure the scattering of aerosols and gases in the atmosphere. They also will be used to follow the spread of vegetation or snow cover on land. The spectrometer may even make it possible to discriminate among crop types.    Scientists have devised ways to use microwave technology to augment infrared photographs and measure temperatures, soil moisture and ice characteristics, even through clouds. This would be especially useful in areas like Antarctica that are usually cloud covered. Another instrument will measure the altitude of water vapor and dust, making it possible to model the development of storms.    Mr. Turkiewicz says the devices will allow scientists to &quot;address questions that concern the integrated functioning of the earth and its systems: the hydrologic cycle, biological cycles and climate processes.&quot; Scientists say better sensing also will mean safer ship routing and more accurate weather forecasting for sea and land.    Judith T. Kildow, a professor in the department of ocean engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, adds, &quot;The advent of remote sensing allows oceanographers to do in a day work that used to take a year.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
