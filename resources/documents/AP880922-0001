Saw Maung pledged to holdelections as soon as peace is restored.   The capital was quiet for the third day since troops ruthlesslysuppressed protests against the military coup that Saw Maung ledSunday.   Saw Maung, who became prime minister Wednesday, is the third newleader in two months of chaos and bloodshed. Like the twogovernment heads before him, he is closely associated with Ne Win,who seized power in 1962.   Ne Win resigned in late July after widespread protests against26 years of authoritarian rule that plunged resource-rich Burmainto poverty. His successor, Sein Lwin, lasted for 17 days ofmassive street protests. The next ruler, President Maung Maung, wasa civilian but was seen as close to the military.   The United States said Thursday it was cutting off all aid toBurma except humanitarian assistance. Rudi Boone, a StateDepartment spokesman in Washington, said he believed U.S. aid toBurma totaled $12.3 million, but he did not know how much of theaid is humanitarian.   A letter sent to Saw Maung on Thursday from opposition leadersAung Gyi, Tin Oo, and Aung San Suu Kyi urged the government ``notto arrest people including the monks, students, artists, etc., inconnection with the recent unrest and also to release those alreadyunder detention.''   Since the coup, security forces have broken up protest centersmanned mostly by monks and students in at least 95 towns. They havereported only eight arrests in those sweeps. The government alsosaid security forces arrested 100 people in Rangoon; they weredescribed as looters.   The opposition figures also urged Saw Maung, who was armedforces commander before the coup, to end his ban on newspapers andannounce a list of casualties in shooting.   The government has acknowledged security forces killed at least146 people since the coup, but a Western diplomat put the figure ashigh as 400, including many unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators.   Opposition leaders did not reply to Saw Maung's letter receivedWednesday in which he said the army does not intend to hold ontopower for long and asked for help to prepare for what would be thefirst multiparty elections since 1960.   ``The army has no intention to retain the duties of state powerfor a long time, in addition to its existing onerous duties. We hadto step in unavoidably because of the deteriorating generalconditions in the country,'' said the letter, Saw Maung's firstcontact with the opposition leadership.   ``We promise you that free and fair general elections will beheld as soon as peace and tranquillity is restored in the country.''   The letter added that political parties will be allowed to usegovernment radio and television for their campaigns. But Saw Maungdid not set a date for the promised elections.   Maung Maung, a civilian who was briefly president before beingousted in Sunday's coup, bowed to massive street protests andagreed to end one-party rule and hold multiparty elections as soonas early October.   But the opposition rejected that formula and instead continuedstreet demonstrations demanding an interim government be formed toconduct the balloting.   In Rangoon, more roadside shops were open Thursday than theprevious day, but large markets remained closed.   The doors of government offices were open, but no one wasworking. Most public employees have been on pro-democracy strikessince Aug. 8 and the government has set an Oct. 3 deadline for themto return to work.   Sketchy reports received from Mandalay, the second-largest city,and other towns indicated security forces and protesters foughtthis week, though not as fierce as in the capital.   State radio said security forces arrested eight people Wednesdaynight in a sweep of the protest center at Mandalay University andkilled two other people in separate incidents in the city. Mandalayis about 350 miles north of Rangoon.   Also Wednesday night, a group of people sent about 50 waterbuffaloes after soldiers on the Mandalay Golf Course and attackedthe troops with catapults and metal darts. The radio said theattackers escaped but five buffaloes were reported killed.   A diplomat said a few U.S. Embassy officials in Rangoon would beevacuated to Bangkok in the next few days. More than 100 dependentsof staff members were evacuated earlier.   ``The embassy remains open. This is as a precaution,'' said RossPetzing, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok.   Japan expressed concern Thursday about political developments inBurma and said it would wait to decide whether to recognize the newmilitary government. Tokyo is the largest foreign aid donor toRangoon although official assistance has dropped recently.   Burma, once the world's largest rice exporter, last year joined40 other countries officially designated by the United Nations as``least developed nation.''   Officials said the Soviet Union and the European Economiccommunity protested the recent bloodshed. The United States earliersaid it might withdraw aid in light of the military coup andbloodshed.</TEXT></DOC>
