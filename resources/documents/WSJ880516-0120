Perhaps so. But he opposes the legislation by mere shibboleth: &quot;It silences our speech. It smothers our freedom. It tramples on our Constitution.&quot; I comment on these in reverse order.    To begin with, the First Amendment, in contradistinction to its passing interpreters, does not prohibit all limitation on free speech or press, but only congressional legislation that interferes with our expressing ideas that criticize government or aim at inducing political or social change. Indeed, from 1868 to 1957, Lord Cockburn's Hicklen test was commonly applied in American courts to sustain conviction under federal (and state) statutes against obscenity. And even the rights-expanding Roth decision admits that pornography is &quot;no essential part of any exposition of ideas&quot; (Roth v. United States, 1957).    Second, every law prohibiting some kind of action smothers our freedom. Part of the purpose of law is to prevent evils (e.g., mayhem or fraud) that would occur more frequently were government not to prohibit them. Perhaps pornography is not an evil, but its putative legitimacy cannot be established by remarking tautologically that a law prohibiting it smothers our freedom to use it. Notice that the rest of our freedoms (e.g., Mr. Gartner's freedom to criticize Congress) remain intact.    Last, whether or not pornography is speech within the meaning of the First Amendment is arguable. But even Mr. Gartner, I suspect, does not believe that panting, however practiced, expresses an idea.    Robert Hoffman   Professor of Philosophy   York College   City University of New York   Jamaica, N.Y.    ---   Is there no proper limit to freedom of speech? Mr. Gartner's plea for freedom of speech for dial-a-porn is not far removed from a plea for freedom of speech for one who shouts &quot;Fire!&quot; in a crowded theater.    Harley M.
