The suspension prevents the research and development center ofHughes' missile systems group from bidding on new governmentbusiness but doesn't affect outstanding contracts.   The center is located in the San Fernando Valley suburb ofCanoga Park and employs 2,100 workers, mostly scientists andengineers. The missile group accounted for $1.3 billion of Hughes'$7.4 billion in 1988 sales, the last year for which sales werebroken down by division. Overally, Hughes has about 68,000 workers.   ``Obviously we are very concerned about it,'' said Hughesspokesman Richard Dore. ``It doesn't really have an impact oncurrent programs.''   Hughes received notice of the ban last Thursday and has 30 daysto present its case, said Capt. Jack Giese, an Air Force spokesman.   The Air Force has proposed a three-year suspension for theresearch center, Dore said. The actual length of the suspensionwill be decided after the government reviews operations at thecenter, he said.   The suspension was imposed after Hughes entered guilty pleas ontwo felony counts of using classified Pentagon documents to gain acompetitive advantage.   Hughes executives said they acquired classified documentsbetween 1978 and 1985. The guilty pleas were entered in March.</TEXT></DOC>
