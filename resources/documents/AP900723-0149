Souter, a little-known federal appeals courtjudge, to the Supreme Court. Bush said he acted without questioningSouter on abortion or other delicate judicial issues.   If confirmed by a majority of the Senate, Souter, a 50-year-oldbachelor from New Hampshire, would succeed William J. Brennan, whoretired last Friday.   Bush's quick decision took Washington by surprise and shiftedthe nation's attention to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which iscertain to examine Souter's record and explore his views onabortion and other issues.   With Souter standing at his side, Bush described Souter as ``aremarkable judge of keen intellect and the highest ability.'' Hechose his nominee after meeting him for the first time earlier inthe day.   The president said it would have been ``inappropriate'' to applyan abortion ``litmus test'' on his nominee. He said the selectionwas not geared to any single issue but to his ability to interpretthe law.   Souter has been on the federal appeals court for such a shortperiod of time that he has not yet penned an opinion.   Gordon Tiffany, like Souter a former New Hampshire attorneygeneral, said it is hard to classify Souter's judicial philosophy.   ``Whether it's liberal or conservative, it's not the issue inhis mind. The issue in his mind is what was intended in theConstitution,'' Tiffany said.   Conservatives hoped Bush would give them a nominee who wouldoverthrow the 1973 Roe-vs.-Wade decision that legalized abortion.   The nomination appeared to underscore the influence exercised byJohn Sununu, Bush's chief of staff, who as governor of NewHampshire had put Souter on that state's Supreme Court in 1983.Like Bush, Sununu is an outspoken opponent of abortion.   Andrew Card, Sununu's deputy, said Sununu did not suggest Souterto Bush.   At a news conference, a questioner noted that Bush and Sununuboth have widely known views against abortion and asked why peopleshouldn't think that Souter's abortion view was known to Bush evenif Bush did not question him about it.   ``I told you it's not,'' Bush said.   The National Right to Life Committee, a leading anti-abortiongroup, said it did not believe Souter had ever expressed an opinionon abortion. But the committee said it was pleased that Bush saidhe chose Souter because of his philosophy of not trying tolegislate from the bench.   Bush noted that Souter had won unanimous Senate confirmationwhen he was nominated in January for the appeals court, suggestinghis hope that the nomination might not trigger a politicalfree-for-all in the Senate.   ``We're not bracing for some horrendous fight with the UnitedStates Senate,'' Bush said.   But Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., a liberal member of the SenateJudiciary Committee, said it would be ``naive'' to think thatSouter would not be quizzed about abortion.   ``There will be a lot more known about him, I guarantee youthat,'' said Leahy.   In fact, pro-choice groups demanded that committee sound Souterout on his abortion views.   ``The American people need to know where Judge Souter stands onthe issues of individual and human rights,'' said Judith Lichtman,president of the National Women's Legal Defense Fund.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell praised Souter'sexperience but did not express an opinion on the nomination.Mitchell promised Democrats would conduct prompt and fair hearings.   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the ranking Republican on theJudiciary Committee, said he expected few if any fireworks overSouter's record ``because he just went on the court in April.''   When Bush nominated Souter for the appeals court, the AmericanBar Association's screening committee called him ``well-qualified''_ its highest rating for judicial nominees.   Bush said he decided on Souter earlier in the day.   ``The excellence was just there,'' Bush said.   The president praised Brennan as well, calling the court'slong-time leading liberal, ``one of the greatest figures of hisage.''   The 84-year-old Brennan, in frail health, resigned Friday.Appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, he had served longerthan most Americans have been alive.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
