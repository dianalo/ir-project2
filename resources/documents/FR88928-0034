Introduction</ITAG>A. BackgroundThe Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is proposing forcomment Rule 15c2-12 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``ExchangeAct''),\1\<NOTE/> which is designed to prevent fraud by improving the extentand quality of disclosure in the municipal securities markets. ProposedRule 15c2-12 would require that underwriters of municipal securities offeringsexceeding $10 million obtain and review a nearly final official statementbefore bidding on or purchasing the offering. The rule also would requireunderwriters of municipal offerings exceeding $10 million to contract withthe issuer or its agents to obtain final official statements in sufficientquantities to permit delivery to investors in accordance with any requirementsof the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB'') and, dependingon the time of the request, to make available a single copy of the preliminaryand final official statement to any person on request. In addition, theCommission is publishing an interpretive statement, on which it has invitedcomments, emphasizing the responsibility of municipal underwriters, afterreviewing the issuer's official statement, to have a reasonable basis forbelief in the substantial accuracy of key representations contained inthe official statement, as well as any other recommendations that theymake regarding the offering.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78a-78jj.The Commission recognizes that Rule 15c2-12, if adopted as proposed, wouldimpose new requirements on underwriters and also might have an impact onissuers. In particular, although the rule would place the direct burdenof obtaining final official statements on the underwriter, an obvious consequencewould be that underwriters would require some issuers to make availableofficial statements at a time when, or in quantities in which, they currentlymight not be produced. The rule is intended to stimulate greater scrutinyby underwriters of the representations made by issuers and the circumstancessurrounding the offering. The Commission believes that it is worthwhileto explore the possibility that the imposition of these requirements willresult in benefits both to the municipal securities markets as a wholeand to individual investors.The Commission's decision to propose Rule 15c2-12 at this time reflectsits concern about the current quality of disclosure in certain municipalofferings. At the time the securities laws first were enacted, the marketfor most municipal securities largely was confined to limited geographicregions. The localized nature of the market arguably allowed investorsto be aware of factors affecting the issuer and its securities.\2\<NOTE/> Moreover, municipal securities investors were primarily institutions,which in other instances have been accorded less structured protectionunder the federal securities laws. Since 1933, however, the municipal marketshave become nationwide in scope and now include a broader range of investors.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See Final Report in the Matter of Transactions in the Securities ofthe City of New York. </T3>Submitted to the Senate Committee on Banking,Housing and Urban Affairs, 96th Cong., 1st Sess.

(CCH) andpara;81,936 (``New York City Final Report'' or ``Final Report'').Today, state and local government obligations are a major factor in theUnited States credit markets. Currently, over $720 billion of municipaldebt is held by investors.\3\<NOTE/> Moreover, while new offerings of municipal securities declinedin 1987 compared to previous years, they nevertheless accounted for $114billion.\4\<NOTE/> Households now are significant investors in municipal securities.On average, households, including unit investment trusts, have accountedfor slightly over one-third of the direct holdings of municipal securitiesin recent years. Up to an additional 21% of municipal holdings are ownedindirectly by households, in the form of mutal fund shares.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Source: Flow of Funds Accounts, First Quarter 1987.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Source: Bond Buyer Data Base, <T3>published in </T3>The Bond Buyer, July 15, 1988, at 3.

In the era preceding adoption of the Securities Act of 1933 (``SecuritiesAct'') \6\<NOTE/> municipal offerings consisted largely of general obligationbonds. Today, however, municipal issues include a greater proportion ofrevenue bonds that are not backed by the full faith and credit of a governmentalentity and which, in many cases, may pose greater credit risks to investors.In addition, more innovative forms of financing have focused increasedattention on call provisions and redemption rights in weighing the meritsof individual municipal bond investment opportunities. Among other instruments,municipal issuers have utilized tax-exempt commercial paper, tender optionbonds, and compound interest bonds in an effort to satisfy the needs ofinvestors and assure efficient funding of municipal projects. Moreover,municipal issuers recently have begun to import financing techniques developedin the corporate debt markets to sell asset-backed securities.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ 15 U.S.C. 77a-77aa.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>See generally </T3>Amdursky, <T3>Creative State and Local Financing Techniques, </T3>in <T3>State and Local Government Debt Financing </T3>(Gelfand ed. 1987).In 1975, Congress, recognizing that changes had occurred in the municipalsecurities markets, enacted a self-regulatory scheme for these markets.\8\<NOTE/> The Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 \9\<NOTE/> created the MSRB and provided a system of regulation forboth municipal securities professionals and the municipal securities markets.At the same time, however, a financial crisis experienced by the City ofNew York revealed serious disclosure problems in offerings of New YorkCity's municipal securities. In 1977, the Commission released a lengthystaff report presenting the results of an investigation of the distributionof debt securities issued by New York City.\1\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ S.

Moreover, a number of proposals concerning the needto modify or increase disclosure about the City's problems were rejectedby the underwriters for fear that accurate disclosure would render thesecurities unmarketable.\1\\1\<NOTE/> Even when a decision was made to disclose potential problemsin the face of the worsening budget crisis, some underwriters denied thatthey had any duty to ``rummage around'' to determine whether, in fact,there would be revenues available to retire a contemplated offering ofnotes.\1\\2\<NOTE/> The underwriters reduced the size of their own positionsin the City's debt and ceased purchasing the securities for fiduciary accounts,but they continued to sell them to the public.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ New York City Staff Report at ch. 5, pp. 39-65.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ New York City Staff Report at ch. 5, p. 51.The recently released Commission staff report concerning the WashingtonPublic Power Supply System (``Supply System'') \1\\3\<NOTE/> provides a second illustration of inadequate disclosure inan extremely large municipal debt offering. As discussed more fully therein,in 1983 the Supply System defaulted on $2.25 billion in principal \1\\4\<NOTE/> on tax-exempt revenue bonds sold to finance the constructionof two nuclear power plants. The default on the bonds was the largest paymentdefault in the history of the municipal bond market. The staff's investigationof the default disclosed that the underwriters of the Supply System's offeringsdid not conduct a close examination of the issuer's disclosure to determinethe substantial accuracy of statements made to investors at the time thebonds were sold.\1\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ <T3>Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Report on the Investigationin the Matter of Transactions in Washington Public Supply System Securities</T3>(1988) (Hereinafter, ``Supply System Staff Report''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 1. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 15, 168. The Supply System's offerings took place over the course of four years,from 1977 to 1981. All but one of the 14 offerings by the Supply Systemduring this period were underwritten on a competitive basis.\1\\6\<NOTE/> Only two selling groups, however, successfully bid on theofferings. Despite the magnitude, frequency, and size of the offerings,and the fact that only one or two syndicates were bidding on the offerings,the underwriters did not require their public finance units to conductan investigation,\1\\7\<NOTE/> or retain underwriters' counsel to conduct an investigation,as they would have done customarily in negotiated sales.\1\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ Sales of municipal bonds by issuers to underwriterscan be on either a competitively bid or a negotiated basis. In a competitivelybid sale, the issuer offers the bonds to underwriters in a sealed-bid auction,usually after circulating a preliminary official statement, and underwritingfirms form syndicates to bid on the bonds. The syndicate offering the bestbid, usually the lowest interest cost to the issuer, wins the auction andbuys the bonds for resale into the market. In a negotiated sale, the issuerselects a lead underwriter, which then usually helps prepare the officialstatement and investigates the adequacy of disclosure in the official statement.The lead underwriter also advises on timing, price, and structure for thesale of the bonds. When the issuer agrees to the offering terms, the leadunderwriter, and the syndicate that it has formed, buy the bonds from theissuer and sell them into the market. <T3>See generally </T3>Supply System Staff Report at 166-67. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ Supply System Staff Report at 171. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ Supply System Staff Report at 191-192. The Commission recognizes that the Washington Supreme Court's decision\1\\9\<NOTE/> invalidating contractual agreements between the Supply Systemand a number of public utilities in the Pacific Northwest was the precipitatingfactor in the Supply System's default. The most critical nondisclosuresrelating to matters apart from legal validity occurred after the greatmajority of the offerings had gone forward. Nevertheless, serious questionsexist concerning whether the official statements for the Supply System'sbonds adequately disclosed significant facts. Among other things, factsexisted that call into question the adequacy of disclosures regarding theestimated cost to complete the Supply System's projects, the ability ofthe Supply System to meet its growing financing needs, the projected demandfor power in the Pacific Northwest, and the extent to which the participatingutilities continued to support the Supply System project. The Commissionis concerned that the underwriters did not investigate costs and delaysin the project in a professional manner. Had they done so, it is possiblethat they would have uncovered disclosure deficiencies in the officialstatements for the later offerings, and could have brought to the attentionof the public important information regarding delays in completing thepower plants and cost overruns that might have affected individual investmentdecisions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ <T3>Chemical Bank v.

Need for Improvements Notwithstanding the problems illustrated by the Supply System's disclosure,the Commission recognizes that significant changes have taken place inthe practices associated with the distribution of municipal securitiessince the events that led to the release of the New York City Staff Report.Municipal issuers have increased substantially the quality of disclosurecontained in official statements.\2\\0\<NOTE/> The voluntary guidelines for disclosure established in 1976by the Government Finance Officers Association (``GFOA''),\2\\1\<NOTE/> which are followed by many issuers, permit investors to comparesecurities more readily and greatly assist issuers in addressing theirdisclosure responsibilities.\2\\2\<NOTE/> Moreover, when an issuer voluntarily prepares disclosuredocuments, the MSRB's rules now require that the documents be distributedto investors.\2\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ The New York City Staff Report revealed that therewas little disclousre in the municipal securities market in 1975 and thatinvestors had to rely primarily on the rating agencies. <T3>See </T3>New York City Staff Report at ch. 5, p. 5. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/> \2\\1\ The GFOA was known at the time as the Municipal FinanceOfficers Association, Inc. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ The GFOA's guidelines have been revised since 1976.The latest revision was published earlier this year. <T3>See Disclousre Guidelines for State and Local Government Securities</T3>(January 1988) (``GFOA Guidelines''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ <T3>See </T3>discussion <T3>infra </T3>at notes 51, 52 and accompanying text, regarding MSRB ruleG-32.Other means of enhancing the disclosure provided to investors in the initialdistribution of municipal securities are also under consideration. Twostates, for example, have recently proposed laws requiring that officialstatements accompany or precede delivery of a confirmation for the saleof certain municipal securities, in the same fashion as corporate securities.\2\\4\<NOTE/> In addition, two other states recently have excluded fromthe definition of an exempt security, for state blue sky purposes, thesecurities of municipal issuers that have been in default.\2\\5\<NOTE/> Members of the municipal securities industry and the MSRBalso have recommended the establishment of a central repository for officialstatements that would provide municipal securities dealers and others withrapid access to information, from a single source, concerning the detailsof an offering and the terms of any call provisions.\2\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ <T3>See Minn.

Ann. </T3>andSection;andSection; 44-1843.01and 44-1898 (certain industrial development bonds).

The Commission understandsthat many municipal underwriters currently conduct an investigation ofthe issuer in negotiated municipal offerings that, in many respects, mightbe comparable to the investigation conducted by underwriters in corporateofferings. Nevertheless, the practices revealed in the Supply System StaffReport underscore the need to explore the benefits that would result froma specific regulatory requirement that underwriters of municipal securitiesbe uniformly subject to a requirement to obtain and review a nearly finaldislosure document and make disclosure documents available to investorsin both negotiated and competitive offerings. The Commission understandsthat no amount of increased review of offering materials by municipal underwriterswill prevent municipal defaults totally,\29\<NOTE/> but the Commission believes that responsible review by underwritersof the information provided by municipal issuers, in both competitive andnegotiated offerings, could encourage more accurate disclosure. Investorsplainly depend on accurate disclosure in considering whether to buy theoffered securities. Moreover, it is a common belief, which the Commissionshares, that investors in the municipal markets rely on the reputationof the underwriters participating in an offering in deciding whether toinvest. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ In the past, the Commission has supported the repealof the exemption from registration under the Securities Act for industrialdevelopment bonds (``IDBs'').<T3> See</T3> Letter from John S.R. Shad, Chairman, Securities and ExchangeCommission, to the Honorable Timothy E. Wirth, Chairman, House Subcommitteeon Telecommunications, Consumer Protection, and Finance (March 12, 1988);1978 Industrial Development Bond Act, S. 3323, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978)(legislative proposal presented to Congress by the Commission). IDB financingwas restricted substantially by recent amendments to the federal tax laws,which limit the types of facilities that may be financed, the percentageof proceeds that may be used for private purposes, and the amount of debtservice that may be supported by payments from private persons.<T3> See</T3> Tax Reform Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-514, 100 Stat. 2085(Oct. 22, 1986). Under Rule 131 of the Securities Act, 17 CFR 230.131,taxable IDBs also must be registered if they amount to purely conduit financingfor corporations. Nevertheless, to the limited extent IDB financing continues,the Commission continues that to support previous recommendations thatwould require registration of IDBs that are, in fact, corporate obligations.<T3> See Disclosure in Municipal Securities Markets,</T3> Remarks of DavidS. Ruder, Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission, Before the PublicSecurities Association (Oct. 23, 1987) at 17-18. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ Of the approximately $720 billion in municipal debt outstanding,it is estimated that approximately $5 billion, or roughly 0.7 percent,is currently in default. Source: Bond Investors Association. While theSupply System's $2.25 billion payment default represents the major portionof this amount, over 300 additional municipal issuers are also currentlyin default on their obligations.<T3> Id.</T3> In contrast, corporate issues are estimated to have roughlya 1.1% default rate.<T3> See</T3> Task Force Report,<T3> infra</T3> note 34, at 7. <ITAG tagnum="28">Issuer defaults pose the most serious economic threat to investors.Nevertheless, investors also may suffer losses as a result of downgradesin ratings. In 1987 alone, one nationally recognized statistical ratingorganization, Moody's, lowered the ratings of 322 municipal bond issues.</ITAG><T3> See Municipal Bond Rating Revisions_1987,</T3> Moody's Bond Survey,January 11, 1988, at 1. Moody's report indicated that almost half of theissues downgraded were concentrated in three states closely tied to mineralsectors. During the same period, Standard andamp; Poors reduced ratings of105 issues, amounting to $17 billion.<T3> Credit Watch</T3> (Feb. 1, 1988), at 1. Although there is not a greatdeal of empirical data in this area, downgradings clearly affect the valueof bonds. For example, yields to maturity on 30-year AAA general obligationbonds are 7.60% as compared to 8.30% for the same bonds rated Baa. Thedirect impact of downgrades, however, may depend upon the amount of otherinformation that is available in the markets.<T3> See generally, e.g.,</T3> Ederington, Yawitz andamp; Roberts,<T3> The Information Content of Bond Ratings,</T3> 10 J. Fin. Res. 211(Fall 1987) (discussing the relationship between ratings and yields onindustrial bonds). As noted earlier, the complexity of municipal bonds recently offered tothe public increases the value of accurate disclosure of the terms of bondofferings. For example, inadequate disclosure of call provisions has resultedin several recent incidents in which municipal issuers attempted to callbonds that had been traded in the secondary markets as escrowed-to-maturity.\30\<NOTE/> Because these bonds had been sold to investors in the secondarymarket on the basis of the yields to a fixed maturity, the exercise ofearly call provisions in the outstanding bonds would have altered significantlythe actual yield received by investors.\31\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ Bonds are considered to be escrowed-to-maturity whenthe proceeds of a refunding bond offering are placed in an irrevocableescrow account, or trust, in an amount that will generate sufficient incometo pay principal and interest on the bonds in accordance with specifiedpayment schedules. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ The issuers ultimately abandoned their attempts to callthe bonds. The Commission and its staff, along with the MSRB and otherself-regulatory and industry organizations, have emphasized the need forclear and conspicuous disclosure of call provisions, particularly in refundingbond issues. <T3>See</T3>, <T3>e.g</T3>., letter from Richard G. Ketchum, Director, Division of MarketRegulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, to H. Keith Brunnemer,Jr. Chairman MSRB (June 24, 1988); Securities Exchange Act Release No.23856 (Dec. 3, 1986), 51 FR 44398. Moreover, the Commission understandsthat similar concerns exist with respect to disclosure of exercise periodsfor municipal put option bonds. Apart from concerns about the quality of disclosure, it appears that problemsalso exist with regard to the timely dissemination of disclosure documents.Currently, many issuers routinely prepare official statements that conformto the GFOA Guidelines for offerings exceeding one million dollars. Thepreparation and timely dissemination of official statements, in conjunctionwith a careful review of the issuer's disclosure by the underwriters, areimportant disciplines that benefit the participants as well as investors.The Commission is aware, however, that in some cases underwriters do notreceive sufficient quantities of official statements, or do not receiveofficial statements within time periods that would allow the underwriterto examine the accuracy of the disclosure and to disseminate copies toinvestors in a timely manner. In rule filings with the Commission, forexample, the MSRB has indicated that the completion and delivery of officialstatements often is given a low priority by underwriters and financialadvisors.\32\<NOTE/> In addition, it appears that many public finance personnelare unfamiliar with the requirements of the MSRB regarding the deliveryof official statements.\33\<NOTE/> These information dissemination problems are evidenced bya recent report by the Public Securities Association, prepared after anextensive survey of its members, which concluded:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ <T3>See generally </T3>Securities Exchange Act Releases No. 21457 (Nov.2, 1984), 49 FR 44835; No. 21968 (Apr. 30, 1985), 50 FR 18336; and No.22374 (Aug. 30, 1985), 50 FR 36505 (concerning amendments to MSRB rulesG-9 and G-32). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ <T3>Id</T3>. <T3>See also</T3>, <T3>generally</T3>, Picker, <T3>The Disclosure Debate Gets Nasty</T3>, Institutional Investor (April1988) at 169 (discussing, among other things, problems in disseminatingofficial statements). <ITAG tagnum="21">Based on consistent [* * * responses] * * * there appears to be atiming problem when the availability of disclosure documents are [sic]considered. The empirical evidence confirms what has been widely acceptedby the marketplace as a problem in disclosure practices in the municipalsecurities market.\34\<NOTE/> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ <T3>Public Securities Association Municipal Securities Disclosure TaskForce Report: Initial Analysis of Current Disclosure Practices in the MunicipalSecurities Market </T3>(June 1988) (``Task Force Report'') at 21. The markets for municipal securities are vital to the financial managementof our nation's state and local governments, and the availability of accurateinformation concerning municipal offerings is integral to the efficientoperation of the municipal securities markets.\35\<NOTE/> In the Commission's view, a thorough, professional reviewby underwriters of municipal offering documents could encourage appropriatedisclosure of foreseeable risks and accurate descriptions of complex putand call features, as well as novel financing structures now employed inmany municipal offerings. In addition, with the increase in novel or complexfinancings, there may be greater value in having investors receive disclosuredocuments describing fundamental aspects of their investment. Yet, underwritersare unable to perform this function effectively when offering statementsare not provided to them on a timely basis. Moreover, where sufficientquantities of offering statements are not available, underwriters are hinderedin meeting present delivery obligations imposed on them by the MSRB's rules.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ The current problems with disclosure in municipal securitiestransactions are illustrated further by statistics on arbitration thatare available from the MSRB. In 1987, roughly 84% of all customer complaints,and 49% of inter-dealer complaints, that were arbitrated through the MSRBalleged that inadequate information was provided concerning the securities.<T3>MSRB Arbitration Statistics on Allegations of Misdescriptions and Failuresto Disclose Information about Municipal Securities: 1985-87 </T3>May 18,1988) (unpublished). For these reasons, the Commission has determined to propose a limited ruledesigned to prevent fraud by enhancing the timely access of underwriters,public investors, and other interested persons to municipal official statements.In the context of the assured access to offering statements provided bythe proposed rule, the Commission also is reemphasizing the existence andnature of an underwriter's obligation to have a reasonable basis for itsimplied recommendation of any municipal securities that it underwrites.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Proposed Rule 15c2-12</ITAG>Rule 15c2-12 is designed to prevent fraud by establishing standards forthe procurement and dissemination by underwriters of disclosure documents,thus enhancing the accuracy and timeliness of disclosure to investors inlarge offerings of municipal securities. The rule's standards for obtainingdisclosure documents are intended to assist underwriters in satisfyingtheir responsibility to have a reasonable basis for recommending municipalsecurities that they underwrite. The rule also is designed to provide underwritersgreater opportunity to fulfill their reasonable basis obligations by creatingan express requirement for review of the mandated nearly final officialstatement.The Committion believes that proposed Rule 15c2-12 may promote greaterindustry professionalism and confidence in the municipal markets. In thepast, state and local governments have regarded regulation to enhance themunicipal markets as beneficial, so long as there is no adverse impacton their capital-raising function.\3\\6\<NOTE/> Rule 15c2-12 is designed to strengthen the municipal marketsand to benefit all participants, including issuers. The Commission wishesto emphasize, however, that the rule is not intended to inhibit the accessof issuers to the municipal markets. For this reason, the Commission isparticularly interested in receiving the views of municipal issuers onthe provisions of proposed Rule 15c2-12.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\6\ <T3>See </T3>S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 44 (1975).A. Scope ofRule 15c2-12As proposed, the provisions of Rule 15c2-12 would apply only to underwritersparticipating in offerings of municipal securities that exceed $10 millionin face amount.\3\\7\<NOTE/> Data supplied by the Public Securities Association and theMSRB indicate that in 1987, 1,743 long-term municipal debt offerings, accountingfor about 25% of total long-term municipal debt offerings, exceeded $10million. These offerings, however, raised over $89 billion, or approximately86% of the money borrowed annually by municipal issuers. Thus, the rulewould apply only to the largest issues of municipal securities, where thereis greatest reason to believe that additional costs the rule might imposeby the establishment of specific standards would be justified by the potentialprotection provided to a large number of investors that otherwise mightpurchase securities on the basis of inaccurate or incomplete information.\3\\8\<NOTE/> By conditioning underwriters' participation in large offeringson the preparation and dissemination of official statements, the rule wouldprovide dealers and investors with more timely access to disclosure ofbasic information about the issuer.\3\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\7\ While the Commission has set an objective thresholdfor the application of Rule 15c2-12, offerings under that amount wouldcontinue to be subject to the general antifraud provisions of the ExchangeAct and the Securities Act, <T3>e.g., </T3>sections 10(b) and 15(c) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.78j(b) and 78<T3>o</T3>(c), and the rules thereunder, and section 17(a) of the SecuritiesAct, 15 U.S.C. 77q(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\8\ Although Rule 15c2-12, as proposed, would apply toofferings exceeding $10 million, the Commission is aware that many defaultsare likely to occur in offerings below the $10 million threshold.

Specifically,would some other minimum, such as $1 million, $5 million, $20 million,or $50 million, be warranted for the rule as a whole or for particularprovisions? As noted earlier, in 1987, 25% of all new issues of long-termmunicipal bonds, comprising 38% of all revenue bond issues and 12% of allgeneral obligation bond issues, exceeded the $10 million threshold. Theseofferings accounted for 90% and 74% of the dollar amounts issued in revenueand general obligation bound offerings, respectively. The figures for alternativethresholds, as of 1987, were as follows: \4\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\0\ IDD/PSA Municipal Database, including all municipalissues with a final maturity exceeding 13 months.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>7,L2,tp0,i1,s100,15,15,15,15,15,15</C> <H1>Offering over </H1><H1>Percent of revenue bond issues </H1><H1>Percent of gen. oblig. bond issues </H1><H1>Percent of total bond issues </H1><H1>Percent of revenue bond dollar amts. issued </H1><H1>Percent of gen. oblig. bond dollar amts. issued </H1><H1>Percent of total bond dollar amts. issued</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">$1 million<D>87</D><D>72</D><D>79</D><D>99</D><D>99</D><D>99</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5 million<D>56</D><D>26</D><D>44</D><D>96</D><D>85</D><D>93</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10 million<D>38</D><D>12</D><D>25</D><D>90</D><D>74</D><D>86</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">20 million<D>25</D><D>7</D><D>16</D><D>81</D><D>67</D><D>77</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">50 million<D>10</D><D>3</D><D>7</D><D>60</D><D>53</D><D>58</D></ITAG></ITAG> The Commission requests comment on the range of costs under the rule forissuers and underwriters in offerings above and below the $10 million threshold,and the impact that Rule 15c2-12 might have on underwriting spreads inthe municipal market. Commentators also are invited to provide their viewson the quality and timeliness of discolosure currently provided at variousoffering amounts.  The Commission recognizes that there may be a range of credit risk anddisclosure concerns associated with municipal bonds that vary accordingto the type of bonds and their maturity. Accordingly, the views of commentatorsare requested regarding whether distinctions should be made according tothe type of bonds, <T3>e.g.,</T3> municipal revenue, general obligation, or private activitybonds,\4\\1\<NOTE/> the type of offering (<T3>e.g.,</T3> competitive or Negotiated), or the extent to which innovativefinancing techniques, or unusual call provisions or redemption rights,are employed in the offering. Similarly, commentators also may addresswhether distinctions should be made that would exclude issues with shortermaturities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\1\ As a general matter, there is less evidence of problemsof default on general obligation bonds than municipal revenue bonds. Similarly,from 1972 to 1983, there were only 10 reported note defaults, some of whichinvolved obligations owed only to local banks. <T3>See generally</T3> Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations,<T3>Bankruptcies, Defaults, and Other Local Government Financial Emergencies</T3>(March 1985) at 24-25. Although general obligation bonds as a rule havenot presented default concerns, some distinction must be made with regardto the general obligation debt of small, special-purpose districts. From1972-1984, eleven special purpose districts declared bankruptcy. <T3>Id.</T3> at 9. Some of these districts were the subject of Commissionenforcement actions. <T3>See SEC v. Reclamation District No. 2090,</T3> Case No. C-76-1231 (N.D.Cal. Aug. 27, 1978), SEC Litigation Releases No. 7551 (Sept. 8, 1976) andNo. 7460 (June 22, 1976); <T3>SEC v. San Antonio Municipal Utility District No. 1,</T3> Civ. ActionNo. H-77-1868 (S.D. Tex. 1977), SEC Litigation Release No. 8195 (Nov. 18,1977). In any event, the New York City problems did involve general obligationbonds in very large amounts. See <T3>supra</T3> notes 10 through 12 and accompanying text.The primary intent of the rule is to focus on those offerings that involvethe general public, and which are likely to be traded in the secondarymarket. While the Commission recognizes that there may be reason to createan exception from the rule for offerings that are similar to traditionalprivate placements under section 4(2) of the Securities Act,\4\\2\<NOTE/> involving a limited number of financial institutions, theproposed rule does not contain such an exception.\4\\3\<NOTE/> In part, this reflect the Commission's concern that, in theabsence of trading restrictions, the bonds could be resold immediatelyto numerous secondary market purchasers lacking the sophistication of theintitial purchasers of the bonds.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\2\ 15 U.S.C. 77d(2).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\3\ In this regard, proposed Rule 15c2-12 is consistentwith the current requirements under MSRB rule G-32. Specifically, the MSRBhas taken the position that G-32 applies to both public and private offerings.<T3>Disclosure Requirements for New Issue Securities: Rule G-32, </T3>MSRBReports, Sept. 1986, at 17.In order to consider whether any rule that is adopted should contain sometype of ``private placement exemption,'' the Commission requests commenton this acpect of the rule. In particular, the Commission would like specificcomments on whether and in what manner the rule's disclosure disseminationprovisions should distinguish between offerings made to a limited numberof sophisticated investors and those involving broader selling efforts.Comment is requested on whether a specific exemption from the rule shouldbe created for offerings to fewer tham 10, 25, 35, or 50 investors andwhether an exemption should look to the institutional nature or sophisticationof investors. In addition, should the underwriter be required to assurethat initial purchasers acquire the bonds with investment intent, ratherthan to resell the securities into the secondary market, or should otherrestrictions, such as holding periods or transfer restrictions, be imposed?Finally, the Commission solicits comment on whether exceptions for limitedofferings should be applied to all provisions of the rule or only to particularparts of the rule.B. Receipt and Review of Preliminary Official StatementsParagraph (b) of the rule would require that prior to bidding on or purchasinga municipal offering in excess of ten million dollars, an underwriter,directly or through agents, obtain and rview an official statement thatis final, but for the omission of information relating to offering price,interest rate, selling compensation, amount of proceeds, delivery dates,other terms of the securities depending on such factors, and the name ofthe underwriter.\4\\4\<NOTE/> This provision would apply to both competitive and negotiatedofferings. It is designed to assure that underwriters receive and availthemselves of the opportunity to review an official statement that containscomplete disclosure about the issuer and the basic structure of the financing,before becoming obligated to purchase a large issue of municipal securitiesfor resale to the public.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\4\ <T3>Cf. </T3>Securities Act Rule 430A, 17 CFR 230.430A (form of prospectusfiled as part of registration statement declared effective may omit informationwith respect to public offering price, underwriting syndicates, underwritingdiscounts or commissions, discounts or commissions to dealers, amount ofproceeds, coversion dates, call prices and other items dependent on offeringprice, delivery dates, and terms of securities dependent on offering price).Although paragraph (b) would require that underwriters receive officalstatements that are nearly complete prior to bidding for or purchasingan offering, this would not prevent an underwriter from requesting evensubstantial changes to the document where necessary to assure completeand accurate disclosure.Many issuers currently are required by state and local law to solicit bidsfor offerings of muncipal debt. Generally, announcements inviting bidsare published in newspapers that are widely followed in the industry. Inaddition, underwriters may be contacted directly by issuers are invitedto submit bids. The actual notice of sale itself often will contain signfiicantinformation about the issuer and its securities. Moreover, as part of thebidding process, many issuers routinely make available more complete disclosureconcerning an offering in the form of a preliminary official statement,which generally includes information concerning the issuer and the offeredsecurities, but omits terms of the offering dependent on the results ofthe bid. In some cases, the issuer, subsequent to the bidding process,prepares a final official statement containing all the terms of the offering.In other cases, the issuer releases a preliminary official statement priorot the date of sale, which , after pricing, underwriting, and other informationis attached, is then regarded as the issuer's final official statement.The Commission is aware, however, that some issuers do not provide preliminaryofficial statements, so that prospective bidders must rely upon informationcontained solely in the notice of sale and on their general knowledge ofthe issuer.\45\<NOTE/> Based upon this limited information, underwriters then solicitbinding pre-sale orders or indications of interest from investors, andsubmit a bid to the issuer. In addition, although negotiated offeringsprovide the underwriter with greater opportunities to participate in draftingthe disclosure documents, in some instances pressure to meet financingneeds, or to take advantage of changes in tax laws or favorable interestrate ``windows,'' have caused underwriters to agree to purchase securitiesin negotiated offerings at a time when disclosure documents were not complete.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ A recent survey indicated that official statements wereprepared for 84% of municipal bond issues, including both competitive andnegotiated offerings. Task Force Report, <T3>supra</T3> note 34, at 14.Paragraph (b) would prevent the underwriter from submitting a bid in acompetitive offering, or from committing to buy securities in a negotiatedoffering, until it has received and reviewed an official statement thatis deemed final by the issuer, except for pricing, underwriting, and certainother specified information. This paragraph is designed to prevent fraudby providing the underwriter with information about the issue sufficientto determine, before becoming obligated to purchase the securities, whetherchanges to the disclosed information are needed and should be obtainedbefore the bid is submitted.\46\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ <T3>See</T3> also discussion <T3>infra</T3> in Part III.The requirement in paragraph (b) that underwriters obtain a nearly finalofficial statement before bidding on an offering could have the consequenceof altering the bidding or offering process employed by some issuers, ifthe issuer does not currently make available, prior to the bid or sale,a preliminary official statement as complete as required in the proposedrule. Accordingly, the Commission requests comment on the extent to whichadequate information currently is available to underwriters during thenegotiation or bidding process, and whether possible improvements in theavailability of information would outweigh the increased costs that couldresult form the rule. The Commission also requests comment regarding anytiming difficulties and consequent economic burdens that might arise forissuers and underwriters as a result of the requirement that underwritersreview the nearly final official statement prior to bidding on or purchasingthe municipal securities.C. Public Dissemination of Preliminary Official Statements upon RequestProposed paragraph (c) would require that preliminary official statementsbe sent to any person promptly upon request.\47\<NOTE/> The purpose of paragraph (c) is to provide potential investors\48\<NOTE/> with access to any preliminary official statement preparedby the issuer for dissemination to potential bidders or purchasers at atime when it may be of use to investors in thier investment decision. Becausepreliminary official statements frequently are used as selling documents,large investors often are provided copies when they are solicited to purchasesecurities in a municipal offering. Indeed, the Commission understandsthat some institutional investors will not agree to purchase securitiesin an offering without receiving a preliminary official statement. Evenso, there does not appear to be a uniform practice among underwriters ofproviding preliminary official statements to all potential investors. Becausesales efforts may be conducted in competitive offerings prior to the timethat an underwriter is awarded a bid, and investors may not have accessto a final disclosure document for an extended period of time followingtheir commitment to purchase the securities, the Commission believes thatconfusion concerning the offering terms and the potential for misleadingsales representations would be reduced if investors had the ability toobtain information contained in the preliminary official statement.\49\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ Absent unusual circumstances, this would require thata preliminary official statement be sent by first class mail or other equallyprompt means, no later than the close of the next business day followingthe receipt of the request. Requests could be made orally or in writing.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ Although this requirement is intended primarily to benefitpotential investors, the rule requires the preliminary official statementto be given to any person on request to eliminate underwriters' discretionin determining who in fact is a potential investor. Comment is requestedon the facility with which analysts and other industry professionals currentlycan obtain copies of preliminary official statements directly from theissuer; whether the underwriters' obligation to provide these statementsshould be limited to potential investors; and how potential investors shouldbe defined.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ Of course, where key representations made in the preliminaryofficial statement are known to the underwriter to be no longer accurate,the underwriter would have to notify investors prior to the time that theymake an investment decision and would have to provide copies of the amendedfinal official statement.Comments are requested regarding the extent to which preliminary officialstatements are disseminated to investors presently, the likely demand byinvestors for these preliminary official statements under the proposedrule, and the estimated additional costs to underwriters that compliancewith the rule would entail. In addition, the Commission requests commenton whether underwriters that provide preliminary official statements toinvestors on request should be excused from the requirement that finalofficial statements also be provided to those investors, where the keyrepresentations contained in the preliminary official statement continueto be accurate.D. Distribution of Official StatementsParagraph (d) of proposed Rule 15c2-12 would require that underwriterscontract with the issuer or its agent to obtain copies of final officialstatements within two business days after a final agreement to purchasethe offered securities. That contract must be for sufficient copies todistribute in accordance with paragraph (e) of the proposed rule and anyrules adopted by the MSRB. The purpose of paragraph (d) is to facilitatethe prompt distribution of disclosure documents so that investors willhave a reference document to guard against misrepresentations that mayoccur in the selling process. In addition, this paragrpah would provideinvestors and dealers in the secondary market with static information concerningthe terms of the issued securities.Rule G-17 of the MSRB's rules requires municipal securities brokers anddelers to deal fairly with customers. The MSRB interprets this rule torequire that a dealer disclose, at or prior to a sale, all material factsconcerning the transaction, including a complete descripton of the security.\50\<NOTE/> Moreover, MSRB rule G-32 requires that underwriters deliverto a customer, no later than settlement, a copy of any official statementthat is prepared by or on behalf of the issuer. If no official statementis prepared by the issuer, a written notice of that fact must be providedto the customer. The Tower Amendment \51\<NOTE/> limits the authority of the MSRB, however, directly or indirectlyto require municipal issuers to furnish disclosure documents. Thus, ruleG-32 applies only where an official statement is prepared and does notmandate disclosure of any particular information to the investor in theofficial statement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ <T3>See, e.g., MSRB Manual </T3>(CCH) andpara; 3581.30.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ Exchange Act Section 15B(d), 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>-4(d)(2). <T3>See </T3>discussion <T3>infra </T3>at text accompanying notes 64 to 69.The Commission understands that it is currently the practice for issuersto state, in notices of sale, the number of official statements that willbe provided to a successful bidder or that a ``reasonable'' number of officialstatements will be provided. If any official statements are prepared bythe issuer, the MSRB has taken the position that the underwriter is requiredto produce sufficient copies to comply with rule G-32.\52\<NOTE/> In most cases, issuers do prepare official statements. Bothunderwriters and investors have complained, however, that even when officialstatements are prepared by the issuer, there frequently is not an adequatesupply, or sufficient time, to permit distribution to each investor atsettlement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ The MSRB has stated that ``if an issuer fails to supplya sufficient number of copies of official statements, it is incumbent ona dealer to reproduce the official statment at its own expense. These requirementsapply to all municipal securities brokers and dealers who sell new issuesecurities, not solely to the underwriters of the issue.'' <T3>Rules G-8, G-9, and G-32, </T3>MSRB Reports, (Mar. 1984) at 3.Paragraph (d) of Rule 15c2-12 would require that an underwriter obtainan undertaking from the issuer or its designated agent to provide, withintwo business days after any final agreement to purchase or sell securities,final official statements in sufficient quantities to enable the underwriterto comply with paragraph (e) of the rule and any MSRB rules regarding thedistribution of official statements. Thus, prior to submitting a bid foran offering, or otherwise agreeing to participate in a distribution, anunderwriter, or the syndicate of which it is a member, would need to ascertainthat it will be able to comply with Rule 15c2-12. If the issuer's noticeof sale, bid form, or underwriting agreement does not provide specificallyfor production of official statements in accordance with Rule 15c2-12,an underwriter would violate the rule if it participates in the offering.\53\<NOTE/> As a practical matter, therefore, issuers would not be ableto go forward with underwritten offerings exceeding the proposed $10 millionthreshold, unless arrangements were made to provide official statements.As discussed below, however, the Commission does not believe that thisrequirement will affect most issuers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ Syndicate members also would need to assure themselvesthat their agreement with syndicate managers will provide for the promptdistribution of offical statements.The proposed rule requires that adequate copies of the official statementswould need to be provided within two business days after final agreementis reached. Nevertheless, the issuer's undertaking may call for provisionof the official statement to be made by designated agents. Thus, an undertakingwould comply with Rule 15c2-12 by indicating that sufficient quantitiesof official statements will be made available from a printer designatedby the issuer, or will be reproduced by the syndicate manager from thoseoffical statements that it receives from the issuer. Also, the rule wouldallow a reasonable fee to be requested by the printer, issuer, or syndicatemembers or investors.As emphasized earlier, if the rule is adopted, underwriters would violatethe requirements of Rule 15c2-12 if they proceed with an offering in excessof $10 million without taking steps to assure the availability of officialstatements. Many issuers already routinely prepare official statementsfor offerings exceeding one billion dollars.\54\<NOTE/> Thus, while the proposed rule will enhance disclosure toinvestors, it is not expected that the rule would inhibit the access ofany issuers to the municipal markets. The only effect on most municipalissuers offering securities that exceed the proposed minimum thresholdsin the rule would be that official statements would be required to be producedin a more expeditious fashion, and perhaps in greater quantities, thancurrently might be the case.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ <T3>See, e.g, </T3>Forbes andamp; McGrath, <T3>Disclosure Practices in Tax-Exempt General Obligation Bonds: An Update,</T3>7 Mun. Fin. J. 207 (1986).The Commission preliminarily believes that the costs imposed on issuersthat are not now producing official statements for offerings in excessof $10 million will be offset by the benefits that will inure both to themarkets as a whole and to individual investors. The Commission requestscomment on any practical problems that might be encountered by underwritersor issuers in attempting to comply with the requirements of the rule. Inparticular, does the two business day requirement pose a significant burdenon issuers or underwriters? Should the delivery period be expanded to threeor four business days, or reduced to a single business day, or to the timethat final agreement is reached?The Commission would like to receive comments concerning the net coststhat might be incurred by underwriters or issuers in reproducing officialstatements if Rule 15c2-12 is adopted. In the past, the Commission hasreceived comments on proposed amendments to rule G-32 that estimated theexpense of producing an official statement at from three to ten dollarsper copy.\5\\5\<NOTE/> The Commission specifically requests comment on current proceduresused in estimating the number of official statements to be produced; theestimated marginal costs of producing official statements in order to complywith proposed Rule 15c2-12; and whether, and at what price, those costsmay effectively be passed on to recipients of official statements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\5\ <T3>See supra </T3>note 32. Specific comment is requested on the per copycost of official statements for offerings at the various suggested thresholdsfor the rule, <T3>i.e., </T3>$1 million, $10 million, $20 million, and $50 million. <T3>See </T3>discussion <T3>supra </T3>at text accompanying note 40.The Commission believes that paragraph (d) will allow the MSRB to use itsexpertise and familiarity with the municipal markets to draft regulationsmore finely tuned to the needs of the market. The Commission expects that,in the event that Rule 15c2-12 is adopted in its proposed form, the MSRBwould amend rule G-32, where appropriate, to modify the standards governingthe timeliness of official statement delivery. In this regard, the Commissionalso requests comment on whether it should regulate directly the timingand manner of disclosure provided to municipal securities investors.E. Public Dissemination of Official Statements upon RequestParagraph (e) of proposed Rule 15c2-12 would require that underwritersprovide a copy of the final official statement to any person on request.\5\\6\<NOTE/> The purpose of this provision is to make the underwriterresponsible for transmission of information to analysts, rating agencies,industry news services, and individuals who wish to analyze particularmunicipal securities offerings. In this regard, the Commission believesthat increased availability of official statements, to potential investors,analysts, and other persons willing to pay a reasonable fee for accessto the information contained in the final official statement, will promotemore accurate pricing in the secondary market and may facilitate the discoveryof potentially fraudulent practices. Thus, in addition to making finalofficial statements available to actual investors, paragraph (e) wouldrequire that other interested parties be provided with copies as well.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\6\ The proposed rule requires that the offering statementbe provided in a timely manner. For the first month following an offering,absent extraordinary circumstances, this would mean that a copy would bemailed within two business days of the request. Requests could be madeorally or in writing. Later, reasonable time would be allowed to locateand duplicate requested documents.No specific time limitation currently is specified in proposed Rule 15c2-12.Comment is solicited on whether and under what circumstances a time periodshould be established, after which the obligation to provide informationwould no longer be applicable.\5\\7\<NOTE/> For example, if a central repository is developed, shouldthis obligation expire after the repository receives and is in a positionto disseminate the final official statement? The Commission also requestscomment on whether a purchaser's ability under paragraph (e) of the ruleto obtain an official statement on request for an unlimited time periodreduces the need for the requirement imposed on the underwriters by MSRBrule G-32 to supply a final official statement to all purchasers. Finally,the Commission would like to receive comments on the potential costs tounderwriters of complying with proposed paragraph (e). Specifically, whatcosts would be entailed in maintaining and disseminating copies of officialstatements required to be provided under paragraph (e)? Also, would itbe possible, and at what price, for costs to be passed through effectivelyto recipients of the official statements?<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\7\ The Commission recognizes that after a period of time,the disclosures contained in the official statement regarding an issuerno longer may be accurate. Accordingly, where the underwriter receivesunsolicited requests for official statements, the Commission would notexpect the underwriter to continue to update the disclosure to reflectinaccuracies that have resulted from intervening events. In respondingto unsolicited requests, underwriters should indicate that the documentcontains dated information. The Commission requests comment on this aspectof the rule and any concerns that underwriters may have.F. DefinitionsIn addition to containing substantive requirements, proposed Rule 15c2-12contains two defintions. Subparagraph (f)(1) of Rule 15c2-12 would definethe term ``final official statement'' to mean a document prepared by theissuer or its representatives setting forth, among other matters, informationconcerning the issuer and the proposed issue of securities that is completeas of the final agreement to purchase or sell municipal securities foror on behalf of an issuer or underwriter. A notice of sale would not bedeemed a final official statement for purposes of the rule. The definitioncontained in subparagraph (f)(1) is based on the definition of officialstatement in MSRB rule G-32. By using a similar definition, the Commissionis seeking to avoid any conflicts that may occur, because paragraph (d)would require that underwriters distribute copies of final official statementsin accordance with MSRB regulations. The Commission requests comment onthe proposed definition of ``final official statement.''The Commission also requests comment on the definition of an ``underwriter''used in subparagraph (f)(2) of the proposed rule. As proposed, the definitionof an underwriter parallels the definition in section 2(11) of the SecuritiesAct.\5\\8\<NOTE/> To ensure dissemination of documents by all professionalparticipants in the offering, the definition includes managing underwriters,syndicate members, and selling group members that receive in excess ofthe usual seller's commission. Comment is requested on the proposed definitionof ``underwriter'' and any foreseeable problems that dealers may encounterin complying with the rule. Comment also is requested concerning whetherthe definition of underwriter should be limited to the underwriters participatingin the syndicate, as in the definition of ``principal underwriter'' inRule 405 under the Securities Act.\5\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\8\ 15 U.S.C. 77b(11). The definition of underwriter insection 2(11) of the Securities Act has been modified in one respect. Referenceto a concession or allowance has been added to the definition to reflectthe terms used in the municipal securities industry for a customary distributor'sor seller's commission. The terms ``concession'' and ``dealer's allowance,''in the context of the sale of a new issue of municipal securities, referto ``the amount of reduction from the public offering price a syndicategrants to a dealer not a member of the syndicate, expressed as a percentageof par value.'' <T3>See Glossary of Municipal Securities Terms </T3>(MSRB 1985).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\9\ 17 CFR 230.405.G. Legislative BackgroundIn contrast to the registration and reporting requirements imposed on non-exemptcorporate issuers under the federal securities laws, offerings of municipalsecurities are not subject to review by the Commission. When Congress adoptedthe federal securities laws, in addition to being influenced by the localnature of markets, the absence of demonstrated abuses, and the sophisticationof investors in municipal securities, it was persuaded that direct regulationof the process by which municipal issuers and municipalities raise fundsto finance governmental activities would place the Commission in the positionof a gate-keeper to the financial markets, a position inconsistent withintergovernmental comity. Nevertheless, Congress clearly made sales ofmunicipal securities subject to the antifraud provisions of the federalsecurities laws.\60\<NOTE/> Accordingly, broker-dealers misstating or omitting to disclosematerial facts about municipal securities or charging excessive mark-upshave been sanctioned for violating the antifraud provisions of the federalsecurities laws.\61\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\ <T3>See, e.g., In re New york Municipal Securities Litigation, </T3>507F.

Supp. 416 (S.D.N.Y. 1955) (Sections17(a) of the Securities Act and 10(b) of the Exchange Act apply to salesof municipal securities). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ See discussion <T3>infra </T3>at Part III. The U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the scope of the Tenth Amendmenthas evolved significantly since the federal securities laws were firstenacted in the 1930's. Most recently, in <T3>South Carolina v. Baker,\62\</T3><NOTE/> the Court affirmed the principle that the Tenth Amendment'slimits on Congressional authority to regulate state activities are structuraland not substantive. In doing so, it ruled that a provision of the InternalRevenue Code that required the registration of municipal bonds in orderto maintain their tax exempt status was constitutional, since the municipalissuers had redress through the political process. Thus, a federal regulationaffecting the manner in which securities are offered, adopted pursuantto Congressionally delegated authority, would not appear to violate theTenth Amendment.\63\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\ _ U.S. _, 56 U.S.L.W. 4311 (April 20, 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\63\ <T3>See also Garcia v.

Inadopting the 1975 Amendments,\64\<NOTE/> Congress struck a balance between the need to protect investorsand concerns about intergovernmental comity. This concern was reflectedin section 15B(d)(1), which prohibits the Commission and the MSRB fromrequiring ``any issuer of municipal securities, directly or indirectlythrough a purchaser or prospective purchaser of securities from the issuer,to file with the Commission or the Board prior to the sale of such securitiesby the issuer any application, report, or document in connection with theissuance, sale, or distribution of such securities.'' \65\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\64\ <T3>See supra </T3>note 8.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\65\ 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>-4(d)(1). At the same time, however, Congress more narrowly defined the authorityof the MSRB. The so-called ``Tower Amendment,'' which added section 15B(d)(2)to the Exchange Act,\66\<NOTE/> also prohibits the MSRB from requiring municipal issuers,directly or indirectly, through municipal securities broker-dealers orotherwise, to furnish the MSRB or prospective investors with any documents,including official statements. The MSRB specifically is permitted, however,to require that official statements or other documents that are availablefrom sources other than the issuer, such as the underwriter, be providedto investors. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\66\ 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>-4(d)(2). While Congress limited the power of the MSRB to require that disclosuredocuments be provided to investors, it was careful to preserve and expandthe authority of the Commission under section 15(c)(2) of the ExchangeAct.\67\<NOTE/> Section 15B(d)(2) expressly indicates that ``[n]othing inthis paragraph shall be construed to impair or limit the power of the Commissionunder any provision of this title.'' \68\<NOTE/> Thus, although section 15B(d)(1) prevents the Commissionfrom requiring that municipal issuers file reports or documents prior tothe issuance of securities in the same fashion as corporate securities,Congress expanded the Commission's authority to adopt rules reasonablydesigned to prevent fraud, so long as the rules did not require documentsto be filed with the Commission.\69\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that Rule 15c2-12 is consistent withits Congressional mandate to adopt rules reasonably designed to preventfraud in the federal securities markets.\70\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\67\ 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>(c)(2). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\68\ 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>-4(d)(2). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\69\ Section 15(c)(2) of the Exchange Act empowers the Commissionwith broad authority to adopt rules reasonably designed to prevent fraudulant,deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices.

Municipal Underwriter Responsibilities </ITAG>In connection with Rule 15c2-12's requirements to obtain and review a near-finalofficial statement, the Commission wishes to emphasize the obligation ofa municipal underwriter to have a reasonable basis for recommending anymunicipal securities and its responsibility, in fulfilling that obligation,to review in a professional manner the accuracy of the offering statementswith which it is associated. An underwriter, whether of municipal or other securities, occupies a vitalposition in an offering. The underwriter stands between the issuer andthe public purchasers, assisting the issuer in pricing and, at times, instructuring the financing and preparing disclosure documents. Most importantly,its role is to place the offered securities with public investors. By participatingin an offering, an underwriter makes an implied recommendation about thesecurities. Because the underwriter holds itself out as a securities professional,and especially in light of its position vis-a-vis the issuer, this recommendationitself implies that the underwriter has a reasonable basis for belief inthe truthfulness and completeness of the key representations made in anydisclosure documents used in the offerings. Under the general antifraud provisions found in section 17(a) of the SecuritiesAct and sections 10(b) and 15(c) (1) and (2) of the Exchange Act,\71\<NOTE/> the courts and the Commission long have emphasized that abroker-dealer recommending securities to investors implies by its recommendationthat it has an adequate basis for the recommendation.\72\<NOTE/> For example, in <T3>Hanly v. SEC, </T3>affirming the Commission's sanctions against securitiessalesmen who recommended the stock of a financially troubled issuer bothby making false and misleading representations and by failing to discloseknow or reasonably obtainable adverse information, the court stated: <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\ 15 U.S.C. 77q(a) and 15 U.S.C. 78j(b), 78<T3>o</T3>(c)(1), and 78<T3>o</T3>(c)(2), respectively. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\72\ <T3>See, e.q., Feeney v.

This obligation to have a reasonable basis for belief in the accuracy ofstatements directly made concerning the offering is underscored when abroker-dealer underwrites securities.\74\<NOTE/> A municipal underwriter's obligation extends to having areasonable basis for belief in the truth of key representations in an officalstatement prepared by the issuer. An underwriter's failure to have a reasonablebasis for believing key representations in offering documents has resultedin private damage actions under the general antifraud provisions and inenforcement action by the Commission under section 17(a) of the SecuritiesAct. For example, in <T3>Hamilton Grant andamp; Co., </T3>the Commission found that an underwriterhad violated sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act where theunderwriter had ``failed to make any substantial effort to obtain specificverification of management's key representations'' and thus had ``no basisfor a reasonable belief in the truthfulness of the key representationsmade in the registration statement and prospectus.''\75\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\74\ The opportunity for the underwriters to require disclosurefrom the issuer, as well as the special selling pressures involved in thedistribution of securities, generally have given rise to a heightened obligationon the part of underwriters.

The underwriterdid not have a formal underwriting agreement with the issuer and was notsubject to liability under section 11 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C.77k. Nevertheless, the court noted that: <ITAG tagnum="28">[a]n underwriters relationship with the issuer gives the underwriteraccess to facts that are not equally available to members of the publicwho must rely on published information. And the relationship between theunderwriter and its customers implicitly involves a favorable recommendationof the issued security. Because the public relies on the integrity, independenceand expertise of the underwriter, the underwriter's participation significantlyenhances the marketability of the security. And since the underwriter isunquestionably aware of the nature of the public's reliance on his participationin the sale of the issue, the mere fact that he has underwritten it isan implied representation that he has met the standards of his professionin his investigation of the issuer. 524 F.2d at 1069-70. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\75\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24679 (July 7, 1987),38 SEC Docket 1346, 1353.

Rule G-17 of the MSRB's rules requires municipalsecurities brokers and dealers to deal fairly with investors and prohibitsthem from engaging in any deceptive, dishonest, or unfair practice. TheMSRB has interpreted this rule to require that a dealer disclose all materialfacts known by the dealer to a customer at the time of the transaction.<T3>See supra </T3>note 50.

Such letters generally provide a descriptionof the investigation undertaken by the counsel on behalf of the underwriterwhich serves as a basis for those assurances. Although general practice among municipal underwriters appears to recognizea responsibility to assess the accuracy of disclosure documents used innegotiated offerings, the Commission is not convinced that this practiceis recognized universally or followed in all negotiated municipal offerings.Moreover, with respect to competitively bid municipal underwritings, someunderwriters mistakenly consider themselves to have virtually no responsibilityregarding the accuracy of the offering disclosure document. As the Commissionnoted in the New York City Final Report, there appears to be no clear understandingof an underwriter's responsibility to assure the accuracy of the informationdisclosed.\81\<NOTE/> The Supply System Staff Report also suggests that underwriters,even in nominally competitive bid offerings, view their responsibilitiesregarding the accuracy of the official statement as extremely limited.\82\<NOTE/> The underwriters of the Supply System's bonds acknowledgedno legal responsibility to read the official statements with a view togauging their accuracy, much less to conduct a review to establish a basisfor a reasonable belief in the accuracy of the key representations madein the offering statement.\83\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\81\ New York City Final Report, <T3>supra </T3>note 2.

The underwriters have generaly stated, however,that circumstances severely restrict their ability to conduct any ``duediligence'' inquiry in any competitive bid offering and that, in thesecircumstances, the inquiry may consist of nothing more than a perusal ofthe official statement or other information provided in connection withthe offering or contained in their files. In contrast, the underwritersgenerally state that in any negotiated offering they do perform a ``duediligence'' inquiry in some ways similar to that conducted in under-writingcorporate issues. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\82\ Supply System Staff Report at 168-169. <T3>See also </T3>discussion <T3>supra</T3> at text accompanying notes 13 to 19. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\83\ Unlike many competitively bid offerings, only two syndicatessuccessfully bid on the Supply System's 14 offerings. Moreover, there appearedto be little uncertainty about which syndicate would be awarded a particularoffering. In light of the above, the Commission believes that further articulationof a municipal underwriter's obligations to the investing public in bothnegotiated and competitively bid offerings is appropriate at this timeto encourage meaningful review of issue disclosure.84<NOTE/> In the Commission's view, the reasonableness of a beliefin the accuracy and completeness of the key representations in the finalofficial statement, and the extent of a review of the issuer's situationnecessary to arrive at this belief, will depend upon all the circumstances.In both negotiated and competitively bid municipal offerings, the Commissionexpects, at a minimum, that underwriters will review the issuer's diclosuredocuments in a professional manner for possible inaccuracies and omissions.85<NOTE/> Beyond this baseline review, the Commission believes thata number of factors generally will be relevant in determining the reasonablenessof a municipal underwriter's basis for assessing the truthfulness of thekey representations in final official statements. These factors would include:The extent to which the underwriter relied upon municipal officials, employees,experts, and other persons whose duties have given them knowledge of particularfacts; 86<NOTE/> the type of underwriting arrangement (<T3>e.g., </T3>firm commitment or best efforts); the role of the underwriter(manager, syndicate member, or selected dealer) 87<NOTE/>; the type of bonds being offered (general obligation, revenue,or private activity); the past familiarity of the underwriter with theissuer; the length of time to maturity of the bonds; the presence or absenceof credit enhancements; and whether the bonds are competitively bid orare distributed in a negotiated offering.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>84 As discussed above, these obligations arise out of thegeneral antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, particularlysection 17 of the Securities Act and sections 10(b) and 15(c)(1) and (2)of the Exchange Act, and the rules thereunder. The factors set forth belowdo not change the applicable legal standards, <T3>e.g., </T3>scienter or negligence, and conduct in a specific case mustbe measured against these standards. Nor do they attempt to establish objectivestandards of recklessness for purposes of any scienter requirement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>85 Proposed Ruel 15c2-12 expressly would require that municpalunderwriters review preliminary official statements in offerings of over$10 million.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>86 The Commission wishes to caution underwriters that thisfactor does not imply that an underwriter may merely rely upon formal representationsby the issuer, its officials, or employees regarding the general accuracyof disclosure contained in the official statement. The underwriter mustreview the information submitted to it with a view to resolving inaccuraciesand inconsistencies. Reliance on portions of a statement prepared and certifiedor authorized by an expert to be included in the document generally wouldbe reasonable absent actual knowledge, or a reason to know, of the inaccuracyof those staments.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>87 In other contexts, the Commission and the courts have distinguishedbetween the obligations of managing underwriters and syndicate members.<T3>See generally </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 9671 (July 26,1972) (discussing the responsibility of underwriters, brokers, and dealerstrading in securities, particularly of high risk ventures). Generally,a participating underwriter in an offering of municpal securities neednot duplicate the efforts of the manging underwriter, but must satisfyitself that the managing underwriter reviewed the accuracy of the informationin the official statement in a professional manner and therefore had areasonable basis for its recommendation. Nevertheless, in both competitiveand negotiated offerings, the syndicate members, as part of forming theirown recommendations to investors, must at least familiarize themselveswith the information in the official statement and should notify the managingunderwriters of any factors that suggest inaccuracies in disclosure orsignal the need for additional investigation.   In negotiated municipal offerings, where the underwriter is involved inthe preparation of the official statement, the Commission believes thatdevelopment of a reasonable basis for belief in the accuracy and completenessof the statements therein should involve an inquiry into the key representationsin the official statement that is conducted in a professional manner, drawingon the underwriter's experience with the particular issuer, and other issuers,as well as its knowledge of the municipal markets. Sole reliance on therepresentations of the issuer would not suffice.88<NOTE/> The role of the underwriter in assessing the accuracy ofthe issuer's key disclosures is of particular importance where the underwritinginvolves an unreasoned issuer.89<NOTE/> Because of the varying types of municipal debt and extentof disclosure practices, the Commission is not attempting to delineatespecific investigative requirements in this release. However, the Commissionnotes that commentators already have suggested a variety of investigativeprocedures to be followed by underwriters in connection with negotiatedmunicpal securities offerings.90<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>88 <T3>See, e.g., Hamilton Grant andamp; Co., supra </T3>note 75.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>89 <T3>Charles E. Bailey andamp; Co., </T3>35 S.E.C. 33, 42 (1953) (``where,as here, an issuer seeks funds from the public to finance a new and speculativeventure, the underwriter must be particularly careful in verifying theissuer's obviously self-serving statements as to its operations and prospects'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>90 <T3>See ABA-NABL Report, supra </T3>note 79, at 74-98; Doty, <T3>The Disclosure Process and Securities Laws, State and Local GovernmentDebt Financing </T3>(D. Gelfand ed, 1986) (``Doty'') at andSection;andSection;8-69,8-71.   With respect to competitively bid offerings of municipal securities, membersof the municipal securities industry have argued that the uncertainty ofthe bidding process and time pressures associated with these offeringsmake it difficult for underwriters to conduct an investigation of the issueror its statements.91<NOTE/> The fact that an offering is underwritten on a competitivebasis does not negate the responsibility that the underwriter perform areasonable review. Nevertheless, the Commission recognizes that municipalunderwriters may have little initial access to background information concerningsecurities that have been bid on a competitive basis. Therefore, the factthat offerings are competitively bid, rather than sold through a negotiatedoffering, is an element to be considered in determining the reasonablenessof the underwriters' basis for assessing the truthfulness of key representationsin final official statements. In this regard, the fact that an underwritingis nominally classifed as competitive will not be relevant to the scopeof an underwriter's review where there is little uncertainty about thechoice of underwriters or where other factors are present that would commanda closer examination.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>91 <T3>See, e.g., Municipal Securities Full Disclosure Act of 1976, Hearingon S. 2969 and 2574 before the Subcommittee on Securities, Senate Committeeon Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, </T3>94th Cong., 2d Sess. 126, 127(1976) (statement of Richard Kezer, President of the Dealer Bank Association).The Commission believes that in a normal competitive bid offering, involvingan established municipal issuer, a municipal underwriter generally wouldmeet its obligation to have a reasonable basis for belief in the accuracyof the key representations in the official statement where it reviewedthe official statement in a professional manner, and received from theissuer a detailed and credible explanation concerning any aspect of theofficial statement that appeared on its face, or on the basis of informationavailable to the underwriter, to be inadequate. In reviewing the issuer'sdisclosure documents, therefore, underwriters bidding on competitive offeringsshould stay attuned to factors that suggest inaccuracies in the disclosureor signal that additional investigation is necessary.\9\\2\<NOTE/> If these factors appear, the underwriter should investigatethe questionable disclosure and, if a problem is uncovered, pursue theinquiry until satisfied that correct disclosure has been made.\9\\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\2\ In a competitively bid offering, the task of assuringthe accuracy and completeness of disclosure is in the hands of the issuer,who usually will employ a financial adviser, which frequently is a broker-dealer.Ordinarily, financial advisers in competitively bid offerings publiclyassociate themselves with the offering, and perform many of the functionsnormally undertaken by the underwriters in corporate offerings and in municipalofferings sold on a negotiated basis. Thus, where such financial advisershave access to issuer data and participate in drafting the disclosure documents,they will have a comparable obligation under the antifraud provisions toinquire into the completeness and accuracy of disclosure presented duringthe bidding process. <T3>See generally</T3> Doty, <T3>supra</T3> note 90, at andSection;8-78. Although the underwriter maychoose to rely upon the fact that a broker-dealer acting as a financialadviser is assisting the issuer, such reliance does not relieve the underwriterof its duty to investigate questionable disclosure. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\3\ The Commission requests comment on the nature and extentof any problems experienced by underwriters and issuers involving underwritingagreements that do not contemplate a reasonable investigation by the underwriters.One commentator has suggested that issuers may attempt to retain good faithdeposits if underwriters refuse to go forward with an offering where sufficientdisclosure is not provided. <T3>See</T3> Doty, <T3>Municipal Securities Disclosure,</T3> 13 Rev. of Sec. Reg. No. 1 (January16, 1980). The Commission believes that any problems previously experiencedin this area may be avoided by proper drafting of purchase contracts orunderwriting agreements. Moreover, issuers and underwriters should considerwhether agreements that do not allow for a reasonable investigation wouldbe voidable under Section 29(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78cc(b).<T3>Compare Kaiser-Frazer Corp.</T3> v. <T3>Otis andamp; Co.</T3> 195 F.2d 838 (2nd Cir. 1952), <T3>cert. denied</T3>, 344 U.S. 856 (1952) (invalidating an underwritingagreement under Section 14 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77n, whereinadequate disclosure was provided by the issuer); <T3>see also, generally,</T3> Gruenbaum andamp; Steinberg, <T3>Section 29(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: A Viable RemedyAwakened,</T3> 48 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1 (1979). While a municipal underwriter in a competitive bid offering may approachits reasonable basis obligation first through a professional review ofthe offering documents, it may not, of course, ignore other informationregarding the issuer that it has available. Generally, underwriters receivenotices of competitively bid offerings one week prior to the date bidsmust be submitted. During this period, they have the opportunity to reviewthe issuer's preliminary official statement \9\\4\<NOTE/> and bring to bear any additional information they have aboutthe issuer. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\4\ The Commission expects that the responsibilities ofmunicipal underwriters described above would require them, in most cases,to receive a preliminary offering statement in this time frame. With respect to both negotiated and competitively bid offerings, apartfrom the information contained in the issuer's disclosure documents, anunderwriter may have had opportunities to develop an independent reservoirof knowledge about an issuer. As noted above and in the Supply System StaffReport,\9\\5\<NOTE/> even in competitively bid offerings, underwriters may haveaccess to information about the issuer that would allow them to reach someconclusion about the worth of its bonds and the validity of representationsin the preliminary or final official statement. In addition, underwritersoften engage in trading of other bonds of the issuer in the secondary marketand acquire information on a continuing basis in their role as dealersof the bonds, regardless of whether they underwrite a particular offering.Moreover, many municipal issuers return to the market frequently to meettheir financing needs. Underwriters that participate in multiple offeringsfor an issuer have a continuing opportunity to become familiar with theissuer's financial and operational condition. From each of these sources,an underwriter may develop a reservoir of knowledge about the issuer andits securities that should be used to assess the adequacy of disclosure.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\5\ Supply System Staff Report at 170-72. An additional source of information is the underwriter's research department.The research units of municipal underwriters produce research on bondssold by both competitively bid and negotiated offerings, and may assistin the sales activities of the underwriter. The research units also draftreports that are sent to potential customers, including institutional investors,and sometimes write more abbreviated information circulars for the directuse of the firm's salespersons in promoting the bonds. When an underwriterparticipates in an offering, the research unit may have substantive knowledgeabout the issuer and should be consulted by the underwriter in performingits investigation.\9\\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\6\ The Commission notes, however, that care should betaken to avoid the misuse of any material, non-public information by thefirm or its clients. The Commission believes that the provisions in Rule 15c2-12 also contributeto a municipal underwriter's ability to meet its ``reasonable basis'' obligation.In particular, paragraph (b) of Rule 15c2-12 would assist underwritersin complying with their reasonable basis obligation by providing that anunderwriter receive a nearly final official statement prior to biddingfor or purchasing an offering, which it then must review. In order to allowthe underwriter to meet this obligation, issuers will have to begin draftingdisclosure documents earlier and perhaps with greater care than in thepast. Furthermore, this requirement should enable underwriters to receive,and if necessary influence the content of, the final official statementbefore committing themselves to an offering. The Commission believes that the conduct of the underwriters in the SupplySystem offerings, and the position advanced by some members of the industry,with respect to their responsibilities in competitively bid offerings,raise serious concerns that warrant additional review. Although the legalstandards stated above reflect the current Commission views based uponjudicial decisions and previous administrative actions, the Commissionis concerned that the standards applicable to municipal underwriters bearticulated correctly. Accordingly, the Commission would like to receiveviews on the interpretation expressed above. In addition, the Commissionwould like to receive comment from underwriters and other members of theindustry regarding current practices in both negotiated and competitivelybid underwritings, and the extent to which they meet the standards articulatedin this release. In this regard, the Commission requests comment on anyproblems experienced by underwriters in fulfilling their responsibilitiesthat could be resolved through further Commission or MSRB rulemaking. Commentatorsalso are invited to address whether a clearer articulation of an underwriter'sresponsibilities is desirable, either through additional Commission interpretationor rulemaking, or through amendment to the statutory provisions of thefederal securities laws. Alternatively, should the MSRB adopt general guidelinesor interpretations to assist underwriters in determining the scope of theirresponsibilities? <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Creation of a Central Repository </ITAG>In addition to soliciting views on proposed Rule 15c2-12, and the methodsused to satisfy an underwriter's responsibility to have a reasonable basisfor recommending the securities it underwrites, the Commission requestscomment on a proposal advanced by the MSRB and members of the industryto create a repository of municipal securities disclosure documents. Thisproposal is intended to imporve the flow of information to the municipalmarketplace. Information concerning corporate offerings is available tothe public at a single location, because most corporate issuers file registrationstatements with the Commission.\9\\7\<NOTE/> In addition, many corporate issuers are subject to the annualand periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act,\9\\8\<NOTE/> which provide a continual source of disclousre about theissuer to the secondary markets. No similar registration or reporting requirementsexist for municipal issuers, however. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\7\ Unless an exemption is available, Section 5 of theSecurities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77e, requires a registration statement to beon file with the Commission prior to any offers of corporate securities,and that a registration statement have been declared effective prior toany sales. A statutory prospectus must accompany or precede the sale ordelivery of a security. Registration statements are public at the timeof filing with the Commission. 15 U.S.C. 77f(d). In contrast, municipalsecurities, which are exempt from section 5, may be offered and sold withoutfiling with the Commission. <T3>Compare</T3> MSRB rule G-34 (requiring certain information concerninga new issue to be provided to the MSRB or its designee in order to obtaina CUSIP number). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\8\ <T3>E.g.,</T3> Sections 12 and 15(d), 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>l</T3> and 78<T3>o</T3>(d). Although some repositories do collect information concerning municipalofferings,\9\\9\<NOTE/> there is no central and complete source of documentary information.Moreover, even when official statements are prepared, dealers may not retaincopies following the distribution. Consequently, they may not have adequateaccess to complete descriptive information about an issuer's securitieswhen trading in the secondary market. As noted earlier, lack of disclosureabout important features of an issuer's securities has been a frequentcomplaint in MSRB arbitration proceedings and has resulted in pricing andtrading inefficiencies.\1\\0\\0\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\9\ Repositories for municipal securities information aremaintained by the Bond Buyer in New York, under the name ``Munifiche,''and by Securities Data Company, Inc. While submission of documentary datato these repositories is voluntary, it has been strongly urged by the GFOA.<T3>See</T3> Procedural Statement No. 8, Dissemination of Information andProviding Statements, Reports, and Releases to a Central Repository, GFOAGuidelines at 91. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\0\ <T3>See supra</T3> note 35. In an effort to improve the quality of disclousre available to both theprimary and secondary market, the MSRB recently has proposed the creationof a central repository of official statements and certain refunding documents.\1\\0\\1\<NOTE/> As envisioned by the MSRB, participation in the repositoryby municipal issuers would be mandatory, and information concerning newissues would be made available to interested persons, for a fee, shortlyafter filing with the repository by the issuer. Among other things, theMSRB expects that the repository would alleviate current informationalproblems in the offering of municipal securities by allowing dealers executingtransactions in new issues of securities to gain access to informationcontained in official statements through in-house computer screens. Itis also expected that benefits would accrue to the secondary market. Rapidaccess to descriptive information concerning all issues would facilitatecompliance with the MSRB's rules and would provide a more complete andreliable source of information than is available at this time. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\1\ Letter from James B.G. Hearty, Chairman, MSRB, toDavid S. Ruder, Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission (December17, 1987). While the concept of a central repository has been endorsed by elementsof the municipal securities industry, the proposal has generated a numberof issues that deserve careful study.\1\\0\\2\<NOTE/> The issues range from technical and operational concernsto more fundamental policy considerations regarding the nature of informationto be provided to the repository, and the role of the Commission, if any,in assisting in the creation of the repository. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\2\ <T3>See</T3> Letter from Jeffrey L. Esser, Executive Director, GFOA, toDavid S. Ruder, Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission (December18, 1987); letter from James H. Cheek, III, Chairman, Committee on FederalRegulation of Securities, and Robert S. Amdursky, Chairman, Subcommitteeon Municipal and Governmental Obligations, American Bar Association, toDavid S. Ruder, Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission (March 30,1988) (suggesting that a careful study be made of the issues raised bya central repository before any formal actions are taken). The Commission requests comments concerning the creation of a central repository.In addition to general comments concerning the need for a repository, commentatorsshould address the following issues: Should the repository be created bythe industry or mandated by the Commission; should participation in a repositorybe voluntary or assisted by rulemaking efforts by the MSRB or the Commission;should the deposit requirement be placed on issuers, underwriters, or dealers;what kind of information should be submitted to the repository (<T3>e.g., </T3>official statements, escrow agreements, annual financialreports); when should the information be submitted; should there be periodicreporting requirements to keep the information current; should data besubmitted in summary or complete form, in hard copy (without restrictionsas to the type font or format, or with restrictions designed to facilitateuse of optical character recognition technology) or electronically; and,how should the repository be funded? <ITAG tagnum="85">V. Effects on Competition and Regulatory Flexibility Act Considerations</ITAG>Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act \103\<NOTE/> requires that the Commission, in adopting rules under theAct, consider the anticompetitive effects of such rules, if any, and balanceany anticompetitive impact against the regulatory benefits gained in termsof furthering the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission is preliminarilyof the view that proposed Rule 15c2-12 will not result in any burden oncompetition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of thepurposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission requests comment, however,on any competitive burdens that might result from adoption of the rule.Although the rule applies equally to all underwriters of municipal securities,the Commission in particular is interested in receiving comments on theextent to which any of the proposed dollar thresholds would burden onesegment of the industry more than another. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\103\ 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2). In addition, the Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis (``IRFA''), pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct,\104\<NOTE/> regarding the proposed rules. The IRFA indicates that Rule15c2-12 could impose some additional costs on small broker-dealers andmunicipal issuers, particularly if a lower dollar threshold is adopted.Nevertheless, the Commission believes that many of the substantive requirementsof the rule already are observed by underwriters and issuers as a matterof business practice, or to fulfill their existing obligations under thegeneral antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commissionrequests comment on the extent to which current practice deviates fromthe requirements of the proposed rule, and the extent to which additionalcosts may be imposed on small municipal issuers and broker-dealers if therule is adopted as proposed. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\104\ 5 U.S.C. 603.
