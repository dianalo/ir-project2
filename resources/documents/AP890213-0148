(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Florida should move ahead with plansto develop the nation's first commercial spaceports on Florida'sSpace Coast and in the Panhandle, Gov. Bob Martinez said Monday.   Martinez told a news conference he will recommend legislationcreating a Spaceport Authority to oversee the project and willinclude $10 million in his budget proposal for the effort.   ``When America enters the space commerce industry, it should befrom Florida,'' the governor said, adding the spaceport could makeuse of many existing facilities at Cape Canaveral and the KennedySpace Center.   ``Here in Florida we are uniquely positioned to serve asAmerica's launching pad,'' he said. ``We have the time, we have theplace, we have the talent, and we have the resources.''   U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner appeared withMartinez and said the federal government fully supports the Floridaeffort, as well as similar efforts being pushed by Hawaii andVirginia.   ``Florida is leading in many aspects of the competition,''Skinner said. ``The state that provides the money and effort to makethis work will get the most government support.''   A Spaceport Florida study says that a facility for launchingsmall rockets that carry instruments to take various scientificsoundings should be built at Cape San Blas, near Port St. Joe in thePanhandle's Gulf County. It also recommends two potential sites nearthe Kennedy Space Center _ Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, usingthree inactive launch pads once used for Atlas and Titan missiles,and the abandoned town of Shiloh.   Martinez said he is directing the Florida Department of Commerceto take steps to develop the facility at Cape San Blas and todetermine which of the two sites near the Kennedy Space Center wouldbe best for launching large payloads into orbit.   The study estimated the Cape San Blas site could be developed forabout $200,000 and could be open in nine to 12 weeks. The Air Forceonce launched sounding rockets and many facilities are stillavailable.   According to the study, development of an orbital launchfacilities on the east coast would require about three years.   Ralph Christi, project leader for United Engineers andConstruction, the consultant that did the study for the state, saida spaceport could be funded like an airport, through revenue bondsor corporate debt.</TEXT></DOC>
