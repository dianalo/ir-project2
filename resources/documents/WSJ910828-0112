Analternative method, suggested long ago and used briefly bythe Treasury, would both yield more revenue to the Treasuryand render such a scandal impossible.   On Oct. 30, 1959, in testimony before the Joint EconomicCommittee, chaired by Sen. Paul Douglas, I criticized thecurrent method of auctioning, indicating that it lent itselfto collusion, and suggested an alternative that has come tobe known as a &quot;Dutch auction.&quot; Here are excerpts from therecord:                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   &quot;MR. FRIEDMAN. . . . Sell all securities exclusively byauction so the market can set the price. The method ofauction should, however, differ from the method now used forbills under which purchasers submit a single bid for aspecified quantity and pay the amount bid if their offer isaccepted. The present method involves payment of differentprices by different purchasers, which tends to limit themarket to specialists and to establish a strong incentive forcollusion among bidders.   &quot;A preferable alternative is to ask purchasers to specifythe amounts they are willing to buy at a schedule of prices,determine a single price so as to clear the market, andcharge all purchasers that single price. An equivalentalternative, of course, would be to fix the price and conductthe auction in terms of the coupon rate, again settling on asingle coupon for all purchasers.                                                                                                          &quot;THE CHAIRMAN. Mr. Friedman, I wonder if you would bewilling to expand upon this? In other words, you ask eachpurchaser to submit a demand schedule?   &quot;MR. FRIEDMAN. That is right.                                                                                                          &quot;THE CHAIRMAN. Instead of a single bid?   &quot;MR. FRIEDMAN. That is right. The same result can also beachieved through single bids if multiple bids are permitted.   &quot;A purchaser is asked to submit a bid in the followingform: `I am willing to buy $100,000 worth of bonds at anyprice below a certain level, say, below 99.' Then he submitsanother bid, saying, `I am willing to buy $50,000 at anyprice below 98'; if he wants to, he can submit still otherbids at different prices.   &quot;This is the equivalent of submitting a demand schedule,but it might be regarded as somewhat simpler because it ismuch closer to what is now done in security markets. . . .                                                                                                          &quot;THE CHAIRMAN. In other words, you are saying that thesecurities sold should be sold to all at the same price?   &quot;MR. FRIEDMAN. Absolutely.                                                                                                          &quot;THE CHAIRMAN. But this should be done under the auctionsystem?   &quot;MR. FRIEDMAN. That is right, yes.   `So far as I can see, the adoption of this alternativetechnique would meet every objection to the sale of long-termsecurities at auction that was offered by the TreasuryDepartment to this committee at the hearings on July 24,1959. Every one of the objections derived from the assumptionthat the particular method of auctioning now used for billswould be used for long-term securities. . . .                                                                                                          &quot;THE CHAIRMAN. I notice that you say the present systemnot only tends to limit the market to specialists, but toestablish a strong incentive for collusion among bidders.   &quot;MR. FRIEDMAN. Yes, sir.                                                                                                          &quot;THE CHAIRMAN. I wonder if you would be willing to developthat a bit?   &quot;MR. FRIEDMAN. Yes; for the same reason. If you pay theprice that you bid, then it really makes a great deal ofdifference that you should bid very close to the final priceat which the auction is going to be settled.   &quot;The only way to assure that you do so is to get togetherwith other people and arrange your bids. As you may know, asimilar method to the one we now use has been used in theBritish bill market and there you have explicit collusion. Myunderstanding is that a single syndicate is formed which getstogether and puts in a single bid.   &quot;I have no direct evidence on collusion in the UnitedStates.&quot;   Changes that have occurred since 1959 require someamplification of these remarks. At the time, auctions wereused only for short-term bills and perhaps notes. Alllong-term securities were sold by tender. For short-termsecurities, the defects of the present method are not seriousnow and were not then. This is because there is a largesecondary market for a range of maturities, including somevery close to the maturity offered. Hence, it is relativelyeasy to estimate the likely cut-off price, so that bidssubmitted could be within a very narrow range even withoutcollusion. That is not true for long-term securities, forwhich there is a thinner market, and the securities availablein the secondary market may differ more widely in maturityfrom the new securities offered. A mistaken bid can beextremely costly.   In 1981, to provide a basis for auctioning long-termsecurities similar to the secondary market for bills, theTreasury introduced a when-issued market in which trading canoccur prior to the actual issuance of the securities. Theprices determined in this market provide a basis for bids bymiddlemen like Salomon Brothers, who in turn resell the bondsto the final customers. The when-issued market enabledSalomon Brothers to profit from what would ordinarily be acertain loser: knowingly bidding a higher price than othermiddlemen to corner the supply and squeeze short-sellers inthe when-issued market.   A second minor note. In all auctions, bids below aspecified level (currently $1 million for bonds) can besubmitted without specifying a price. They are honored at theaverage price of the accepted bids.   A Dutch auction proceeds precisely as at present with onecrucial exception: All successful bidders pay the same price,the cut-off price. An apparently minor change, yet it has themajor consequence that no one is deterred from bidding byfear of being stuck with an excessively high price. You donot have to be a specialist. You need only know the maximumamount you are willing to pay for different quantities. TheTreasury adds up the amount bid for at each price and setsthe price at the level at which the total amount bid for atthat and higher prices equals the amount offered. If you bida higher price, you do not lose as you do under the currentmethod. Dealers no longer have a sheltered market in whichthey can conveniently gain by such tactics as Salomonfollowed.   The advantage claimed for the present method is that itenables the Treasury to benefit from bids above the cut-offprice and from bids at the average price. In effect, it isbehaving like a discriminating monopolist. That may be avalid argument for a single, one-time auction; it is notvalid for a series of repeated auctions.   As I wrote in the October 1964 issue of the Journal ofPolitical Economy, in answer to a criticism of my suggestion:Even for bills, where the defects of the method are leastimportant, &quot;the method of bidding may not limit the volume ofbidding much, but it does limit it some; it may not alter thebids submitted by those who enter bids much, but it doesalter them some; it may not add much to the returns ofdealers who have superior ability to bid and who buy toresell, but it does add some.&quot; Hence I argued that in a longseries of auctions, the Treasury &quot;probably loses to theextent of the extra rents earned by scarce dealer abilities.&quot;   More important, &quot;my major reason for urging a change inmethod of bidding has been not to save money on bills butrather to facilitate the adoption of auctioning as theexclusive method of selling all Treasury securities,regardless of maturity.&quot;   While my initial proposal produced a brief but livelydiscussion in professional journals, it had no effect onTreasury policy. However, in 1972, when George Shultz wassecretary of the Treasury and Jack Bennett was undersecretaryfor monetary affairs, I was able to persuade them toexperiment with Dutch auctions for some issues of long-termsecurities. The experiments ended in 1974, when William Simonbecame secretary. For all his admirable qualities, Bill Simonwas too recently a bond trader on Wall Street to welcome anexperiment vigorously opposed by professional government bonddealers.   Two economists at the Treasury subsequently evaluated theperformance of comparable bond issues sold by Dutch auctionand by the standard procedure. The results were unambiguous.The Treasury got a better deal under the Dutch auction. Theeconomists estimated that the Treasury would have saved some$60 million by using a Dutch auction for the 10 issues soldby the standard method that they used as a basis ofcomparison. The estimated saving would have amounted to about0.75% of the total revenue realized. If anything like thesame results were realized today, the savings would clearlybe substantial given the far larger amounts involved.   The authors submitted their article to a professionaljournal, which accepted it for publication. However, for morethan two years the Treasury refused to authorize itspublication. That veto was withdrawn in late 1979. By thattime, only one of the two authors was still at the Treasury,and he left shortly thereafter. Despite his intention torevise and publish the paper, as conveyed to me in a 1981letter, the paper has never been published, so the evidenceis still not a matter of public record.   Perhaps the Salomon scandal will wake the Treasury out ofits torpor, and lead it to adopt a Dutch auction for all ofthe securities it issues. If that mini-miracle were tohappen, Wall Street would not like it. Authorized &quot;primarydealers&quot; (of which there currently are 40) would lose anyexcuse for existence. Bids would be open to everyone. Finalpurchasers could deal directly with the Treasury withoutgoing through middlemen. There would be no need for awhen-issued market, though it might do no harm to have one.   The Treasury bureaucrats in charge of debt management alsowould not like it. They are now important people, in aposition to confer or withdraw primary dealer status, meetingregularly with important people from Wall Street to decide onterms of new issues. Under a Dutch auction, they would bereduced to clerks, tallying up the bids and announcing theclearing price.   The only ones who would like it would be the public, whowould benefit both as taxpayers and as final purchasers ofU.S. securities. Though the public has the greatest interestin the outcome, experience suggests that it has little if anyinfluence, which is why a decision to use Dutch auctions forall securities issues would be a mini-miracle.                                                                                                          Addendum. When he left the Treasury, Jack Bennett returnedto Exxon, where he introduced Dutch auctions for at leastsome Exxon debt issues. Since then, the practice has beenspreading, so that it is no longer simply a theoreticalpossibility.   ---   Mr. Friedman, the Nobel laureate in economics, is a fellowat Stanford's Hoover Institution.</TEXT></DOC>
