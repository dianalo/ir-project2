(products).andO;Product:   Network Products ACS2 (Communications board)LanMaster Incomserv 2.01 (Turnkey system).andO;Topic:     EvaluationTurnkey SystemsCommunications EquipmentBoards-Cards.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Help WantedandM;Wanted: Network specialist to work with Paradox, Xywrite, FaxPress, and otherapplications.andP;  Good communication skills and the ability to direct and assistnetwork users required.andP;  Must be a self-starter and able to work long hours.andO;Duties include organizing network applications and acting as a resource tonetwork users.andM;When you're shopping for communications server, your requirements may soundas much like a help wanted ad as any you've seen in the classifieds.andP;  Thedevice must fit into your existing network to provided users with sharedaccess to modems, remote access to applications that they have already beenusing on the network, or at least file transfer capabilities between remotecomputers and the network.andP;  I found the LanMaster Incomserv and the NetworkProducts [ACS.Sup.2] both filled the available position in my network.andM;ObjectiveandM;Asynchronous communications servers typically allow network users to sharemodems.andP;  These modems can be used to call into the network from remote sitesso users can access network applications and data.andM;Anyone who has found himself working outside the office but needing to accessinformation from his network understands why remote access is beneficial.andO;Instead of telling a client you will fax him a report in two weeks when youreturn to the office to pull it off the network, you can call your networkvia your portable computer with modem and print it in his office or accessthe network fax server and fax it to him from your hotel room that same day.andM;In the case of the [ACS.sup.2], the modems can also be accessed by localnetwork users for placing an outgoing call.andP;  Since modems are typically usedonly periodically, it makes sense to share them.andP;  Rather than five networkusers having modems they each access 20 percent of the time but leave idle 80percent of the time, five users can access a single modem.andP;  The modem canthen be used 100 percent of the time, making your investment more worthwhile.andM;These comm servers also let network users access asynchronous hosts andconnect terminals to the network, thus providing an inexpensive way of addingusers to the network.andP;  LanMaster is positioning the Incomserv in low-costmultiuser system markets as well as the network comm server market.andO;Likewise, Network Products lists about 30 compatible applications forterminal emulation, dial-in access, and special purpose applications.andM;With the LanMaster system, the comm server and remote user must be runningLanMaster proprietary software, but the [ACS.sup.2] is compatible with anysoftware that supports the Network Communications Software Interface (NCSI).andO;This interface was developed by Network Products and is becoming increasinglyaccepted as a standard.andP;  Applications that support the Novell NetworkAsynchronous Server Interface (NASI) or Ungermann-Bass's NETCI are alsocompatible with NCSI.andM;Because both the [ACS.sup.2] and In-comserv use intelligent multiport boardsfor the serial devices, data transmission processes are offloaded to theprocessor on the serial board, and comm server speed is not affected as muchby the amount of data being transferred.andM;ExperienceandM;HardwareandM;I had good experiences with both products in the LAN Magazine test lab andfound both installed easily.andP;  Since I received a turnkey system fromLanMaster, the hardware installation was reduced to connecting the monitor tothe CPU.andP;  I also connected the serial cable and attached a modem to the firstof the four ports.andP;  Incomserv comes with an octopus cable that plugs into asingle port on the computer but splits from that connector into four (or asmany as eight) numbered serial cables.andM;I still had to supply a cable to connect the Incomserv and modem because theconnectors on both the Courier 2400 modem and the Incomserv were fitted withmounting nuts.andP;  If the Incomserv cable was fitted with screws on either sideof the connector, as most cable connectors are, it would not require theadditional cable.andP;  This posed a minor problem because I was installing amodem that had already been in use on the network, so I already had a cablefor it.andM;The Network Products [ACS.sup.2] consists of an add-on board and software.andO;You have to supply the computer to run the software drivers.andP;  I'm always putoff by the need to outfit another PC for the network that adds to networktraffic, but the [ACS.sup.2] offers remarkable flexibility for itsinstallation.andP;  The hardware can be installed in a dedicated PC, a dedicatedor nondedicated file server, or a dedicated or nondedicated bridge.andP;  I chosethe dedicated PC configuration for my installation, but I would certainlyinstall in a bridge if it became a permanent part of the lab.andP;  By installingit in a dedicated PC, I felt I was choosing the safest installation to get afeel for the product.andM;After becoming familiar with how the comm server works and confident that itwill operate without a need to reboot to clear ports and without crashing allby itself, I would be more comfortable installing it in a computer that Idon't want to reboot often, like a network bridge.andP;  I choose the bridgerather than the file server as my second favorite configuration because I amwary of the impact the driver might have on the file server performance.andP;  I'mnot as concerned about the impact on the bridge because it does not sustainas large a traffic flow.andM;To install the board, you must first determine an available memory addressand I/O address.andP;  The board does not require an interrupt request line as anRS-232 serial card would.andP;  The documentation that accompanies the productgoes into great detail about how to select available addresses.andP;  With suchthorough documentation, even someone with little hardware experience caninstall this board without trouble.andM;Unlike the Incomserv, the [ACS.sup.2] board has four separate RJ-45,telephone-style connectors on the back.andP;  My four-port system included fourseparately packaged RJ-45 cables and DB-25 adapters for 25-pin serialconnectors.andP;  I plugged the cables into the board and snapped the adaptersonto the free ends.andP;  Since the adapters were equipped with screws, I was thenable to plug the cables directly into the Courier 2400 modems.andM;SoftwareandM;I found the [ACS.sup.2] software installation very easy for my dedicated PCconfiguration.andP;  I merely executed the installation program and specified thedestination directory for the software and the memory and I/O addresses I hadselected for the board.andM;The installation program then offered me the option to change either of thetwo names associated with each port.andP;  The [ACS.sup.2] associates a uniquename with each port as well as the general or non-unique name.andP;  The generalname lets you group ports; you might, for example, assign ports names modemand ports named terminal to ensure that the ports with different functionscan be distinguished.andM;Because up to four boards may be installed in a single PC and multiple[ACS.sup.2] servers can exist on the same network, I was allowed to specify aname for the comm server and a password for the comm server administrator.andO;To install the software for a file server or bridge, you must also generatethe bridge or file server operating system to add a LAN driver for the[ACS.sup.2] board.andM;I the executed [ACS.sup.2] on my dedicated PC to make the hardware availableto the network.andP;  This step is not required if the board is installed on abridge or file server because the [ACS.sup.2] drivers make the hardwareavailable.andP;  Users with local workstations that will access the comm servermodems must execute execute NCSI to provide their computer with an interfaceto the comm server ports.andM;Network Products provides a simple communications program that is useful fortesting to see that all the ports work properly after the hardware andsoftware are installed, but they do not provide a program that most userswill be comportable with for remote access to the network.andP;  I tested myinstallation using the BTTY program as the documentation described and foundthat all the ports worked properly.andP;  The dedicated PC displayed basicinformation about what ports were available and whether they were in use orcould be used for performing maintenance such as clearing ports, but a secondapplication, CCONSOLE, made these functions available from any workstation onthe network.andM;To provide remote users with access to the network, I installed Triton'sCo/Session software (Iselin, N.J.).andP;  Another supported dial-in application isNovell's NetWare AnyWhere, and a host of terminal emulation software issupported.andP;  The dedicated PC configuration requires a minimum of two PCs forremote communications with Co/Sessions compared to the Incomserv singlecomputer setup.andM;In addition to the PC with the installed hardware, there is the computerthrough which you provide remote users with access to the network.andP;  theCo/Session host cannot be executed on the PC already running [ACS.sup.2], soit must be executed on a second system.andP;  If you are using the comm serveronly to share outgoing devices or connect terminals to the network, you won'tneed this extra computer, but for every remote user you'd like to have accessthe network at any time, you will need a computer running the Co/Session hostsoftware.andM;My first attempt to install the LanMaster Incomserv software did not go assmoothly as the Network Products [ACS.sup.2] installation.andP;  I was firstthwarted by a general failure from the system disk.andP;  I couldn't read the diskfrom any drive in the lab.andP;  LanMaster replaced the disk promptly and I beganagain.andP;  after running the installation program, I rebooted the computer usingthe sample boot disk as the documentation suggested, but found that theAUTOEXEC.BAT file was trying to log user &quot;Incomserv&quot; onto the network withoutthe installation program having created created such a user.andP;  And thedocumentation did not suggest that I should have created the user.andM;ManagementandM;After I logged on as Supervisor again, I executed the commands that wouldhave followed a successful login with the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.andP;  Incomservincludes Quarterdeck's DeskView 386 as part of its package, and the serversoftware, Incomware, works in conjunction with the DeskView multi-taskingsystem to allow the network administrator to view or work in multiplewindows.andP;  Each remote user session and administrator's console may be viewedsimultaneously.andP;  This simultaneously viewing is extremely beneficial since itenables the network adminsitrator to view comm server activity beforeattempting to down the server whenever line problems are suspected.andM;As a security measure, the administrator must log into Incomware beforeaccessing the administrative functions such as defining network users orinitializing the modems for remote access.andP;  Actually, security is not astrong suit for the comm servers I looked at.andM;I found that the ID and password documented as the default systemadministrator login was not accepted when I first attempted to access thesystem.andP;  I rebooted and, instead of executing the XDV command to start upDeskView and Incomware, I looked to see what other executables were availableon the system.andP;  The CRUSSE.EXE and USERCON.EXE programs looked to be justwhat I needed to edit the user database and find out why I was unable to login.andM;When I executed the USERCON program, I found that, in fact, no users weredefined by default.andP;  I defined a supervisor and two users, BVH and GTK, butfound no way to distinguish the users from the supervisor.andP;  Either BVH or GTKcould log into the Incomserv console and perform administrative functions.andO;Or anyone, for that matter, could down the Incomserv and run USERCON at theconsole as I had.andM;It would be nice if Incomware automatically logged the comm server out whenthe administrator elected to down it.andP;  Since LanMaster's Incomware onlyprovides a login and no logoff functions, I'd like to see a screen andkeyboard lock function added to the menus to ensure security when the systemis left unattended.andM;With supervisor and user IDs defined, I executed the LanMaster XDV commandand logged into Incomware to configure ports and sessions for remote users.andO;Setup options allow you to specify baud rates from 300 to 19.2K for the Hayescompatible modem or the serial terminals.andP;  You may also define the amount ofRAM available to sessions associated with each port.andM;At least one session must be initialized before users can call into thesystem.andP;  Three methods are available for starting sessions: A menu optionallows you to specify which sessions to start, a command window lets youperform tasks including starting a session through the command interface, andan automatically executed command set may be defined to execute each timeLanMaster's Incomserv software is loaded.andM;All sessions are associated with a specific port, but they share the sameuser database, so no user ports may be reserved for specific users.andP;  This canbe a drawback if you have more possible users than shareable modems or if youhave a limited number of fast modems.andP;  With a single 9600 baud modem on thenetwork, you might want to limit that session to a user with a high-speedmodem and prevent a user with a 1200-baud modem from accessing it.andM;Sessions also all share the same user profile as far as the network isconcerned.andP;  Since I had originally logged onto the network as supervisor, alldial-in users would be accessing the network as supervisor.andP;  LanMasterprovides a measure of protection against the disasters that could occur whena user runs rampant through the network by implementing a menu system thatlimits the users' access.andM;The system administrator may define menu entries in addition to the defaultset that LanMaster supplies.andP;  If you only want to provide remote users withaccess to a word processor such as Xywrite, you can specify that as the onlyentry in the front end menu definition.andP;  Unfortunately, since Xywrite offersan option for users to access the DOS command prompt via a secondary commandshell without exiting the application, remote users have unlimited access tothe network just by shelling out to DOS.andM;This setup seemed to cry out for a more sophisticated menu system such asSaber Menu, Perfect Menu, or Menu Manager (see &quot;Test Drive&quot;s, April 1990issue).andP;  These vary in the sophistication of their security systems, but oneoption they share is the ability to eliminate a user's access to DOS shells.andO;Unfortunately, these menu systems wouldn't return control to the Incomservmenus when I accessed them as a remote user.andP;  This left me stuck without theability to log off the comm server and free up to the modem.andM;The Network Products [ACS.sup.2] with Co/Sessions host software also assignsthe current user profile to remote users.andP;  When I log in as supervisor andexecute APPLNET to initialize a session for a remote user the remote userwill have access to the network as supervisor.andM;Co/Session provides more options for security, though.andP;  You may optionallychoose to have users log in to access the network remotely, but like theLanMaster Incomserv login, this has nothing to do with the network login anddoes not affect the network profile.andP;  Unlike the Incomserv, you may log offthe CO/Session host computer after initializing the system for remote access.andO;This forces the remote user to enter the LOGIN command when he connects withthe network, thus allowing him to access the network remotely with the sameprofile he uses to access the network on a local computer.andM;The user will see a system he is already familiar with, and it provides anextra bit of security as long as the user logs out after executing APPLNET.andO;However, it can cause problems if, while a remote user is accessing thesystem, the administrator needs to access APPLNET options, such as filetransfer, that require a search path.andP;  And, of course, it is just a littlemore difficult than it has to be.andM;Additional features provided by Co/Session for security include the abilityto limit a user's life transfer rights.andP;  You can set up the Co/Session hostto allow a remote user only to send files to--rather than receive filesfrom--the network, and you can specify which directories the user can accessfor these file transfer capabilities.andP;  Each of these security features ismore a function of the software than the [ACS.sup.2], so you may be able tofind a dial-in application that offers more or less in the way of securitydepending on your needs.andM;Unlike the LanMaster Incomserv, [ACS.sup.2] and Co/Session allow you toassign devices to the remote user session and limit who can log into thatsession.andP;  When you initialize the Co/Session host, you must specify the commserver name and port name.andP;  You can select a device by its specific name(e.g., port01) or its general name (e.g., modem96).andP;  You may also specify aparticular password or login for users to access that session.andP;  This featureallows you to limit the use of highspeed modems to those users you know willbe calling in on high-speed modems.andP;  That way, the high-speed modem featuresaren't wasted on a user calling in at 1200 baud, and users who are apt toplace long distance outgoing calls can access the faster modem.andM;Co/Session also offers a dialback mode that will verify a user's name andpassword for the particular session, disconnect the call, and then call theuser back at his remote site.andP;  If Triton adds to this the ability to specifya list of phone numbers that may be dialed, the feature could also providesecurity by ensuring that random hackers are not called back if they happento connect.andM;OperationsandM;LanMaster also provides users with the option to transfer files between theirremote computers and the network, but it automatically limits the files tothe \ICS\DNLD and \ICS\UPLD directories for getting files off of and onto thenetwork, respectively.andP;  These two options are provided by default to remoteusers on the Incomserv system.andP;  Unfortunately, all remote users have equaltransfer rights with these directories, so users must be sure to transferonly public files.andP;  If a user transfers a private letter to the \DNLDdirectory to download it to his remote computer, any other user may also seethe file in the directory and choose to download it.andM;In addition to the file transfer options, Incomserv menus offer utilitiesthat list all remote users and display the system memory status.andP;  I dialed inand found that a remote session that was configured by the administrator for735KB actually had access to 485KB when the system memory status wasdisplayed.andM;Next, I selected an option to execute CHKDSK A: so I could see how muchmemory would be available to an application invoked from the Incomserv menu.andO;Incomserv invokes applications through a secondary DOS shell, so the memoryturned out to be more--about 560KB.andP;  I assumed this was due to the menusystem unloading itself to execute the application, but not to execute theDISPLAY STATUS command.andP;  Because of that, I was able to execute Xywrite IIIand Paradox 3.0 despite that they like to have a lot of memory wheneverpossible.andP;  I also executed Castelle's FaxPress program, which loads aterminate-stay-resident portion to provide access to a fax server and printserver.andM;All programs loaded properly and exited back to the Incomserv menu asexpected, but I found some quirks in the way they behaved.andP;  With Xywrite, allof my keyboard macros were activated on the host computer's keyboard ratherthan the remote keyboard.andP;  This meant that as a remote user I could not usethe macros, but as the Incomserv administrator, I was bothered by strangeinput if I happened across a macro combination.andM;With the FaxPress software, I was able to send faxes and print from theremote computer, but I was not able to access the remote computer's C: drive.andO;In fact, the remote computer hung when I tried to access files on C:.andP;  Aftersome experimentation, I discovered that the FaxPress actually looks at theIncomserv rather than at the local computer when drives are specified.andM;Obviously, it would be better if Incomware could pass this request back tothe local computer rather than hanging the system.andP;  A remote user is muchmore dependent on his hard drive than a local user, so he probably needsaccess to it.andP;  Another good security option would be to let the supervisorselect whether the remote user had unlimited access to his local drives orjust the ability to upload and download files from the specified incomservdirectories.andM;The keyboard macros problem is inherent in communication server systems.andP;  Atleast the difficulty reappeared when I executed Xywrite as a remote user onthe [ACS.sup.2] server with the Co/Session host.andP;  The problem with accessingthe C: drive through FaxPress did not recur with the [ACS.sup.2] andCo/Session configuratioin.andP;  FaxPress was able to access files on the localdrive as I requested.andP;  Unfortunately, I could not execute Paradox because, asa remote user, I did not have enough memory.andM;ReferencesandM;LanMaster's Incomserv deserves credit for giving lots of references.andP;  Everyport licensed has a bound user's guide and an administration guide is boundwith a user's guide.andP;  The documentation did seem only to give the basics,though, and left much useful information unstated.andP;  For example, neither atroubleshooting nor an error message section was included.andP;  According toLanMaster, this area is being improved in the upcoming release.andM;Network Products [ACS.sup.2] didn't include references for every user sincemost users don't need to be aware of how it works to use it.andP;  (They'll justaccess an application that supports NCSI/NASI and access ports accordingly.)andO;The reference material supplied by Network Products seems very thorough andmakes the product easy to work with and integrate into an existing network.andM;As for the Co/Session software, the two-PC license came with one host and oneremote manual--the same as the four-user LAN license.andP;  The documentation wasconcise and clear.andM;The Final DecisionandM;Asynchronous comm servers can benefit any company that needs to providemultiple network users with access to modems or asynchronous hosts.andP;  Theirability to support remote users and terminals is also very useful inenvironments where security is not an issue.andP;  If security is important, Iwould suggest waiting until LanMaster improves its security, or I would shopfor a secure third-party application to work with the [ACS.sup.2].andM;Don't forget extra expenses like modems for those users who want to accessthe network from remote sites, and don't expect them to be happy with1200-baud operations.andP;  They'll be screaming for high-speed modems in no time.andO;If you feel that your network needs such a device, review your needscarefully to find the one most qualified to fit into your networkenvironment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
