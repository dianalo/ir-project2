Even kids might want to check it out, given theirfascination with all the dinosaurs who failed to adapt to achanging world and died out. Ted Kennedy and the Senate LaborCommittee have certainly passed a bill with a pea-sized brainthat exists only to feed itself and reproduce.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Kennedy's bill would dole out $850 million a year toschool districts around the country. &quot;Local school officialsmay decide to undertake whatever initiatives they feel willbest improve academic achievement,&quot; says the committee'spress release. Mr. Kennedy wants us to believe that the samepeople and bureaucracy that allow drop-out rates of 50% ormore in major cities are going to turn it all around withmore dollars.   The same Democrats who accuse Mr. Bush of lacking a&quot;domestic agenda&quot; have purged every reform EducationSecretary Lamar Alexander proposed. Accountability foradministrators, merit pay for teachers and power to stateGovernors to monitor reforms all lost out to the dictates ofthe National Education Association, the Tyrannosaurus ofpublic-employee unions. The same old crowd will be able notonly to control &quot;reform,&quot; but also to judge it. And the sameDemocrats who hated Ronald Reagan's &quot;block grants&quot; to statesdon't seem to mind when the granting is to their own interestgroups.   Mr. Kennedy came down especially hard on the mostpromising idea -- giving parents a choice of schools, publicor private. He refused even to talk about a choice&quot;demonstration&quot; and rammed his bill through committee on avoice vote. Mr. Alexander's New American Schools -- the ideaof developing one new experimental school as a &quot;choice&quot;example in every congressional district -- were alsocashiered.   The bill's fate shows once again how impossible it is topromote reform inside a system dominated not by parents orindividual teachers, but by unions and bureaucracy. TheKennedy bill also shows how Congress, as ever, is concernedonly with input (money), not outcomes (education). SenateDemocrats (and some Republicans) can brazenly ignore all thisbecause they figure Mr. Bush will never veto a bill labeled&quot;education.&quot;   The good news is that the Kennedy dinosaurs may beirrelevant to the genuine reform now taking place beyond theBeltway. The choice movement in particular remains ajuggernaut. The U.S. Center for Choice in Education reportsthat in 1991 11 state legislatures (from Alabama toMassachusetts) passed some sort of choice legislation, upfrom seven in 1990 and only four in 1989. Minnesota approveda breakthrough &quot;charter schools&quot; plan that lets teachersestablish schools outside the current bureaucracy. Only ahuge, last-minute union lobbying drive prevented aprivate-school choice plan from passing in Pennsylvania.   Public opinion is also moving. The 1991 Gallup-Phi DeltaKappa education poll shows public-school choice favored by62% of Americans, including 69% of minorities. Support forprivate-school choice climbed to 50% (from 44% in 1987),including 57% among blacks and 60% among people aged 18 to29.   George Bush has a potential winner in this issue. But toprevail, he and his administration are going to have to showthey have the energy and interest to wage a long-termcampaign against the dinosaurs who are flattening U.S.education.</TEXT></DOC>
