I will be jailed. I might lose my lifeif I am returned to Poland because the media there knows that Ihave asked for asylum,'' Polish fisherman Roman Marczak, 25, saidthrough an interpreter.   Immigration Judge Jesse Sellers ruled Thursday that Marczak hadnothing to fear from the recently reformed Polish government.   ``I think the applicant has failed to prove a well-founded fearof persecution by the present government of Poland,'' Sellers said.``Prior to those recent changes, I think he would have had awell-founded fear.''   ``(Marczak) is totally ignoring changes made in Communist bloccountries in the past year,'' the judge said.   Marczak was one of nine fishermen who defected in Anchorage,Alaska, in mid-August. All are being held in the Immigration andNaturalization Service's Aurora detention facility, where Marczak'shearing was held.   He is assured of remaining in the United States for up toanother four months as his case is appealed.   ``It's a bad decision based on an erroneous legal stcndard,''said Dan Kowalski, Marczak's lawyer. ``I'm very pessimistic aboutthe other cases. If this case can't win, I'm dubious that any ofthe other cases will win. This was one of the stronger cases.''   The INS, in a departure from past practice, refused thefishermen's requests for temporary work permits and transportedthem to the detention center here, contending the fishermen wereseeking lucrative jobs on American boats, not freedom frompolitical persecution.</TEXT></DOC>
