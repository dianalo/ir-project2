Simon agreed to acquire Western Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association for $41 a share, or about $146.5 million.    Based in Marina Del Rey, Calif., Western Federal is a healthy thrift, and as such represents a departure from previous acquisitions by the Simon group of troubled thrifts in Hawaii and Southern California.    However, the Simon group plans to inject at least $25 million of additional capital into Western Federal, and is likely to use Western Federal to acquire additional troubled thrifts.    &quot;This institution has a value of being a great acquisition vehicle,&quot; Mr. Simon said in an interview. &quot;What is on the drawing board is merging in another one and possibly two of the Sandamp;Ls we're working on.&quot; He wouldn't identify the possible acquisition targets, but the group previously has said it wants to acquire other thrifts with between $1 billion and $3 billion in assets.    News of the agreement, which must be approved by thrift regulators and Western Federal shareholders, sent Western Federal stock skyrocketing $13.625 to close at $37.25 a share in national over-the-counter trading yesterday. Mr. Parsky said he hopes the acquisition will close in three to six months.    Western Federal has about $2 billion in assets and has been expanding its mortgage-banking operations, originating $1.8 billion in loans during the fiscal year ended June 30 and selling $1.2 billion of loans.    For the fiscal year, it had net income of $15.5 million, or $4.53 a share, more than double the year-earlier net of $6.6 million, or $1.86 a share. Results for the most recent year included about $5.6 million in nonrecurring charges for early repayment of debt and the write-off of Western Federal's investment in the secondary reserve of the troubled Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.    The price to be paid by the Simon group is a substantial premium over Western Federal's recent stock price, but doesn't represent as much of a premium over book value as certain other recent thrift acquisitions. The price is about 1.5 times Western Federal's current book value of $27.40 a share, said Gerald L. Parsky, a Los Angeles lawyer who is a member of the group. He added, however, that Western Federal's book value is expected to increase to between $31 and $32 a share by the time of the closing, reducing the multiple paid by the Simon group to about 1.3 times book value.    Preston Martin, former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and another member of the Simon group, said the group puts a premium on mortgage-banking income, which he said the stock market &quot;hasn't figured out yet.&quot;    Other attractions of Western Federal, Mr. Martin said, are its 23 branches, which don't overlap the 30 branches in California that the Simon group already owns, and Western Federal's &quot;strong management team.&quot;    &quot;We will encourage (the managers) to stay in place and expand their horizons onward and upward,&quot; Mr. Martin said.    Mr. Martin, who notified state and federal regulators of the acquisition agreement yesterday, said he received &quot;rather positive verbal responses,&quot; but noted that applications for approval haven't been filed yet.    Toronto-based Financial Trustco Capital Ltd. said it intends to support the Simon group's bid for Western Federal. Financial Trustco, a financial services and real estate concern, said it holds about 9.9% of Western Federal's shares outstanding. By tendering to the Simon group, Financial Trustco said it would record a gain of 10.2 million Canadian dollars ($7.7 million) or 95 cents per Financial Trustco share on the investment, made in July 1985.    Western Federal would be the largest of the Simon group's thrifts and would bring its total thrift assets to about $4.8 billion. Last year, the group took control of Honolulu Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Hawaii's largest thrift, and this year it won Southern California Savings andamp; Loan Association, Beverly Hills, helped by $217.5 million in government aid.    The group also made a proposal to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to take control of troubled Financial Corp. of America, parent of the nation's largest thrift, but isn't currently pursuing that bid. The group bid successfully for insolvent Bell Savings andamp; Loan Association, San Mateo, Calif., but the Bank Board is seeking other offers because terms of the Simon bid changed substantially during final negotiations.    Financing for the Western Federal acquisition will come from the group's own funds and from Ariadne Australia Ltd. of Brisbane, Australia, which provided funds for the acquisition of Southern California Savings. However, members of the group said they may also sell an unspecified amount of subordinated debt.    The acquisition will be made by D.P. Holdings Inc., a company set up by the Simon group, which also includes Los Angeles real estate investors Roy Doumani, Larry Thrall and Craig Gosden. Mr. Martin said there aren't any current plans to merge Southern California Savings into Western Federal or rename their branches. Each thrift controlled by the Simon group is owned by a separate closely held holding company.    West Coast investment bankers said Western Federal had previously indicated it might be receptive to a takeover bid, although the thrift resisted overtures from Goldrich andamp; Kest Investment Co., which held 9.9% of Western Federal from mid-1984 until early 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
