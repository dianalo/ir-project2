The prime goal is todiscredit the claim that the rich earn the right to reinvesttheir earnings.   Today in America, the acids of envy are lapping at thefoundations of the system, with confiscatory capital gainstaxes, new state surtaxes and an all-out government campaignagainst so-called junk bonds. Driving the campaign to aclimax is the lust for a living sacrifice, to be achievedthrough the defamation, discrediting and final imprisonmentof Michael Milken.</LP><TEXT>   Now as Milken approaches sentence for a series of subtleregulatory infractions, major investment journalists andgovernment officials rush to paint him in lurid colors as amugger, mobster or racketeer. In the case against Milken as aPonzischemer whose junk bond market concealed massive rot atthe foundations, the prime exhibit is a study by High YieldAssociates of New York.   Supposedly refuting Drexel Burnham claims of an annualdefault rate of 1.5%, HYA computed the cumulative rate ofdefaults and troubled exchanges for each class of Drexelissues from 1977 to 1989. The picture seemed grim indeed. Forexample, the 1977 class saw 43% defaulted or exchanged forlow value securities by 1988; the 1981 class saw a 54% rateof defaults or troubled exchanges by 1989. Other years ranfrom 10% by 1989 for the 1982 cohort to 23% by 1989 for the1986 cohort.   It is true that by combining large recent issuing yearswith years of far smaller totals, the Drexel overall defaultfigure of 1.5% misrepresented the real risks of high-yieldsecurities. A more accurate, though very conservative,indicator of Mr. Milken's performance is the average annualrate of return for his junk securities through 1989.Including post-Milken issues, that rate is 11.7%, well abovethe 9.6% annual yield of long-term Treasury bonds.   Not only did purchasers of junk bonds gain high averageyields but shareholders in issuing firms also thrived. A 1989study by John Pound of Harvard and Lilli Gordon of theAnalysis Group showed that high yield issuers increased cashflow, profits and dividends and on average doubled theirprice-earnings ratios. Michael Jensen of Harvard estimatesthat junk bonds and buy-outs benefited shareholders by atotal of some $400 billion.   In other words, beyond all the defaults and troubledexchanges, high yield securities fulfilled their promise ofabove average yields. Indeed they offered real rates ofreturn far above government bonds during the inflationary1970s or stocks since 1973. To say that high yield securitiesare a scam because many default is like saying thatcapitalism is a scam because an estimated half of allbusiness startups fail within five years.   The Pound-Gordon-Jensen figures include the issues --roughly 40% of the total -- done by firms other than Drexel.Despite a hugely greater exposure and its catastrophe between1986 and 1989, Drexel outpaced most other high yield issuers.Drexel's average annual rate of return on junk between 1977and 1989 was well above the average for the market. Itsoverall rate of defaults and troubled exchanges for all junkissued between 1977 to 1990 was 9.6%. The rates for itsprominent rivals were: Merrill Lynch, 19.3%; PaineWebber,43.1%; and L.F. Rothschild, 44.7%.   The real target of the more frenzied enemies of Mr.Milken, however, is not the junk bond but the supposedlydecadent U.S. economy of the 1980s, ridden with debt, lowinvestment and low productivity. The business expansion ofthe 1980s, however, exceeded the recoveries of the 1960s and1970s in precisely the areas where junk bonds wereconcentrated. Business fixed investment, for example, reachedan average of 12% of GNP, substantially higher than in the1960s and 1970s recoveries, and capital equipment spendingaveraged 8.4% of GNP, compared to 5.7% in the 1960s and 7.3%in the 1970s. In remarkable contrast to critics' claims,manufacturing rose slightly as a proportion of GNP andmanufacturing productivity growth at 3.9% exceeded the recordof 3.3% during the 1960s boom. U.S. industrial output rose41.5% in the 1980s, and the U.S. increased its share ofglobal employment, exports and manufactures.   All these gains jibe closely with the focus of junk bondissues. As economist Glenn Yago documents in &quot;Junk Bonds,&quot; tobe published this fall by Oxford University Press, junk bondissuers accounted for some 82% of all the annual job growthof all public companies between 1980 and 1986. Overall, junkbond issuers created jobs four times faster than the economyas a whole, achieved a one-third higher growth inproductivity, increased sales 50% faster and generated threetimes faster growth in capital spending. Some 33.9% of allissuers were manufacturing companies and between 1980 and1986, they increased capital spending four times faster thanthe manufacturing sector as a whole and accounted for nearly40% of all the growth in capital spending among publicmanufacturing firms.   More important still was the critical role of junk bondsin financing such crucial American businesses as fiberoptics, telecommunications and television. Drexel managedmultibillion dollar issues for Turner Broadcasting, MCI,Tele-Communications Inc., McCaw Cellular, and many othercompanies without firm collateral -- companies that could notpossibly have raised comparable sums anywhere else. Thesefirms, backed by Drexel, have been critical to U.S.competitiveness in communications not only by their owncontributions but by providing markets for many U.S. hightech suppliers.   In addition, as documented in a study by John Paulus andStephen Waite of Morgan Stanley, high yield securities havebeen critical to the computer industry. Between 1985 and1989, some 80% of all computer industry finance came fromjunk, including crucial issues during downturns for Compaq,Silicon Graphics, Cray Research, Alliant, Convex and Evans andamp;Sutherland, all among the elite in the business. The harddisk drive industry, also an American forte, was saved fromruin by junk, including $250 million for Seagate and largeissues for Connor, Maxtor and other major firms that won forthe U.S. more than 70% of the world market. Micro Technologyand VLSI Technology were among the recipients of the $500million in high-yields that financed the microchip industry.Junk alone, often supplied by Morgan Stanley when Drexelfoundered, enabled these firms to survive downturns withoutselling out to foreigners.   One of the most amazing canards of Mr. Milken's critics isthe notion that junk bonds somehow caused the savings andamp; loancrisis. Only 5.3% of Sandamp;Ls held any junk bonds at all andtheir junk comprised less than 1% of all Sandamp;L assets. But thefirms that did use these securities were among the mostsuccessful of all thrifts until the draconian measures ofJuly 1989 forced them to mark down and sell most of theirholdings into a sinking market within 90 days.   From the capital gains tax debate to the boycott of Koreangrocers in Harlem, from the assault on Chinese entrepreneursto the invasion of Kuwait, the war against wealth continues.Fueled as usual by envy and ignorance, the current siegeagainst Mike Milken and junk bonds is a symbol of thatperpetual struggle at the heart of capitalism. But insacrificing him, the U.S. is succumbing to an obscurantistdisease that can ultimately cripple American competitivenessand prosperity.   ---   Mr. Gilder is a fellow at the Hudson Institute.   ---     How Junk Bonds Performed During the Milken Years                                                                                                                                                    AVERAGE ANNUAL   YEAR                                     RATE OF RETURN*                                                                                                          1977                                           10.20%   1978                                           10.06   1979                                           11.04   1980                                           11.82   1981                                           12.52   1982                                           11.90   1983                                           10.17   1984                                           10.18   1985                                           10.48   1986                                            7.78                                                                                                          *Through 1989                                                                                                          Source: Salomon Brothers   ---       Defaulted and Troubled High-Yield Securities                                                                                                                          (Issued from 1977-90)                                                                                                          Issuer                                                                                                          Morgan Stanley                                 2.4%   Shearson Lehman                                6.8   Donaldson Lufkin                               8.4   Drexel Burnham                                 9.6   First Boston                                  15.6   Goldman Sachs                                 18.3   Merrill Lynch                                 19.3   Prudential-Bache                              21.1   Bear Stearns                                  22.8   PaineWebber                                   43.1   L.F.
