The proposed moves, which are intended to spurcompetition, would change the way that the Bell companiesprovide services. Historically, they have bundled together avariety of services necessary for a telecommunicationsnetwork, such as call routing and switching, which requiredcompanies to pay for services they might not want. Under thenew plan, the Bell companies must provide services on a kindof &quot;a la carte&quot; basis, so companies can buy just the servicesthey want.</LP><TEXT>   The change comes as the Bell companies are preparing tostart offering information services, a right that previouslywas denied them under the consent order that broke upAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. But the FCC says thechange will help existing information-service providers too,by enabling them to efficiently utilize the Bell system.   In addition, unbundling will give a boost to big companiesthat run their own communications networks. &quot;Big companieswill have the first applications,&quot; says Steven Harris,director of regulatory planning at the Pacific Bell unit ofPacific Telesis Group. &quot;As the largest purchasers, they canget volume discounts.&quot;   But unbundling phone services may cause the cost ofresidential long-distance service to rise. That's becauselong-distance companies will have to buy many services whosetotal cost may well be higher than if they were packagedtogether, Mr. Harris says.   In particular, computer users who hook up to phone linesto send messages or call up data from information vendorscould face considerably higher rates.   Currently, for instance, Prodigy Services Co., whichprovides computerized news, information and shopping, pays$40 a month for each phone line it uses to connect customersto Prodigy computers. Under the new prices for unbundledservices, says Sandra Weis, director of government affairsfor Prodigy, the price of new high-capacity computer lineswill increase to $140 to $180 a month.   Ms. Weis says Prodigy, a joint venture of InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. and Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., needs thehigh-capacity lines to speed the transmission of informationto consumers. Prodigy users regularly complain about theservice being slow; but the higher price for the new linespresumably would make the company sharply increase the costof its service from its current $12.95 a month. &quot;They'reoverpricing new technology by burdening it with {new}charges,&quot; says Ms. Weis.   She says that Prodigy posted warnings about the FCC actionon its computerized bulletin boards this month. The last timethe FCC proposed raising fees for computer users, it receivedabout 10,000 letters opposing the action, a record for atelephone issue, and ultimately backed down. (Dow Jones andamp;Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal and owns DowJones News/Retrieval, also opposes higher rates forcomputerized services.)   Nevertheless, Mr. Harris of Pacific Telesis says the newrates merely reflect costs. &quot;We don't think we should givespecial discounts,&quot; he says.   At today's FCC meeting, the agency is expected to takeseveral actions that will stoke the controversy even more.First, the agency intends to loosen regulation of the Bellcompanies by letting them fold their unregulatedsubsidiaries, including those providing information services,into their main, regulated phone business.   Last year, a San Francisco appeals court panel threw outan FCC rule eliminating separate subsidiaries. But the agencynow plans to argue that separate subsidiaries aren't neededto keep the Bell companies in check, because the agency canpolice the firms through a complex system of accountingrequirements.   Consumer groups and Bell company competitors, however, saythat the proposed FCC rule will amount to a regulatory sham.&quot;It's a signal they're not out to protect competition,&quot; saysGene Kimmelman, legislative director of the ConsumerFederation of America.   At the same time, the FCC is expected to address somelongstanding advantages enjoyed by the Bell companies, whichcan now use information about subscribers for marketingpurposes. Phone companies can identify consumers whose phonesare frequently busy and try to sell them a voicemail system,for example. Competitors complain they can't get that kind ofmarketing information unless they persuade customers to writeto the phone companies and release their records.   A senior FCC official says the agency wouldn't allow thephone companies to provide information about consumers tocompanies at will. Instead, the agency plans to restrict theways the Bell companies can make use of subscriber data. Mr.Harris of Pacific Bell says the agency may make telephonecompanies get permission from big and medium-sizedbusinesses.   But others say the FCC should make the phone companies getpermission from all its customers, just as their competitorsmust do. Otherwise, says Robert Butler, a Washington attorneywho represents the Bell competitors, the phone companiesalways &quot;get the first sales opportunity.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
