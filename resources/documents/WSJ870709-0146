Article II of the United States Constitution says the president shall appoint Supreme Court justices &quot;with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.&quot; That seems pretty straightforward. There are no conditions or restrictions. It doesn't say, &quot;Ideological considerations not allowed&quot; or, &quot;Goods must be accepted if all parts are in reasonable working order.&quot; Yet advocates of Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork would have us believe that &quot;Advice and Consent&quot; actually means that the Senate's job is limited to determining whether the candidate is breathing and speaks English.    Irony number one of the Bork controversy is that a strict construction of the advice-and-consent clause is all that stands between conservatives and the strict-constructionist promised land. Therefore, Mr. Bork's supporters find themselves insisting that the Constitution's words should not be given their literal meaning, but must be interpreted in light of changing circumstances and evolving practice and blah blah blah.    It's true that the practice in recent years has been to give heavy deference to the president's choice of justices. But the practice has been far from uniform or uncriticized. Conservatives used a filibuster to torpedo Abe Fortas for chief justice in 1968, on plainly ideological grounds. In 1959 a young Arizona lawyer named William Rehnquist wrote in the Harvard Law Record urging the Senate to resume its abandoned practice &quot;of thoroughly informing itself on the judicial philosophy of a Supreme Court nominee before voting to confirm him.&quot; He endorsed the ideal of &quot;a balance between liberal and conservative opinion&quot; on the court.    Now, as then, the praise of &quot;balance&quot; as an ideal is disingenuous, and the present canonization of Justice Lewis Powell by liberals such as Sen. Joe Biden is nothing short of hilarious. But it's perfectly fair and sensible for Democrats to make a bigger fuss, and invest more of their political chips, over an appointment that would change the fundamental balance of the court than over two earlier Reagan appointments that did not. That's politics.    President Reagan unctuously calls on the Senate to &quot;keep politics out of the confirmation process.&quot; But his administration has chosen federal judges with unique political care. The Reaganites would never make the mistake of appointing an Earl Warren or even a Lewis Powell. A Supreme Court justice, unlike a cabinet secretary, is not part of the president's team and does not depart with the end of the administration. There's no reason the Senate shouldn't exercise its own independent judgment about Supreme Court appointments, just as it does about treaties. Reviving genuine &quot;advice and consent&quot; is not a recipe for deadlock; it's a recipe for compromise.    Given the need for compromise, though, what kind of compromise should the Democratic Senate settle for? It could well be that a seemingly principled judicial restrainer like Mr. Bork is preferable to a go-with-the-flow establishmentarian like Mr. Powell, or -- worse -- some younger unknown conservative quantity.    Irony number two of the Bork debate is that judicial activism -- unelected judges overriding the will of democracy -- should have become a cornerstone of liberal orthodoxy. Getting hooked on judicial policy making is probably the biggest mistake of postwar liberalism. As Stuart Taylor Jr. pointed out in the New York Times, we now have the poignant spectacle of &quot;elected senators . . . feeling . . . pressure to reject a nominee whose philosophy rests on the premise that legislators should make the laws.&quot;    The past few decades have been an anomaly. Judges, by their nature, generally come from the ruling class, and when they get too frisky it is conservative values they are more likely to advance. During the first few decades of this century, for example, the Supreme Court routinely threw out progressive child-labor and worker-safety laws on the grounds that these violated an alleged constitutional &quot;freedom of contract.&quot;    Since federal judges are appointed for life, and since by the end of Mr. Reagan's term Republicans will have controlled the White House for 16 out of 20 years, a long-lasting conservative majority in the American judiciary is inevitable. The question is what kind of conservatives these judges will be. Will they keep faith with all the conservative rhetoric about &quot;judicial restraint&quot; and &quot;strict constructionism&quot; of the postwar era? Or will they discover the joys of judicial activism?    Already, in right-wing think tanks throughout the land, scholars are discovering remarkable new &quot;rights&quot; in the Constitution that were somehow overlooked for the past two centuries, such as a property owner's &quot;right&quot; not to be affected by environmental regulations and a president's &quot;right&quot; to run a secret war in Nicaragua even if Congress passed (and the president signed) a law saying he shouldn't. The Wall Street Journal editorial page is the red-hot center of conservative intellectual hypocrisy about &quot;judicial restraint.&quot;    Mr. Bork's confirmation hearings should concentrate on three questions. First, does he recognize the difference between judicial excesses such as the Roe v. Wade abortion decision (like so many &quot;liberal&quot; excesses, actually a product of the Nixon era) and other exercises of sound constitutionalism that have made our country a freer, fairer place? Or does he want to repeal the entire postwar period?    Second, is he willing to apply the same standards of restraint in rejecting future conservative judicial creativity? For example, in his view, does affirmative action by government agencies merely conflict with the Civil Rights Act (which can always be clarified by legislation if Congress disagrees) or is it actually unconstitutional?    Third, since once he's confirmed we're stuck with him, does he seem to have the integrity to keep his word on these matters? His remarks that he wouldn't overturn certain rulings because they're now part of the &quot;warp and woof&quot; of society and that he's changed his mind about whether the First Amendment only applies to political speech, can be seen as reassuring on the first point -- or as alarming on the third one. After all, this is a man who wants desperately to be on the Supreme Court.    Mr. Bork's desperation to be on the court may have affected his decision to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox at President Nixon's request after Elliott Richardson and William Ruckelshaus refused. Certainly his argument that the &quot;viability of the Justice Department&quot; was at stake seems strained. And the mere fact that Mr. Richardson now says it was OK for Mr. Bork to do what Mr. Richardson's entire moral reputation is based on not having done is not convincing. Although Mr. Bork may find it tiresome, there's nothing wrong with the Senate examining his Watergate performance more carefully now that he's up for the Supreme Court than it did when he was confirmed for the Court of Appeals.    But if I were Sen. Biden, the first question I would ask Judge Bork when he comes in front of the judiciary committee would be: &quot;What is your understanding of the 'original intent' of the framers in using the phrase 'Advice and Consent'?&quot; That will pit Mr. Bork's intellectual integrity against his ambition right from the start.    ---   Mr. Kinsley edits The New Republic. </TEXT></DOC>
