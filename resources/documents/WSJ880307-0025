Both commodities, which are closely watched as inflation indicators, have started the year weakly. On Friday, West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery closed on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $15.59 a barrel, up 9 cents for the day but 7% lower than at the beginning of the year.    Gold for April delivery on the Commodity Exchange in New York closed Friday at $438.80 an ounce, a $9.70 increase for the day, in reaction to a much higher than expected increase in the nation's nonfarm payrolls last month. But that was still 7% less than when the year began. In Hong Kong, gold was quoted Monday at $436.75 an ounce.    Just last December, crude was hovering near $19 a barrel and gold hit an almost five-year high of $500 an ounce.    Many analysts and traders predict that crude in coming weeks will likely slip below $15 a barrel, and gold below $400 -- perhaps as low as $350 -- an ounce.    But not everybody agrees with that bearishness.    In oil's case, prices have dropped so low that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may call a meeting of all 13 members to re-establish production and price restraints. Such a meeting would immediately drive prices up $2 to $3 a barrel, says Nauman Barakat, oil analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York.    Richard D. Donovan, head of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s international-energy desk, says prices wouldn't have to drop much below $15 for very long to spur an OPEC meeting, perhaps before Aug. 1.    &quot;The market is soft. The world recognizes that, as do the OPEC members. . . . I'm not a doomsday guy, but I recognize the high level of world inventories and it's that that raises concern,&quot; Mr. Donovan says.    There are also tremendous political pressures that will come to bear if crude drops below $15. Many banks have loans to oil-producing countries, such as Mexico and Venezuela, which will have even more difficulty servicing their debt with less oil revenue.    In addition, U.S. presidential candidates will take notice if oil falls much more. As the election year drags on, it may become increasingly important for politicians to woo the country's troubled oil patch. There will be intense pressure from the main oil region, the Southwest, to impose an oil-import fee if prices fall below $15.    There are other supporting factors for oil. William E. Byers, director of futures research at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., says economic indicators suggest that the economy is in significantly better shape than expected after the October stock market crash. That underlying economic strength may mean better than expected demand for oil in coming months, he says. He predicts prices will dip below $15 &quot;temporarily&quot; in the next month or so, but says there's strong support at $14.90.    If oil does hold off the plunge that many analysts have been predicting, it will help gold's case among those investors who see a connection -- at least a psychological one -- between the two commodities.    Explains Mr. Byers: &quot;People outside the commodity industry, particularly economists and the man on the street, have seen oil prices have a significant impact on inflation. And I think oil prices to some degree set inflationary expectations.&quot;    Falling oil prices, inasmuch as they suggest that inflation is under control, dissuade some investors from keeping gold as an inflation hedge. But here, too, some analysts see possibilities for a price rise.    Jeffrey M. Christian, managing director of Christian, Podleska, andamp; van Musschenbroek Ltd., precious-metals consultants, says that despite CPM's previous projection that gold wouldn't fall below $440 in the first half of 1988, he still believes the metal remains in an &quot;overall upward trend.&quot;    Mr. Christian, who says he recommended against buying gold from 1983-1986, says that below $440 an ounce, gold is a good buy. He questions whether current gold prices have fallen too far.    Investment demand is likely to remain above 20 million ounces a year, he says, and even if the economy is already in a recession or about to enter one, prices may already reflect the negative impact of such a recession.    In addition, CPM says supplies this year may be reduced from central banks, South African mines and some other mining regions. It predicts gold may be back to $450-$470 &quot;during the next few months.&quot;    The technical outlook for gold isn't as bad as gold bears maintain, adds Steve Chronowitz, Smith Barney's director of futures research. He points out that both oil and gold are in &quot;intermediate downtrends.&quot; But while oil is clearly in a bear market, he says gold is still in a long-term uptrend that began in February 1985, when the metal cost about $280 an ounce.    &quot;We think it's still a bull market,&quot; says Mr. Chronowitz.    Adds Mr. Byers of Bear Stearns: &quot;It looks like very good long-term support for gold at $400-$420 an ounce. We came through the cataclysmic events between October and January and the expectations that the whole world would go into a recession, if not a depression -- which certainly would be deflationary -- and gold only recently has started to move downward&quot; with any real force.    Still, Peter I. Cardillo, commodity trading adviser for Josephthal andamp; Co., a New York brokerage, isn't so enthusiastic. Though there might be a slight uptick first, gold will soon fall below $400, he says, because, among other factors, there isn't any sign of inflation heating up in at least the remainder of this year's first half.    &quot;I'm more optimistic about oil staying up than gold,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
