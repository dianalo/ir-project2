Baker III,disapproving of moves in Congress for further sanctions againstChina, said Thursday that U.S. foreign policy cannot be guidedentirely by human rights considerations.   He urged Congress to work out a compromise with the White Housethat would preserve President Bush's flexibility in framing a U.S.response to the crackdown on pro-democracy forces and permit theUnited States to speak with one voice on the subject.   Baker said Bush, who headed the U.S. liaison office in Beijingfrom 1974 to 1975, knows as much about China as any electedofficial. ``We do recognize the desire of elected officials to speakto this and to vote on this issue,'' Baker said at a White Housenews conference.   ``But we really and firmly believe that the leadership in thisinstance must come from the executive branch and it should come fromthe president of the United States as commander-in-chief and as onewho is thoroughly and completely versed in the affairs of China.''   Therefore, Baker said, the Bush administration could not endorsethe package of sanctions being put together on Capitol Hill toregister congressional concern over a wave of arrests and executionsand to try to moderate the Chinese leadership.   Within hours of his comments, the House voted 418-0 for thepackage, which endorses previous Bush moves but would add suspensionof trade and development programs, a ban on the sale of policeequipment and a limit on transfer of high-technology and nuclearmaterials or components.   The House provision is part of a foreign aid bill that has notyet been debated in the Senate.   Even though Bush and Baker have expressed outrage overdevelopments in China, including the attack by the military onstudents in Tiananmen Square June 3-4, several members of Congresshave exhorted them to take stronger action and make more damningstatements.   But Baker said ``we will not use inflammatory rhetoric.''   He said U.S.-Chinese relations served a variety of purposes andshould not be jettisoned as a response to the crackdown.   ``The principle of human rights has to be a major foundationprinciple for our foreign policy,'' Baker said. ``It has been, itcontinues to be, and in my view it will continue to be well into thefuture. That is a very, very important principle.''   But, he said, ``it is not the only principle which determines ourforeign policy. And it is not, and cannot be, the sole and onlyprinciple which determines the extent and scope and degree of theresponse of the United States in a situation such as this.   ``When we say the relationship is important, and that we ought totry and preserve the relationship, we do not suggest that we do soat all cost. And we are not suggesting that it is important solelyfrom an economic basis.   ``It is important economically, yes, but it is important as wellfrom a geopolitical and geostrategic standpoint.''   Baker did not elaborate on the point. But U.S. relations with theCommunist government in Beijing, built up over the last two dozenyears, has sometimes been used as leverage in dealing with theSoviet Union.   The sanctions imposed by Bush suspended military sales to Chinaand prohibited visits by senior U.S. military and civilian officials.   The congressional package, an amendment to a two-year $23 billionforeign aid bill, would put these executive actions into law,suspend trade and development programs, ban the sale ofpolice-related weapons and limit transfer of high technology andnuclear materials or components.   The amendment also included some harsh rhetoric condemning the``unprovoked, brutal and indiscriminate assault'' on peacefuldemonstrators that left at least 700 dead.</TEXT></DOC>
