Affluence is to be determined by income from all sources for a single person of $25,000 annually or $32,000 for a couple.    What this suggestion doesn't acknowledge is that thrift is an attribute that should be rewarded and not pilloried. I grew up in an era when we were taught that &quot;a penny saved is a penny earned.&quot; &quot;Save for a rainy day&quot; was our motto. We paid our taxes and saved or wisely invested every penny that was left over after we met our obligations.    By dint of hard and conscientious work; by spending only for necessities and forgoing costly vacations, we managed to put a little aside to accumulate a little capital. By investing wisely and not rashly we nurtured our savings and helped them to grow to a point where we could look to retirement without earned income and still continue to live in the life style that we became adjusted to. I was assured by my government that if I agreed to pay into a Social Security fund each year, that a time would come when this fund would pay me benefits after a certain age so that I could continue to live the same life style without earned income.    It is worthy to note, that the Social Security tax that I paid was never a deductible item. It was withheld from my earnings after income taxes were assessed and paid on that contribution. In other words I paid my Social Security premiums with after-tax dollars. The government broke its word to me when it decided that I am an affluent taxpayer, by its definition and it now compels me to include 50% of my benefits in my taxable net income, regardless of the fact that I have not recouped my contribution to the fund over the past 50 years of after-tax dollars. It does this because I have income on my savings of after-tax dollars and earnings from investments with my after-tax dollars totaling more than the affluency level prescribed by the Democratic Party. Those who are similarly situated will be faced with an increase in taxes of 38% on 85% of the Social Security benefits of about $7,500.    This is like taking a cut in pay. In life we aspire to live comfortably and in pleasant and safe communities. With a cut of $7,500 in income we cannot afford to live as we are. What do we do? Dispose of our &quot;American dream&quot; house, which we cannot afford and seek a cheaper place to live. We cannot find a suitable place to live, so we are constrained to take a room in the Salvation Army or in the YMCA because all of the affordable housing that we see has waiting lists registered ahead of us by those who did not work hard, did not save and who now look for the government to give them low-cost housing or help finance their rental obligations with rent subsidies, food stamps and the like.
