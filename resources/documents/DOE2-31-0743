These extremelylow probability, but potentially credible, scenarios are characterizedby the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Modal Study in terms of themaximum credible structural responses and/or the maximum credible casktemperature responses. In some accident scenarios, the spent nuclearfuel casks are assumed to be breached, resulting in the release of radioactivityto the atmosphere. Models have been developed to estimate radiologicalhealth consequences, including potential short-term exposures and healtheffects to individuals and potential long-term environmental dose commitmentsand health effects to the population. The population risks are calculatedusing state-level data, and the resulting overall health risks are comparedfor several levels of cleanup effort to determine the relative effectson long-term risks to the population in the event of an accident. 4 refs.,3 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
