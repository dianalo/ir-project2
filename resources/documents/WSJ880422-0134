Robert Swanson, founder and chief executive officer, said he doesn't know of any takeover plans in the making.    The takeover defense, announced at the biotechnology company's annual meeting, would give shareholders the right to purchase 1/100 of a share of preferred stock for each share outstanding of Genentech common held as of May 5, 1988.    The rights become exercisable at $150 each when someone acquires 20% or more of Genentech stock or announces a tender offer which could result in someone acquiring such a stake. Prior to someone acquiring 20%, the rights can be redeemed for one cent each by board action. Under certain circumstances, if someone acquires 20% or more of Genentech, the rights permit holders to purchase Genentech common at a 50% discount. In the event of a combination, the rights permit purchase of the stock of an acquiring company at 50% discount.    Genentech emphasized the plan won't prevent takeovers, but &quot;is designed to guard against abusive takeover tactics,&quot; by forcing hostile suitors to deal with the Genentech board, or face major dilution of its holdings via the discount purchase provisions.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Genentech closed yesterday at $32.50, down 50 cents.    In a question-and-answer session, shareholders complained at length about the stock's languid performance of late and Genentech's lack of a dividend.    Mr. Swanson said the company has no immediate plans to pay a dividend, and said he can't explain the reason for the stock's rather listless performance, especially in view of recent good news about the company's clot-dissolving drug TPA.    TPA, the heart attack treatment approved last November by the Food and Drug Administration, now is stocked by 99% of the country's large hospitals and is administered to 2,000 heart attack victims every week. Genentech has sold more than $100 million of the drug since its approval.    Mr. Swanson said the company plans to petition the FDA shortly for the right to include on its TPA label a claim that the drug reduces heart-attack deaths.    The company hasn't any plans to cut TPA's price from the current $2,300 a dose, Mr. Swanson said. He projected &quot;significant sales success&quot; for TPA in 1988, and overall good revenue growth in 1988 with strong gross margins.    Genentech plans to boost its 1988 capital spending 50% over the 1987 level of $88 million, Mr. Swanson said. </TEXT></DOC>
