WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic presidential front-runner MichaelDukakis was holding meetings today with congressional leadersbefore heading for Oregon, the scene of the next primary contest.   The Massachusetts governor had a morning meeting set withArchbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa. Tutu told members ofCongress on Wednesday he favors new and harsher economic sanctionsagainst South Africa to pressure the country to end its policy ofofficial racism.   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., was introducing a measure todaythat would require U.S. companies to shed their investments inSouth Africa within a year and ban trade in everything butstrategic minerals and agricultural products. A similar bill ispending in the House.   Dukakis was also meeting congressional leaders including HouseMajority Leader Tom Foley; House Speaker Jim Wright; Rep. WilliamGray, D-Pa., the chairman of the House Budget Committee, and SenateMajority leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia.   The Massachusetts governor was attending a luncheon with LatinAmerican ambassadors before leaving for a series of appearances inOregon, which holds its primary Tuesday. Dukakis was travelingtonight to California, which has 314 delegates at stake in its June7 contest.   Dukakis widened his delegate lead over Jesse Jackson this weekwith wins in Tuesday's Nebraska and West Virginia primaries. He ismore than 600 delegates ahead of his only remaining Democraticrival, but is still several hundred shy of the 2,081 delegatesneeded to nominate.   As his prospects for being the nominee have steadily improved inrecent weeks, Dukakis has been more aggressive in criticizing hislikely rival, George Bush. The vice president, who has amathematical lock on the GOP nomination, received PresidentReagan's formal endorsement on Wednesday night.   That drew a gibe from the Dukakis camp.   ``We figured it's because Aquarii get along better with Geministhan Scorpios,'' said Dukakis campaign spokesman Steve Akey,referring to Nancy Reagan's consultations with an astrologer, asreported by former White House chief of staff Donald Regan in hisnew book.   On Wednesday, Dukakis rode high-speed trains being tested foruse between Boston and New York and accused the Reaganadministration of failing to promote such service and ``spendingthe last eight years without a national transportation policy.''   He also attended a fund-raiser in New Jersey, whose primary isthe same day as California's.</TEXT></DOC>
