Now that he's pleaded guilty to six felonycounts, The Wall Street Journal has sought comment frominterested and disinterested parties both on his plea-bargainagreement and on how history will view him.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Glenn A.

Now as we focus sunlight on history, we seethat a lot of that activity occurred outside the law.   There's some vindication of companies, includingourselves, that were attempting to operate in astraightforward manner when the people who were dealing withus were dealing outside the law. It took a long time for allthat to come to light, but it helps recast the characters ina different light. I'm not saying that everyone was operatingoutside the law, but certainly a number of people identifiedin the Phillips takeover activities have now been shown tohave operated outside the law.   &quot;The settlement, as I understand it, does probably shortenthe time frame that this thing could consume if allowed todrag through the courts. Given the strong position thegovernment has, I'm glad to see the matter being resolvedtoday rather than dragged out another three, four, fiveyears.&quot; (Drexel provided financing for a run at PhillipsPetroleum by Carl Icahn.)                                                                                                          Charles H. Keating Jr.   Chairman, American Continental Corp.                                                                                                          &quot;You don't put Michelangelo or da Vinci in jail. To losethat mind for even a day would be a tragedy.&quot;   Instead, Mr. Keating suggests that the government couldthrust Mr. Milken into a central role in correcting thesavings-and-loan mess by making him chairman of the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. &quot;A guy like Milken could bringintelligence and common sense, and more important than that,an ability to marshal talent.&quot;   &quot;Mike was a tremendous factor in the development ofAmerica over the past eight years. The Reagan administrationwas very fortunate to have Mike funding American enterpriseduring the time Reagan was in office. It caused the economyto be extremely stable and evolving.   &quot;I think that if Mike Milken's talents were applied togovernment relationships -- in the economic field -- in SouthAmerica, that someone like Mike could design and implementsolutions that would cause the poor and starving to haveopportunities and to economically advance.&quot; (AmericanContinental had major junk-bond dealings with Drexel.)

He's a very terrible person. He's asymptom of the worst in America at the end of the century.Washington is full of corruption, and so is Wall Street andeverywhere. That's a symptom of yuppie values.   &quot;If you mention Milken {to kids at the synagogue}, theywould say, `He just got caught.' I think it's possible to bemore honest, but not a lot of kids here think it is.White-collar crime is wrong. It just looks less malevolentthan it is.&quot;                                                                                                          Joel Smilow   Chief Executive, Playtex Apparel Inc.   and Playtex Family Products Corp.                                                                                                          &quot;It's an American tragedy. He was such a clever guy whowas so brilliant and did contribute so much. It was a tragedythat he had to be involved with activities that so tarnishedhis reputation and removed him from the scene. He didn't needto do what he admitted to.&quot; (The Playtex companies wereclients of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Mr. Milken's firm.)

His energy should be usedsomewhere else.   &quot;The agony of it is that he'll never know if he did theright thing&quot; in agreeing to the plea bargain. &quot;He made thedecision for his brother and his {Lowell's} children, becausehe didn't want Lowell to be prosecuted.   &quot;Michael Milken is far from over. He's a man of suchunusual gifts, and such an extraordinary fellow . . . he'llput all his creative energy and brilliance to work in a waythat will be rewarding to him and the people he works with.&quot;(Mr. Milken helped Golden Nugget become the first casinooperator to use junk bonds.)

We'll never know what hedid.&quot; But while the bargain may enable Mr. Milken to claimthat he didn't cut a deal to cooperate with prosecutors, &quot;Iguarantee there will be a secret letter . . . sent to thejudge, outlining his secret cooperation. This deal smells ofthat.   &quot;In a case of this public interest . . . the prosecutorhas an obligation to announce all the terms, implicit andexplicit,&quot; behind the plea bargain.

Steven Sandler   Legal Aid Society lawyer in New York                                                                                                          &quot;None of my clients who had six felonies would have achance of being out on bail.&quot; There's &quot;clearly a differentstandard. . . . The more you steal, and you're white, thebetter you do. Even if {Mr. Milken} goes to jail, the jail hegoes to is a country club . . . and he'll have a few bucksleft when he gets out.&quot;                                                                                                          Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich)   Chairman, House Energy   And Commerce Committee                                                                                                          &quot;The government's agreement with Mr. Milken raises morequestions than it answers.&quot;   &quot;The fines assessed amount to less than a year'scompensation for Mr. Milken, according to the mostconservative estimates. How does this affect the rights ofthe companies and individuals who have been victimized inthese cases? Why is Justice not pursuing the others who wereindicted with Milken and his brother Lowell? Why is thegovernment not getting Mr. Milken's full cooperation in othercases as the public interest demands?&quot;   Mr. Dingell also questioned why Mr. Milken wasn't chargedwith any violations stemming from his junk-bond transactions.He said his committee provided the Justice Departmentinformation two years ago on them. He said he will give Mr.Milken &quot;every opportunity&quot; to testify before his panel. Healso said the committee will review the settlement.   &quot;At this point, I can only wonder if the Mikado would besatisfied that `the punishment fit the crime.'&quot;                                                                                                          Earl G. Graves   Publisher, Black Enterprise magazine                                                                                                          &quot;Mike Milken and Drexel led the way in doing business withblack America. Because of them, big U.S. corporations areincreasing their involvement with black companies.&quot;   Mr. Milken &quot;may have lost sight of what else he wassupposed to do.&quot; But he has done some very positive thingsnot only in business but in education and in charitablegiving, Mr. Graves says.   The plea bargain &quot;is quite acceptable. If you can get himto pay $600 million and still serve time, justice will havebeen served.&quot;                                                                                                          John Bogle   Chairman, Vanguard Group                                                                                                          &quot;I think history will judge Mike Milken and the high-yieldbonds as one of the great financial excesses of the latterpart of the 20th century. I thought a trial would be a goodthing. That way, we would have more than just opinion to goon in deciding whether this thing was one great fraud or justsome minor technical violations of the law. I tend to leantoward it being more than just technical violations.&quot;                                                                                                          Studs Terkel   Radio Personality, Oral Historian                                                                                                          &quot;The whole thing depresses me with Milken and {Ivan}Boesky. We live in a corrupt, amoral moment set by the powersabove -- Iran-contra, Oliver North.&quot; Mr. Milken &quot;is par forthe course. There are a million Milkens, and he doesn'tdeserve even a footnote in history. He's reflective of oursociety at this time.&quot; But he probably won't be chastised inthe history books. &quot;People have lost their sense of outrage.&quot;                                                                                                          H. Ross Perot   Financier                                                                                                          &quot;He {Mr. Milken} caused a great deal of destruction thatwill continue on for a number of years. It's a tragic wasteof talent when business and society encourage this kind ofactivity. The financial community and the media lionized himand made it possible for this destruction to occur.&quot;   Mr. Perot said he is uncomfortable with plea bargains buthe felt it was probably the best thing the government coulddo under the circumstances. &quot;When you have a revolving doorof prosecutors, you're placed in an inherently weakenedposition. One of the lessons learned is that we really haveto come up with a way for government to go into the privatesector and hire world-class attorneys who have the backgroundand skills to handle a case like this and who will see thecase through to a conclusion.&quot;   A lesson for young businessmen is: &quot;Don't govern your lifeby what's legal or illegal, govern it by what's right orwrong.&quot;                                                                                                          Kurt O. Hanson   Lecturer, Business Ethics,   Stanford Business School                                                                                                          &quot;Cases of this type almost require a plea-bargainingprocess because of their complexity. . . . To me, such a pleabargain outcome will only be just if it results in someprison time. The stigma, particularly to a business person,of doing time is among the most severe penalties.   &quot;In some ways, Milken should be the symbol of the 1980sbecause he both contributed a lot and was so blind toprocedures of fairness and fair dealing in so many day-to-daytransactions. He also will be remembered as yet one moreindividual who believed his own press releases and thoughtthat junk bonds were the solution to every company's andinvestor's problems.&quot;                                                                                                          Gail I. Hessol   Managing Director,   Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. ratings services                                                                                                          &quot;I'm not sure whether Milken was a villain or a victim.The initial premise behind junk bonds was probably correct.For fallen-angel companies, the world thought credit qualitywas a lot worse than it was. Milken and others earned verygenerous returns by investing in those bonds. It was a goodidea in the beginning.   &quot;Clearly it went too far. Aggressive takeovers led tofinancial excess. The average credit rating declined fromsingle-A in the early 1980s to double-B now. There was a lotof propaganda that ratings were irrelevant. That's over now.   &quot;I don't think we're laughing to see Milken gone. I have asuspicion that in the end, he and Drexel were unfairly blamedfor a lot of problems.&quot;                                                                                                          Joe Jamail   Lawyer                                                                                                          The $600 million &quot;is a stiff fine. Justice will probablybe served by it. I have trouble, unless we're just punishingfor vengeance's sake, sending anybody off to thepenitentiary. They're punishing the SOB enough by taking hismoney away. That's a hell of a fine.   &quot;Everyone wants to see the mighty fall. I'm afraid itwould be difficult for the man to receive a fair trial. Ajury wouldn't understand everything. Now I love juries, but Idon't know about this one. Arthur {Liman} did him a hell of ajob.   &quot;Those who made money will love {Mr. Milken}. Those whodidn't are going to hate him. Friends want you to besuccessful, but not too successful.&quot;                                                                                                          Jay Rockefeller (D., W.VA.)

I was curious about where he's going toget&quot; the $600 million in fines and restitution. &quot;It makes afairly clear point to anyone who's listening carefully.&quot;                                                                                                          Stan Marshall   United Auto Workers vice president   in charge of Chrysler Corp. department                                                                                                          &quot;These corporate takeovers {that Mr. Milken's junk bondsfinanced} certainly haven't helped our work force -- as amatter of fact, they've hurt. They've caused companies tospend a lot of their money on lawyers and lining theirexecutives' pockets, instead of putting the money intoresearch and developing new products.&quot;                                                                                                          Gordon S.

It's hard to takesomeone who accomplished so much and paint him totally black.On the other hand, it's hard to find high praise for someonewho is guilty by his own admission.&quot;   &quot;He's the only one who saw the whole set of cards. He'svery smart and very sophisticated. He wouldn't have done it{plead guilty} if he didn't have good reason.&quot;   &quot;This whole era of flagrant securities violation has beenmarked by very effective work by the SEC and the otherlaw-enforcement agencies. On the other hand, it was alsomarked by some extravagances . . . I think they {lawenforcers} have restored much of their credibility bybringing this case to a conclusion.&quot;                                                                                                          Frank Rizzo   Former Philadelphia Mayor;   Radio Talk-Show Host                                                                                                          &quot;I hope he gets a lot of time. He should do a substantialamount of time {in jail}. If some poor guy robbed a bank hewould get 10 or 20 years. But if you're very rich, you canhire the best lawyers and make deals.   &quot;He'll be viewed as a crook.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
