The legislators, who have amended the constitution to reflectdemocratic ideals, rejected an alternative motion by the SocialistParty to restrict political activities to shop and factory floors.   Such politicization of the workplace has been a key weapon ofcommunist indoctrination and is sharply opposed by oppositiongroups.   The Socialist Party, formed Oct. 7 to replace the communistparty that had ruled Hungary since 1948, has vowed commitment todemocracy, but many of its leaders were ranking members of the oldparty.   Last week, it overwhelmingly approved a motion calling for theright to continue to organize at the workplace.   Constitutional amendments formally ending one-party rule andgiving political parties the right ``to be freely established and... (to) freely function'' were approved Wednesday. The law passedThursday formally outlines the rights of parties wishing to fieldcandidates in next year's elections, due by June.   They will be the first freely contested elections here since1947.   The bill also places limits on the contributions parties mayreceive, and it draws the line between funds and property theruling party legally acquired and other assets owned by the statebut controlled by the party.   The assets, valued at nearly $200 million, have been acontentious issue between the party and the opposition, whichclaims much party wealth was seized illegally.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwilersaid Hungary has taken ``yet another historic and courageous steptoward democracy.   ``The constitution institutionalizes many of the laws andpractices implemented in recent months to reform Hungary from astate controlled by the communist party to one of democraticpluralism,'' she said.   A proposed law regulating next year's election envisions amodified system of proportional representation designed to give allparties contesting the elections a chance to win mandates.   Interior minister Istvan Horvath, who presented the bill, saidit was evidence of the transition to democracy. ``The franchise ...is a basic political right of the citizens,'' he said.   He pledged that the state-owned media will carry each party'smanifesto and campaign summary without biased comment.   Parliament also approved establishment Thursday of aConstitutional Court, which will have the power to dismiss lawscontrary to the constitution.   Its 15 members will not be permitted to belong to any party orto have recently held any government post.   The constitutional amendments passed Wednesday established theoffice of president of the republic, who will replace the 21-mancollective presidency. Still to be decided is when and how thepresident will be elected.   A presidential election is tentatively scheduled Nov. 26. Someopposition groups want the president to be chosen later, fearingthe ruling party will have too strong of an advantage if electionsare held next month. The issue is expected to be discussed thisweek.</TEXT></DOC>
