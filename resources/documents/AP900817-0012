The Iraqi president has rewritten history books and purports tobe a descendant of the Prophet Mohammed, who founded Islam in the6th century. He has employed more than 1,000 workers and spentmillions to rebuild Babylon, capital of Nebuchadnezzar's empire.   Saddam seeks to rally support among the world's estimated 1billion Moslems and legitimize his crusade against the West andIsrael in their eyes as he finds himself facing a U.S.-ledinternational quarantine for invading Kuwait on Aug. 2.   Saddam's evocation of Iraq's ancient dynasties has given rise tosuspicions among other Arabs that he harbors imperial ambitions.   Nebuchadnezzar's empire embraced Kuwait, now gobbled up by Iraq,and what are now Syria, Jordan, Israel and Saudi Arabia.   Saddam, 54, has been shrouding himself in the mythology ofIraq's historical heyday from the 6th century B.C. to the 8thcentury to consolidate his power.   Around this he has created an all-pervasive personality cult.Huge posters and wall paintings of Saddam in noble pose areever-present, as are photos of him on front pages of Iraqinewspapers.   A plaque in the Shiite Moslem mosque of Imam Hussein in the holycity of Karbala in southern Iraq shows a family tree thatsupposedly proves that the former peasant boy can trace his lineageback to Mohammed through the Hashemite kings of Arabia.   The Information Ministry in Baghdad freely hands out copies,although the accuracy of the family tree cannot be authenticatedand many non-Iraqi Arabs are highly skeptical of its provenance.   But to help it along, Saddam has in the last couple of yearsrehabilitated the once discredited Hashemite monarchy of Iraq,overthrown in a 1958 coup and denounced as a British puppet regime.   Iraqis like to point out that ancient Mesopotamia, inpresent-day Iraq, is generally viewed as the cradle ofcivilization. Mesopotamis means ``the land between the rivers'' _the Euphrates and the Tigris.   Archaeological excavations have produced evidence of settlementsdating from 7,000 B.C. The Garden of Eden is reputed to have beenat Al-Qurna, where the Euphrates and Tigris join.   Saddam's most ambitious effort to project himself as the newNebuchadnezzar has been the resurrection of Babylon, the jewel ofMesopotamian civilization.   Saddam began rebuilding Babylon four years ago during the1980-88 war with Iran. He brought in more than 1,000 laborers fromSudan to toil in the desert heat on the banks of the Euphrates torebuild Nebuchadnezzar's Southern Palace and other parts of theruined city, 60 miles north of Baghdad.   By encouraging Iraqis to steep themselves in the glories ofBabylon, and those of the great Mesopotamian cultures thatflourished around the cities of Nineveh, Nimrud and Ur, Saddamsought to boost national morale as well as enhance his own dynasticcredentials.   Nebuchadnezzar was tailor-made for Saddam's grandiose crusade toportray himself as the savior of the Arabs against Israel.   The Baylonian king sacked Jerusalem. He took the Children ofIsrael into captivity for 50 years and fought for years with thePersians, ancient enemies of the Arabs.   Iraqi officials conveniently ignore, however, that theAchaemenian Persians conquered Babylon in 539 B.C.   Iraqi history books now refer to Nebuchadnezzar as the defenderof ``the Arab nation,'' even though he lived 1,000 years beforethere was such a thing.   Rebuilding Babylon has cost Iraq millions of dollars while thecountry is saddled with a war debt estimated from $50 billion to$60 billion.   That does not include the $10 billion owed to Kuwait which thepuppet government Saddam installed there conveniently wrote off.   Saddam has not restricted himself to identifying withNebuchadnezzar. He has likened himself to Hammurabi, who ruledBabylon in the 17th century B.C. and is credited with drawing upthe world's first written code of law and with razing the cities ofhis enemies.   Mesopotamia was the center of the Parthian empire which emergedin the 2nd century B.C. and lasted for 400 years. Its capital wasCtesiphon, whose ruins lie near modern Baghdad.   The Parthians came later and held back the Romans and theByzantine empire until A.D. 637, when they were conquered by theArabs sweeping out of the south to spread the new religion of Islamby the sword.   In 750, the Abbasids, whose capital was Baghdad, carved out anIslamic empire stretching from what is now Pakistan to Morocco.   This was the era of Caliph Haroun al-Rashid, when Baghdadflowered as the center of Arabic culture and the beguiling city ofthe Thousand and One Nights.</TEXT></DOC>
