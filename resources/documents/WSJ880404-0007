Initially, the discovery that the Saudis have acquired the missiles has produced more anger than reconsideration of policies. The Reagan administration is upset that the Saudis hid their acquisition of the missiles. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, in turn, has asked the U.S. to recall its ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Hume Horan, apparently in part because of the ambassador's complaints about the Chinese missile deal.    Israel's supporters in Congress are angry that the Saudis have introduced a more potent class of weapons to the Middle East tinderbox. A bipartisan group of 31 Senators last week signed a letter to the Reagan administration urging that all arms sales to Saudi Arabia be suspended until the Saudis withdraw the Chinese missiles.    But over time, the Saudi move will resurrect the argument that the U.S. should be more willing to sell arms to friendly Arab states so they don't turn elsewhere. If the U.S. supplies weapons, proponents will argue, it has some control over their level of sophistication and can use its influence to reduce the chance they will be used against Israel. As the Saudis illustrated, American influence is lost when Arab states turn to China, Britain or the Soviet Union, as several are doing.    It is far from clear this argument will sway lawmakers, who have shot down almost all arms sales to Arab states that haven't made a peace pact with Israel. But some expect eventual re-evaluation.    &quot;My gut feeling is that in the short run it's going to make the Saudis' life tougher on {Capitol} Hill,&quot; says Geoffrey Kemp, a former member of the National Security Council staff who now is a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. &quot;But in the long run, I hope they'll come to their senses&quot; in Congress and reconsider attitudes toward arms sales.    Certainly the Saudi move is serious enough to warrant some review of U.S. policies. The Saudis began looking at Chinese missiles in 1985, after the Reagan administration failed to deliver on a promise to persuade Congress to provide the Saudis additional F-15 jet fighters and related ground-strike equipment.    Then the Saudis decided to get arms elsewhere, diplomatic sources say. They turned to Britain and acquired sophisticated Tornado fighter aircraft. And Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi ambassador to Washington, went to China in July 1985 for discussions that led to the acquisition of the Chinese CSS-2 missiles.    It isn't clear how many missiles the Saudis acquired, but the transaction is sizable. Diplomatic sources say the Saudis could eventually pay $3 billion to $3.5 billion for the missile package. The missile's range of well over 1,000 miles means it can cover targets throughout Israel. It can carry nuclear and chemical warheads, as well as conventional ones, but the Saudis say they will arm the missile only with conventional explosives.    The Saudis say they acquired the missiles as deterrence against Iran's less-sophisticated missiles. The Saudi appetite for the weapons may have been increased by the Iran-Iraq missile &quot;war of the cities,&quot; which has accentuated Saudi vulnerability to long-range attack and increased their longing for the capability to retaliate against distant ground targets.    Even before the Saudi missile purchase, Mr. Kemp says, staunch Israeli supporters in Congress privately were debating &quot;the wisdom of consistently rubbing the Arabs' nose into&quot; their inability to get arms sales through Congress.    Of course, there isn't any certainty that a change of heart will take place. In the short run the Saudi move could harden congressional attitudes toward arms sales to Arabs. William Quandt, a Middle East scholar at the Brookings Institute, envisions &quot;a possible backlash&quot; in Congress against the Saudis for secretly introducing the potent missile system. Moreover, Mr. Quandt says, some may argue that by approving new arms the U.S. would appear to be &quot;rewarding&quot; the Saudis for taking a step Washington didn't like.    It also isn't clear the U.S. could have stopped the Saudi purchase even if it had met the Saudis' other weapons wishes. Though they may fill some of the same military needs, the missiles are quite different from any arms the Saudis have sought from the U.S.    The only similar missile American officials have discussed sending the Saudis is the Lance, which has less than one-tenth the Chinese missile's range. Thus it is possible the Saudis would have turned to China for missiles even if they had gotten the weapons requested from Washington.    In any case, Israel won't end its opposition to U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations that haven't made peace with the Jewish state. But the Saudi purchase raises a tough question for Congress: Is the U.S. better off selling arms so as to retain some control over events, or withdrawing from the fray? </TEXT></DOC>
