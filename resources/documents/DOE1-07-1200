Genetic information allowing to identify a gas source aswell as to receive information about evolution and geochemical peculiaritiesof this source is shown to be impressed in isotope relations of noblegases. Thus, noble gases are unique geotectonic tracers, a clue to knowledgeof the origin and history of volatile constituents of the Earth. Dataon isotope relations of noble gases can be effectively used to solvea wide range of problems related directly or indirectly to the originof volatile constituents - ore-bearing fluids, combustible gases andoil, thermal and mineral waters and etc.</TEXT></DOC>
