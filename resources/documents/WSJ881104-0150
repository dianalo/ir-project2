Smith III of Virginia Commonwealth University, from a Media Institute study on television coverage of economic affairs:   Throughout much of the first Reagan administration, liberal Democrats insisted on the need to raise taxes in order to reduce the growing deficit, and argued repeatedly that administration tax initiatives were really hidden increases. These claims were strongly, and quite openly, supported by network journalists, both in commentaries and in routine reports of political and economic events. Perhaps encouraged by that coverage, Walter Mondale made the issue a central focus of his 1984 campaign; both he and it were decisively rejected in the Reagan landslide of November 6. Network journalists did not accept this defeat with good grace. In the weeks immediately following the election, a number of stories . . . insisted that Walter Mondale was right in claiming a tax increase was necessary. But the cause was lost, and beginning in December 1984 stories about this theme became increasingly rare. </TEXT></DOC>
