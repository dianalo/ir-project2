In an interview yesterday, Christopher Reeves, group chief executive officer, and Lord Catto, chairman, acknowledged that Morgan Grenfell is experiencing one of its most difficult public periods but maintained that operations won't be hurt and that there won't be major policy changes.    But others in the London financial district say they have reason to think that last year's most aggressive financial adviser in the British corporate takeover explosion will become considerably meeker. The scandals and investigations that have battered the firm's public image since November may lead to a loss of clients. And there may be an exodus of talent; rivals are receiving more resumes from Morgan employees and are stepping up recruiting efforts.    &quot;Nothing like this has ever happened to Morgan Grenfell,&quot; says Peter Stevens, director of corporate affairs at Willis Faber PLC, a British insurance broker that holds almost 21% of the bank's equity and is its largest single shareholder. &quot;The government investigations . . . could have some impairment on their business and morale.&quot;    In the interview, Mr. Reeves acknowledged that &quot;I don't think we have ever had a problem of public exposure of this type.&quot; But so far, he said, he hasn't noticed any effect on business and doesn't expect any. &quot;The business goes on,&quot; he said.    Morgan yesterday established a committee of senior directors to examine the group's organizational structure and management reporting systems and report to the board any changes that should be made. &quot;We feel it is necessary to look at what happened and why (it happened) without the knowledge of senior management,&quot; Lord Catto said.    He and Mr. Reeves declined to discuss possible organizational changes, Morgan's role in Guinness PLC's acquisition of Distillers Co. or the Department of Trade and Industry's investigation of possibly illegal manipulation of shares in the transaction.    The two executives presided over one of Morgan Grenfell's most successful years in 1986. To bolster its ability to underwrite major acquisitions and maintain its position as Britain's most audacious financial adviser, Morgan raised $229 million in its first public stock offering and subsequently borrowed $200 million on the international capital market. Capital stands at $833 million, up from $426 million at the end of 1985. By October, Morgan had emerged as the undisputed leader in mergers and acquisitions, advising on more than 50 such deals totaling nearly $21 billion.    But since November, things haven't gone as well. Its stock price has plunged more than 30% since the June offering. In November, it disclosed that Geoffrey W. Collier, the director and rising star who was brought in to build a stronger securities unit, breached company rules and possibly violated British insider-trading laws.    The Collier affair stunned the City, London's financial district, but paled in comparison with events in December. It was then that the government disclosed its investigation, which has as one aspect the possibility of illegal manipulation of shares in Guinness's takeover of Distillers. Morgan, which acted as an adviser to Guinness, announced on Dec. 30 the resignation of Roger Seelig, its most prominent corporate finance director and its chief strategist of the Guinness/Distillers acquisition and others.    Mr. Seelig was Morgan Grenfell's most visible corporate finance director and is widely credited with devising many of the aggressive or innovative strategies that helped his clients prevail in contested takeovers.    Mr. Reeves said yesterday that senior management wasn't aware of all of Mr. Seelig's activities in connection with the Guinness takeover of Distillers. He declined to discuss the reasons or events behind Mr. Seelig's resignation other than to say Mr. Seelig &quot;breached the bank's rules.&quot; As for the departure of such a prominent executive, Mr. Reeves said it is &quot;bound to be a loss, but there are 15 other&quot; directors in the corporate finance department.    Mr. Seelig, who couldn't be reached for comment, hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing. Some in the City find it odd that Morgan was unaware of his activities. &quot; . . . He was such a key figure at the bank,&quot; says David Poutney, a bank analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, a securities unit of Barclays Bank PLC.    Mr. Seelig, referred to as &quot;Roger the artful dodger&quot; by rivals during his 15 years at Morgan Grenfell, &quot;perfectly straddled the fine line between being fainthearted and cutting too many corners,&quot; says a corporate finance director at a rival merchant bank. &quot;The problem, I guess, is that he was just too visible.&quot;    In the Guinness takeover of Distillers, for example, Mr. Seelig personally arranged much of the strategy that bolstered the Guinness share price during the decisive period of the bid, according to Morgan Grenfell. He also was widely credited with introducing a new and controversial wrinkle into the increasingly Byzantine takeover business here: In the event the merger failed, Distillers agreed to pay most of Guinness's costs to be rescued by the brewer.    &quot;That's simply prudence on the part of Guinness,&quot; Mr. Seelig explained at the time.    The investigations and resignations have left a blot on Morgan's reputation, people in the City say. &quot;In a people business where reputations count heavily, (Morgan Grenfell's) leadership in mergers and acquisitions is in question,&quot; says Rod Barrett, a bank analyst at Hoare Govett, a stockbrokerage.    At least one major client, Storehouse PLC, has questioned Mr. Seelig's departure. Over the past five years, Morgan acted for Storehouse in a half-dozen major friendly acquisitions that enabled Storehouse to become a giant retailer with more than $1.5 billion in sales.    &quot;Obviously, Roger did superbly well for us,&quot; says Sir Terence Conran, chairman of Storehouse. &quot;Whether we will continue to use Morgan Grenfell in the future, I don't know.&quot;    Mr. Reeves yesterday described the firm's clients as &quot;very supportive.&quot; Among the major customers, BTR PLC, United Biscuits PLC, and Dee Corp. express support for the bank. Like Storehouse, however, Dee now cites its relationship with other merchant banks.    &quot;It's a way of hedging their bets,&quot; says David Davis, a director at J. Henry Schroder Wagg andamp; Co., a large British merchant bank.    In any case, the government investigation has brought into high relief the aggressive takeover tactics that made Morgan Grenfell a powerhouse in British corporate finance. Many companies and financiers anticipate a backlash against such innovations now that the government investigation of Guinness is focusing on the practices of the takeover trade.    More than any other merchant bank, Morgan Grenfell allied itself with companies intent on growing through acquisitions, a substantial portion of which have been hostile.    &quot;They bent the rules as far as they could be bent (legally) in looking after their clients' interests,&quot; says Keith Brown, a bank analyst at Montagu Greenwell, a securities unit of Midland Bank PLC. </TEXT></DOC>
