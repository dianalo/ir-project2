A strategyfor efficiently evaluating these concurrent queries in a multi-processorenvironment is presented. The strategy combines three query processingtechniques, namely, query decomposition, intermediate result sharingand data-flow and pipelined query execution to achieve a high degreeof parallelism. An analytical study uses the response time for each resolventand the execution time for a set of resolvents as a performance measureto examine the performance gain due to the data-flow and pipelined approachto query processing.</TEXT></DOC>
