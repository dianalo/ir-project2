DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former top federal prosecutor says thecrippling fines and forfeiture provisions of the federalracketeering law should be turned on those accused of fraud in thesavings and loan scandals.   And the man who helped craft the controversial RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act agrees.   At a conference discussing the future of RICO, Joseph diGenova,former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said the law was``perfect for what went on in the savings and loan industry.''   Congress has enacted a $50 billion bailout plan for the nation'sfaltering savings and loans, many of which failed because of fraud,mismanagement and the economic downturn in the Southwest.   In April, the government seized a large California thrift,Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, and filed a $1.1billion civil lawsuit against its operators, charging fraud andracketeering.   James Barth, chief economist at the Office of ThriftSupervision, attributed approximately one in 10 failures to fraud.   ``It seems to me that knowing what we know about RICO, andknowing what we know about the Sandamp;L crisis, that Congress could nothave enacted a better statute to deal with what went on in thesavings and loan industry over the last few years,'' said diGenova,now in private practice.   That notion was seconded by G. Robert Blakey, a University ofNotre Dame professor who was one of the architects of the RICOstatute nearly 20 years ago.   ``It's not a single instance of fraud but it would be a patternof frauds: multiple bad loans of one kind and another, insidersdealing with outsiders. That falls within the core meaning of RICO,mail fraud and wire fraud.''   Their remarks came at a conference, ``RICO, Rights and theConstitution,'' sponsored by the Cato Institute, a Washington-basedthink tank.   Passed by Congress in 1970 as part of the Organized CrimeControl Act, RICO was designed to make it easier for prosecutors togo after mobsters by giving them a tool to attack seeminglylegitimate businesses associated with organized crime.   Prosecutors can take seemingly unrelated crimes or allegedcrimes committed by several people over a 10-year-period, and ifthey can convince a jury that those charged were linked through a``criminal enterprise,'' they can win a racketeering conviction.   Those convicted are subject to maximum penalties of 20 years inprison, hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and forfeiture ofillegal profits into the millions, if the government can collect.   In civil RICO cases, brought either by the government or privateparties, defendants are liable to pay triple damages if found tohave engaged in a ``racketeering enterprise.''   Though tremendously successful in the Justice Department'sattack on the Mafia, RICO has become increasingly controversial asprosecutors used it on crooked politicians and businessmen in casesthat critics say might not have been brought under other laws.   But in reply to that argument, diGenova countered: ``No oneseems to have a problem with applying RICO to the Colombo(organized crime) family or the Genovese (organized crime) familyor anyone of a number of families whose names end in vowels. The dohave a problem, apparently, applying RICO to people whose namesdon't end in vowels and run what are called legitimate businessesbut who happen to engage in massive fraud.</TEXT></DOC>
