Berman, director of the ACLU'sInformation Technology Project.andM;But, he said, the case and growing public debates on federal informationpolicy demonstrate that there is &quot;board agreement&quot; for Congress to re-examinethe laws in this area.andM;&quot;Federal information policy is incomplete and inadequate without making broadpublic access to electronic information a principal goal,&quot; Berman said.andM;Although the Information Industry Association often has argued againstinformation dissemination projects in the government that complete withindustry, its spokesman agreed with Berman.andM;&quot;The public's right to obtain information held by the government should notbe dependent on -- or dismissed by -- the media in which information is madeavailable,&quot; said Kenneth Allen, IIA's senior vice president for governmentrelations.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
