The Commission on Elderly People Living Alone said Wednesday itsstudy of America's 1 million older Hispanics shows they ``generallyare not sharing in the economic prosperity enjoyed by other elderlyAmericans.''   The commission, established in 1985 by the Commonwealth Fundphilanthropic foundation, said the problems confronting Hispanics inlater years ``reflect cumulative deficits throughout life.''   For example, it said, 73 percent of elderly Hispanics received aneighth-grade education or less and 39 percent speak only Spanish.   ``These handicaps have consigned many elderly Hispanicsthroughout their lifetimes to jobs that offered low pay and nopension or health insurance benefits,'' the commission said.``Despite having worked for most of their lives, many Hispanics findthemselves in old age without the means to maintain theirindependence.''   Higher levels of education and English fluency may help youngerHispanics get better jobs and retirement benefits, but school-ageHispanics have high dropout rates and ``many may already be on theirway to lives of low-paying jobs and poverty,'' the report said.   Advocates for the elderly were to discuss the federalcommission's report at a hearing today of the House Select Committeeon Aging.   The study, based on a national survey of 2,299 older Hispanics,found 22 percent of elderly Hispanics live below the federal povertyline, compared with 12 percent of all elderly Americans. Fifty-fourpercent of older Hispanics report poor or fair health, compared with35 percent of all elderly.   Forty-eight percent of Hispanic elders are very satisfied withtheir lives, compared with 64 percent of all elderly, the surveyfound.   Hispanics currently make up 3 percent of the U.S. elderlypopulation, but are the fastest-growing segment of the seniorpopulation. Their ranks are expected to quadruple to 4 million bythe year 2020, when they will make up 8 percent of the elderlypopulation, the commission said.   It attributed lower percentages of Social Security and privatepension beneficiaries among today's elderly Hispanics to theimmigration of some later in life and to their work in service,unskilled and farm jobs with few benefits.   Seventy-seven percent of elderly Hispanics receive SocialSecurity, compared with 92 percent of all elderly; 19 percent ofolder Hispanics receive a pension, compared with 45 percent of allelderly, the survey found.   Because of their lower incomes, 30 percent of poor elderlyHispanics receive benefits under Supplemental Security Income, agovernment program providing minimum income to poor people who areelderly, blind or disabled. Sixty-seven percent of poor olderHispanics are eligible for the benefits, but many don't know theyqualify, the report said.   Although the report found poverty and health problems throughoutthe elderly Hispanic population, there were differences amongdifferent ethnic categories.   For example, because elderly Mexican-Americans were the mostlikely to have been born in the United States and work there longer,85 percent received Social Security benefits. But 74 percent ofPuerto Ricans living in the continental United States and 66 percentof Cuban-Americans receive the benefits.   Cuban-Americans were the best educated and had the lowest povertyrate _ 35 percent _ compared with 42 percent for Puerto Ricans and43 percent for Mexican-Americans.</TEXT></DOC>
