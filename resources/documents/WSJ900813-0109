And limited partnerships may be one of the best ways toplay it -- at least for sophisticated investors whounderstand and can tolerate the risks involved.</LP><TEXT>   Whatever happens in the Middle East, &quot;the case for naturalgas in this country is exponentially stronger than it is foroil over the next 10 years,&quot; says John Olson, an energyanalyst at First Boston Corp. in Houston.   Cheap and plentiful in the U.S., natural gas at $1.30 perthousand cubic feet is an alternative fuel bargain that wasenjoying growing industrial demand even before Iraqi troopsstormed into Kuwait. The crisis is expected to boost demandfurther, as utilities and other big energy users scramble tocut their dependence on imported oil.   The argument for limited partnerships is that they aredirect investments that allow income to flow to the investorswithout being taxed at the company level, as is the case withordinary corporations. Some natural gas partnerships alsopass through attractive tax benefits. And becausepartnerships are outside the stock market, they are lesssusceptible to day-to-day swings in investor sentiment thanare the shares of gas producers or mutual funds that buythem.   But there are also risks.   Partnerships as a way of investing in nearly anything havehad their image tarnished because of their high fees andgenerally poor past performance. At least 20% of the nearly$90 billion of partnerships marketed publicly during thesyndication boom of the 1980s are now troubled. While most ofthose problems are in real estate partnerships, thousands ofoil and gas investors were stung badly in energy partnershipssyndicated after the last oil crisis in the late 1970s.   Partnerships are also long-term investments. Peoplethinking about investing in them should be willing to committheir money for seven to 10 years, when the partnership isdissolved and the proceeds are distributed to the limitedpartners.   Most &quot;energy partnerships&quot; are primarily natural-gasinvestments, since gas reserves are both more abundant andeasier to develop than new oil supplies. There are two basickinds of energy partnerships.   So-called &quot;income partnerships&quot; buy only proven reserves,not speculative properties. These generally targetdistributions to investors of as much as 18% or 20% a year.Because the reserves backing those distributions arecontinually being depleted, however, part of that money is areturn of investors' own capital. For the same reason,distributions are highest in the early years of thesepartnerships.   &quot;You'd be getting into income funds because you'respeculating that oil and gas prices will go up,&quot; says WilliamG. Brennan, a tax partner in the Washington office ofaccountants Ernst andamp; Young. In addition, investors get to takea deduction on their income taxes for their portion of thepartnership's &quot;cost-depletion allowance,&quot; he notes. &quot;I'veseen partnerships where 60% to 70% of the cash flow in thefirst year was tax-free because of depletion,&quot; Mr. Brennansays.   The other basic type of energy partnership is the&quot;drilling partnership.&quot; These are mostly &quot;development&quot;partnerships, which are involved in drilling wells in or nearproven fields. In addition to the depletion allowance,investors who are willing to assume the special risk ofbecoming &quot;general partners&quot; typically get to write off about80% of their investment against any other income the firstyear.   &quot;The chief advantage is the tax deduction,&quot; says FuhrmanNettles, a vice president at Robert A. Stanger andamp; Co., aShrewsbury, N.J., partnership publishing and consulting firm.&quot;In addition, however, if they happen to run into an elephant{big discovery} by mistake you make a lot of money.&quot;   The downside is that investors who want to take that bigwrite-off have to assume unlimited liability for theirpartnership's operating expenses and uninsured losses. ButMr. Nettles says most new drilling partnerships aren't asleveraged as they used to be, and they have beefed up theirliability insurance.   Some drilling partnerships also give investors the optionof skipping the big deduction and investing as limitedpartners. Sponsors may also permit investors to go in as ageneral partner for just the first year -- so they can claimthe 80% write-off -- then convert their &quot;working interest&quot; toa limited-partner interest.   Some drilling-fund sponsors, though not all, have alsolowered their front-end fees drastically. Brokeragecommissions still range from 8% to 10% of a typical $5,000minimum investment.   But Canfield, Ohio-based Everflow Eastern Inc., whichcurrently has a $20 million offering, will keep only 0.4% ofthat to cover its own costs of marketing the partnership. Onthe other hand, Parker andamp; Parsley Petroleum Co., a Midland,Texas, sponsor that is selling a $100 million drillingpartnership, will claim 15% in front-end fees.   Sales of drilling partnerships were rising even before theIraqi invasion. Through July, $14.6 million had gone into thefunds, compared with just $2.2 million during the same periodlast year.   Now, &quot;they're slowly climbing at the rate of about $3million a month,&quot; says Mr. Nettles. Sales of income funds,which have steadily declined in recent years, were $157.2million through July, down 57% from $351.2 million a yearago.   While gas prices are still under some pressure because ofa surplus in certain regions of the country, that &quot;bubble&quot;could rapidly disappear with the winter home-heating seasonjust around the corner. State utility regulators, realizingthey can't count on imported oil supplies, &quot;are going to wantto make sure that local gas companies are up to the brim withinventories,&quot; says First Boston's Mr. Olson. Most aren't now,either because they have some gas left over from last year'sunusually warm winter or because they have been waiting forprices to fall even lower.   But Mr. Nettles adds a final note of caution. In thecurrent heated environment, dealing with reputable energypartnership sponsors is more important than ever. Even beforeIraqi ruler Saddam Hussein seized Kuwait, he says, theincreasing world-wide demand for oil had brought outpromoters pushing questionable deals.</TEXT></DOC>
