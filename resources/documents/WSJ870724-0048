Traders focused instead on rumors that there will be a disapointing report today on U.S. second-quarter economic growth. In the Persian Gulf, the absence of any Iranian attack on Kuwaiti vessels that were placed under U.S. protection this week seemed to reduce buying of the dollar as a &quot;safe haven&quot; investment currency.    Testimony by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker before the Senate Banking Committee helped control the dollar's slippage.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 151.23 Japanese yen, off 0.7% from 152.31 late Wednesday. The U.S. currency also eased to 1.8601 West German marks from 1.8643.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 150.85 yen.    Durable goods orders jumped 1.4% last month. Most forecasts had called for little change or a slight decline. But many traders chose to ignore the figure.    &quot;It's a notoriously erratic number,&quot; Leslie A. Puth, a corporate trader at Banque Indosuez in New York, said. Defense-related orders, which fluctuate widely from month to month, accounted for the increase, the Commerce Department said.    Before the report, the dollar was softened up in overseas trading by speculation that today's report on second-quarter growth will show a more sluggish economy than previously thought. Analysts generally believe the economy grew at about a 2% annual rate in the quarter.    Mr. Volcker's comments to the Senate Banking Committee may have restrained the dollar's slide. The departing Fed chairman repeated his warning against an &quot;overshoot&quot; in any dollar decline. He said the link between a falling dollar and a rise in U.S. inflation is so close that any loss of confidence in the U.S. currency would have a &quot;chilling&quot; effect on financial markets.    Mr. Volcker also said there's no doubt that the lower dollar contributed to a recent rise in the U.S. inflation rate, as prices of imports are climbing by much more than the average rise in prices. The U.S. &quot;must avoid a precipitous decline of the dollar,&quot; he said.    Fears of a widening conflict in the Persian Gulf region receded somewhat, partly because Iran hasn't attacked Kuwaiti ships under U.S. protection as threatened and partly because of a United Nations bid to halt the Iran-Iraq war.    Currency speculators bought dollars aggressively early this week in the belief that the U.S. naval escort of Kuwait's oil tankers would provoke Iranian attacks. Funds tend to flow to the dollar in times of international crisis or instability. But now, &quot;that has faded from the market as a bullish factor&quot; for the dollar, Charles A. Spence, vice president, foreign exchange, at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles, said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 20 cents an ounce to $455.10 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.3 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $454.90 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                  LATE NEW YORK TRADING                 Thursday, July 23, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
