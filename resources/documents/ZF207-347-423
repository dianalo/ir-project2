(Technology Update) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Terry, Chris.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Making C programs that are widely portable is fairly easy due tonew compilers and techniques.andP;  Programmers, however, must programcarefully, paying close attention to C's implementation-dependentfeatures, in order to ensure the portability of their programs.andO;Designing software for embedded systems on host computers mayrequire the use of cross-development compilers and tools, whiledesigning for reduced instruction-set computer (RISC)-basedprocessors may require the use of a retargetable compiler.andO;Retargetable compilers first generate output in an intermediatelanguage, and then use files containing a definition of the targetmachine to translate the intermediate language into executablecode and optimize it for the target machine.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     C Programming LanguageProgrammingCompilers.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
