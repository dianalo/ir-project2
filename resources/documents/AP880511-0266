(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Voters rejected three of fivecandidates under criminal indictment and nominated a host ofunknowns to key offices in what the secretary of state called ``thecleanest election in Mingo County history.''   The poverty-stricken mountain coal mining county has beensaddled with a corrupt reputation for years. In 1986, the firechief was convicted of running a drug ring and the sheriff pleadedguilty to buying his job for $100,000.   Tuesday's primary election for Legislature, county commission,sheriff and other posts marked the decline of ``slatemakers,''powerbrokers who in the past have bought a person's vote for $2 ora half-pint of bourbon, officials said.   The three indicted officials who lost Tuesday were state Sen.John Pat Fanning and Chief Magistrate Bill Webb, both seekingre-election, and former state Rep. R. Doyle Van Meter II, who ranfor county assessor.   Two indicted officials will be on the November ballot _ formerMagistrate Joey Kohari, who captured the Democratic nomination forassessor, and surveyor Jim Webb.   ``The results signal that an overwhelming majority of MingoCountians are determined to put an end to the kind of politicalcorruption which had drawn unfavorable attention from outsiders,''Secretary of State Ken Hechler, the state's chief election officer,said Wednesday. ``Now I trust this determination will stick andthat the clock won't be turned back in the future.''   Fanning, Kohari, Van Meter and Bill Webb were among 15 politicalfigures indicted April 7 on charges of conspiring to controlelections through excessive political contributions to a MingoCounty political slate. Jim Webb was indicted last fall on briberyand conspiracy charges for his role in a deed transaction.   All have pleaded innocent.   Of the 69 people running for 12 county-wide offices, 57 werepolitical novices and 43 had never run for office before. Fivenovices were nominated, including four who never before had ran arace.   Former Sheriff Gerald Chafin won the Democratic nomination forsheriff and will run in November for the post he held until 1980,when political boss and subsequent Sheriff Johnie Owens led asuccessful ouster suit against him.   Kohari said his indictment made him ``the underdog.'' He saidhis strategy was to explain the charges to voters. ``Apparently,it's paid off,'' he said Wednesday. ``They believe me.''   Jim Webb, of Chattaroy, won re-election to the surveyor'soffice, a position with no salary and no official duties, by a widemargin.   Fanning, a Democrat from Wyoming County whose district alsocovers Mingo, lost his state Senate seat to political newcomer A.Keith Wagner. No Republican is scheduled to run against Wagner inthe November general election.   Bill Webb ran fourth in a field of 11 in a race for threemagistrate positions. Dee Sidebottom, Webb's magistrate'sassistant, led the ticket.</TEXT></DOC>
