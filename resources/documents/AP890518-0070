About 60,000 students, townspeople and opposition supportersgathered in southeastern Kwangju to denounce Roh and the UnitedStates for suppressing the 1980 Kwangju rebellion in which at least192 people died.   Eight effigies representing Roh and seven other senior generalswho commanded the army were burned as the crowd cheered and raisedclinched fists in the provincial capital, 170 miles southwest ofSeoul.   In Seoul and seven other cities, thousands of people also tookpart in marches, protests and religious services.   Thousands of riot police were deployed in central Seoul to blockprotests. Police chased bands of students who ran through thestreets shouting slogans, such as ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' and``Drive out the Yankee imperialists!''   In Kwangju, opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said right-wingforces were plotting to reimpose authoritarian rule in South Korea.``We must remain alert to crush them and inherit the spirit ofKwangju,'' Kim said in the message read to the crowd.   All protests were peaceful except in southern Chonju whereradical students hurling firebombs attacked offices of thegoverning Democratic Justice Party. Police said there were noinjuries.   Dissident groups had called for peaceful protests to mark theanniversary of the uprising that began May 18, 1980 in Kwangju.Past anniversaries were marked by violence.   It was the first time the government permitted a demonstrationin Kwangju to mark the uprising. Hundreds of riot police stayed outof sight inside the government headquarters while the huge crowddemonstrated in the square before the government building.   Earlier, 20,000 people visited the cemetery outside Kwangjuwhere many of those killed in the nine-day uprising are buried.Mourners prayed and bowed before the graves as funeral music blaredover loud speakers and students pounded drums.   Mourners lit a gasoline-drenched figure made of cloth about sixfeet high, with a top hat decorated with the U.S. Stars and Stripesand Roh's face.   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Get out American imperialists!''people yelled as thick smoke swirled up from the blazing effigy.   Dissident groups called for Roh's resignation and the expulsionof the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea. They claimWashington has helped to keep Roh and past authoritariangovernments in power.   Crowds of students, townspeople, opposition politicians andothers hiked to the cemetery in the hills outside Kwangju. Elderlymothers, dressed in long traditional white mourning robes, sobbedand cried hysterically in front of the graves of sons killed in theuprising.   ``My son, my son!'' sobbed one woman.   Other mourners placed fruit and drinks on the graves and burnedscented candles to honor the dead. Pictures of the dead, mostlyyoung students, were placed in front of many of the graves.   Columns of radical students carried red, blue and yellow flags.Banners depicted enraged people with rifles fighting soldiers.   Anti-government sentiment in Kwangju, a traditional oppositionstronghold, has been inflamed by the death earlier this month of aradical student. Dissidents allege police killed Lee Chol-kyu,whose body was found in a reservoir near Kwangju May 10.   Roh was a senior army general when townspeople and studentsseized a government armory in Kwangju on May 18, 1980 and tookcontrol of the city until troops were sent in to end the uprising.   Government reports said 192 people were killed and hundredsinjured. Opposition groups claim the government covered up manymore deaths.   South Korea has been hit by waves of violent anti-governmentprotests and labor strikes in recent months. Dissidents and radicalstudents have been calling for the overthrow of the Roh government,but they lack public support because of their violent tactics andextremist views.</TEXT></DOC>
