Mary H.I. Sunny of Alexandria, Va., dropped her husband's name in 1977, because using it was &quot;a custom of slavery.&quot; Her husband, a retired colonel, directed the Air Force to make out his pension checks to &quot;Mary H. Sunny and James E. Mahon,&quot; in &quot;symbolic recognition&quot; of her services as &quot;a partner and comrade-in-arms&quot; for over 30 years. In 1980, Ms. Sunny tried repeatedly -- to no avail -- to get the IRS to accept her preferred name; so for 1981, the couple divided Mahon's pension and employment income equally and filed separate returns.    They added to his return a statement that the income and tax were joint and shared equally. But the IRS said Mahon had understated his income by half; it billed him for tax and a negligence penalty. He turned to the Tax Court. Now Judge Simpson has agreed with the IRS that Mahon earned all the income and is taxable on all of it.    But the judge rejected any penalty, finding that the separate filings resulted from &quot;frustration and confusion&quot; in dealing with the IRS.    WHAT'S THE PAY-OFF from a smile and a right answer? the IRS asks itself.    The IRS knows its &quot;customer-relations&quot; people can enhance compliance by providing accurate information in a helpful way. But it's hard to get more money for taxpayer-service functions that don't have a measurable effect on tax revenues; budget reviewers outside the IRS are more inclined to beef up its audit and collection forces. Now, at the urging of the Commissioner's Advisory Group of outside tax experts, the IRS has come up with an estimate.    The IRS believes that its responses to taxpayers who called, wrote, or came in with queries &quot;prevented a potential revenue loss of nearly $1.3 billion in 1986&quot; from taxpayer errors. That is based on data about the questions posed and is seven times the $189 million cost of that part of the IRS's taxpayer-service program, Deputy Commissioner Wedick says.    THE IRA CEILING also falls on commissions paid to insurance agents.    In Revenue Ruling 86-142, the IRS held that a payment to an individual retirement account to cover broker commissions is part of the annual contribution, which is limited to $2,000; such payments aren't deductible separately as administrative fees. The IRS didn't mention other commissions; so David J. Fayram of Madison, Wis., an independent agent for insurers, sent the IRS a query. He sells insurance contracts and annuities that are used as IRAs; for some, he charges his customers commissions.    Now the IRS has replied that Fayram's customers must treat the commissions paid to him as part of their IRA contributions and subject to the $2,000 limit. They may not deduct the commissions as business expenses or as costs of producing income. The insurers, as IRA sponsors, must include the commissions when reporting the IRA contributions on Form 5498 to the IRS.    Payments exceeding the annual ceiling could subject an IRA owner to the penalty for excess contributions.    PRODUCTS IMPORTED by a U.S. concern from a related foreign company may not be valued higher for U.S. inventory than for U.S. customs duties, under the 1986 tax act. That's to keep companies from using low costs for customs and high ones for taxable profit. Proposed IRS rules now explain how the new law is to be applied.    PAID OR PADDED? Insurance agent John A. Farrer of Virginia Beach, Va., in four years spent $48,000 on 1,100 business meals, according to his log books. But duplicate and otherwise suspicious receipts made the logs unreliable, the Tax Court found. It denied all his deductions.    BEREAVED OF LEAVE, maybe. But James P. and Yvonne H. Stuart of Santa Rosa, Calif., may not deduct $1,430 for lost vacation time that she used in pressing their Tax Court case, the court ruled.    JOBS CREDITS for a 1986 hiatus are lost to concerns lacking documentation.    The targeted jobs credit for employers that hire the disadvantaged expired for workers who began work after 1985; but the tax act signed Oct. 22, 1986, revived the program for 1986 through 1988. During the hiatus, state agencies stopped certifying eligible workers; only employers hopeful of renewal continued to apply for certifications. Now IRS Revenue Ruling 87-94 tells how to determine which employees hired during the hiatus count for credits.    Anyone hired from Jan. 1 through Oct. 21, 1986, is eligible only if the employer got certification or sought it in writing by the date the employee began work; the date is extended five days for a worker who had preliminary approval. Employers must prove requests were filed in time. Acceptable evidence includes a postmarked original request, a dated mailing certificate, a copy of a document with an agency date stamp, or an agency receipt or logbook entry.    The new law doesn't permit retroactive certifications.    BRIEFS: A House Ways and Means panel plans a hearing Oct. 6 on the tax treatment of television ministries; among those invited to testify: the Revs. Jim Bakker and Jerry Falwell. . . . The Treasury's new Office of Depreciation Analysis has begun to review the useful lives of depreciable assets for taxes. . . . Chief Counsel Nelson led a five-person IRS team called &quot;Taxation Without Hesitation&quot; in a three-mile run for charity yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
