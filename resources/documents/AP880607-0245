A carpet of algae spread in recent weeks along the Norwegian andSwedish coasts, killing farm trout and salmon worth millions ofdollars and causing unknown damage to wild fish. An epidemic of aherpes virus has killed hundreds of seals in Danish and Germanwaters this spring.   Pollution from farms, sewers and industry was suspected in bothcases.   About 175 delegates from Sweden, the Soviet Union, Finland,Poland, West Germany, East Germany, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlandsand Britain were attending the three-day meeting, said spokesmanTorsten Wikstrom.   The timing of the conference, coinciding with the algae plague,``was not meant that way,'' said Wikstrom. But he said the algae wasa main topic on the first day of talks.   Farmers from all countries represented have been blamed for heavyuse of fertilizers, which eventually find their way to the seas, andsome municipal governments will face costly outlays for bettersewage treatment if the seas are to be cleaned up.   Harald Velner, executive secretary of the Helsinki Commission,singled out the Soviet Union and Poland as major polluters. ButWikstrom said the meeting has mostly been free of recriminations.   The delegates included local, regional and national politiciansas well as marine experts</TEXT></DOC>
