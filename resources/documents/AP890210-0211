The proposal has been the subject of intense debate since theFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front made it on Jan. 24.   The rebels offered to take part in elections if voting waspostponed from March 19 until September. It represented a dramaticturnaround. The rebels had boycotted and condemned as a sham fiveprevious national elections this decade.   The leftist rebels have been fighting since 1980 to overthrow theU.S.-backed government.   The government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte initiallydismissed the rebel overture as insincere, then retreated somewhatand left resolution of the matter up to political parties running inthe election.   Speaking to journalists Thursday, Duarte criticized thesuggestion that all candidates withdraw so no election could beheld. Some sectors had advanced this as one way to postpone theelection without violating the constitution.   ``We cannot use a subterfuge as a pretext for solution. What mustbe sought is a true peace that will not lead us anew intoconfrontation and war,'' Duarte said.   Col. Emilio Ponce, chief of the joint chiefs of staff, saidrejection of the guerrilla proposal would strengthen Salvadorandemocracy. In a speech to the American-Salvadoran Chamber ofCommerce, Ponce likened the rebel initiative to a man bullying hisway into a poker game with a pistol, his own deck and his own dealer_ ``who deals him a straight flush. Of course he wins.''   He said rejection was advisable even though the government couldbe perceived overseas as intransigent.   On Tuesday, Defense Minister Gen. Carlos Vides Casanova said therebel proposal ``rather than bringing peace ... would aggravateconditions.'' Vides said the armed forces consider the proposal astrategy to foment insurrection.   Representatives of all main political parties have been meetingthroughout the week trying to forge a consensus response to theguerrilla document, with no sign of a breakthrough.   The Marxist-led insurgents said they would participate in theelection and respect its outcome if it were postponed for six monthsand other conditions were met dealing with security and fraudprevention. Meeting the conditions would require constitutionalchanges.   The rebels said on their clandestine radio Wednesday thatresponse has been ``dilatory and irresponsible ... all we have seenare inconsistencies, lack of will and indisposition to consensus.''   The rebels insist that the army be confined to barracks forelection day, the point considered most objectionable by the armedforces.   On Thursday two rebel commanders, Shafik Handal and Roberto Roca,sent a letter to the major political parties saying they werewilling to travel to San Salvador to discuss the election proposalwith legislators.   ``If the Assembly invites them, we (the armed forces) will goalong, even though we don't like it,'' said Ponce.   Sources participating in the politicians' meetings said therightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, remained adamantthat the election should not be postponed.   Arena, which trounced Duarte's Christian Democrats in legislativeand municipal elections last March, is favored to win thepresidential ballot and Arena leaders have said postponement canonly hurt their prospects.</TEXT></DOC>
