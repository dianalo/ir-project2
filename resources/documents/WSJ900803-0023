Emphasizing that the Central Intelligence Agency wasn'tsurprised by the Iraqi action, an agency spokesman saidyesterday, &quot;We provided policy makers with very useful andtimely information on these events and we continue to do so.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Administration and congressional officials agree that theCIA did its job. Since last week, President Bush had beenwarned by intelligence analysts that what originally lookedlike a military bluff was quickly turning into the kind oftroop deployment that could be used to invade Kuwait or evenSaudi Arabia.   Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster evenhand-delivered certain fresh details on the Iraqi buildup toNational Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. Among theassessments he conveyed was a conclusion that, by this week,President Saddam Hussein's force would be capable ofpenetrating Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.
