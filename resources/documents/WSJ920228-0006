Dixon, alreadyserving a five-year prison term for misapplying thrift funds,was indicted on new charges related to private jets allegedlypaid for by defunct Vernon Savings andamp; Loan Association.   The eight-count indictment, returned Wednesday by afederal grand jury here, deals sparingly with the speculativereal estate loans that led to $1 billion in losses at VernonSavings and the thrift's collapse in 1987.</LP><TEXT>   Instead, the indictment charges Mr. Dixon with misapplyingthrift funds in the purchase and lease of jet airplanes by acompany that he is accused of controlling. Stock in thecompany, Coronado Air Inc., was actually in the name ofDallas real estate developer Tommy F. Stone, a Vernonborrower indicted with Mr. Dixon.   The indictment charges Messrs. Dixon and Stone withconspiring to misapply the thrift's funds and charges Mr.Dixon with concealing payments for the jets from Vernon'sdirectors and thrift regulators.   Mr. Dixon's lawyer, Deborah Goodall of Dallas, says shebelieves the new indictment is an attempt by federalprosecutors to lengthen Mr. Dixon's prison sentence.Prosecutors had expected a much longer sentence than the fiveyears he received last April for his conviction on chargesthat he misapplied Vernon funds in buying a California beachhouse.   Mr. Stone's lawyer, William T. Hill Jr., said his clientisn't guilty of the criminal charges and previously settled acivil suit brought by thrift regulators over the $800,000 heborrowed from Vernon to buy stock in Coronado Air.   Both men are expected to plead innocent to the charges ata hearing next Thursday before U.S. District Judge Robert B.Maloney of Dallas.</TEXT></DOC>
