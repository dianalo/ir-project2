<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-43-1020 </DOCNO><TEXT>Failure of insulating systems of thermally high-stressed components (suchas combustion chambers of gas turbines), expressed by spalling of large-sizedareas and the degradation mechanisms underlying such failure are as yetnot fully understood. These questions are, a.o., investigated in theSpecial Research Programme 167 (Highly-stressed combustors - stationarycombustion under uniform pressure). Microstructural investigations ofthe stressed layers are an important means of interpreting such processes.Results obtained via light- and scanning electron microscopy, electronbeam microprobes, and X-ray microstructure investigation are describedin the paper and chemical and physical changes in the microstructureare discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
