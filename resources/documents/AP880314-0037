(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists at Sandia NationalLaboratories have cast aside a popular theory and developed a newmethod to dramatically boost the speed of solving complex problemswith parallel computers, which work on many parts of a problem atthe same time.   ``We have achieved results that most computer scientists thoughtimpossible a couple of years ago,'' said John L. Gustafson, aSandia computer scientist.   Sandia announced Sunday that Gustafson and other scientists atthe lab had broken records for speedups, a measure of the increasedspeed at which a problem can be solved on a multiprocessor parallelcomputer, compared with a single processor from the same system.   Single data processors, like those in home computers, solveproblems one step at a time, in sequence, like balancing acheckbook.   Parallel computers use many processors linked together so theycan share the load, each working on a different piece of a problemat the same time, like a lot of people each doing one page of acheckbook.   The theory applied to parallel processing had predicted speedupsof 50 to 100 times. But the Sandia scientists achieved speedups ofmore than 1,000 times.   Edwin Barsis, director of computer sciences and mathematics atSandia, said in an interview that large-scale parallel computingcould be used in such areas as defense work, weather forecasting orsolving large economic problems.   Barsis said the Sandia scientists basically ignored a popularbelief in computer circles based on a speedup theory dubbedAmdahl's Law.   Amdahl's Law says that no matter how many processors might belinked in parallel, the problem-solving speed could be increased atmost by 50 to 100 times that of a single processor because theincrease would be limited by the small portion of any computerprogram that cannot be chopped up and run in parallel.   Sandia scientists decided to jump ahead and work with 1,000 ormore processors at the same time. ``After you think about it for awhile, you think it's obvious,'' Barsis said.   ``The idea is that you have to get all the processors to worktogether,'' Barsis said. ``You have to make it so they don't getbogged down in communication (with each other) rather thancomputing.''   Specialists in the field said Sandia's findings appeared verysignificant.   ``All the speedups sound very, very good for me. They sound verysignificant,'' Anoop Gupta, professor of computer science atStanford University, said in a telephone interview Friday. ``But Iwould have to know more details. On the whole, however, they soundvery good.''   ``We think it's a very exciting result,'' Bill Gear, head of thedepartment of computer science at the University of Illinois, saidSaturday.   Gear is president of the Society for Industrial and AppliedMathematics and managing editor of the SIAM Journal of Scientificand Statistical Computing.   He read the Sandia paper on the breakthrough, submitted forpublication in the journal, last week. ``Normally, from the time it(a paper) comes in until it appears in print, it may be twoyears,'' he said. ``We're going to try to publish it in July.''   The Sandia scientists developed mathematical and computationalmethods, or algorithms, tailored to handle large scientificproblems.   The problems were worked out on a parallel supercomputer calledan NCUBE-ten, made by NCUBE Corp. of Beaverton, Ore.   Sandia has the only NCUBE-ten, which uses 1,024 processors. Itis less than 3 feet on a side but is the largest computer in theworld in numbers of processors operating in parallel and in the 7.7billion bytes, or characters, it can move per second, Sandiaofficials said.   Gustafson, along with fellow Sandia scientists Robert Benner,Gary Montry and David Womble, achieved speedups of 1,020, 1,019 and1,011 on three full-scale scientific application problems, theofficials said.   ``We have come almost all the way to the theoretical limit for a1,024-processor machine,'' Benner said.</TEXT></DOC>
