(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   One of two Tuscarora Indians acquitted ofcharges stemming from their armed takeover of a newspaper calledthe verdict ``historic,'' but the prosecutor said he feels sorryfor the hostages they took.   Eddie Hatcher, 31, and Timothy Jacobs, 20, were found innocentFriday of all charges related to the February takeover in whichthey held hostages for 10 hours at the office of The Robesonian.   The jury agreed with defense lawyers' contention that the twomen had no criminal intent when they took over the building to drawattention to alleged official corruption, racism and drugtrafficking in Robeson County in southeastern North Carolina. Thecounty is one-third Indian, one-third black and one-third white.   Hatcher and Jacobs faced charges of making and possessingillegal firearms, conspiring to make those weapons and conveyingfalse information about explosives. A federal charge ofhostage-taking was dismissed earlier this week against Jacobs, butremained against Hatcher.   ``The jury has made what is going to be a historic verdict, averdict that people will remember,'' Hatcher said while leaving thecourthouse after the three-week trial. ``I don't think peoplerealize yet how important this verdict is.''   One white juror, Patience Brannock, hugged Hatcher in thehallway, saying ``God bless you. ... You're a good boy.''   However, one of the hostages, Robesonian Editor Bob Horne, saidthe verdict sent the wrong message.   ``It seems to me the message is, if you have a grievance, totake hostages, put them in fear for their lives and say you did itfor your own protection because you feared for your life,'' Hornesaid.   ``Does that say that Timothy Jacobs' and Eddie Hatcher's fearcounts more than the fear of the people they held hostage thatday?'' he asked. ``I saw terror that morning like I have never seenbefore and hope I never see again.''   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Bruce, who prosecuted the case,said the verdict was ``a failure of advocacy on my part'' and addedthat he felt particularly sorry for those taken hostage.   ``Anyone who was here in the first part of the trial to heartheir testimony knows they were in real terror. I feel that I havelet them down,'' he said.   Hatcher and Jacobs never denied walking into The Robesonianoffice Feb. 1, chaining the door shut and brandishing sawed-offshotguns. They held as many as 20 people during the siege, in whichno one was injured.   They surrendered after they were told the governor had agreed toset up a task force to investigate their allegations.   During closing arguments Thursday, defense lawyers said Hatcherand Jacobs had not staged the takeover ``with malice.''   That argument was ``the deciding factor in the whole case,'' oneunidentified juror told the News and Observer of Raleigh. ``I feelit was fair based on the interpretation of the law.''   There were no jury room arguments or heated discussions duringdeliberations, said juror Sarah Thompson of Raleigh.   ``We focused on (the no-malice argument) right there because wehad told ourselves not to let our feelings into it,'' Ms. Thompsonsaid.   The panel of nine blacks and three whites took 6{ hours toreturn the verdicts.   If convicted, Hatcher could have faced life in prison and Jacobscould have faced 40 years in prison.   ``I'm just glad that Timothy and Eddie did something to drawattention to the conditions in our county,'' said Eleanor Jacobs,Jacobs' mother. ``I hate they used guns. But they did bringattention to something that was needed. The jury had compassion.They understood things.''   Robeson District Attorney Joe Freeman Britt, one of theofficials Hatcher and Jacobs criticized for allegedly failing torepresent poor people in the county, said Friday he ``has begunexploratory work'' to determine whether to pursue state charges.   Jacobs said he was uneasy about returning to Robeson County.   ``I'm afraid,'' Jacobs said. ``But it's my home, and where myfamily is, so I am going.''   ``I'm not afraid,'' said Hatcher, who represented himself duringthe trial because his lawyer, William Kunstler, was involved in aNew York trial. ``I'm going home.''</TEXT></DOC>
