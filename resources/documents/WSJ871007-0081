Nobody left the party in a huff, however. Max is a golden retriever. He carried his guests -- including two teddy bears -- to his party in his mouth and devoured the whole &quot;cake&quot; made of Gaines Burgers.    Max is just another party animal here at the Shady Spring Boarding Kennels andamp; Camp for Dogs. This 250-dog kennel, situated on 17 rural acres between Baltimore and Washington, is profiting handsomely from pet owners' guilt at leaving their animals behind while they travel. Dogs here eat their favorite foods, and some bring their own beds. They have a busy social calendar that includes such planned activities as swimming, hiking and following scents in the woods.    Not every dog loves to go to camp. Margaret Bunnen sends her German short-haired pointer to Shady Spring but says he is always happy to come home. She figures the camp is really much like other kennels but says, &quot;Psychologically, it works wonderfully for yuppies who have more money than sense.&quot;    Other kennels are also going upscale. At Kennelwood Village near St. Louis, camp counselors dressed in uniforms feed the animals tidbits at &quot;wiener roasts.&quot; At Holiday Pet hotel in Encinitas, Calif., cats have a choice of four elaborate rooms including the Hawaii suite, where they can play with plastic birds.    When Shady Spring began its activities program in 1981, barely 25% of the dogs signed up for hiking or camping (a category that includes Frisbee catching). But the figure now is 75%. The kennel is owned by Charlotte Katz, a sociologist by training, and Donald Farb, formerly a wastedisposal expert with the Environmental Protection Agency.    &quot;We get a lot of two-income couples for whom the dog is a surrogate kid,&quot; Ms. Katz says.    Room and board cost $9.50 to $11.50 a day depending on a dog's size, but there are extra fees such as $2 for a hike and $4 for a 30-minute camping trip. Many dogs arrive at camp with knapsacks. Madison Rayford, a yellow Labrador retriever, has toys in a nylon duffel bag. When they leave, campers get report cards and Polaroid snapshots of themselves.    Some dogs come to camp with demands. Princess turns up with a note saying she expects dinner at 5 p.m. sharp and &quot;two little sausages&quot; in the morning. The dogs generally are fed what they eat at home.    At mail call, the staff reads aloud the letters addressed to the dogs. Mary and Philip Robertson have sent a postcard from Italy to their three Shih Tzus. &quot;Dear Nanky-Poo, Yum-Yum and Tu Ling,&quot; the card says, &quot;We are having a splendid time, but as always, miss you guys.&quot; (Some clients telephone to talk to their dogs, but Ms. Katz jokingly tells them that the pets are &quot;on another line.&quot;)    Outside the kennel, barking fills the air as Ms. Katz speaks warmly of &quot;the human-animal bond.&quot; For instance, a card on the bulletin board to &quot;Maggie&quot; from &quot;Mom and Dad&quot; says, &quot;We miss you. We are having fun at this camp. Hope you are having fun at yours.&quot;    Dogs prone to homesickness get special care. One dog, Jason, arrived with a note saying he is afraid of thunder. Ms. Katz says, &quot;We go out and hold a lot of paws during storms.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
