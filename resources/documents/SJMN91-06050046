I don't know if you have anathletic commission there, but it's a farce.&quot;;    Only one oddsmaker haslisted the fight. Jimmy Vacarro, operator of the sports book at the Mirage,listed Morrison as a 50-1 favorite, but said &quot;not a penny&quot; had been bet on thematch as of Sunday night.;    &quot;He will be a betting draw once the odds getcompetitive and he fights someone who is competitive,&quot; Vacarro said.;    Hmmm.Shades of George Foreman on his comeback trail.;    Keep it up, Tommy. You'llprobably wind up keeping your record perfect and getting a big-bucks shot atthe champ.;  Look, Vin, no socks; Ah, that California feeling.;    DarrylStrawberry -- that's him, without the socks -- was greeted by Dodgersannouncer Vin Scully last week at Los Angeles' Crenshaw High School,Strawberry's alma matter.;    Why the salute, you ask?;    For those of youwho have been asleep since last baseball season ended, Strawberry has comehome to L.A. after eight seasons with the New York Mets. During the early partof the off-season, he and the Dodgers agreed to a five-year deal worth $4.05million a year.;    Now that the background information is wrapped up, let'sget to the interesting stuff -- Strawberry's appearance.;    Survey says . . .we like it. The sock-less appearance shows that Darryl wasn't brainwashed inNew York; thank goodness. He managed to keep his California feel.;    Whatabout when the weather in L.A. gets cold, though, Darryl? That big contractcould buy a lot of footwear.;    For the record, on his lap is his daughter --2-year-old Diamond.;    We can't tell if she's following in her father'sfootwear.;  Who's keeping score?; Gentlemen, where's your bowlers' etiquette?;   Orange County Register horse-racing writer Larry Bortstein filed a batteryreport against jockey Gary Stevens on Saturday night after the two wereinvolved in a scuffle at a bowling alley near Santa Anita racetrack inArcadia, police said.;    And they weren't arguing about strikes and spares orthe electronic scorekeeper.;    Witnesses at the bowling alley said the twowere talking about Stevens' loss to Craig Perret in Eclipse Award ballotingfor top jockey. Stevens apparently was angry that Bortstein had beenexpressing sympathy for him despite voting for Perret.;    The witnesses saidBortstein, 48, wound up on the floor with his shirt torn, his glasses knockedoff and cuts under his left eye and ear.;    &quot;It was nothing, really,&quot; Stevenssaid, calling the incident &quot;a misunderstanding.&quot; He wouldn't comment further.Bortstein wouldn't discuss it for print.;    Both were taking part in a weeklySanta Anita bowling league.;    Trainer Mike Puhich, a friend of Stevens',described the scuffle as &quot;pushing and shoving,&quot; and added with a laugh: &quot;Thatwas nothing compared to some of the racetrack (bowling) leagues I've been in.That was a mellow night.&quot;;  'Manute Bol is so skinny he doesn't travel withthe team any more. They just fax him to the next city.
