Object-oriented datamodels with project-management features have been proposed as an alternative.The Distributed Hypothetical Storage System is intended to serve as theunderlying storage mechanism for an object-oriented data model. The storagesystem provides feature that are essential to project management suchas version histories, alternate data versions, and optimistic concurrencycontrol in a distributed environment. This thesis presents a robustnessmechanism for DHSS. Three classes of system failure are considered: sitefailure, communication failure, and media failure. The protocols describeshere make the system robust in two senses: first, users are providedwith continued read access to their data; and second, users are providedwith continued write access to their data. The traditional approach ofdata replication is used to support continued-read access. However, traditionalsystems support no write access or highly restricted write access inthe event of a failure. The DHSS robustness mechanism supports continuedwrite access for all visible data by allowing the execution of possiblyconflicting write requests and attempting to merge or resolve the resultsat a later time if they are indeed conflicting.</TEXT></DOC>
