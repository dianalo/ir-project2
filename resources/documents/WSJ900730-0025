But in his nearly seven years on the New Hampshire SupremeCourt, Judge Souter -- President Bush's U.S. Supreme Courtnominee -- had little or no experience with some of the majorbusiness issues being raised at the state level: regulationof securities, antitrust enforcement, and limits on punitivedamage awards.</LP><TEXT>   Many of the business-related rulings among Judge Souter's221 New Hampshire Supreme Court decisions involve disputes ofa type that are rarely if ever decided by the U.S. SupremeCourt. Many involve disputes over contracts, local taxassessments and zoning. A handful of his rulings written forthe five-member court, however, shed some light on hisapproach.   One apparent theme is an unwillingness to create theoriesof liability for businesses or to recognize new rights to suefor damages.   In a 1986 decision written by Judge Souter, the courtrefused to impose the toughest standard of liability on alocal developer in Grantham, N.H., for contaminating the landand groundwater of a homeowner with gasoline and grease thatleaked from a storage tank. The homeowner argued that thedeveloper's action was so hazardous that the developer shouldbe liable even if there wasn't any evidence of negligence.But Judge Souter rejected the argument as imposing too tougha standard.   And in a medical malpractice decision in 1987, JudgeSouter threw out a lawsuit against a hospital in Dover, N.H.The lawsuit, filed by a woman who suffered nerve damage inher arm when a blood sample was taken, charged that thehospital failed to train the technician properly or toprovide a proper chair for the patient. Judge Souter said thepatient didn't prove any fault by the hospital.   Bruce Fein, a Washington lawyer and conservativecolumnist, says these and other cases show a reluctance byJudge Souter to impose liability based on what Mr. Fein calls&quot;some avant-garde, or stretching, theory of law.&quot; But, Mr.Fein says, Judge Souter's record is too thin &quot;to reach anyconclusions about a pronounced approach in the area ofbusiness law.&quot;   Robert Viles, dean of Franklin Pierce Law Center inConcord, N.H., agrees there isn't much evidence from which toevaluate the record. But on business cases, he says, JudgeSouter &quot;has his own mind and sometimes applies it to come upwith a rather unusual analysis of the law.&quot;   Judge Souter doesn't shy away from finding violations ofthe constitution -- the state constitution, that is -- but heis loathe to find new constitutional rights. In 1985, heruled that the state's meal tax was unconstitutional becauseoperators of vending machines that sold candy and soda wererequired to pay the tax, while proprietors of supermarketswho sold the same items on their shelves were exempt.   But in a 1986 case, Judge Souter ruled that a group ofhomeowners in Conway, N.H., didn't have the right to sue fordamages over alleged discrimination in violation of the stateconstitution. The homeowners alleged that local officialsrefused to build roads for them, in part because they wereonly seasonal residents. Allowing the lawsuit, Judge Souterwrote, &quot;would inevitably lead to the conversion of every roaddispute into a constitutional . . . action.&quot;   The 50-year-old Judge Souter's business decisionsoccasionally display a bit of a conservative judicialphilosophy -- one that sees a limited role for the courts.When the court in 1985 struck down a contract that Laconia,N.H., had awarded after receiving bids, Judge Souter wrote alone dissent. The court, he noted, concluded that the rulingmight benefit the city by improving the bidding system. &quot;Ican only say that the public has the power to obtain thatbenefit by statute or city ordinance,&quot; he wrote.   In numerous decisions, Judge Souter's opinions called fordeference to state regulatory agencies or governmentofficials responsible for making decisions. One example was a1985 ruling upholding the state utility commission's settingof tolls for a privately owned bridge across the ConnecticutRiver between Charlestown, N.H., and Springfield, Vt.   And his decisions contain some discussion of the role ofprecedent. In a 1987 dissent, he chastised the court forabandoning a state banking law precedent in a 3-2 vote inwhich one lower court judge temporarily took the place of oneof the justices who had been disqualified from the case. Hedisagreed with the ruling and questioned its value as aprecedent because it had the support of only two justices.   As with other aspects of Judge Souter's record, however,there may be more uncertainties than answers. Alan Slobodinof the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservativepublic-interest firm, says he viewed retiring Justice WilliamBrennan as an ally in ruling that the First Amendmentprotects advertising and other &quot;commercial&quot; speech and inexpressing concerns about too much jury discretion inawarding punitive damages. &quot;Brennan was a very important votefor us on those issues, and we don't know about Souter,&quot; hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
