SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney sharplycriticized an administration decision to allow the sale of personalcomputers to Soviet bloc nations Wednesday, contending it gives themcomputers ``with military applications.''   Cheney sought out reporters to make a statement about the matter,intent on clarifying a Washington Post story that he had been``persuaded'' by Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher to support thedecision.   ``I do not support that decision,'' Cheney said, appearingclearly irritated.   The secretary said he opposed the move because it would give theSoviets ``significant capabilities they do not now possess.''   Cheney's comments revealed the fierce debate waged insidePresident Bush's Cabinet over the decision, which marks a majorshift in policy from the previous administration.   Conservative members of that administration had sought to retaintight control of high-tech exports to the Soviets, but thisadministration's shift appears to have been influenced by the moreopen attitude between the superpowers fostered by Soviet PresidentMikhail Gorbachev.   Mosbacher, in a statement released Tuesday, argued that Bush'strip to Poland and Hungary had ``paved the way for expanding tradein areas that improve prospects for prosperity in Eastern Europewithout harming America's national security.   ``Eliminating export controls on AT-compatible personal computersis one way to meet this objective,'' he said. ``Consistent with thespirit of the president's initiatives, we are creating newopportunities for U.S. manufacturers to sell more widely abroad.''   Mosbacher said the administration had decided to lift controls onsuch commonly used desktop models as the IBM PS@2 and AT modelsbecause they were easily obtainable in 11 countries, includingEastern Europe.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, told of Cheney'scriticism, said Bush was not informed in advance about the decisionbut does support it.   The Commerce Department said the administration will propose tothe 17-nation Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls(COCOM) that export restrictions be lifted against the Soviet blocnations.   The restrictions are based on multilateral agreements, but theallies generally follow the United States lead in these matters.   The COCOM committee, based in Paris, consists of Australia,Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece,Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain,Turkey and the United States.   The committee is scheduled to take up the question this week.   Although restrictions will remain on some sophisticated computersand the portable ``laptop'' computers, Cheney said would prefer thatexports be permitted for only ``a lower level of technology.''   ``My concern is that it will give them a computer capability thathas military applications. That should be avoided,'' the secretarysaid.   He said he disagreed with allowing the East bloc to obtaincomputers with a higher data processing rate and storage capacity.   ``The reason we have the COCOM is to make sure you don't transfermilitarily sensitive or significant information or tech, and myconcern is that I'm not satisfied that we are protecting thattechnology under that decsion,'' Cheney said.   The Commerce Department said there were about 6 millionAT-compatible desk top personal computers sold worldwide by U.S.companies in 1988. Of those, 2.7 million valued at than $1 billionwere sold outside the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
