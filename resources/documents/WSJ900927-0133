But when Iraq's President SaddamHussein threatened last Sunday to attack Israel if economicsanctions &quot;strangle&quot; Iraq, Israeli politicians and soldiershere redoubled their efforts to prepare.   The stepped-up pace is readily apparent in the GolanHeights, the closest point to Iraq's forces. Any Iraqimissile or aircraft intended to strike Israel would likelyfly overhead. And any attack by ground forces would involvethe thousands of Israeli troops here. &quot;We have to be readyfor anything,&quot; says an Israeli lieutenant colonel, pointingto the area on a map. &quot;We are doing everything we wouldnormally be doing, but more of it.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Israeli armored patrol vehicles zoom by in a non-stopstream. The crews are beefing up the Israeli tank andartillery bases that dot the Golan Heights like gas stationsalong a U.S. highway. Across the valley that forms theno-man's land, Syrian military activity, possibly involvingunits that could be sent to bolster the Gulf multinationalforce, is picking up as well.   Military installations across Israel are increasing theiralready-heightened level of alert based on Saddam Hussein'slatest threats. &quot;After several weeks of quiet, his latestthreat was somewhat different. It got our attention,&quot; says anIsraeli military officer. Previously, Saddam Husseinthreatened to strike only if Iraq were attacked. In response,Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told Israel'sParliament: &quot;We are preparing to forestall the threat,prevent it (and if he does attack) to retaliate.&quot;   Israeli officials confirm an increase in the number ofsorties flown by Israel's first line of defense, its F-15 andF-16 fighter jets, since the Gulf crisis began. The air forcecontinues to bolster resources needed to fend off an Iraqiair strike. Israel also has deployed an unspecified number ofits Hawk surface-to-air missile batteries along the Jordanianborder.   Groups from the Israeli Defense Force's 55,000 air forcereservists have been called up to help augment the militarybuildup. And Defense Ministry officials have warned that theadditional use of fuel, engines and resources is going to addroughly $500 million, or roughly 10%, to Israel's annualmilitary budget, analysts say. That is already translatinginto calls for more U.S. military aid.   The Israelis have put military deployment off-limits toforeign reporters recently, as they try to keep a lowprofile. Israel and the U.S. think everyone's best interestsare served if Israel lies low.   Says Avi Pazner, adviser to Prime Minister Shamir: &quot;We aretrying to stay out of this. It isn't a conflict with us, butSaddam Hussein will try to do anything in order to drag usin. We have to be prepared for the worst, but not do anythingto bring it about.&quot;   In coming weeks, it is likely to become clearer thatIsrael faces a dilemma as it assesses its strategic options.Because it doesn't want to anger the Arabs and jeopardize itsrelations with America, it has limited military alternativesto forestall Iraqi threats. However, Israel also realizesthat the deployment of the multinational force in the Gulfoffers an unprecedented opportunity to remove its current No.1 enemy: Saddam Hussein.   &quot;Anything short of a major attempt to dismantle thatmonster will leave the entire region, not just us, with amajor problem,&quot; says Joseph Alpher, deputy director of theJaffee Center for Stategic Studies at Tel Aviv University.&quot;Otherwise, we are sitting with a ticking time bomb.&quot;   And Israel may be tempted to strike first against SaddamHussein if months from now the Gulf crisis appears to beheaded toward a resolution that would leave Iraq's forcesintact and few U.S. troops around. Israel proved with itsattack on an Iraqi nuclear installation in 1981 that isprepared to strike first to avoid a threat later. &quot;The betswould be off if they (the multinational force) went home,&quot;says Mr. Alpher.   Israeli military officials and analysts are concerned bythe threat of Iraq's missiles, but say these missiles poseonly a moderate threat. In order to reach Israel,conventional warheads would have to weigh one ton or less --enough to damage an office building, but not destroy it. Evenif the missiles have chemical warheads, Israeli officialsseem to think the damage could be limited to no more than athousand casualties.   &quot;There is a limited military risk&quot; from a missile attackbut a huge strategic risk that such a move would embroilIsrael in a shooting war, says Gerald M. Steinberg, astrategic specialist at Israel's Bar Ilan University. Mr.Steinberg says the Israelis hope America's Desert Shield willextend to Israel; a U.S. interception of an Iraqi attackcould keep Israel out of the conflict.   Some Israeli military officials believe the U.S. wouldknow about a possible Iraqi attack even before Israel. Iraq'sliquidfueled rockets, which require as long as 24 hours toprepare before launch, could be detected by U.S. spysatellites and eliminated before they are fired.</TEXT></DOC>
