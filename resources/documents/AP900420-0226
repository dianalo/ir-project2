The British owner of Maple Leaf Mills, Canada's biggest flourmiller, announced the plan for its subsidiary to join forces withwhat is the country's largest public food-processing company.   Hillsdown Holdings PLC will have a 56 percent stake in thecombined company under the proposed transaction which must beapproved by both companies' stockholders. Their boards of directorsback the proposal and are recommending that shareholders endorse it.   The merger must be approved by Canadian regulators.   ``The combination of these two businesses creates a powerful newforce in the North American food industry,'' said Harry Solomon,chairman of Hillsdown. ``The size, scope and resources of thecombined company enables it to take full advantage of theopportunities of the Canada-U.S. free-trade agreement.''   Maple Leaf Mills, which was taken over by Hillsdown in August1987, sells baked goods and poultry. Its brand name productsinclude Monarch flour and Dempster's bread.   Canada Packers sells about $3 billion worth of food productseach year, which include the brand names York, Maple Leaf andTenderflake. It has been on the auction block since last October.   The new company will have combined sales of $4 billion and willbe the largest publicly traded food-processing company in Canadaand one of the largest in North America, Hillsdown said in a newsrelease.   Under the deal, Hillsdown will exchange its entire interest inMaple Leaf Mills for approximately 29.5 million newly-issued CanadaPackers shares. That's equivalent to a 45-per-cent holding in thenew company.   In addition, Hillsdown wants to buy $119 million worth of CanadaPackers shares at $16.50 per share to boost its holding in the newcompany to a majority share of 56 per cent.   Canada Packers shares ended trading on the Toronto StockExchange on Thursday at $13.25, down 38 cents on the day.   The shares had soared to more than $20 after the companyannounced it was up for sale last year but then sagged when nooffers for the company appeared. Analysts suggested the poor profitof Canada Packers' meat division was discouraging potential buyers.   The family of William McLean and their associates, who togetherown 29 per cent of Canada Packers, have agreed to tender theirshares to the offer, Hillsdown said.   Canada Packers employs about 12,000 people, while Maple LeafMills employs 4,000. There was no immediate indication whether jobswould be lost.</TEXT></DOC>
