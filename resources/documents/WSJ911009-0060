Why? Lawyers aregreedy. Americans like a good fight. Litigants are pursuing arisk-free society.   Still, rare is the writer who can make a case for reiningin lawyers that is fair, important and original. Such isPeter W. Huber, author of &quot;Galileo's Revenge: Junk Science inthe Courtroom,&quot; (Basic, 274 pages, $23). The worst part ofthe book is the title, catchy enough but with littlerelevance. For no one would be more horrified than poorGalileo himself at how some American lawyers have bastardizedscience to make a buck.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Huber's indictment of the system as a whole falls onjudges who bear ultimate responsibility for what takes placein their courtrooms, but it comes down more directly on&quot;expert&quot; witnesses and personal injury attorneys. For theright price, he writes, an expert witness will blame anyinjury on any deep pocket. Says one criminal and personalinjury lawyer: &quot;You get a professor who earns $60,000 a yearand give him the opportunity to make a couple of hundredthousand dollars in his spare time and he will jump at thechance.&quot; Adds the lawyer, &quot;They are like a bunch of hookersin June.&quot;   Some even operate out of bordellos of sorts. The MedicalLegal Consulting Service of Rockville, Md., promises lawyers:&quot;If the first doctor we refer doesn't agree with your legaltheory, we will provide you with the name of a second.&quot;   Yet there would be no prostitution without a steady supplyof Johns. &quot;Galileo's Revenge&quot; is replete with horror storiesof products and defendants hounded, sometimes into oblivion,by unscrupulous attorneys with dreams of dollar-coated sugarplums dancing in their heads.   One example is that of Bendectin, a drug used since 1956to prevent morning sickness during pregnancy. In October1979, the National Enquirer, apparently prompted by thenotorious litigator Melvin Belli, broke the story of &quot;whatcould be far larger than the thalidomide horror,&quot; of &quot;untoldthousands of babies&quot; born &quot;with hideous birth defects.&quot;   Providing the &quot;scientific&quot; basis for the allegationsagainst Bendectin were two obscure scientists who would againfall back into obscurity, though not before collecting hugeexpert-witness fees. In the worst incident in this feedingfrenzy, a jury would award $95 million to the family of analleged Bendectin victim (a decision later reversed), and thedrug's manufacturer, Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc., wouldagree to a $120 million class action settlement that wasvoided only because greedy plaintiffs' attorneys thought theycould make more on a case-by-case basis.   In the end, true science may catch up with junk science,in part because the professional colleagues of one of the twoscientists has revealed that his work in that area wasfraudulent. But Merrell Dow, tiring of the bad publicity andattorneys' fees of upward of $100 million, has taken theexpedient route and dropped the drug. It still faces legalaction: Just this week, a court awarded $34 million to theparents of a girl born with birth defects after her mothertook Bendectin. The Journal of the American MedicalAssociation, meanwhile, has reported a doubling ofhospitalizations due to morning sickness and concluded thatas a result of the abandonment of the drug, &quot;Birth defectsmay well increase.&quot;   While some may view such problems as simply part of theprice of doing business, the ultimate victim, Mr. Hubernotes, is the consumer. &quot;Junk science verdicts raise prices,lower production, and deter consumption,&quot; he writes.   One defense of product liability litigation is that itserves as a deterrent to unscrupulous or careless businessesby punishing them for malfeasance. But, as Mr. Huber pointsout, the path-breaking scientific work in areas where therereally were problems (occupational exposure to asbestos, theDalkon Shield intrauterine device and the Ford Pinto, forinstance), litigation began years after the problem wasdiscovered and after corrective steps were taken.   What should be done? For one thing, Mr. Huber says, courtsshould apply to witnesses the same standards applied todefendants. &quot;If people who really design cars or deliverbabies are to be judged by professional standards in court,those who accuse them must be held to similar account.&quot;   But how? Mr. Huber notes that in modern times, &quot;science inthe West has been built up through collegiality andconsensus,&quot; and then makes the questionable suggestion thatpeer-reviewed medical and science journals may serve thispurpose. But, as with science in general, the medical andscience journals, including the most prestigious, are beingsteadily politicized. At the current rate of decay, thesejournals may be, in a few years' time, almost as much a havenfor junk science as are American courtrooms today.   Still, his suggestion that American judges beginconsulting their own experts, as they are allowed to do andas European judges routinely do, is certainly a realistic,effective counter to those who would solicit those Junehookers.   ---   Mr. Fumento is an attorney and journalist who specializesin science issues.</TEXT></DOC>
