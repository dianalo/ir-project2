As American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. solidified itsleading position in the market in 1991, No. 2 carrier MCICommunications Corp. and No. 3 US Sprint Communications Co.began new campaigns to woo residential and small-businesscustomers -- expensive efforts that won't yield significantprofits this year, analysts say. Sprint is a unit of UnitedTelecommunications Inc., Westwood, Kan. ATandamp;T is based in NewYork, and MCI is based in Washington.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Carriers backed off on sales and marketing in the fourthquarter because revenues were so anemic,&quot; says Robert B.Morris III, a telecommunications analyst at Goldman, Sachs andamp;Co. He says fourth-quarter revenue problems weren't helped byDecember's mid-week Christmas and New Year's Eve holidays,which led many people to take two weeks off and causedbusiness communications traffic to fall off sharply. Now&quot;we'll see that {sales and marketing} spending take off thisquarter {particularly} at MCI and Sprint,&quot; he says. &quot;ATandamp;Twill follow suit.&quot;   Jack B. Grubman, a telecommunications analyst atPaineWebber Inc. says the primary problem for carriers is therecession, which has slowed industry traffic volume growth to5% to 6% from almost double digits two years ago. &quot;I don'texpect that to pick up in the first quarter,&quot; he says.   Price cutting, always welcomed by customers, is alsohampering carrier profits. The three leading carriers haveannounced new residential and small-business services &quot;thatamount to one big price cut,&quot; Mr. Morris says. In addition,corporate users, which have seen domestic rates fall morethan 40%, stand to see prices drop further on internationalrates.   Currently pricing on international calls is set accordingto &quot;settlement rates&quot; agreed to by domestic carriers,including ATandamp;T, and foreign telecommunications authorities.ATandamp;T and the Federal Communications Commission have beenstruggling to convince their foreign counterparts to lowersettlement rates and balance the pricing of calls to and fromthe U.S. Their efforts are critical: The U.S. ran a $2.8billion trade deficit on international calls in 1990 and &quot;weexpect the 1991 numbers may worsen by as much as 20% whenthey're finally tabulated,&quot; says James Spurlock, specialassistant to the FCC's common carrier bureau chief.   Things may be quite different this year, however. For onething, &quot;the international scene will become increasinglyintense,&quot; says Mr. Morris. &quot;You're starting to see thebreaking down of the U.S. oligopoly of ATandamp;T, MCI and Sprintas new foreign entrants such as BT {BritishTelecommunications PLC}, Cable andamp; Wireless {PLC} and otherscome into the {U.S.} market.&quot; As a counterattack, ATandamp;T hadbeen negotiating to take a stake in Candamp;W's highly profitableMercury Communications, which offers alternative networkservices to business customers in Britain. But those talksbroke off earlier this month, according to individuals closeto the negotiations.   In addition, some foreign countries are beginning to yieldto U.S. pressure to trim their rates. Says the FCC's Mr.Spurlock: &quot;We are cautiously optimistic that rates willimprove this year.&quot; For example, a three-minute call fromSweden to the U.S. that used to carry a $5.28 settlement ratein 1985, now costs $2.16. Similarly, Singapore has droppedits rate to $3 from $7.50 seven years ago.   Rates aren't coming down everywhere, however. &quot;The pricingpicture is very good&quot; for the carriers in a few businessmarkets where rates are beginning to firm, says GregorySawers, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein andamp; Co., New York. ATandamp;Tand MCI have increased pricing on offerings such as toll-free800 numbers and special voice and data services, setting thestage for improved margins.   Still, analysts have cut their estimates on MCI and arealso eying Sprint skeptically. Mr. Morris two weeks ago cuthis 1992 estimate on MCI to $2.20 to $2.30 per share from$2.40 to $2.50. For the first quarter Mr. Morris has MCIearning 53 cents to 55 cents, down from his earlierprediction of 58 cents to 60 cents per share. He says he'sleaning toward cutting his 1992 estimates on Sprint's parent,United Telecommunications, since he now expects Sprint toshow an operating income of $85 million vs. an earlierprojection of $90 million in the 1991 fourth quarter and $395million in 1992 instead of the $425 million he earlierexpected.   Similarly, PaineWebber's Mr. Grubman recently cut hisearnings estimates for MCI, predicting the recession andmarketing costs will put increasing pressure on thelong-distance telephone company and the entire industry. Mr.Grubman cut his 1992 estimates of MCI profit performance by adime to $2.20 a share and by a few cents in the first quarterto 52 cents to 54 cents.   &quot;There was a lot of air in MCI's stock, growing as it didfrom $29 to $34 in the last couple of weeks,&quot; says Mr.Grubman. &quot;Normally a 10-cent cut {in an annual earningsestimate} doesn't affect a stock that much.&quot; MCI officialsdeclined to offer projections for the first quarter.   ATandamp;T has dramatically slowed erosion of its market sharein the last couple of years. &quot;MCI and Sprint, while stillgaining, aren't getting the two to three points a year thatthey had been,&quot; Mr. Morris noted. Currently, Mr. Morrisfigures, ATandamp;T has more than 70% of the $16 billionresidential long-distance services market and more than 50%of the $37 billion business market. ATandamp;T's seeminginvulnerability to its rivals' raids in the last year, isexpected by analysts to continue for most of this year,especially as the company derives continued gains fromcost-cutting programs and other restructurings aimed atimproving profits. But the analysts say ATandamp;T's spending towithstand competition will have to increase, putting greaterpressure on margins down the road. An ATandamp;T spokesman wouldn'tgive an outlook but did say the company's economists werepredicting &quot;some form of recovery by the second half of 1992. . . and industry growth will be back to 10% to 12% when theeconomy recovers.&quot;   Meanwhile, the marketing battle to lure customers awayfrom ATandamp;T is costing MCI and Sprint a bundle. MCI'sresidential marketing campaign, called Friends andamp; Family, haswon MCI five to eight million new customers since itsannouncement last summer, according to Mr. Grubman. &quot;It's ahuge success.&quot; Trouble is, residential calls don't offer muchin the way of margins, Mr. Grubman noted. MCI also recentlyunveiled a new calling-card that offers joiners $35 or up tofour hours of free calls in return for not using its rivals'cards. MCI has had greater margin success, he says, in newerareas such as toll-free 800 numbers and internationalservices. And the new card program offers additional servicessuch as conference calling and a messaging service that carrya fat fee for usage.   ATandamp;T, meanwhile, has been trying to lure backsmall-business defectors of its service with ads statingflatly &quot;We Want You Back&quot; and pricing and service programswhich mirror its offerings to big corporations. Phone usageby such customers offer carriers the highest operatingmargins (as much as 18% vs. 10% on residential calls), Mr.Grubman says. ATandamp;T in December also announced a daytimediscount calling plan that essentially cuts rates by 17% andwaives a $5 sign-up fee between now and April 5.</TEXT></DOC>
