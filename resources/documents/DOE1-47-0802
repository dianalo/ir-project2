The floc fraction constituted a major part (i.e.,57% total protein) of the total microbial population in the digestor,and it accounted for 87% of the total CO{sub 2}-dependent methanogenicactivity and 76% of the total ethanol-consuming acetogenic activity.Lactose was degraded by both cellular fractions, but in the free florafraction it was associated with higher intermediary levels of H{sub 2},ethanol, butyrate, and propionate production. Electron microscopic analysisof flocs showed bacterial diversity and juxtapositioning of tentativeDesulfovibrio and Methanobacterium species without significant microcolonyformation. Ethanol, an intermediary product of lactose-hydrolyzing bacteria,was converted to acetate and methane within the flocs by interspecieselectron transfer. Ethanol-dependent methane formation was compartmentalizedand closely coupled kinetically within the flocs but without significantformation of H{sub 2} gas. Physical disruption of flocs into fragmentsof 10- to 20-{mu}m diameter initially increased the H{sub 2} partialpressure but did not change the carbon transformation kinetic patternsof ethanol metabolism or demonstrate a significant role for H{sub 2}in CO{sub 2} reduction to methane. The data demonstrate that floc formationin a whey-processing anaerobic digestor functions in juxtapositioningcells for interspecies electron transfer during syntrophic ethanol conversioninto acetate and methane but by a mechanism which was independent ofthe available dissolved H{sub 2} gas pool in the ecosystem.</TEXT></DOC>
