Besides his shoes, Mr. Kim left behind video copyingequipment, electronic image enhancers and hundreds of copiedtapes of popular American movies. To Mr. O'Neill, the MotionPicture Export Association of America's man in Seoul, thesewere the smoking guns of a videotape counterfeiter. And Mr.Kim, he believed, was a key figure in the Bucheon Ring ofvideo pirates who were supplying many of Seoul's video-rentalshops.</LP><TEXT>   It would be months before Mr. O'Neill was back on thepirate's trail, all the while shocking video-store ownerswith surprise raids and seizures, and spreading fear throughthe underground industry by pressing exposed bootleggers intoservice as informants. He would suffer harsh criticism fromKorean video-store associations, harassing phone calls in thenight and a cat nailed to his door. &quot;I left it up there,&quot; hesays. &quot;I don't like cats, anyway.&quot;   But Mr. O'Neill, a former Green Beret soldier and VietnamWar veteran, is helping the American movie industry make biggains in the war against the Korean underworld of counterfeittape makers and distributors. When the burly Mr. O'Neill flewinto Seoul two years ago, about 85% of the 30,000 video shopsin Korea sold pirated tapes. U.S. movie studios complainedthat pirates were beating them to the stores with movies,stealing a lucrative market.   Adapting guerrilla tactics he says he learned fighting theViet Cong, Mr. O'Neill has reduced the share of storesselling bootleg tapes to under 30%. &quot;Genghis Khan had a lotof good ideas,&quot; he says. The score so far: 734 raids, 140,816tapes seized or destroyed, 155 convictions, and hundreds ofcases pending.   Mr. O'Neill's war is important to American movie makers.The industry reels in about $1 billion in revenue from Asiaeach year, but loses almost $400 million in potential salesto piracy. (Movies are a leading U.S. export, with overseasrevenue of more than $3.5 billion a year.)   Pirating in Asia is no mom-and-pop trade. It is asophisticated business in which bootleggers copy the latesttitles by running 25 or more VCRs at once, and then packingthe tapes in what looks like genuine packaging. Some evencarry clever counterfeits of the silvery holograms designedto guard against bootlegging.   The legitimate movie industry is happy with Mr. O'Neill'swork. &quot;He is a tremendous asset,&quot; says Ron Putnam, head ofanti-piracy efforts for the Motion Picture ExportAssociation's Asia-Pacific region. Authorized videodistributors in Korea report that 1991 sales more thandoubled, and several say this year will be even better.   More important, Mr. O'Neill's methods are being taught toanti-piracy officials in other Asian countries, such asMalaysia and Thailand, where more than 85% of stores sellpirated tapes. (In India, all stores are believed to do so.)Makers of computer software, luggage and even machined partsare taking an interest in his anti-pirating techniques, whichrely on computers, persistence, long hours and a refusal tobe intimidated by pirates or indifferent governmentofficials. &quot;Dick is a unique character and much of hissuccess is due to him personally,&quot; Mr. Putnam says. &quot;But hismethods can be applied elsewhere.&quot;   South Korea has been among the world's worst offenders.Its streets are famous for fake Louis Vuitton bags, rip-offReebok athletic shoes and bootleg Lotus 1-2-3 software. Thecopy culture is so deep here that major Korean companiesdon't hesitate to use Disney-like characters for mascots,appropriate the Batman logo or replicate distinctive packagessuch as Johnson andamp; Johnson's teardrop-shaped baby shampoobottle or Procter andamp; Gamble's Tide box.   Korea is changing, but Mr. O'Neill's tough tactics aremaking Korea change faster. Mr. O'Neill, 5 feet 11 inchestall, weighing more than 250 pounds, and 43 years old, craveswhatever action he can find. He grew up in New York City,joined the Army, and gained a commission as an officer. Inthree years in Vietnam he received a Silver Star and sixBronze Stars, he says. After studying law enforcement at theUniversity of Nebraska in Omaha, he helped set up securityfor the Seoul Olympics. Hollywood found him in thePhilippines doing security work for a U.S. company.   Once in Korea, he set out to get to know his enemy. He andhis staff of six Koreans, clipboards in hand, began surveyingall 30,000 video shops in Korea. On detailed city maps, theystarted plotting stores that sell only legal tapes with bluedots and stores with pirate tapes in red. Yellow dots wouldmark stores that reformed their ways after visits by one ofMr. O'Neill's &quot;market surveyors.&quot; (Private detectives areillegal in Korea, hence the euphemistic job description.)   Soon, with prodding by Mr. O'Neill, the police raidsbegan. Mr. O'Neill's strategy: Hit the biggest store in a seaof red dots to scare the rest into compliance. &quot;It's GenghisKhan. You burn one village and leave a few survivors to tellthe rest,&quot; he says. Nowadays, all he has to do is send aletter asking when it would be convenient to make a raid. Hegets photos, via registered mail, from frightened storeowners showing them burning piles of counterfeit tapes. &quot;It'sthe damndest thing. But I got a drawerful of them.&quot;   Mr. O'Neill is even so bold as to pose as a buyer and passout business cards with such names as &quot;I.B. Kuhl,&quot; &quot;Dr. FelixdeKhatt, Famous Psychiatrist,&quot; or &quot;Father Richard of theFriars of St. Valenti,&quot; a reference to Jack Valenti, head ofthe U.S. Motion Picture Association.   Members of the Korean Video andamp; Phonograph Sale ShopAssociation aren't laughing. In fact, they are angry aboutMr. O'Neill and his aggressive style. &quot;We don't know whichtapes are pirated,&quot; says Jin Suck-Ju, an associationdirector. He admits that shopkeepers sometimes buy fromunauthorized dealers in order to get popular titles faster. Abona fide tape sells for about $27. A good pirate versionsells for about half that. &quot;The high price the Americanscharge is the main cause of piracy,&quot; says Shim Yong-Tae,another store owner. &quot;That forces the Korean people to copy.Otherwise we can't make a profit.&quot;   Most retailers get off with a warning. But with shopowners who could face criminal charges, Mr. O'Neill pressesthem to turn in other video outlaws. &quot;It works againstclandestine organizations,&quot; he says. Often, they tell Mr.O'Neill or his quiet right-hand man, Kim Kun-Soo, a formerKorean marine, the location of pirate tape inventories.Acting on an informant's tip, Mr. Kim led police to a cacheof videos hidden under sacks of rice in a store across thestreet from a Seoul video shop. Sometimes informants lead Mr.O'Neill to distributors. Some even become agents,infiltrating the pirate distribution chain.   One informant told Mr. O'Neill about a meeting of outlawmanufacturers who were gathering to discuss what to do aboutthe new American in town harassing them. Mr. O'Neill got oneof his men to pose as a parking-lot attendant. He took downlicense numbers that led to the identities of many majorbootleggers.   With his reputation well established, some tips now comewalking through his door. A pirate's estranged wife informedon her husband last year because he wasn't providing herenough money. &quot;Can't you do anything to get him?&quot; she asked.Mr. O'Neill was happy to oblige her.   Mr. O'Neill's quarry is still a slippery prey. He spentdays in a cheap hotel, listening and monitoring power meters,to find the room where a pirate was operating. When hefinally made his move, bursting through the door with police,all they found were two stunned lovers in a clinch. Thesuspect had moved across the hall.   It was luck that put him on the trail of Mr. Kim, theshoeless pirate. A rival distributor, angry that Mr. Kim hadinvaded his turf, led Mr. O'Neill and police right to theshop in Bucheon. But the raid was a bust when Mr. Kim and hisassociates saw police and fled.   Mr. Kim left his dog, a light-brown mutt that theinformant said Mr. Kim adored. Mr. O'Neill kept the dog forweeks, hoping Mr. Kim would call to make a deal. He didn't,so the investigation continued.   On a computer in his office above a Shakey's Pizza parlor,Mr. O'Neill drew links between shops, distributors andmanufacturers in what he calls an &quot;intel-association matrix.&quot;In the list of 120 suspected manufacturers and distributors,Mr. Kim's name was still being linked to seven men known asthe Bucheon Ring, named for the industrial city west of Seoulwhere they operated. Also, printed tape boxes, each bearingalmost imperceptible manufacturing marks typical of Mr. Kim'soperations, were popping up at various stores, suggesting hewas still in business. But where?   Then, last fall, informants found Mr. Kim, the allegedpirate, operating in a house in northeast Seoul. When policeswooped in, they confiscated 34 VCRs, 6,000 tape boxes, 1,320blank tapes, plastic shrink-wrapping machines, and 540 copiesof &quot;The Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back,&quot; among other titles,including &quot;Terminator 2,&quot; which hadn't been released here onvideo. They also caught Mr. Kim.   Mr. O'Neill says within six months he will have the shareof Korean stores selling pirate tapes below 20%. (In the U.S.and Japan the rate is 12%.) But already pirates are findingnew outlets for their ware: Video theaters showing moviescopyrighted before 1987, and thus unprotected under Koreanlaw. Others are wiring Korean homes to rogue cable systems.   The movie studios now have Mr. O'Neill traveling toThailand, where pirate tapes are sold openly on streets totourists (though the videos won't play on American TV sets).He recently raided a shop in Bangkok that carried 44,000bootleg tapes. &quot;We've never seen anything of that scale inSeoul,&quot; he says. &quot;It is real cowboy and Indian country downthere.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
