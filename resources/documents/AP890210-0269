The association, representing nearly 600 stock brokerages andinvestment banks in the United States and Canada, intends to filesuit later this month to overturn the Fed's decision enabling bankholding companies to underwrite corporate debt and equity on alimited basis, according to a statement by SIA President Edward I.O'Brien and the group's chairman, Hardwick Simons.   The suit will be filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals inWashington, D.C.   In a ruling last month, Fed governors voted to allow banks tounderwrite corporate debt through affiliates but severely limitedthe amount of underwriting the subsidiaries may handle.   The ruling was significant because it continued the evolution inthe banking industry's financial powers.   The distinctions between the securities business and commercialbanking spelled out in the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act haveblurred over time as each of the two industries have been grantedpermission to expand their services. The Fed increasingly has takenthe lead in giving banks broader powers, as Congress generally hasnot done so.   The SIA suit will attempt to persuade the court that the Fed'saction was ``a dangerous piecemeal undermining of the safetybarriers'' of the nearly 55-year old Glass-Steagall, the statement.   ``We believe the nation's law should be amended, if necessary, byCongress, not by regulatory and administrative organizations, suchas the Federal Reserve,'' the statement read.   ``Legal issues aside, it is absurd to let banks risk theircapital in the volatile securities market at the very time they arestill struggling with the developing-nations' debt problems, and theeconomy-threatening problems of the thrift industry,'' they stated.</TEXT></DOC>
