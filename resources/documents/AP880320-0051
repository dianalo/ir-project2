Gen. ColinPowell said Sunday the fighting between Nicaragua and Honduras isbasically over and the chance of involvement by U.S. troops incombat is unlikely.   ``I don't expect that they (the U.S. troops) will get anywherenear the combat zone,'' Powell said. ``The combat zone is rapidlydisappearing as the Sandinistas appear to withdraw, and I don'tthink there is any reasonable likelihood that they would beanywhere near the combat zone or getting themselves in a combatsituation.''   The Reagan administration dispatched 3,200 troops to Hondurasthis week in response to the Nicaraguan incursion across the borderto destroy Contra rebel camps and supplies. The U.S. troops were toparticipate in exercises far from the fighting.   Powell, who appeared on ABC-TV's ``This Week With DavidBrinkley,'' said the exercises should be completed shortly and thetroops will return to the United States.   ``I would expect that in a short period of time the exercisewill end and they will be on the way home,'' Powell said.   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci had said Friday that U.S.forces would remain in the region for 10 days and not take part inborder fighting between the two Central American nations.   Powell said Sunday that based on ground fighting, ``the battleis pretty much over. The Sandinistas have withdrawn. They'reapparently on their side of the border again. They appear to be ina process of withdrawing or have withdrawn.''   ``And our troops are 50-60-100 miles away from the site ofaction, and no plans are being made to move them any closer,'' hesaid. ``I see no prospect of their entering into a combatsituation.''   Cease-fire talks between Nicaragua's Sandinista government andleaders of the Contra forces were scheduled to resume Monday inManagua, but the possibility of negotiations seemed slim in lightof the fighting.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who appeared on NBC-TV's``Meet the Press,'' said he was uncertain about the future of thepeace talks.   ``I think the likelihood is they will (resume), but I'm notcertain of that,'' Shultz said. ``There seems to be a certainamount of maneuvering among the parties, but I think a reasonableand sensible cease-fire would be a good thing. And so we're forit.''   Shultz also said the administration is examining a bipartisancongressional plan of $48 million in new aid to the Contras,including renewed authority for the CIA to deliver previouslystockpiled weapons.   ``It's a very interesting plan. We're studying it,'' Shultzsaid. ``(It) seems a little low on money, but it is an interestingeffort on their part and deserves careful study, and I hope thatsomething goes forward. It should go forward.''   Powell denied published reports that the administration turneddown Honduran president Jose Azcona's request that U.S. helicoptersbe used to ferry Honduran troops to the battle zone.   The New York Times, quoting an unidentified senioradministration official, reported Sunday that the United Statesrejected the Honduran proposal, which was never made formally.   ``We did not say no,'' Powell said. ``We were in the process ofexamining that request. It had some funding problems and somepolicy problems. And before we had to answer definitely `yes' or`no' or even get a formal request, we found another way toexercise.''   He did not specify what type of exercise, but the Times reportedthat U.S. officials were able to persuade Honduras to accept ajoint training exercise in which U.S. helicopters would carryHonduran troops to about 30 miles from the Nicaraguan border but100 miles from the battle zone.   ``We are not using U.S. airlift to move Honduran troops to thescene of the action at the Bocay,'' Powell said, referring to themajor battle site.   Powell denied that he had misled Congress when he briefedlegislators on Wednesday and failed to mention that PresidentReagan had decided, in principle, to send troops to Honduras ifAzcona asked.   ``We did not go into the specific options because we did notwant it all over the newspapers,'' Powell said.   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., in an interview onCBS-TV's ``Face The Nation,'' contended the administration didmislead Congress about plans to send U.S. troops to Honduras.   ``I think that what happened is that we were being briefed at4:30 in the afternoon on day and they had made a decision thatmorning to go down. And they told us in that meeting that it wasnot even under consideration to send troops down to Honduras,''Coelho said.   ``I think that what is happening here is that we are beingmisled, or we were being misled,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
