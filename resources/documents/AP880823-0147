The government said it wouldn't negotiate ``under the `pistol'of a strike,'' and took measures to end Poland's worst wave oflabor unrest since the 1981 imposition of martial law.   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said at least 49 people havebeen detained by police nationwide in connection with the strikes,which began Aug. 16 and at their height affected about 100,000workers at 20 sites.   On Monday night, Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak said troopswould be sent to secure major industrial plants to prevent anarchy,although none were in evidence at the plants Tuesday. An 11 p.m. to5 a.m. curfew was imposed in Jastrzebie in Katowice Province, thesite of many of the mine strikes.   Four columns of army and police vehicles left Krakow forKatowice, witnesses said. Two of the convoys consisted of more than70 vehicles, including four trucks with water cannons and 10truckloads of armed soldiers, the witnesses said.   On the road in Oswiecim, near the entrance to the coal-richSilesia region, army roadblocks stopped cars and searched them.   Miners from the 30 Years of People's Poland Mine near Jastrzebiepledged they ``will stay there until the end of their lives, untilall the demands are met,'' said Wojciech Maziarski, a Solidarityspokesman in Warsaw.   Striking dockworkers in Szczecin said they feared police weregetting ready to move in on them Tuesday night. Police broke upstrikes at two Szczecin streetcar depots and one bus depot onMonday night.   ``The situation here is very simple now: we are expecting anassault at any moment, because movements of police vehicles havebeen spotted outside our perimeter,'' said Edward Rodziewicz,chairman of the Interfactory Strike Committee at the Baltic port.   At the 30 Years of People's Poland mine, workers went down intothe shaft, 580 yards underground, about noon Tuesday, according tothe Inter-mine Strike Committee in Jastrzebie.   ``They have decided to stay underground until the start ofnegotiations,'' said a communique issued by the committee. ``Theirhealth is in danger.''   Mine strike leaders said they were not discouraged by thegovernment actions and would continue their strike.   ``We have to continue to fight the red bourgeoisie in theparty,'' said Romuald Bozko, a worker at the Moszczenice mine whowas interviewed at a church in Jastrzebie.   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa appealed again for dialogue withauthorities to end the strikes, but Urban dismissed the possibilityof negotiations while strikes continued.   ``There will be no political talks under the `pistol' of astrike,'' Urban told a Warsaw news conference. The strikers havebeen demanding increased wages and recognition of Solidarity, whichwas outlawed in 1981.   Urban announced that a special parliament commission will meetAug. 31 to review the government's economic policies and that itmight make adjustments in its economic program after consultationwith official trade unions.   He declined to explain what steps the security forces mentionedby Kiszczak would take at the strikebound plants. Kiszczak alsosaid curfews were authorized in the provinces of Szczecin, Katowiceand Gdansk, although the only place where one was imposed was inthe Katowice town of Jastrzebie.   Urban did not rule out declaring a state of emergency in theaffected provinces.   ``The measures that will be applied will be adequate todevelopments,'' Urban said.   The government said only a few thousand workers remained onstrike. The number could not be independently verified.   The Politburo of the country's ruling Polish United Workers(Communist) Party met on the situation Tuesday night, statetelevision reported, but there were no details on its deliberation.   On Monday, workers at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk waved Polishflags and changed ``Solidarity!'' in scenes reminiscent of anine-day strike there in May.   Strikes were reported at two more Silesian coal mines Tuesday,bringing to 11 the number hit by labor unrest. Solidarity activistssaid strike actions spread to a repair shipyard and a shipyardmaking boats for river traffic in Gdansk.   ``These are events of great importance,'' said Solidarityadviser Adam Michnik, because they followed Kiszczak's speechMonday.   ``If the intention of the speech was to stop the just protest ofthe workers by intimidating them, then this scenario has failed,''Michnik said.   But there were signs that enthusiasm for strikes was ebbingelsewhere.   Strikers in two departments of the Cegielski Engine Works inPoznan ended a walkout Tuesday, as well as those at a train carfactory in Wroclaw, the Huta Warszawa steel mill in Warsaw, and theAndaluzja coal mine, according to the state-run news agency PAP.   An attempt to begin a strike in one department of the Nowa Hutasteelworks outside Krakow fizzled after a few hours.   Miners in Jastrzebie, the heart of the miners' unrest, reporteda harrowing few hours before dawn Tuesday, saying police cars withsirens blaring drove up to the July Manifest Mine in a mock raid.   Strikers could be seen erecting barricades by using wood toreinforce the mine's entrance gates in preparation for possiblepolice assault.   Provincial governors in Wroclaw, Warsaw, Katowice and Szczecinissued regulations for speeded-up court proceedings against strikeleaders, according to reports in the official press.   Kiszczak, in his TV address, had urged that glaring offendersagainst the peace be jailed in summary proceedings, not just fined.</TEXT></DOC>
