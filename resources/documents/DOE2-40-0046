It is maintained that up to 3,000 m{sup 3} can be injected througha single hole executed according to the design elaborated by VNIMI andthat the radius of injection effectiveness is 70 m. Typical schemes ofregional water injection used in mines of the Gruzugol', Vorkutaugol',Artemugol' and Prokop'evskugol' associations in the Donbass and Kuzbassbasins are shown and discussed together with a diagram of the appliedwater pressures. The fact that no rock bursts were recorded between 1979and 1986 at sections where regional injection had been implemented testifiesto the effectiveness of this technology. Feasibility investigations intoinjection of antipyrogens and surface active agents are being conductedat VNIMI in order to find a method of fighting simultaneously rock bursts,dustiness and endogenous fires by injection.</TEXT></DOC>
