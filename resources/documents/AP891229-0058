Calling the defendants' fears ``the concerns of all right-mindedpeople'' about the dangers of nuclear weapons, provincial courtJudge Wallace Craig said Thursday that they were right to protestand that Canadians had been too passive in the past.   ``I think it's remarkable that the (Canadian) government hasseen fit to invite a vessel of this type,'' Craig said.   The five were charged after they spray-painted peace symbols andthe international radiation warning symbol on the aircraft carrierUSS Independence as it attempted to anchor in English Bay on Aug.9. A sixth protester charged with mischief, Rolph Reynolds, wasgiven a conditional discharge.   The court was told Reynolds climbed the carrier's anchor chainwaving a flag.   Craig said he accepted that the defendants believed there werenuclear weapons aboard the ship. The U.S. Navy routinely refuses toconfirm or deny whether nuclear weapons are aboard a vessel.   Carrier navigator Cmdr. Richard Ormsbee said Reynolds put thevessel's captain in a perilous situation because the carrier was indanger of running aground near Stanley Park.   If Reynolds hadn't been dragged off the anchor chain, he said,the captain would have been faced with dangerous choices.   He would have been forced to either drop the port anchor,endangering small boats near the ship's bow, drop the starboardanchor with Reynolds on it, or throw the engines into full reverse,swamping several small boats, Ormsbee said.   Craig said Reynolds' actions could have caused the accident hewas trying to prevent, but refused to grant the Navy's request for$1,950 for fuel the ship burned while the carrier was attempting toanchor.</TEXT></DOC>
