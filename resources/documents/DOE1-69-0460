RK-28 andRK-29 had higher in vitro sensitizing effects on EMT6 single cells thanMISO. The sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) at a concentration of 1mM was 1.9 for both RK-28 and RK-29, but 1.55 for MISO. The in vivo sensitizingeffects on SCCVII carcinomas of C3H/He mice and EMT6 sarcomas of Balb/cmice were measured by an in vivo-in vitro assay. The sensitizing effectsof RK-28 and RK-29 appeared to be maximal when they were administeredintraperitoneally 30 {similar_to} 40 min before irradiation. At the drugdose of 100 mg/kg, the effects of the two compounds were almost the sameas those of MISO; the SER of RK-28 and RK-29 was 1.4 for both SCCVIIand EMT6 tumors, while that of MISO was 1.45 for SCCVII tumors and 1.4for EMT6 tumors. At doses higher than 200 mg/kg, however, MISO was moreeffective than RK-28 and RK-29, especially for EMT6 tumors. The LD/sub50/7/ value in C3H/He mice was 1.7 g/kg for MISO, 0.9 g/kg for RK-28,and 0.2 g/kg for RK-29. Discussion was made on clinical applicabilityof RK-28.</TEXT></DOC>
