A Consumers Power spokesman said the company won't appeal the recommendation, though it &quot;doesn't believe a civil penalty is warranted.&quot;    The NRC said the plant had an unsecured opening that &quot;could have allowed unauthorized individuals undetected access&quot; into a vital area. The Consumers Power spokesman said the opening was too small for a person to pass through.    The proposed fine is half the traditional penalty, because Consumers Power has had a good safety record, the NRC said. This is the first time in the plant's 25-year history that a fine has been recommended. </TEXT></DOC>
