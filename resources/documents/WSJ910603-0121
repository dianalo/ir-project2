But he has. &quot;The legislative system of{the United Kingdom} isn't suited to an innovative financialmarket,&quot; the Swedish banker fumes. &quot;We have got in the U.K.what many countries would define as a political risk.&quot;   Mr. Evander is managing director of Svenska InternationalPLC, a London-based unit of Svenska Handelsbanken. A fewmonths ago, he took part in a decision to transfer part ofSvenska's interest-rate swaps operations out of London toHong Kong.</LP><TEXT>   The reason? Doubts about London's legal environmentfollowing a row over swaps dealings between banks and localauthorities. Earlier this year, Britain's highest courtdecided that all such contracts involving local authoritiesare invalid.   The ruling, Mr. Evander and others claim, undermined thebasis of trust that traditionally has been at the heart ofbusiness in the City, as London's financial district isknown. At a time of increasing competition among financialmarkets, the ruling has dented London's reputation as a worldfinancial center.   At issue is London's informal regulatory environment,formerly regarded as one of the city's strengths but nowattacked by some as a weakness. Though it's still too earlyto assess the row's long-term effects, possible winners interms of a rechanneling of financial business may beFrankfurt and Paris. Either way, the Bank of England makes noeffort to hide its concern. &quot;There's no doubt in our mindsthat London has suffered,&quot; a senior official admits.   Ironically, a taste for financial innovation landed Londonin this mess. Swaps enable parties to exchange financialobligations, in this case fixed-interest-rate liabilities forfloating-rate liabilities. When swaps were developed in theearly 1980s, banks encouraged local authorities to use themto improve the management of their finances. By 1987, atleast one municipality, the west London borough ofHammersmith andamp; Fulham, was among the world's biggest players.   But swaps are a gamble on interest rates, and misjudgingfuture trends can prove expensive. Questions about localauthorities' involvement began to be asked when an auditordiscovered that Hammersmith andamp; Fulham had slipped into deepfinancial trouble.   The result was a lengthy legal wrangle, culminatingearlier this year in a ruling by the House of Lords puttingswaps out of bounds for all local authorities. The judgment'seffect was to annul thousands of existing contracts. This letHammersmith andamp; Fulham and several other authorities that hadgot into trouble off the hook. But it also meant thatauthorities that had made profits on swaps would have to payback money.   Hammersmith andamp; Fulham had every reason to be thankful.Instead of paying #200 million (about $345 million), as itwould have had to if it had honored its contracts, it expectsto have to pay only about #20 million under restitution, therepayment of funds through the unwinding of contracts.   At a wider level, however, the ruling unleashedpandemonium. Altogether, 80 banks, including Svenska, havelost a total of about #550 million in earnings on contractswith 130 local authorities. Restitution is expected to bringonly around #125 million in compensation, if the banks canget it. Around a dozen banks have issued more than 70 writsagainst individual local authorities, and at least two caseshave been settled out of court. But much of what banks areowed probably won't be forthcoming without legal action.   In addition to the financial pain, the affair has raisedother far-reaching questions. &quot;There used to be a nonwrittentradition in London whereby business was transacted on abasis of `my word is my bond,'&quot; says Alec de Lezardiere,managing director and chief executive of Paribas Ltd., theLondon unit of Banque Paribas of France. Now, he says,&quot;people are going to have to look more closely at legalquestions,&quot; a development he regards as &quot;clearly negative&quot;for London's financial center.   Bankers are worried about legal risks on other newfinancial products, such as stock borrowing and options.They're also thinking twice about doing business withinstitutions that aren't incorporated under U.K. company law,for fear of getting entangled in other legal messes.   Along with local authorities, these institutions includepension funds, mutual funds and building societies, orthrifts. &quot;We don't know where we are for virtually anyunincorporated entity,&quot; laments Sir Nicholas Goodison,chairman of the British Bankers' Association.   The uncertainties coincide with other controversiespoisoning the City's once-clubby atmosphere. At Lloyd's ofLondon, London's insurance market, angry investors are suingtheir agents and market regulators for negligence related tothe underwriting of policies and subsequent losses. Inaddition, the Bank of England recently revealed that it hasadmonished some of London's leading investment banks forcarelessness in their choice and promotion of clients.   In the swaps affair, the central bank tried for months,unsuccessfully, to persuade the government to enactretrospective legislation to legalize swaps contracts withlocal authorities. &quot;The principal of `my word is my bond' iscentral to the reputation not just of London, but of theUnited Kingdom as a whole,&quot; the bank argued.   To head off other problems, the central bank recently setup a top-level committee to study other areas of legal risk.Headed by Lord Alexander, chairman of National WestminsterBank PLC and a noted lawyer, the committee held its firstmeeting last week and is expected to produce a full report byearly next year.   For now, local authorities seem to be the principalvictims of the swaps controversy. By casting doubts on theirreliability as counterparties, the affair has deprived themof access to other modern financial products. Other thanstraight borrowing, they and certain other non-companyinstitutions are finding it hard to do business with banks.   When the banks don't actually flatly refuse business fromlocal authorities and the other non-company institutions,they often demand tough legal wording and a chance to makeprofits on other services. In the case of building societies,for example, &quot;a lot of people won't do swaps unless it's inconjunction with an issue,&quot; says John McNiven, of MerrillLynch andamp; Co. in London.   At Hammersmith andamp; Fulham, Neil Newton, a former moneybroker hired earlier this year to sort out the municipality'sfinances, has no illusions. He likens negotiations betweenthe borough and its banks on their former swaps contracts toa poker game. Because neither the House of Lords nor thegovernment has specified how restitution should operate, hesays, there's plenty of room for haggling.   &quot;Does restitution involve only open deals, or does itinclude closed deals?&quot; he asks. &quot;Does it call for payment ofinterest? And if so from what date? There are no guidelines.&quot;   On the financing front, he says, Hammersmith andamp; Fulhamcould face problems if it comes up against a squeeze oncredit from the state. For the moment, the borough is able toborrow most of the funds it needs direct from a specializedgovernment lending agency. But if, for political reasons, thegovernment should decide to reduce the availability of fundsfor local authorities, it could be in trouble.   &quot;Hammersmith andamp; Fulham won't get bank money for years tocome,&quot; Mr. Newton predicts. &quot;Given our name and what hashappened, it would be silly for us to try.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
