ScheierandM;Almost a year after Windows 3.0's introduction, corporate PC managers remainskeptical of Microsoft Corp.'s claim that moving to a graphical userinterface (GUI) can save their companies hundreds of thousands or evenmillions of dollars.andM;Those doubts, however, aren't keeping many managers from migrating largenumbers of users to a GUI environment -- be it Windows or OS/2 PresentationManager.andM;Even if they can't prove it with spreadsheet figures, many managers believethat a multitasking, graphical PC interface is the best way to get more andbetter work out of their employees.andM;&quot;At this point, we're pretty much doing it as an article of faith,&quot; said BobHolmes, a computer technology research analyst at Southern California Gas Co.andO;in Los Angeles, where Windows 3.0 is currently being installed on hundreds ofPCs.andP;  &quot;It's still a matter of spending $100 [for the Windows program], andyou're generating intangibles in terms of benefits.&quot;andM;Last summer, Microsoft Corp. distributed an Excel spreadsheet that calculatedthe costs and benefits of moving to a GUI.andP;  Many of the cost estimates werebased on Microsoft's assumptions about factors such as how much trainingusers would need on Windows and how quickly their productivity wouldincrease.andM;Last summer, PC Week ran this spreadsheet for seven PC managers, using dataabout their sites, and six said they doubted that their firms would see thebenefits Microsoft predicted.andP;  That sentiment was shared by PC managers at 14firms who later worked with software reseller Corporate Software Inc. ofCanton, Mass., to introduce Windows to their users.andM;Based on their skepticism, Corporate Software reduced the estimates in themodel for productivity gains and increased the estimates of the amount oftraining and support needed (see related story, Page S/20).andM;In January, PC Week again contacted many of the managers involved in theoriginal test and found them still skeptical of Microsoft's claims.andM;Last summer, Holmes felt that even if the productivity gains predicted by thespreadsheet were true, it would be impossible to convince management thatthose benefits could be achieved.andP;  He still feels that way.andM;However, &quot;we still are in the process of putting together our Windowsstrategy,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We're just about ready to start giving it to the groupsthat are interested in having it.&quot;andM;By year's end, he estimated, the utility will have installed Windows 3.0 on100 to 250 of its 700 286- and 386-based PCs.andP;  Prime candidates for Windows,he said, are users who run both word-processing and spreadsheet applications.andO;He expects the biggest productivity gains to come from the ease of working ina GUI and the ability to move data among applications.andP;  Also by the end ofthe year, another 50 users will be moving to OS/2 to take advantage of anapplication now being written that will access a DB2 database on a host.andM;Southern California Gas is still looking for ways to quantify the benefits ofmoving to a GUI, said Holmes.andP;  &quot;We even talked about going to our industrialengineering department and doing some analysis of how people worked beforethey used Windows and how they work afterward,&quot; he said.andM;A group manager for a New York financial-services firm said it is still &quot;hardto tell&quot; about the productivity gains of Windows, although he feelsMicrosoft's assumptions about training time are close to reality.andP;  His firmhas developed a data-entry and database application running under Windows,but so far has introduced it to only two of the 25 users who will eventuallyrun it.andM;One pleasant surprise, he said, is that users can learn the basics of aWindows application in several hours, and then learn others quickly becausethe interfaces of various Windows programs are so similar.andM;Last summer, Darrin McCarthy, an end-user computing analyst for Porsche Carsof North America Inc. in Reno, Nev., called Microsoft's productivityassumptions &quot;almost entirely marketing hype.&quot;andM;At least for the time being, most of his users will continue usingcharacter-based software such as WordPerfect in a Windows environment.andO;&quot;You'll see the real productivity gains when you give the person the abilityto carry on two or three tasks at the same time,&quot; said McCarthy.andM;Porsche is planning to migrate 10 users to OS/2 right away.andP;  The other 90users at Porsche, who do not need the multithreading capabilities of OS/2right now, will be migrated to Windows and eventually to OS/2, he said.andM;&quot;I don't feel quite as skeptical about the overall gains [as I did before],but it's still on a user-by-user basis,&quot; said Bruce Hallberg, MIS manager forGenelabs Inc., a Redwood City, Calif., biotechnology firm.andM;Genelabs has moved about 25 of its 110 users to Windows 3.0, with aboutanother 15 hoping to make the switch soon.andP;  Most of the other users arewaiting for WordPerfect Corp. to ship a Windows version of its WordPerfectword-processing program.andM;The Dynamic Data Exchange capability of Windows, which allows users to movedata easily among applications, is one of the biggest productivity boostsfrom using Windows, Hallberg said.andM;&quot;Six months ago, I thought Windows would be a two-year stepping-stone toOS/2,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I'm starting to have some thoughts that we might not jumpto OS/2,&quot; using Windows as a GUI platform instead.andM;The easier training for GUI applications was another time-saver, he said.andP;  &quot;Iwould guess it takes half the time to learn a Windows application than acharacter-based application.&quot;andM;Tom Ferguson, a research analyst with the city of Phoenix, was just as leeryabout Windows this winter as he was last summer.andP;  &quot;Perhaps after someone hascome in and configured [the PC] for an end user, ...andP;  then moving from oneapplication to the next can be fairly easy,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;But as forproductivity gains, I'm still not convinced that those numbers are anywhereclose.&quot;andM;Fewer than 1 percent of his users are now running Windows 3.0, he said, afigure he doesn't expect to rise much in the next year.andM;In Corporate Software's pilot program, users recorded at best modestincreases in their proficiency using various applications under Windowsrather than a character-based environment.andM;The real benefit of a graphical environment, said Holmes, is that itencourages people to be more creative and think of new ways to approach theirwork.andP;  &quot;The right brain is the seat of creativity,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;If we exercisethe right brain with the GUI, we may be able to think about the work itself,rather than automating the past.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
