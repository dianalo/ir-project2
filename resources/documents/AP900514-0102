Another researcher called the findings a ``hopeful statement''for exasperated parents of teen-agers.   The study was presented Monday to the annual meeting of theAmerican Psychiatric Association by David Bernstein, a psychologistat the Bronx Veterans Administration Medical Center and the MountSinai School of Medicine.   He cautioned that for other youths with personalitydisturbances, the troubles can be an early warning of long-standingdifficulties. So, he said, parents should consider getting theadolescent evaluated by a mental health professional if personalityproblems appear persistent.   The researchers focused on 10 types of personality disorder:   _ Paranoid, a tendency to view the actions of others asdeliberately demeaning or threatening.   _ Schizoid, in which a person neither wants nor enjoys closerelationships, and often appears cold and aloof.   _ Schizotypal, a pervasive pattern of peculiarities in thoughtsand behavior such as superstitiousness, bizarre fantasies andpreoccupations.   _ Histrionic, which involves excessive emotionality andattention-seeking.   _ Narcissistic, which includes a grandiose sense ofself-importance, extreme sensitivity to criticism and inability torecognize how other people feel.   _ Borderline, an instability in self-image, mood andrelationships with others.   _ Avoidant, a pervasive pattern of discomfort in socialsettings, timidity and extreme fear of disapproval.   _ Dependent, which involves submissive behavior in a variety ofcontexts.   _ Obsessive-compulsive, a pattern of perfectionism andinflexibility in a variety of contexts.   _ Passive-aggressive, a pervasive tendency to resist meetingsocial and business obligations by such indirect means asprocrastination or claiming to forget do to things.   Such traits appear in many healthy people, but can become adisorder if they form an inflexible pattern that significantlyinterferes with social or occupational functioning, or causes theperson distress.   The study included 776 participants drawn from two New Yorkcounties. They were interviewed initially at ages 9 to 19, andagain two years later.   Researchers found that 17 percent could be diagnosed with atleast one disorder, including about one-third of 13-year-olds.   But of the diagnosable participants, 59 percent were free of anypersonality diagnosis two years later.   Only 39 percent of participants diagnosable forpassive-aggressive disorder in the initial interview met criteriafor that disorder two years later, and the other disorders wereeven less persistent.   Bernstein did the research with colleague Dr. Larry Siever andPatricia Cohen and her colleagues at the New York State PsychiatricInstitute.   The study's results do not mean that adolescent problems can beignored, cautioned Dr. Daniel Offer, director of the Center for theStudy of Adolescence at Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Centerin Chicago.   ``You have to take adolescent problems seriously, some do growout of it and some don't, and you never know who will and whowon't,'' he said.   If the troubles are serious and affecting more than one area ofan adolescent's life, a mental health professional should beconsulted, he said.   Offer also said he thinks two years is too brief to be sure theproblems are truly gone.   But he said the findings constitute a ``hopeful statement.''   ``So many parents have so many negative experiences withteen-age children and they're so pessimistic that I think it's niceto have that kind of statement,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
