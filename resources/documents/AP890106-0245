The jobless rate averaged 5.5 percent for all of last year, downfrom 6.2 percent in 1987.   The Labor Department said December's civilian unemployment ratewas down 0.1 percentage point from November, hitting 5.3 percent forthe third time in 1988, the lowest level since the 5.1 percent ofMay 1974.   Service-producing industries led in the creation of 279,000 newjobs last month, bringing to nearly 3.8 million the number of jobscreated during the year, the most since 1984's total of 3.95million, the department said.   The report had little impact on Wall Street, where traders hadpredicted the numbers, and the stock market posted a modest gain.The unemployment figures did nothing to relieve expectations thatthe Federal Reserve might tighten credit further in its campaign tokeep inflation from reviving.   ``It shows that the economy has not shifted to a lower gear,''said economist Roger Brimmer of Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,Mass., forecasting service. ``With the economy continuing to operateat these levels and continuing to grow as rapidly as it is,inflation is going to keep creeping up.''   Average hourly earnings, however, remained unchanged for thethird consecutive month at $9.45. This statistic is closely watchedfor signs of inflation, but wage growth from December 1987 toDecember 1988 was just 3.4 percent, behind the inflation rate of 4.4percent.   ``The economy continues to grow robustly and wage rates are notaccelerating very much right now,'' said Washington-based economistMichael K. Evans. ``But I still think there is higher inflationahead, perhaps in spite of this report and not because of it. Wecould get a big jolt in inflation in January.''   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidthe figures ``indicate that the longest peacetime expansioncontinued through its 73rd month. ... The economy is on a strongfooting and proceeding moderately and smoothly.''   President-elect Bush, who takes over for Reagan in two weeks,used the occasion to repeat his no-tax pledge.   Asked whether the government could do anything to bringunemployment down further, Bush was not specific but said: ``There'sa lot of things where we can help in an effort to move unemploymentlower. But one way to not do that is to slow the economy down bygoing out there and raising taxes.''   When Reagan took office in January 1981, unemployment was 7.5percent. It rose to 10.8 percent late in the 1981-82 recession, thehighest level in four decades, before beginning to decline.   Janet Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics, said 3 millionof the new jobs last year were on the service side of the economy,including 700,000 in retail trade. More than 400,000 were inmanufacturing and 300,000 in construction.   Rebounding exports helped in manufacturing, particularly themachinery industry. Factory workers continued to average four hoursof overtime a week in December.   Of the 279,000 new jobs in December, 107,000 were in the businessand health services industries. Retail trade added 52,000 new jobsfor the month, most of them in department stores during theChristmas season.   Manufacturers reported adding 34,000 people to their payrolls inDecember, well behind the 85,000 monthly gain they averaged inOctober and November.   The department said the number of jobless people fell by 9,000 to6,554,000 last month. It reported there were 950,000 ``discouragedworkers'' _ people who want jobs but are not included in theunemployment rate because they have given up looking for work in thebelief that none is available. That figure has been constant sinceearly 1987.   The number of workers employed part-time because they cannot findfull-time work also was unchanged over the past year, remaining at5.3 million.   An alternate jobless rate that includes in the labor force the1.7 million members of the armed forces stationed in the UnitedStates was also 5.3 percent last month, unchanged from November.   The unemployment rate among adult men and adult women remainedunchanged at 4.4 percent in December. Joblessness among teen-agersrose from 14.1 percent in November to 14.8 percent.   The Labor Department said unemployment rates among otherdemographic groups were:   _Blacks, 11.6 percent, up from 11.2 in November.   _Black teen-agers, 29.3 percent, down from 29.9.   _Hispanics, 7.6 percent, down from 8 percent.   _Whites, 4.6 percent, unchanged.</TEXT></DOC>
