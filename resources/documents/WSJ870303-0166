In London, prices also rose.    The Nikkei stock average, which soared 345.00 points Saturday, rose another 167.16 points to close at 20,933.82, the second record in a row and the third in four trading days.    Volume was about 1.2 billion shares, up from 700 million in Saturday's half-day session and 1.1 billion Friday.    The stock exchange index rose 12.44 points to 1,805.61.    Despite the bullish tempo, one trader noted, the index retreated from the day's high of about 20,947.00 notched in the first half-hour. The trader characterized the performance as modestly disappointing following the weekend bull run. Investors still expect a modest correction, analysts said.    Investors cautiously turned from chemicals and food, Saturday's popular issues, to pick up recent laggards.    Consumer-oriented electronics stocks advanced strongly. Monday's relatively quiet yen-dollar exchange rate encouraged the advance, traders said, although some doubted whether it would last long based on lackluster fundamentals in the sector.    Auto makers also got a boost from bullishness about export-led stocks.    Construction issues continued to prosper on optimism about increased government spending for public works under plans to stimulate the domestic economy. Real estate issues also made robust gains.    Shares relating to acquired immune deficiency syndrome generally finished mixed on profit taking as pharmaceutical stocks retreated.    Meanwhile in London, prices ended higher despite a late bout of profit-taking and Wall Street's weak opening.    Coming on moderate trading, the advance was buoyed, brokers said, by optimism about the British economy and anticipation of tax cuts this month. Polls showing a rise in the conservative party's popularity also boosted the market.    London's Financial Times 100-share index set a record. It opened more than seven points higher and almost broke through the 2,000 mark around noon. Despite a decline because of profit-taking, the index closed at 1983.1, up 3.9.    The industrial-share index closed at 1604.5, up 4.7. The gold-mines index fell 5.1, to 324.7.    Brewers soared early in the day on news that restaurants will be allowed to serve alcohol all afternoon.    Pharmaceuticals were hit by profit-taking after their strong gains during the previous weeks.    Beecham Group closed lower despite an earlier advance after it announced it is launching a new anti-arthritis drug in Britain and West Germany.    Unilever PLC rose in anticipation of its results due to be reported today.    Banks advanced, led by Lloyds, whose chairman said it wouldn't be affected too badly by Brazil's decisions to suspend interest payments.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                              % This                        Feb. 27   Feb. 26     Year    U.S. ............... 266.2     265.1     + 16.7    Britain ............ 590.2     590.7     + 18.6    Canada ............. 383.0     381.1     + 14.9    Japan ............. 1070.0    1070.2     + 13.2    France ............. 436.2     429.5     +  6.9    Germany ............ 215.1     216.5     - 17.2    Hong Kong ......... 2031.6    2000.8     + 14.2    Switzerland ........ 185.9     187.4     -  7.4    Australia .......... 293.2     288.2     + 11.1    World index ........ 410.6     410.0     + 15.1</TEXT></DOC>
