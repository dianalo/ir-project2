Thomas Merrill Gaubert of DeSoto, Texas, was accused Tuesday ofpocketing $5.6 million of $8 million he persuaded the CapitolFederal Savings and Loan Association into investing in acondominium project he was developing in Texas.   The Mount Pleasant, Iowa, savings and loan was closed in May,when federal regulators said its Texas investment and other poorlysecured loans had left the company with a negative net worth of $65million.   Gaubert, 48, former owner of the Independent American SavingsAssociation in Irving, Texas, contributed $7,000 to two Wrightpolitical committees in 1985.   In the fall of 1986, Wright, D-Texas, then House majorityleader, arranged a 2{-hour meeting between Federal Home Loan BankBoard Chairman Edwin Gray and Gaubert to air Gaubert's complaintsabout his Sandamp;L's treatment by the board.   Wright said he was simply encouraging Gray to ensure that hisagency was being fair to one of Wright's constituents.   Gaubert is accused of using the Sandamp;L to finance a ``land flip''in a Dallas County, Texas, condominium project he was developing in1982 and 1983.   Gaubert bought about 44 acres of land about 11 miles south ofdowntown Dallas at less than 50 cents per square foot, then sold itthe same day through a middleman to 22 buyers at $5.25 per squarefoot, the indictment alleged.   He is accused of not telling Capitol Federal officials that heowned the land and planned to sell it to investors at inflatedprices.   The indictment charges Gaubert with three counts of wire fraudand one count of making false statements to a federally insuredfinancial institution.   ``I am confident that I will be vindicated,'' Gaubert saidTuesday. ``The transaction in the indictment occurred five yearsago and all of the funds initially borrowed from Capitol Savingswere repaid in 1985.''   No arraignment date has been set for Gaubert.   The Sandamp;L industry in Texas, which leads the nation in losses andfailures, is the focus of a huge federal criminal investigationthat has led to a number of indictments of prominent businessmen.   The maximum penalty for wire fraud is a $1,000 fine and fiveyears in prison. Making false statements to a federally insuredfinancial institution carries a maximum $5,000 fine and two yearsin prison.</TEXT></DOC>
