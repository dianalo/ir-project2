The report Wednesday by the department's Energy InformationAdministration also said known reserves of U.S. crude, including thenewly discovered oil, fell last year for the eighth time in the last10 years.   The report underscored a trend of declining U.S. oil resourcesthat accelerated in the mid-1980s when prices dropped sharply andoil exploration tailed off.   The slower exploration, combined with rising energy demand, hasresulted in a rapid increase in oil imports, which in July suppliedmore than half the nation's petroleum needs for the first time inmore than a decade.   The report said drillers added 553 million barrels of oil lastyear to U.S. reserves, either by discovering new fields, extendingthose already in production or finding new reservoirs in existingfields. That is a 20 percent drop from the 1987 discovery total andis the second lowest on record, the agency said.   Domestic proved oil reserves _ defined as crude oil that could bepumped from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions _totaled 26.8 billion barrels as of Dec. 31, 1988, the report said.That is a drop of 431 million barrels, or 1.6 percent, from a yearearlier.   A barrel equals 42 gallons.   The reserves total has dropped in each year during the pastdecade except in 1984, when a gain of 711 million barrels wasreported, and in 1987 when the total rose by 367 million barrels.   The 1988 total oil reserves would disappear in about nine years,at current rates of consumption, if additional oil were not found.The Interior Department reported last month that undiscovered U.S.oil resources totaled about 49 billion barrels, indicating a further16 years life expectancy for oil in this country.   Proved reserves of natural gas plunged by 10 percent last year to168 trillion cubic feet, the report said, because of a majorrevision of gas reserves for the North Slope of Alaska. The majorcompanies operating on the North Slope agreed that 24.6 trillioncubic feet of gas should be removed from the reported total becausethe prevailing gas prices are too low to make it marketable, thereport said.</TEXT></DOC>
