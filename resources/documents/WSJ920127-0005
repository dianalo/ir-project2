Bowing to pressure from scientists and testing companiesand to concern in Congress, Roche said it will ease licensingand other restrictions that have obstructed access to thetechnology, known as polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, toacademic and private diagnostic labs.</LP><TEXT>   While the immediate effect of the move will be limited,scientists said the decision clears a major bottleneck toeventual development of inexpensive genetic tests forailments ranging from cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophyto heart disease and cancer. PCR can also be used indetection of human immunodeficiency virus, the virus thatcauses acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and otherviruses, as well as in so-called DNA finger-printing testsused to identify criminal suspects or to resolve paternitysuits. Currently, PCR accounts for only a few million dollarsof tests annually, but proponents believe the market willmushroom into a billion-dollar industry by the end of thedecade.   Roche, the U.S. unit of Roche Holding Ltd., the Swisspharmaceutical company, disclosed its intentions at aconference on the commercialization of biotechnology at ColdSpring Harbor Laboratory's Banbury Center here. Details ofthe new policy won't be finalized until next month, when thecompany is expected to announce them at a meeting at theNational Academy of Sciences in Washington D.C. Scientistswelcomed the development.   &quot;I'm very pleased,&quot; said James Watson, the Nobel prizewinner who heads the U.S. program to map the human geneticcode and directs the research lab at Cold Spring Harbor. &quot;Thetechnology is too important to be restricted to any onecompany.&quot;   &quot;Roche is going to allow an industry to happen,&quot; saidDavid Botstein, a prominent molecular biologist at StanfordUniversity. &quot;It will be the Intel of genetic testing,&quot; headded, referring to the semiconductor company whosemicrochips power much of the personal computer industry.   PCR is already fueling a revolution in genetic discoveriesby making it possible to replicate strands of geneticmaterial rapidly and in enormous quantities, significantlyenhancing the ability of researchers to detect specific genesand segments of DNA. As more genes and genetic mutationslinked to disease are discovered, PCR becomes important notonly as a research tool, but in diagnosis as well.   PCR was invented in 1983 by scientists at Cetus Corp.which sold certain diagnostic marketing rights to Roche in1989. In December, Roche acquired the full patent rights toPCR for $300 million as part of a transaction in which ChironCorp., an Emeryville, Calif., biotechnology company, acquiredCetus.   Meanwhile, when researchers announced discovery of agenetic defect that causes cystic fibrosis in 1989, it openeda major new market for genetic testing that until recentlyhas focused on prenatal screening, based on other technology,for Down's Syndrome. Diagnostic labs wanted to license PCR todevelop screening tests for cystic fibrosis.   But under licensing policies established by Cetus andRoche, laboratories are required to pay a $15,000 annual downpayment against royalty fees of $24 or 15% of revenue pertest, according to Arthur L. Beaudet of the Institute forMolecular Genetics at Baylor College in Houston.   In addition, labs aren't permitted to use PCR at all forpaternity tests, a growing diagnostic business, and someother purposes, and can't offer customers significant volumediscounts. Any improvements licensees would make in applyingthe technology would become the property of Roche.   The result has been a cumbersome and expensive licensingprocess that has &quot;cast a pall&quot; over the future of the genetictesting business, says Thomas K. Reed, chairman and chiefexecutive officer of Vivigen Inc., a Santa Fe, N.M., companythat specializes in genetic diagnostic testing. In recentmonths, as Roche took over full ownership of the technology,scientists, including Dr. Beaudet and Dr. Watson, have raisedcomplaints at scientific meetings.   &quot;There was enormous frustration over the {licensing}policy,&quot; said Dr. Watson, the co-discoverer of the molecularstructure DNA. &quot;It was very inhibiting to a large number ofcompanies who wanted to develop products.&quot; Without a move tosignificantly lower barriers to the technology, he said,Congress was poised to hold hearings on the issue.   Douglas S. McQuilkin, vice president of businessdevelopment for Roche Molecular Systems, a new business unitestablished solely to develop PCR-based products, told theweekend conference that Roche would make the technology&quot;available to any lab without restriction&quot; under financialterms that haven't been determined.   Apparently, royalties will be less than under currentpolicy; academic and other not-for-profit labs, for instance,won't pay a down payment and the royalty will be under 10%,he said. Single licenses will cover most human diagnostictests, except for certain forensic tests used in criminal andcivil court cases. Those will be licensed by Perkin-ElmerCorp., Mr. McQuilkin said. He said the company hadn'testimated the financial impact of the new policy, butscientists and others at the meeting predicted that wider useof PCR will prove lucrative for the company. In addition, thecompany plans to introduce PCR test kits within a year, hesaid. And Roche will use PCR in its own diagnotic laboratoryoperations, one of the largest in the U.S.   Assuming the final details satisfy concerns over access tothe technology, the effect in the marketplace will depend onother technological developments, including the discovery ofmore genetic defects linked to inherited diseases and theability to automate genetic testing so several tests can berun simultaneously on a single blood sample. Gene-testingproponents see the possibililty of running a test for say,$200, that would yield 50 different pieces of geneticinformation.   Even if such predictions prove true, prospects for broadpopulation-based genetic screening raise social, economic andethical questions that have yet to be answered. Even at a lowprice, it isn't clear that such tests will lead tocost-effective health care. Ethicists and others aretroubled, for instance, by the likelihood of discovering thatpeople are predisposed to diseases that haven't any cures andby the possibility that insurance companies and employerswill use genetic data to determine health coverage or inhiring.</TEXT></DOC>
