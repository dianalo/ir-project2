(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A gunman whose bullet paralyzed amarathon runner in a freeway shooting last July has been sentencedto the maximum 10-year prison term.   A rash of similar confrontations, including several in whichvictims were killed or injured, plagued Southern California lastsummer. Incidents have been reported sporadically since then.   Albert Carroll Morgan, 33, of Huntington Beach, who apologizedfor shooting Paul Gary Nussbaum, was sentenced Friday to sevenyears for shooting at an occupied vehicle and an additional threeyears for infliction of great bodily injury.   Morgan also was ordered to pay a maximum $10,000 to the victimrestitution fund by Orange County Superior Court Judge JeanRheinheimer.   Morgan shot Nussbaum on July 18, 1987, while Nussbaum wasdriving on the southbound Costa Mesa Freeway during rush-hourtraffic.   Nussbaum, 29, confined to a wheelchair, said he was satisfiedwith Morgan's sentence.   ``I feel that he should spend the rest of his life in prison,''said Nussbaum. ``But the judge did what she had to do. I'm reallyglad he got the maximum.''   A jury convicted Morgan in February of the felony charges ofvoluntary manslaughter, assault with a firearm and shooting at aninhabited vehicle.   In another case, jurors began deliberations Friday in Compton inthe case of Ronald Elam, 28, who is charged with first-degreemurder, two counts of attempted murder and two counts of assaultwith a deadly weapon in connection with an Aug. 17, 1987, roadwayshooting.</TEXT></DOC>
