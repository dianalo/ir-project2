VAXminicomputer as a router between Hyperchannel-50 and TCP/IP networks.andM;Using the VAX as a router, especially when network traffic was high, tookprecious computing resources away from application processing, in effectrestricting the VAX to serving as a dedicated router, according to Tom Bohan,manager of the Scientific Computer Center at Tektronix Inc., a manufacturerof electronic testing and measurement equipment in Beaverton, Ore.andM;Catlett and Bohan both used the high-end VAX 780 as a router betweenHyperchannel and Ethernet networks, and found its performance lacking,especially as the networks grew in size.andM;''We started out with 68 mainframes, and we used VAXes as gateways forrouting packets around using TCP protocols,'' said Bohan.andP;  Tektronix's68-node network quickly expanded to 1,500 as users began working withtechnical workstations from Sun Microsystems Inc., Apollo Computer Inc. andothers.andM;''We became a more distributed-processing organization needing to move moreinformation around, but the VAXes became a bottleneck -- they couldn't handlethe throughput,'' he explained.andM;''By going to the new routers, we were able to flatten network [hierarchy],increase speed and throughput, and we were able to handle the growth,'' saidBohan.andM;''We needed something to make the networks manageable.andP;  We have 50 networks,and we're going up to 70 now.andP;  Everybody was doing their own thing, and we'drun into addressing problems, or engineers would hook up new equipment thatwould cause 'broadcast storms,' '' recalled Bohan.andM;To make it possible for 10 network support people to manage 1,500 users,Tektronix used the Hyperchannel-50 network as a high-speed backboneinterconnecting the lower-speed subnetworks through the routers, he said.andM;The routers were used to filter traffic so that only data intended for adifferent part of the internet is allowed onto the high-speed backbone.andP;  Suchfiltering keeps problems in one subnet from affecting the whole internet,Bohan said.andM;The routers, which are Ethernet-to-Ethernet as well asEthernet-to-Hyperchannel, also provided a logical boundary for differentnetworking domains within Tektronix, so that each domain can be managedlocally.andM;''What we've done is partition the networks and then assigned responsibilityand trained a system administrator for defining the network -- i.e., who'susing it, the number of workstations, naming the workstations, creatingdirectories of workstations,'' explained Bohan.andM;''Now, instead of 1,500 users, we're just working with 20 to 30 people.andP;  It'seasier to coordinate upgrades, and because we keep everything withinsegments, we have greater security,'' he said.andM;Security is a major concern for the regional National Center forSupercomputing Applications network (NCSAnet), which connects nineuniversities, two national laboratories and five corporate laboratories,according to Catlett.andP;  The NCSAnet is also a part of the National ScienceFoundation network, which provides approximately 3,500 users at 175 researchinstitutions with access to the center's two Cray supercomputers.andM;The filtering provided in the router improves security on the internet,according to Catlett.andM;''You can do security on types of applications, so that you can screen outcertain applications in one or both directions, rather than just screening onaddresses.'' he said.andP;  ''Also, you can keep track of traffic between anarbitrary set of hosts on the network through the router.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
