Proposes to Acquire Portec in Stock Swap </HL><SO> </SO><CO> IBL POR </CO><IN> TNM </IN><DATELINE> GREENWICH, Conn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Iroquois Brands Ltd. said it proposed to acquire Portec Inc. in a stock swap with an indicated value of $12.6 million.    The vitamin and pharmaceutical maker said it made its offer as a result of a discussion between members of its management and Zohar Ben-Dov, Portec's chairman, and Allen S. Greene, a Portec director.    In Oak Brook, Ill., however, James C. Horton, Portec's vice president and secretary, characterized the proposal as &quot;unsolicited&quot; and declined to comment on whether Messrs. Ben-Dov and Greene had met with Iroquois officials.    Mr. Horton said the Iroquois proposal is &quot;incomplete,&quot; adding &quot;it doesn't have all the terms.&quot; Nevertheless, he said Portec's directors would evaluate the proposal &quot;in due course.&quot;    Mr. Ben-Dov, a New York real estate investor, and Mr. Greene, president of a financial consulting firm, were elected to Portec's board in March. The two lead an investor group that in February said it held 10.6% of Portec and had talked with Portec about possible transactions concerning the company. The group also said at the time that it had been contacted by third parties interested in acquiring Portec, &quot;possibly on a hostile basis.&quot;    Portec makes railroad, construction and materials-handling equipment. Iroquois said it was proposing a merger because its new chairman and chief executive officer, Malcolm H. Stockdale, &quot;has significant years of experience&quot; in fields related to Portec's business &quot;and believes he will be able to place Iroquois in an important world-wide position in this industry.&quot;    Under terms of the offer, Iroquois Brands said it would exchange one share of its common stock for five shares of Portec common. Portec has about 2.8 million shares outstanding.    Iroquois Brands said the offer would be subject to refinancing of Portec's defaulted bank loan, entering into satisfactory agreements with Portec management, and approval by the companies' holders.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Iroquois Brands closed at $22.625, up 12.5 cents, while Portec closed at $5.625, up 25 cents.    Iroquois said that as of March 31, Portec has classified all of its nearly $56 million in liabilities as currently payable. </TEXT></DOC>
