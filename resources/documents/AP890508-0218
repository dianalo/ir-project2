American officials say the Soviets spend at least $1 billion ayear to obtain Western technology and often will pay more thanthree times market value for something they want.   Analysts say the Soviets obtain high technology with the help ofunscrupulous Western businessmen who may acquire the goods legally,then divert them to the East illegally. Soviet agents get othermaterial through espionage.   The diversions are taking place in the more relaxed atmospherecreated by Mikhail S. Gorbachev's peace and disarmament overtures,which have altered Western perceptions of the Soviet threat.   ``There is no sign that Soviet efforts have diminished, andevidence is that they are increasing,'' said William Waldegrave,Britain's deputy foreign secretary.   Francois Heisbourg, head of the International Institute forStrategic Studies in London, said losses now may surpass those ofthe late 1970s, when Soviet agents penetrated key ministries inFrance and West Germany.   ``We will see an enormous draw from the West,'' said JohnGalvin, the American general who commands NATO forces in Europe.``We'll probably lose the technological edge we've had fordecades.''   The United States and 16 allies belong to the CoordinatingCommittee on Multilateral Export Controls, known as CoCom, whichtries to stem the flow of sensitive military goods to the Sovietbloc.   Stephen Bryen, former U.S. deputy undersecretary of defense fortrade security, estimated Western businessmen smuggled items worthup to $2 billion to the Soviet East in 1988.   Recent diversions and thefts, analysts say, have allowed Sovietengineers to make more accurate missiles, quieter submarines andstronger aircraft wings, and to clone advanced computers they mighthave taken years to develop.   They say the Soviets also are acquiring such new battlefieldtechnology as helicopter weapons systems and tank armor, andWestern experts worry that the trend to greater trade between Eastand West will increase the flow.   ``There is no question they are ... on a path toward gettingmore technology,'' said Richard Perle, a former top Pentagonofficial who championed export controls. ``We certainly gave away alot during detente, and this looks like a rerun.''   Gorbachev's ambitious plan to modernize the Soviet economy hascreated intense interest in Western business circles.   Dozens of Western companies are entering joint ventures thateventually may offer Soviet consumers a variety and quantity ofgoods and services not available now. Joint ventures also mayprovide Western technology, money and management expertiseGorbachev sorely needs.   Some Western allies urge caution lest such cooperation allow theSoviets to concentrate its scarce resources on defense projects,but others want to help Gorbachev's liberalization program.   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany saidrecently: ``In view of the great economic problems confronting theSoviet Union, as well as its process of restructuring, a Westernreadiness for cooperation in the economic sector is stronglyneeded, not least in our own interest.''   An American serving in Paris said privately that, if the thawcontinues, ``it will probably be more and more difficult tomaintain the support for CoCom that we've had.''   John C. Kelley Jr., director of strategic investigations for theU.S. Customs Service in Washington, said increased trade willprovide ``more opportunity to mask some of the items and ...commingle more high-technology merchandise'' with legitimate goods.   CoCom, based in Paris, regulates shipments of weapons, nucleartechnology and ``dual-use'' products, such as communicationsequipment, that have both commercial and military applications.   Aaron Karp of the Stockholm International Peace ResearchInstitute said Soviet engineers now are seeking manufacturingprocesses rather than single items.   In March, West German authorities accused several Germancomputer hackers of pirating technical data from the Pentagon andresearch centers in the United States, Europe and Japan over twoyears. Investigators say the hackers sold it to the Soviets formoney and drugs.   Authorities said the information helped Soviet engineers readdata in some crucial industrial and military installations.   ``This is a new quality of espionage by the East,'' said GerhardBoemen, chief of West German intelligence services.   Espionage successes for the Soviets mean Western researchersmust invest heavily to find something better than what has beenlost.   NATO officials say a spy ring in the U.S. Army in West Germany,broken up last August, gave the Kremlin even more sensitiveinformation than originally believed.   Italian authorities charged two men in February with sellingsecrets about a computer system being developed for the alliance.   French police seized a disassembled particle accelerator packedin 18 crates and destined for the Soviet Academy of Sciences inMoscow. The police arrested Aime Richardt, who was implicated inprevious cases. French customs charged that the machine is used toaccelerate heavy ions, which gives it military applications. ButRichardt claimed it was an accelerator of light ions and wassuitable only for scientific research. The case is still pending ina French court.   Viktor Karpov, the Soviet arms negotiator, laughed when askedwhether Moscow's theft of technology had increased.   ``Look at that Florida case,'' he said. ``The man tried to sellto the FBI, not the KGB.''   A former defense worker in Florida had called the Soviet Embassyto offer plans. FBI agents on the line arrested him.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
