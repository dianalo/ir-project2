James Njiru, minister for national guidance and politicalaffairs, said Tuesday that the banning was based on ``a shortreview'' of the book, which many Moslems consider blasphemous.   The review, Njiru said, ``clearly indicates that the content ofthe book is offensive to Moslems who constitute an important sectionof the Kenyan community.''   About 6 percent of this African country's 20 million peoplebelong to the Islamic community, which had asked the government toinstitute the ban.   Other countries that have banned the book include India,Pakistan, Egypt and South Africa.   Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has called on Moslems to seekout and kill Rushdie, who is in hiding, and his government hasthreatened to break diplomatic relations with Britain unless itdenounces the author.   Britain is among more than a dozen European countries that haverecalled their ambassadors from Iran over the death threat.</TEXT></DOC>
