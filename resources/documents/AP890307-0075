Craig?</HEAD><TEXT>   Q. On that regard, on human rights, will it always be the firstthing you mention with the Soviets, as it was under President Reagan?   A. I don't recall it always being the first thing, because thelast meeting I attended with him and Mr. Gorbachev it was raised,but it wasn't the first thing.   But it will be high on our agenda.   I confidently expect that Jim Baker will continue to raise it.   And yes, it will be an agenda item.   Q. Mr. President, on the air strike, your opposition on CapitolHill, many of the Democrats up there, wanted you to intervene inthis strike. Should you have to go to Congress for emergencylegislation to deal with secondary boycotts, it is likely they aregoing to say, ``No, no. We want you to intervene first.'' If theEastern pilots succeed and the machinists succeed in imposingsecondary boycotts, you seem to be on a collision course there. Willyour policy hold firm?   A. It will hold firm.   The secretary is testifying, I think at this very moment, aboutthe kind of legislation you are talking about and some wanting tocompel the president to convene this board.   So there are two schools of thought.   I still feel that the best answer is a head-on-head, man-to-mannegotiation between the union and the airline.   And I think that is better and more lasting, incidentally _ theagreement that would stem from that _ more lasting than an imposedgovernment settlement which could cause the airline to totally shutdown.   So I think there could be some, you know, confrontation.   But I will stick with my view, and I will keep _ and if, indeed,innocent parties are threatened through the secondary boycottmechanism, I will move promptly with the Congress, and what wouldhappen, and I don't want to buy into a lot of hypothesis here, butyou would have an outcry from the American people on the basis of _that I mentioned about that commuter.   It is not fair to, you know, have innocent people victimized by astruggle between Eastern Airlines and the Machinists union.   So there may be a different _ a closely-fought contest, and theremight _ I know there's some widely differing views on this.   Q. But if that should happen, sir, you must recognize that therewould be great pressure on you to at least stop it for 60 days. Areyou intent on not doing that?   A. I am intent on staying with what I've outlined is ouradministration's policy, and it is the correct policy.   And I think it's the best way to have a solution to this question.
