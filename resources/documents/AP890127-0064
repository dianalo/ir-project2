As tensions escalated during the last phases of the Soviet troopwithdrawal, Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Thursdayordered the U.S. Embassy in Kabul closed, citing increased turmoilin the Afghan capital.   Japan today also ordered its embassy closed in Kabul and itsdiplomatic personnel to leave the country because of deterioratingconditions.   Western diplomats in Islamabad quoted reports from Kabul thatSoviet and Afghan forces had launched a major shelling attack onboth ends of the 10-mile Salang Tunnel in an effort to reopen thecrucial Salang Highway, which is carrying Red Army troops home fromAfghanistan.   The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, quotedwitnesses as calling the attack a ``major atrocity.''   A dispatch from Kabul received by one Western embassy quotedreports of witnesses seeing ``Soviet tanks rolling over dead bodiesof victims'' along the highway, which runs for 250 miles betweenKabul and the Soviet border.   The tunnel, part of the highway, cuts through the Hindu Kushmountains about 60 miles north of the capital.   ``After shelling the north and south ends of the Salang tunnel,Soviet and Afghan artillery obliterated all dwellings and villagessouth of the tunnel,'' the diplomats quoted the reports as saying.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said,``There are eyewitnesses who say no dwellings remain and hundreds ofcivilians were killed.''   The dispatch received by the Western embassy said the report ofall houses being destroyed came from three separate sources,including a diplomat who defends the Afghan government.   Afghan media and military officers had reported 377 guerrillaswere killed Tuesday along the Salang Highway, where the insurgentsfighting the Kabul government have attacked many food and fuelconvoys trying to reach the capital.   Heavy snows also have blocked parts of the road, and Kabul hassuffered severe food and fuel shortages as the end of the Sovietmilitary withdrawal approaches.   Moslem guerrillas, backed by the United States and Pakistan, havefought tha Kabul government since a Communist coup in April 1978.Soviet troops intevened in 1979 to fight the rebels. Last May, theRed Army began withdrawing under a U.N.-mediated agreement and allSoviet military forces are to be gone by Feb. 15.   The diplomats attributed the brutal Soviet and Afghan attackMonday to a desire to intimidate Ahmed Shah Masoud, generallyconsidered the most effective guerrilla commander in Afghanistan.   Masoud controls the Panjshir Valley, through which the SalangHighway runs.   In Islamabad, the Pakistani government said today that SovietForeign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze would arrive next week fortalks on a settlement in Afghanistan.   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Shevardnadze would meet Feb. 4with President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto andForeign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan. There was no immediateconfirmation from Moscow.   Shevardnadze would be the highest ranking Soviet leader to visitPakistan in more than 20 years.   In another development Thursday, the army tried to countercharges it has dragged young men from their homes to fight Afghanguerrillas by displaying what it said were volunteers _ solemnteen-agers and men in their late 30s.   As the Soviet military withdraws, Afghanistan's conscript armydesperately needs recruits. Although two years of army service ismandatory, thousands of Afghans have deserted. Many young men havefled the country either to avoid conscription or to join theinsurgents.   Baker's decision to shut down the Kabul embassy came on his firstday at his new job.   The U.S. diplomatic contingent in Kabul already had been reducedto less than 10 officers and security guards. An official source inWashington, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the pulloutwould be carried out over several days.   A growing list of countries are debating whether to do the same.On Saturday, the West German Embassy became the first foreignembassy to close.   Besides the diplomatic group, fewer than 20 private U.S. citizensremain in Afghanistan. Most Westerners are with the InternationalAid Mission, a charitable organization that has operated inAfghanistan for many years.   The U.S. Embassy said Tuesday it sent a warning letter toAmericans that ``a critical point'' had come in the Kabul area,increased instablity was likely, and they should leave whilecommercial flights remained available.   Only the Soviet airline Aeroflot and Ariana, the Afghangovernment airline, still operate from Kabul. Aeroflot uses militaryplanes and Ariana flights are unpredictable, sometimes delayed orcanceled for lack of fuel.</TEXT></DOC>
