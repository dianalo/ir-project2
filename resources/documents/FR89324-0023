Telephone: (202) 732-1297.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>These regulations establish a new Part380 that contains regulations for three kinds of supported employment discretionarygrant program authorized under section 311 of the Rehabiliation Act: Statewidesupported employment demonstration projects; community-based supportedemployment projects; and technical assistance projects.The purpose of Statewide supported employment demonstration projects isto reorganize, expand, or, if appropriate, convert existing Statewide programsof rehabilitation for individuals with severe handicaps to programs thatoffer supported employment services. Grant funds are to be spent for thecosts of program development and reorganization, staff training, and evaluation.While grant recipients must also provide, or ensure the provision of, directservices to individuals, grant funds cannot be used for this purpose.By contrast, community-based supported employment projects serve a morelocalized geographical area and must develop innovative approaches to improveand expand the delivery of supported employment services. These projectsare designed to enhance local service delivery capacity. Grant funds payfor direct services to individuals but only for a maximum period of 18months.Technical assistance projects provide assistance to State vocational rehabilitationagencies in implementing the State Supported Employment Services Programauthorized under Title VI, C of the Rehabilitation Act.Because the purposes of these three supported employment programs vary,the regulations contain three different sets of selection criteria at andSection;andSection;380.11, 380.12, and 380.13.On May 3, 1988, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking(NPRM) for these programs in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 15776). Except for minor technical andeditorial revisions, there are no differences between the NPRM and thesefinal regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes</ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 21 parties submittedcomments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments and ofthe changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows.Issues are grouped according to subject, with appropriate sections of theregulations referenced.Who is Eligible for an Award? Section 380.2<T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters expressed concern that the Staterehabilitation agency is placed in direct competition with any other eligibleorganization that chooses to apply for a supported employment statewidedemonstration project grant. One commenter recommended that applicantsother than State vocational rehabilitation agencies should not be permittedto apply for such grants.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Organizations eligible to apply for grants under section311 of the Act are designated in the statute and cannot be limited by theSecretary.<T3>Change: </T3>None.Activities the Secretary May Fund Under Statewide Supported EmploymentDemonstration Projects, Section 380.4<T3>Comments: </T3>Many commenters expressed concern that these regulationsmay force a change in the nature and scope of the existing 27 statewidedemonstration projects to limit services provided to supported employmentservices. Also, several commenters were concerned that the list of supportedemployment services in this section are not precisely identical to thesupported employment services specified in Part 363. Other commenters wereconcerned that the list of supported employment services implied a limitationthat only the listed services were to be provided.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The regulations were not intended to require any changein the nature and scope of the existing statewide demonstration projects.The services listed in andSection; 380.4(b)(2) are only examples of servicesthat may be provided and are not intended to limit the nature of supportedemployment services that grantees may make available.<T3>Change: </T3>A change was made to make it clear that authorized supportedemployment services to individuals are not limited to those enumeratedin the regulations.Technical Assistance Supported Employment Projects, Section 380.6<T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter suggested that RSA should be providingtechnical assistance on supported employment directly rather than providingit through grants or contracts.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Technical Assistance Supported Employment projectsgrant authority was added by the 1986 amendments to the Act. The Secretaryviews these projects as complementary to, and not a replacement for, directtechnical assistance provided by RSA.<T3>Change: </T3>None.List of Applicable Regulations, Section 380.8<T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter requested that the Client Assistance Project(CAP) regulations should be included in the list of regulations that applyto supported employment projects.<T3>Discussion: </T3>This section only refers to those regulations thatdirectly apply to applicants and project grantees. Other regulations thatmay indirectly affect a grantee or a supported employment client are notincluded in this section.<T3>Change: </T3>None.Definitions, Section 380.9(c)<T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter pointed out that the definition of ``traditionallytime-limited post-employment services'' is different than the definitionof this term in Part 363.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The definitions are not intended to be identical.Under section 311 of this Act, grantees are not mandated to establish collaborativeagreements to ensure the provision of extended supported employment servicesand to develop individualized written rehabilitation programs for clients.These requirements are imposed by the Title VI, C program and are reflectedin the Part 363 definition. Otherwise, the definitions are the same.<T3>Change: </T3>None.Participation and Coordination, Section 380.11(h)(2) (i) and (ii)<T3>Comments: </T3>Two commenters stated that the language implies thatsupported employment is intended primarily for school-age children sinceparents or other representatives are to be involved in project planningand decisionmaking. Several commenters felt the language in the sectionimplies that the kinds of agencies expected to participate in the projectsare limited and that other agencies which should be sharing responsibilityfor supported employment are not mentioned. Many State vocational rehabilitationagency commenters believed no grants should be awarded unless the applicationis accompanied by a letter of support and involvement from the appropriateState vocational rehabilitation agency. A commenter also suggested thatmore than 15 points be assigned to this selection criterion to reinforcethe necessity for the involvement of the State vocational rehabilitationagency.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes that, if appropriate, parentsor other representatives of individuals with severe handicaps should beinvolved in these projects, including planning and decisionmaking. Theregulations are not intended to imply that the projects are exclusivelyintended for school-age children or any particular disability group.The Secretary agrees that the illustrative list of collaborating Stateagencies and organizations should be expanded in order to clarify thatsupported employment may be appropriate for any individual with severehandicaps, regardless of type of disability.The Secretary believes in the importance of collaboration between Statevocational rehabilitation agencies and grantees involved in these programsand encourages potential applicants to obtain letters of support from Statevocational rehabilitation agencies; however, there is no statutory basisfor requiring written documentation.In determining the number of points to allocate to any one criterion, theSecretary weighs the relative importance of the various aspects of theprogram and exercises judgment in determining the weight to be given toeach criterion. The Secretary believes that 15 points is adequate to ensurethat all applicants will involve the State vocational rehabilitation agencyand other appropriate agencies in the application process.<T3>Changes: </T3>Changes have been made in the regulations to make itclear that parents or other representatives of individuals with severehandicaps are to be involved in project planning and decisionmaking, ifappropriate. The illustrative list of collaborating State agencies andother organizations has been expanded to mention other agencies and organizationsthat the Secretary believes could and should share responsibility for supportedemployment. The list includes State and other agencies responsible forvocational rehabilitation, special education, developmental disabilities,mental health, social services, medicaid, social security, veterans programs,and rehabilitation facilities.<T3>Conversion, Sections 380.4, 380.6, 380.11(f)(1)</T3><T3>Comments: </T3>A number of commenters recommended changes in the regulatorylanguage concerning converting existing programs to programs providingsupported employment services. The commenters stated that the regulationsshould be modified to clearly reflect that it is not the intention of theSecretary to require that the total resources of existing programs be devotedto supported employment.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that the language in the NPRMneeds clarification. The activities authorized by these regulations areintended to foster statewide change by facilitating the reorganization,expansion, or, if appropriate, the conversion of existing programs to providesupported employment services. In some cases, this will involve a majorchange of direction in a statewide or local program; in others, the supportedemployment program will assist, support, or be complementary to other servicesprovided in an existing program.<T3>Change: </T3>The regulations have been changed to make it clear thatthe authorized activities are to facilitate reorganization, expansion,or, if appropriate, conversion of existing programs to offer supportedemployment services.<T3>Ongoing Services for Individuals with Severe Physical Disabilities</T3><T3>Comments: </T3>A commenter expressed concern about the lack of long-termfunding for supported employment for individuals with severe physical disabilities.This commenter believed that the effect of the proposed supported employmentregulations would be to exclude these individuals from supported employment.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The regulations are not intended to, nor in fact dothey, exclude individuals with severe physical disabilities from receivingsupported employment services. The problem of long-term funding is nota regulatory issue. States have the option to include provision for extendedservices for individuals with severe physical disabilities in their socialservices and medicaid programs funded under titles XIX and XX of the SocialSecurity Act. Also, RSA is reviewing other possible sources of long-termfunding for extended services and encourages States to do the same.<T3>Change: </T3>None.<T3>Reports, Sections 380.20, 380.21</T3><T3>Comments: </T3>A commenter requested that all Technical Assistanceand Community-based projects be required to provide copies of all researchdata, including statistics, to State vocational rehabilitation agencies.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that exchange of this informationwith State vocational rehabilitation agencies is desirable; however, thereis no basis in the statute to mandate this exchange. Further, the Secretaryhas determined that the paperwork requirements imposed by statute and reflectedin proposed andSection;andSection; 380.20 and 380.21 should not be includedin the final regulations. Any reporting of this nature is already coveredunder 34 CFR 80.40(b) (Nonconstruction performance reports).<T3>Change: </T3>Sections 380.20 and 380.21 have been deleted from thefinal regulations.<T3>Publication of the Regulations</T3><T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter stated that the regulations should be publishedby the Commissioner rather than by the Secretary in accordance with section12(c) of the Act.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 3 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Act),as amended, states that ``Any reference in this Act to duties to be carriedout by the Commissioner shall be considered to be a reference to dutiesto be carried out by the Secretary acting through the commissioner.'' Inaddition, section 412 of the Department of Education Organization Act (DEOA),Pub. L. 96-88 (1980), states that ``No delegation of functions by the Secretary* * * shall relieve the Secretary of responsibility for the administrationof such functions.'' Finally, the definition of ``Secretary'' found at34 CFR 77.1 applies to all Department programs and means, in addition tothe Secretary of the Department of Education, any official or employeeof the Department acting for the Secretary under a delegation of authority.Taken together, the above authorities clearly support the authority ofthe Secretary to publish these regulations and the use of the term ``Secretary''rather than the term ``Commissioner'' in these regulations because theSecretary is ultimately responsible for the administration of this program.<T3>Change: </T3>None.<ITAG tagnum="84"><T3>Executive Order 12291</T3></ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291.
