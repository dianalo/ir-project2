On Tuesday, student leaders gave the government 24 hours torecognize their student union or they would take to the streetsagain. Thousands demonstrated for democracy and freedom in Shanghai.   The developments added new tension to a situation the governmenthas been trying to calm by holding talks with officially sanctionedstudent unions.   Last week's activism crested with a march of 150,000 studentsand their supporters in China's capital.   The official student unions took no part in the marches, thebiggest in communist China's history, and student activists say thetalks won't satisfy their yearnings for a freer and more open China.   Beijing police announced they would close central Beijing'sTiananmen Square on Thursday, the 70th anniversary of China's firststudent protests, in what appeared to be an effort to head off anew student march.   The government also said unidentified non-students who opposeCommunist rule have been advising the student protesters frombehind the scenes, and suggested that leading dissident Fang Lizhimight be one of them.   Government spokesman Yuan Mu told a news conference that thesepeople ``try to accomplish during disturbances goals that theycannot attain in circumstances of political stability.''   Yuan stopped short of directly accusing Fang, an internationallyrenowned astrophysicist, of advising the student protesters. But hequestioned Fang's patriotism and said, ``The role Mr. Fang wants toplay in the current disturbances will be decided by his words anddeeds.''   Fang, who previously has called Marxism a failure and called formulti-party democracy, has not taken part in any of the studentprotests that began April 15. Speeches he made on campuses in 1986were blamed for stirring up 1986-87 pro-democracy marches, and hewas ousted from the party.   Yuan refused to say what the government will do if students tryto march Thursday.   The protest in Shanghai, China's most important trading andindustrial city, began in the early afternoon when about 6,000students, carrying banners reading ``give us democracy andfreedom,'' blocked traffic in front of city government offices.   Student leaders presented petitions demanding political reformand the Xinhua News Agency said the protest ended about 10 p.m.   An American teacher said a class boycott, which started inBeijing and spread earlier this week to Tianjin, has moved toShanghai. About half of the students at Fudan University, thecity's leading school, are striking, said Jason Hurtado, ofPortland, Ore.   He quoted student activists at Fudan as saying that studentleaders from Beijing helped organize the strike and the march.Student leaders have also been sent to Beijing for morecoordination, he said. Earlier, students from Tianjin came toBeijing for guidance with their movement.   In Beijing, 65 student leaders from 33 universities bicycledmore than 7{ miles to deliver an ultimatum to the National People'sCongress, China's legislature; the State Council, its cabinet; andthe Central Committee of the ruling Communist Party.   In a handwritten letter, the students demanded the governmentrecognize and hold talks with the United Association of BeijingUniversities, an independent association set up during their2-week-old campaign for democratic reform. They want a free press,freedom of assembly and publication and an end to officialcorruption.   Thursday marks the 70th anniversary of China's first studentdemonstration, which turned into a movement for democratic andscientific reforms.   Beijing students already have marched five times to TiananmenSquare since April 17, defying police warnings. An estimated 70,000students at 41 colleges in Beijing also have been boycotting classsince April 24.   After a march April 27 drew cheers and applause from tens ofthousands of bystanders, the government held a series of meetingswith invited students.   However, most of those invited have been members of theofficially established student unions. The government has declaredthe students' new association illegal.   For its part the association has rejected the talks with thegovernment as a sham, accusing officials of trying to placatestudents without agreeing to democratic reforms.   Despite student complaints, however, the government does seem tobe responding to public pressure.   On Saturday, Sunday and Monday, ministers of three governmentbureaus along with the government's leading spokesman and the mayorand party secretary of Beijing met with students.   The meetings were unprecedented in a society whose leaders hidefrom public scrutiny.   The state-run press has softened its shrill editorial stance onthe movement and several in-depth reports on the talks and thedemonstrations have appeared.</TEXT></DOC>
