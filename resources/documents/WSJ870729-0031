Garcia</HL><DD> 07/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   The stock market rallied yesterday on the strength of a handful of stocks, as investors largely ignored higher oil prices and a weaker bond market.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 25.83 to a record 2519.77, surpassing its previous record of 2510.04, set July 17.    The stock market opened on a strong note, climbing more than 19 points in the first few minutes of trading as investors clamored to buy three issues in the industrial average -- Boeing, American Express and Merck. Early in the session, a stronger dollar and higher bond prices also provided support for the higher stock prices. The advance took place without some of the usual leaders, such as International Business Machines and Digital Equipment.    The advance was led by the 30-stock industrial average, and broader market barometers lagged a bit. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.68 to 312.33, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index moved up 0.77 to 175.24.    Despite the advance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, volume was only slightly higher on the Big Board, and advancing issues still didn't have an overwhelming lead over decliners. Volume rose to 172.6 million from 152 million shares Monday as gainers had a 900 to 673 lead over losers.    Boeing opened sharply higher on news that Mesa Limited Partnership plans to acquire a sizable stake in the aircraft company. Investors were cheered by American Express's buy-back plans, while hopes of a stock buy-back and dividend increase stirred interest in Merck.    A sharp rise in crude oil prices amid worries of increased hostilities in the Persian Gulf wiped out all of the gains in the bond market. But the stock market, traders said, picked up steam in late afternoon.    Ralph Bloch, a technical analyst with Raymond James andamp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla., said he had been telling clients that any trips over 2500 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average should be used for selling unless volume and the number of advancing issues increased. &quot;But if volume and breadth open up and the advance gets big and healthy, I'm sure not going to fight it,&quot; he said.    Michael Metz, a market strategist with Oppenheimer in New York, said the advance may just reflect &quot;shrinking supply and lots of money in the investment system.&quot;    He said that with high cash flow and low capital spending, such companies as Merck and American Express are finding no better way to spend their money than to buy their own stock. Aggressive pools of capital devoted to acquisitions and leveraged buyouts as well as foreign companies looking for bargains in the U.S. are also adding to the demand for stock at a time when new supply from initial public offerings is hardly noticeable, Mr. Metz said.    Boeing jumped 7 1/8 to 53 3/4 on trading of more than 5.8 million shares. Late Monday, the company disclosed that Mesa Limited Partnership plans to acquire more than $15 million of Boeing's common stock and is seeking regulatory approval to buy as much as 15% of the aircraft maker. Boeing adopted an anti-takeover plan.    Alan Benasuli at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. hardly thinks Boeing is a cheap takeover target. He said that because military spending looks like it has peaked, the company's profit margins and earnings are likely to come down significantly. He believes the stock is overpriced on the fundamental prospects for the company, and without a takeover possibility, Boeing should be selling in the $40-a-share to $45-a-share range.    Other defense stocks initially traded higher, following Boeing's early surge. But most of their gains were pared by the closing bell.    Merck moved up 3 5/8 to 188 1/8. The drug company raised its quarterly dividend to 80 cents from 55 cents and approved the purchase of as much as $1 billion of its common shares.    Eastman Kodak rose 2 1/4 to 90 5/8 on expectations that the company will report higher quarterly earnings.    IBM fell 7/8 to 161 1/4; a rating on the stock was reportedly lowered by a Wall Street firm. Digital Equipment sank 2 7/8 to 160 5/8; Alex. Brown andamp; Sons lowered its earnings estimates on the company.    Takeover speculation continued fueling gains in media and publishing stocks. Time jumped 3 5/8 to 109 1/8, MCA rose 1 1/2 to 59 7/8 and McGraw-Hill moved up 4 1/8 to 74 1/2.    Auto stocks were lower as the United Auto Workers began contract negotiations with Ford Motor and General Motors this week.    American Express announced after the market closed Monday that it plans to buy back as much as 9.3% of its shares over the next two to three years. The stock moved up 7/8 to 36 1/8 on volume of more than 2.7 million shares.    Jim Walter moved up 3 to 61 1/2 in active trading. The company said late Monday that it was exploring ways to maximize shareholder value and is providing information to outside parties interested in acquiring the company, in addition to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Earlier this month, Kohlberg offered to acquire Jim Walter for about $2.03 billion, or $50 a share.    Several oil stocks moved up as crude prices climbed on renewed concern about tensions in the Persian Gulf. The September crude oil contract rose 83 cents to $21.32 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.    Chevron rose 1 to 60 3/4, Atlantic Richfield added 1 5/8 to 94 5/8, Mobil moved up 1 1/2 to 52 5/8, Phillips Petroleum gained 1 1/4 to 17 1/2 and Occidental Petroleum rose 5/8 to 37 5/8. But Exxon was unchanged at 92.    USX added 1/2 to 37 1/2 in active trading. The company reported second-quarter net income rose to $149 million from $14 million a year earlier.    Reynolds Metals fell 7/8 to 51. The company acquired a 25% interest in a new state-of-the-art aluminum smelter in Becancour, Quebec, from France's state-controlled Pechiney.    Biogen rose 3/8 to 10 7/8 in the over-the-counter market. The firm agreed to sell its biotechnology research facilities in Geneva to Glaxo Holdings, which rose 3/4 to 29 1/8.
