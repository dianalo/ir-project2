Until now. Now they have become very impatient withtheir government.   One part of their government, the National Institute onAging, set up a state-of-the-art test of THA, the drug Dr.William Summers described in 1986 as a potential treatmentfor Alzheimer's. The government also sought out a large drugcompany, Warner-Lambert, to organize a clinical trial at 16centers and pay most of the costs. THA, or tacrine, was onwhat the government chooses to call a &quot;fast-track&quot; approvalprocess. That was in 1987. Four years later, on March 15, thedecision to approve THA fell, as always, to the Food and DrugAdministration.</LP><TEXT>   An FDA-picked advisory committee of what the agencyregards as eight outside experts spent 14 hours in a hotelroom near Washington discussing THA. It concluded about 10p.m. that despite the submitted evidence that THA helped 41%of the patients who took it, the committee would not approveTHA for the nation's estimated four million Alzheimer'svictims. One committee member said, &quot;We need a cleanerdesign.&quot;   By all means, let us have a &quot;cleaner design&quot; for the nextTHA study. There of course aren't going to be any more largestudies of THA. The task of assembling 16 centers, recruitinga suitable number of subjects desperate enough to riskgetting the placebo, and sustaining a complex study protocolis huge. No, what happens now is that Warner-Lambert and theFDA hold meetings, and people inside the FDA will hold moremeetings about those meetings.   The FDA's senior officials could overrule the committee,but that is rarely done. The agency could reconvene a newcommittee, but that too would upset procedure. There must bea small temple in the basement of the FDA's headquarters,where candles are burning to Procedure.   In the columns nearby, Alzheimer's families describe theirown experiences with THA and their opinions of the FDA'sprocedures. Clinical investigators dismiss views such asthese as &quot;anecdotal.&quot; They look like very impressiveanecdotes to us.   (See related story: &quot;An Alzheimer's Demonstration&quot; -- WSJApril 30, 1991)   They also share a lot in common with the AIDS activists.Close readers will notice that some of the writers refer tothemselves as criminals. For a very short while the FDAallowed individuals to import THA for personal use fromforeign companies, such as the Canadian pharmaceutical housePharmascience. Then the agency reversed course and forbadesuch shipments. So the Alzheimer's families do what AIDSpatients did before the establishment embraced their cause:They smuggle THA into the country, find someone to compoundit for them illicitly, or fly to clinics outside the U.S. Onelady says she would throw rocks at the FDA's headquarters ifshe could.   The complaints of AIDS victims about the system and theseriousness of their disease are well known. If you add tothis the anger of millions of Alzheimer's families, it seemsto us self-evident that there is something seriously wrongwith the current system that the FDA administers with noavenues of appeal. How many more commissions do we need torecognize this or do something about it?   Notwithstanding the proven value of clinically controlledstudies, the issue of approving drugs for the nation's mostdesperately ill people comes down to judgment. FDACommissioner David Kessler explicitly recognized this fact inan insightful article on drug regulation for the New EnglandJournal of Medicine. &quot;In the end, the decision to approve,&quot; anew drug, he wrote, &quot;depends on the judgment of the FDAreviewers, who take into account the disease, thealternatives and the available evidence.&quot; But that waswritten when Dr. Kessler was practicing at Montefiore MedicalCenter in the Bronx.   A doctor in the Bronx would have seen that the THAdecision (four million victims, no existing treatment,positive evidence from 16 medical centers and England) was anexercise in simple judgment. Instead, the Alzheimer'spopulation got an advisory decision that was a fiasco and anuncertain outlook that depends on the FDA figuring out how tosquare what is obvious with its sacred procedures. While themeetings go on, more patients deteriorate.   The THA story is not utterly dark, however. There are noknown accounts of the FDA arresting any of these elderlypeople for the crime of smuggling into the U.S. an unapproveddrug, identified in 1986, which in their view, works.</TEXT></DOC>
