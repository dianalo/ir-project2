Amid all the controversy over the savings and loan crisis,in which taxpayers will be called on to pay at least $150billion to cover the insolvent insurance fund for thriftinstitutions, the adequacy of the fund for banks has alsoraised some concern.</LP><TEXT>   FDIC officials have said they expect the bank fund couldsuffer a loss this year as big as $2 billion, which wouldreduce the fund to about $11.2 billion. The fund backs upabout $2 trillion in insured deposits at the nation's banks.   The FDIC's chairman, William Seidman, said he has askedthe FDIC staff to review the agency's financial outlook for1990 and 1991 to determine whether a premium increase may benecessary. Depending on the outcome of the review, theincrease would be considered and possibly voted on at aTuesday FDIC board meeting, Mr. Seidman said.   The FDIC chief said he hadn't yet decided whether hebelieved the premiums should be increased. But his commentssuggested that a boost may be in the offing.   &quot;It's a judgment matter and we'll be discussing it,&quot; Mr.Seidman said. &quot;If the indications are that the fund will bereaching all-time lows and we have concerns about what wemight be facing, we'd have to do everything we could toincrease our resources.&quot;   The bank premiums have already been nearly doubled by theSandamp;L bailout law, signed by President Bush a year ago today.That law raised the annual premiums from 8.3 cents per $100of deposits to 12 cents this year and 15 cents in 1991.   The law also gave the FDIC the power to raise premiums onits own, but not more than 7.5 cents in any one year. Thusthe FDIC could raise the premiums as high as 19.5 cents per$100 of deposits next year.   Just last week, Mr. Seidman told the Senate BankingCommittee that the $13.2 billion currently in the fundtranslates to about 70 cents for each $100 of insureddeposits, the lowest level in &quot;modern history,&quot; he said.While the FDIC believes $1.25 for each $100 is a healthylevel, a $2 billion loss this year would drop the fund toabout 60 cents per $100.   &quot;Some of the statements I've been making could be said tobe paving the way {for a premium increase} if our reviewshows it's necessary,&quot; Mr. Seidman said. He has also said hebelieves the FDIC fund is sufficient to handle the bankingindustry's problems without taxpayer funds, disputingassertions by some outside analysts.   Other factors would seem to suggest that the FDIC willhave to raise premiums. Recent statistics point to a slowingeconomy, and the oil price hikes following Iraq's invasion ofKuwait add to the threat that the economy could tumble into arecession. Moreover, real estate values in many areas of thecountry are weakening just as banks are finishing a binge ofreal estate lending. All these ingredients could produce morebank failures for the FDIC to handle.   Premium income this year is expected to be just over $3billion, said John Bovenzi, a top aide to Mr. Seidman. Nextyear's increase to 15 cents would bring in another $750million, because each one cent increase generates about $250million in premiums for the FDIC.   Troubles in the banking industry, particularly in Texasand the rest of the Southwest, over the past few years havedepleted the strength of the bank fund. In the past two yearsit has suffered the first losses in its history: $4.24billion in 1988 and $851 million last year.</TEXT></DOC>
