Perot, former chairman of EDS, filed the countersuit Friday inU.S. District Court.   Perot founded EDS in 1962 and sold it to General Motors Corp. in1984.   The relationship between Perot and GM soon soured, and Perot andthree other top EDS executives left the firm in December 1986 whenGM agreed to pay them about $850 million. Perot also stepped downfrom GM's board.   Last week, EDS filed a suit in which it claimed Perot violatedan agreement to refrain from competing with the data-processingcompany for at least three years after he left the company.   The EDS suit, filed in state court in Virginia, also namedPerot's new company, Virginia-based Perot Systems Group, as adefendant.   In papers filed with his countersuit in federal court in Dallas,Perot sought an injunction to prevent EDS and GM from interferingin Perot Systems Group's business activities.   Perot contends the suit is groundless and will ``boomerang'' onEDS.   Earlier this year, Perot proposed to automate the U.S. PostalService and his company was awarded a no-bid contract for the job.   But after protests by EDS and other companies, the GeneralServices Administration suspended Perot's postal contract.   Perot has challenged the GSA's suspension of the contract. ThePostal Service contract is one of Perot's activities that EDSclaims violate the 1986 agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
