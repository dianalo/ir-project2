Salwen   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>01/11/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C8</SO><IN>SECURITIES REGULATIONS AND ENFORCEMENTS (RGU)SECURITIES (SCR)</IN><GV>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Corporate executives face guidelinesdesigned to force timely reporting of trades in theircompanies' stock, including the risk of new penalties if theydon't report or are consistently late.   At the same time, however, the guidelines would reduce thenumber of executives who must report their trades.</LP><TEXT>   The new rules, unanimously approved by the Securities andExchange Commission, would force companies to disclose on thecover of their proxy statements that certain executives ordirectors hadn't filed disclosures of their stock activities.They would have to disclose the names of those officials inthe report. That will help the SEC's enforcement divisiontrack down delinquent executives, agency staffers said.   The SEC estimates that 22% of all filings about insidertrades show up late at the agency. While that's down from 55%several years ago, it still means that nearly a quarter ofthe filings trickle in after the required time. Moreimportant, the SEC said it doesn't know how many executivesdon't file at all.   Under the new system, corporations will be forced to asktheir executives and directors whether they have filed thenecessary forms, which focus on purchases and sales of stockand options only in the securities of the company an insiderworks for. The SEC is hoping for deterrence through acombination of disclosure and fines. &quot;Not only will there nowbe the embarrassment factor, but the delinquencies will bereadily available to the division of enforcement,&quot; saidAssociate Enforcement Director Harry Weiss.   Under a law passed late last year, the agency will beallowed to ask a court to fine executives who don't complywith the rules.   The SEC, which has been working on the plan for severalyears, undertook the project to improve rules designed todeter abuse of inside information by company officials.Moreover, the filings, which offer investors insight intowhether insiders are bullish or bearish on the concern'sprospects, are often used by money managers and otherinvestors.   The SEC plan, which takes effect at the beginning ofApril, also redefines who is required to file. Prior ruleswere open to broad interpretation, with many companiesforcing all vice presidents to disclose their transactions,as well as those higher up in the corporation.   The new rules are structured more with jobresponsibilities in mind. Under the earlier rules, &quot;Peoplewere included in the . . . reporting provisions who don'thave the responsibilities of management,&quot; said Linda Quinn,the SEC's director of corporation finance. In particular,many financial companies, such as banks and securities firms,grant the title of vice president to hundreds of employeeswho don't have access to the kind of information that wouldallow abuses of insider knowledge.   Under the revised rules, officers with significantpolicy-making duties -- as laid out in proxy rules -- will berequired to file, plus the chief financial officer and chiefaccountant or comptroller, according to Elisse Walter, deputydirector of the corporation finance division. In addition,executives will be allowed to report exercises of stockoptions later and less often.   Some companies will have to overhaul their reportingsystem. &quot;It is really the companies where titles have beenhanded out without concomitant responsibilities that willhave to change,&quot; Ms. Quinn told the commission.   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said the package of changes&quot;should go a long way to make compliance easier and lesscostly, and thus reduce delinquencies.&quot;   The SEC also decided not to include a rule that would havebroadened the definition of who can sue company insiders torecover short-swing trading profits. The agency hadconsidered extending the definition to allow some formershareholders to sue, but kept the proposal out of the packageuntil the Supreme Court decides a pending case.   Much of the commission's three-hour debate over the ruledealt with wording technicalities. For example, the panelspent more than 45 minutes questioning staffers over whethera nine-day or 10-day window would be sufficient for theinsider filings and whether to determine that time by thepostmark or the receipt of the information. But even 45minutes wasn't enough for this debate. Agency staffers wereasked to discuss the matter and bring back a recommendationto the commission.</TEXT></DOC>
