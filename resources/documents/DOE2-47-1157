The oil consumption in European countries was twelve million bbl/din 1986; a 17% decrease to the total of 1979 is due to the conversionof heating fuel use to other heat sources. From 1986 on, however, thetotal consumption is increasing. The rate of increase in 1988 is estimatedto be 1%. Although the oil refining industry in the EC area was activein 1986, there remained surplus of heavy oil and shortage of middle distillate.The operation rate and profitability of the industry were improved. Oilproduct import increased in the U.S.A. and Japan. The petroleum oversupplythat began in 1980 has promoted relaxation of regulation and liberalizationin oil distribution. The European Continent has a pipeline network offive thousand kilometer and storage tank capacity for half a year consumption.Oil retailing in supermarkets accounts for 7.2% of the whole Europeanmarket. The U.S.S.R. suffers in oil reserves and oil production technology,consequently, hopes to advance into the Persian Gulf area and to obtainthe cooperation of Japan. Norway's oil and gas reserves account for 41%and 48%, respectively, of the total reserves in western Europe. The NorthSea oil field of the U.K. deprived market share of OPEC, however, facesdecline of production because of low prices. (20 figs, 81 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
