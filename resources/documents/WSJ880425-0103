But it is time the Reagan administration exerted more pressure on Tehran's enemy and the aggressor in the Persian Gulf war -- Iraq.    The heated U.S. anti-Iran rhetoric obscures important facts. Iraq, not Iran, started the war. While the U.S. is trying to protect ships in the gulf from Iranian attack, it is Iraq that has hit more than half of the tankers. When Tehran quietly made diplomatic concessions concerning a United Nations cease-fire, Baghdad dragged its heels. Iraq, not Iran, launched the latest round in the so-called War of the Cities on population centers and used outlawed chemical weapons against defenseless civilians.    Yet compared with the radical Islamic regime of Ayatollah Khomeini, Iraq is perceived as a moderate state. The U.S. deplores the killing of civilians and use of poison gas, but it rarely bares its teeth at Baghdad the way it does at Tehran.    But now, the administration has an opportunity to promote peace in a more balanced way. The U.S.-Iran naval skirmish grabbed last week's headlines, but a more significant event took place on the ground. Iraq recaptured the Fao Peninsula, putting it in an improved military position that could help persuade Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that this is a good time to end the seven-year war.    &quot;The time is coming when we'll have to figure out a way to exercise restraint on Iraq,&quot; says Frederick Axelgard, a Mideast specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. &quot;It seems difficult to say now that they are the seriously disadvantaged party they have been.&quot;    There isn't any doubt that Tehran deserves U.S. enmity. Its Islamic revolution threatens the region. Iranian-backed terrorists are holding nine Americans hostage in Lebanon and have killed hundreds more in attacks on U.S. facilities there.    By contrast, Iraq, which has diplomatic relations with the U.S., has made efforts to cooperate in the battle against international terrorism. Baghdad expelled several key Palestinian terrorists, including the notorious Adu Nidal.    But despite Iraq's image as the underdog in the Iran-Iraq war, the majority of shipping attacks in the gulf since the tanker war began in 1984 have been initiated by Baghdad, according to William Hughes, a Lloyd's insurance underwriter in London. Mr. Hughes, who monitors shipping losses, says that, typically, Iraq, which transports most of its oil via overland pipelines, attacks Iranian ships, and Tehran responds by shelling ships going to and from Iraq's Arab allies in the gulf. He says that since 1984, Iraq has been responsible for 256 of 463 such attacks.    &quot;The Iranians feel they are unfairly blamed for the tanker war and unjustly challenged by the U.S.,&quot; says Robin Wright, a Mideast specialist at the Carnegie Endowment. She adds that Iran is as threatened by the beefed-up U.S. Navy presence in the gulf as the U.S. once was by the Soviet missile deployment in Cuba in the early 1960s.    U.N. diplomats say Iran, which had strongly opposed a U.N. cease-fire and demanded war reparations, last month softened its position and offered to unofficially adhere to a U.N. implementation plan for the cease-fire while an impartial body determined who started the war.    Iraq accepts the U.N. cease-fire resolution without reservations, but wants a cease-fire in place and prisoners and captured territory exchanged before the impartial body completes its work.    Analysts say Iraq began firing rockets into Iranian cities shortly after Iran began moderating its cease-fire position. Iran retaliated. Such attacks on civilians by both sides make negotiations difficult. These analysts speculate that Iraq isn't ready to accept a verdict that it started the war.    Last week's Iraqi victory at Fao could provide room for diplomatic maneuvering. Iraq, which worried that Iran's official acceptance of a U.N. cease-fire would let it keep captured territory while talks bogged down endlessly, now can be prodded into showing flexibility. And, &quot;with the pressure off Iraq, we can afford to send signals to Iran that we do believe that it's time to examine more closely the issue of responsibility for starting the war,&quot; says Mr. Axelgard of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.    But first the administration must overcome its Iran hang-up. The ordeal of the 1979 hostage-taking at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and the defiant nature of Iran's Islamic revolution still stick in the American craw. But those feelings must be separated from the need to end the Iran-Iraq war by prodding Baghdad and Tehran equally. </TEXT></DOC>
