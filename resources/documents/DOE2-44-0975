<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-44-0975 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report describes a research effort devoted to the development andsubsequent feasibility demonstration of an instrument for the remotesensing of the Btu flow rate in a steam or hot water heating system.The concept of the Btu meter is based on a differential hot wire anemometerinvented by Osman K. Mawardi. The incentive in the development of thisdevice is the increased demand for an inexpensive and accurate (betterthan 1%) Btu meter. The ability of the meter to be read remotely is essential,since it is an effective way of reducing the manpower costs of the companyoperating the heating system. Other features of the Btu meter which areincluded in the design are simplicity of construction, ruggedness, andflexibility of the electronic interfacing system. The latter featurepermits the incorporation of the telemetering circuit in a telephoneor radio-based communication system. Both of these alternatives are commerciallyavailable today and are quite economical. With small modifications ofthe interfacing circuitry, the meter can be linked to a fiber opticsautomated meter reading network. 15 refs., 20 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
