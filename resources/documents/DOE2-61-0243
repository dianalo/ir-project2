For each agent in the data base, thequantitative results from genetic and related test systems are representedby computer-generated bar graphs genetic activity profiles. Bioassaysystems are organized according to classes of genetic activity and subdividedby the phylogenetic level of the test organism. Genetic activity profileswere prepared 187 chemicals, e.g., dibromochloropropane, for the useof the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Working Group.</TEXT></DOC>
