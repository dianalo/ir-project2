Given the dismalfailures of the manned space shuttle and the glorioustriumphs of Voyager, the premise sounds about right.   But in &quot;Exploring Space: Voyages in the Solar System andBeyond&quot; (Random House, 448 pages, $24.95), William F. Burrowsmanages to make space exploration unbearably dull. He'swritten a book about soulless machines built by the dullesthumans on Earth. To get a better sense of the joy ofdiscovery, turn on &quot;Star Trek&quot; or &quot;Nova.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Though the title of his book promises more, Mr. Burrowsdelivers a history of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration's program for unmanned planetary exploration.He catalogs in excruciating detail 30 years of spacelaunches, starting with the early failures of the Pioneer andRanger craft and ending with the successes of Voyager. ButMr. Burrows, director of New York University's science andenvironmental reporting program, forgets the first rule ofjournalism -- or writing for that matter. To entice someoneto read a story, you need characters, plot, theme and so on.Instead he offers lists and factoids.   Mr. Burrows tells the reader that the Mariner spacecraftsthat zoomed past Venus and Mars in the 1960s had on board aradio, data encoder, video storage equipment, a commandsystem and about a dozen other machines. He says they usedless power than a refrigerator light bulb. But he doesn't saymuch at all about the dreams or characters of the people whobuilt the Mariners or how the craft's first glimpses of theplanets changed the way people back on Earth thought aboutthe heavens.   Combine this fault with plain bad writing -- &quot;If {Apollo}was a circus, {scientists} at least had the consolation ofknowing that they numbered among its shareholders,&quot; he notesat one point -- and you have a book that plods when it shouldsoar.   Mr. Burrows's weaknesses didn't matter much in his earlierbook, &quot;Deep Black,&quot; a popular history of U.S. spy satellites.In the highly classified reconnaissance program, so little ispublicly known that machines become the main story. Thequestion of whether a spy satellite can read a license plateon the ground, as claimed, or just a street sign takes onmore significance than it merits in spy-satellite books. Butthe machines really are impressive. They help us keep tabs onour enemies and represent one of the few high-tech areas leftwhere we still clearly lead the Japanese.   &quot;Exploring Space&quot; does have some strengths. Mr. Burrowsdescribes in detail the bureaucratic battles that precedeeach major planetary project, giving outsiders a look at thedesultory world of space politics. He also gives ampleevidence that the space shuttle was oversold, underfunded andbound to run into trouble -- a disturbing parallel to NASA'splanned $37 billion space station.   But he just can't make space exploration come alive.That's a terrible shame, because the planetary program ispopulated by a host of colorful scientists. Among many othersare James Van Allen, whose first space probe discovered thatthe Earth is surrounded by radiation belts, and whorelentlessly opposed the space shuttle; Edward Stone, theunflappable chief Voyager scientist who meticulously jotsdown every observation in numbered notebooks; and Carl Sagan,the most eloquent of the planetary scientists, and the mostmaddening.   None of these men or scientists of similar stature aredescribed in detail in &quot;Exploring Space.&quot; Indeed, the book'ssole vivid character is Wernher Von Braun, the proselytizerfor manned exploration, who wanted NASA to build giantrotating space stations and colonize Mars. Mr. Burrowsclearly thinks that such manned extravaganzas are a waste oftime and money. But he describes unmanned planetary missionswith such leaden prose that the reader might wonder why theU.S. ever bothered launching them.   What's missing is a recognition that the planetary programhas genuinely changed intellectual thought in the 20thcentury. Before these space probes were launched, scientistsand the many others believed that Mars and Venus might teemwith life, while most of the other planets were dull blobs.The robots proved that all wrong.   Now we know with near certainty that we are the only lifein the solar system. But we can also marvel at the stunningdiversity of the worlds around us -- on one moon geysers oozeice; on another, they propel gasses 60 miles into theatmosphere. And we can only guess at the mysteries that liedeeper in the universe.   Lyricism and Mr. Burrows, though, are strangers. Heconcludes the main body of his book about space explorationthis way: &quot;The quality of a civilization, as {scientist}Bruce Murray has observed, is measured not by what it has todo, but by what it wants to do. In that sense, even spaceitself is not the final frontier. The mind is.&quot; Carl Sagan,where are you when we need you?   ---   Mr. Davis covers NASA and science from the Journal'sWashington bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
