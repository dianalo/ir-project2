Mr. Kuroda, the former vice minister for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, will advise the brokerage house on Japanese industrial clients on a part-time basis. The company wouldn't disclose his salary.    Mr. Kuroda was considered by his colleagues in the Japanese government as one of the brightest government officials of an era when Japan's best college graduates went into government service. During his 33-year career with the ministry -- which took him to the top post a career bureaucrat can hold -- he helped set Japan's postwar industrial policy and manage its trade negotiations. Mr. Kuroda is considered unusual by American diplomats because of his penchant for blunt and pugnacious arguments in perfect English. While he is nationalistic, he earned an undeserved reputation as anti-American, U.S. diplomats have said.    Salomon is one of a growing number of American companies that are adopting the custom, long-practiced by Japanese companies, of hiring top officials of the ministries in order to take advantage of their connections and experience. Earlier this year, Salomon appointed as an adviser Sumio Hara, a former commissioner for the National Tax Administration.    Mr. Kuroda, coming from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, won't be of much assistance to Salomon in regulatory matters since the securities industry falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. But Mr. Kuroda's appointment is considered a coup because he has wide contacts in Japanese industry that could bring many important clients to Salomon. In a statement, John Gutfreund, chairman of Salomon Inc., said, &quot;We are pleased and honored to have an individual with Mr. Kuroda's breadth of international experience associated with the firm.&quot;    Mr. Kuroda, who reached retirement age at the ministry earlier this year, is also an adviser to the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, a major Japanese bank. In addition, he is an adviser to a Ministry of International Trade and Industry-affiliated think tank, the Japan Economic Foundation. </TEXT></DOC>
