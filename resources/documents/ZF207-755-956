 The IIPis just the latest in a series of new product offerings from HP, includingthe DeskJet Plus and DeskWriter in inkjet technology, and the Laserjet IID inthe laser printer arena.andP;  The HP inkjct and laser printcr programs have anextraordinary impact on desktop printing environments.andM;The Hewlett-Packard LaserJet IIPandM;The Laserjet IIP may be the most important of these new products.andP;  Indeed, itmay be as important to the dcsktop printing environment as the Laserjet II.andO;In 1987, the Laserjet II changed user expectations of printerprice/performance.andP;  As a consequence, the HP LaserJet family has dominatedthe laser printer market for the last three years.andP;  The IIP is likely to havethe same affect in 1989 with the potential for the same consequences in 1990and 1991.andM;The Hewlett-jPackard LaserJet IIP is a $1495, four page-per- minute (ppm),300 dot-per-inch (DPI) laser printer 'with 512K of RAM.andP;  The marking engineis supplied by Canon, while HP has developed the controller technology.andP;  TheIIP is Laserjet IID compatible, meaning it too uses a superset of PCIA.andP;  Fontrotation in 90 degree increments for landscape printing is the most improtantof these PCL 4 extensions.andM;Hewlett-Packard states that the 4PPM rating is real and that performance ofthe IIP is half the speed of the Laserjet II.andP;  However, because of improved1/0, the IIP sometimes prints the first page more quickly.andP;  The device isfurther rated at a 6000 page-per-month duty cycle.andM;The IIP has an attractive new (and proprietary) cover set design and a newcontrol panel configuration with buttons rather than the membranes as on thcII and IID.andP;  Memory upgrades are not compatible with other HP printers.andP;  Thelist price for a 1MB upgrade is $495, while thc 2MB vcrsion is $995.andM;The paper handling scheme includes a standard 50 page tray with an additional250 page cassette availablc as a $195 option.andP;  The standard tray adjusts toaccept envelopes, while the optional cassette takes the form of a modulewhich users may attach easily to the bottom of the printer in an attractive,ergonomic design.andM;The Laserjet IIP uses all Hewlett-Packard font cartridges and will have aHewlett-Packard PostScript cartridge in the first quarter of 1990, accordingto Bill McGlynn, Marketing Manager of HP's Boise Printer Division.andP;  (ThisPostScript cartridge will also bc compatible with the IID.andP;  See below formore on HP PostScript.)andM;The IIP thus shapes up as an extraordinarily competitive device.andP;  At $1495,it is likely to be priced substantially below most of the new generation of 6PPM machines in which other printer vendors have invested heavily to combatthe market dominance of the Laserjet II.andP;  With a list of $1495, theconservative initial street price may be in the $1100-$1300 range.andP;  Thissuggests that the mythical and mystical $1000 laser printer may be availablcas a Christmas special, if not carlier.andM;Competitors, especially those vendors such as Toshiba and Epson who arebringing new 6 PPM laser printers to market, will find it extremely difficultto offer products which perform equivalently at anywhere near these prices.andO;(A 2 PPM advantage [6 vs 4]) is probably not enough product differentiation,even if it translated into a real 50% performance advantage, to offset HPdistribution, mindshare, and markct momentum).andP;  Indeed, there may be littleperformance advantage in these ncw 6 PPM devices.andP;  The generic controller inthe Toshiba and Epson products is supplied by engine manufacturer TokyoElectric Company and is reported to be slow.andP;  Other announced vendors o thisTEC printer include Mannesmann Talley, Packard-Bell, Facit and Oasys, whileAT andamp; T, and Harris-3M are rumored to be working on products based on this device.andM;The IIP rounds out a laser printer product family also made up of the almostlegendary Laserjet II and the Laserjet IID.andP;  The Laserjet II is the industrystandard (non-PostScript) laser printer while the IID offers advanced paperand font handling.andP;  In November 1988, HP announced the sale of 1 millionlaser printers.andP;  The Laserjet product family will undoubtedly continue andprobably enhance this sales trend.andM;Hewlett-Packard InkJet PrintersandM;The InkJet line is equally impressive and more diverse.andP;  The HP Paintjetoffers color while the DeskWriter is the first monochrome non-impact offeringfrom Hewlett-Packard specifically designed for the Macintosh.andP;  (The Paintjetis also available in an Apple configuration.) The flagship of the inkjetfamily is the Deskjet Plus.andP;  The Deskjet Plus is a performance enhancedversion of the DeskJet, which was announccd in April.andP;  HP used this occasionto inform the industry that it had sold 1 million inkjet printers!andM;The Deskjet-DeskWriter product line offers 300 DPI technology at prices muchlower than competitive laser printers.andP;  Indeed, pricing is comparable to dotmatrix devices which, even when 24-wire, do not compare favorably toHewlett-Packard inkjet print quality.andM;The Deskjet family places enormous price/pcrformance pressures on 24-wiredot- matrix technology.andP;  This will be even more pronounced if HP lowers theprice of the Deskjet Plus.andP;  The Deskjet Plus suggested list price is $995,but shoppers can easily find it for $660 to $700.andM;The Hewlett-Packard Product ProgramandM;The following price matrix shows how Hewlett-Packard covers the printingarena:andM;DeskJet: $695andM;DeskJet+ $995andM;DeskWriter $1,195andM;PaintJet $1,395andM;IIP $1,495andM;II $2,595andM;IID $4,295andM;From the pricing matrix of non-impact desktop printer products, it should beapparent that the IIP fills a hole in the product program.andP;  The IIP is alsolikely to place pressure on the Deskjet Plus and thc Laserjet II.andP;  Thus,HewlettPackard is competing against itself This is good for the customer,since most other printer vendors cannot reasonabley compete withHewlett-Packard without offering dramatically new products.andM;The IIP probably has set a new price/ performance plateau which will make thcother manufacturers scramble, since it is not likely that current strategiesbased on 6 PPM, $1800-$2000 devices will work.andM;This product program does, however, raise some issues, most notably thestatus of the venerable LaserJet II.andP;  Also, Hewlett-Packard has and does makemistakes-see the discussion of these issues below.andM;FontsandM;Hewlett-Packard is thc leading vendor of fonts in the dcsktop environment.andO;It has recently begun offering scaleable font technology.andP;  Thc original threetypeface offerings of the HP Type Director-Premier Collection, firstavailable in February, 1989, has been supplemented by an Additional 12scaleable typefaces.andP;  Scaleable font tcchnology is now available on all threelaser printers and the inkjet family.andP;  Further, HewlettPackard hasreconfigured its traditional bit-mapped font cartridges.andP;  Most of the newcartridge configurations are priced at $195.andP;  The 65 font HP ProCollectioncartridge is still being offered at $300, while one of the new cartridgeslists for $95.andP;  The old HP cartridges have bccn discontinued All cartridgeswork with the entire Laserjet family (For additional information on fontcartridges sec V ol.andP;  8, No.andP;  1 of The Outlook).andM;Hewlett-Packard is clearly taking a leadership role in scalcablc fonttechnology.andP;  This is a very important role for HP, since this type oftechnology will bc at the heart of the next generation of new printingdevices.andM;Hewlett-Packard PostScriptandM;Hewlett-Packard also announced the availability of the long awaited HPPostScript solution for thc LaserJet on September 18.andP;  PostScript will besupported in a cartridge which looks like a font cartridge and is installedin a font cartridge slot.andP;  The Hcwlctt-Packard PostScript Printer Cartridgeis a $995 solution which requires a 2MB ($995) memory upgrade for simplexprinting.andP;  Duplex printing requires 4MB to support PostScript.andP;  The cartridgeis for the IID and will be availablc in October.andP;  The IIP will have aPostScript cartridge during the first quarter of 1990.andP;  This 1990 cartridgewill be compatible with both the Laserjet IIP and thc LaserJet IID.andM;Adobe Systems is the PostScript language supplier (Version 51.5), and HPclaims IID PostScript performance equivalent to the Apple LaserWriter II NT.andO;The 35 standard fonts are supported.andP;  While the cartridge uses the latestrelease of Adobe PostScript, the design of the implementation suggests thatprinting performance will not be especially efficient.andP;  It may be difficultfor HP to fulfill its claims of NT speed especially if the Apple printerconfiguration is to a Macintosh on AppleTalk.andP;  This is a significantly fastersolution than an NT connected to an DOS machine with a serial interface.andP;  Amore significant issue for HP and for users is the lack of Hewlett-PackardPostScript support for the vast majority of LaserJet owners, thoseindividuals who purchased the Laserjet and LaserJet II.andM;Hewlett-Packard also states that the controller for the Laserjet II issufficiently different from that of the IIP and IID and the HP will notdevelop a PostScript cartridge to support it! The officialHP PostScriptsolution for the Laserjet II is the QMS JetScript, a hostresident controllerboard.andP;  (Pacific Data Products offers a cartridge PostScript solution for theLaserjet II.andP;  Thc PostScript interpreter in the Pacific Data cartridge issupplied by Phoenix Technologies.) Thus, HP is not providing its ownPostScript upgrade path for LaserJet II users.andP;  This is unfortunate.andM;This lack ofa PostScript cartridge for the LaserJct II from Hewlett-Packardsuggests that HP may replace the Laserjet 11 with a 11 Plus or a Laserjet IIIto make the entire line more consistent and compatible.andP;  This possible newprinter would be equipped with the long awaited PCL 5.andM;HP FaltersandM;Hewlett-Packard has not been uniformly successful despite its overwhelmingdominance of the general desktop nonimpact printer marketplace.andP;  It has notexperienced the same degree of success in the Apple marketplace.andP;  Indeed, itonly entered that arena with the PaintJet in January (with aninterface/driver program) and the DcskWriter in July.andP;  To date, no HP productcomes equipped with an AppleTalk interface.andP;  Since the Macintosh environmentis heavily networked, this is an obvious product design oversight.andM;Hewlett-Packard also does not provide the marketplace with a desktop printerdesigned to serve the needs of thc PC IAN community.andP;  The LaserJet 2000 issimply too costly to support the typical PC LAN workgroup environment.andM;Finally, Hewlett-Packard is very late getting into thc PostScript arena withits own product.andP;  It has a history of missteps in this area which thecartridge strategy may not offset.andP;  It is difficult to see how HP PostScriptsupport of the IID or even the IIP mill comfort users who will not have aHewlett-Packard upgrade path for the LaserJet II.andP;  The vast majority ofHewlett-Packard's installed base must turn elsewhere.andM;However, it should bc remembered that PostScript is primarily a Macintoshplatform requirement and only a secondary niche requriement in the IBM/compatible arena.andP;  This will change, and indeed, is changing.andP;  PostScript islikely to become the high-performancc imaging model of choice in the DOSenvironment, and the one most often turned to by the professional publishingand the workstation communities.andM;Perhaps more significant is the length of time the marketplace has beenwaiting for PCL5, Hewlett-Packard has said that this time was required towork out all the elements to insure that existing products (such as fontcartridges) will be compatible with new products.andP;  However, sinceHewlett-Packard representatives have discussed PCL extensions since 1987,this is not a compelling rationale.andP;  HP has simply been late.andP;  Indeed, onekey element, scaleable fonts, is now offered by HP and others as a softwaresolution.andM;On September 20, Cathy Lyons product marketing manager for the LaserJetfamily, discussed Hewlett-Packard's language philosophy at the SeyboldComputer Publishing Conference.andP;  HewlettPackard is committed to maximizingthe price / performance ratio of its products.andP;  This is inyherentlyatradeoff.andP;  Thus, HP could not bring a LaserJet IIP product to market at a$1495 price point and also include PCL5.andP;  The company chose to maximizeperformance at that price level.andM;Ms.andP;  Lyons also provided details of PCL 5 in Hewlett- Packard's firstofficial stateament concerning the contents of the PCL enhancements.andP;  The keyelements are that PCL 5 will use Compugraphic's Intellifont 2.1 font scalingtechnology and HPGL 2 seamlessly integrated.andP;  PCL 5 will be backwardscompatible with PCL 4 and PCL 4 Plus.andP;  However, the only discussion of PCL5based printers was the announcement that there would be no printer productsequipped with PCL 5 released until 1990.andM;What The Hewlett-Packard Non-impact Printer Program MeansandM;It means crisis for most competitors.andP;  Apple computer is currently the onlyviable laser printer competitor.andP;  Applc has bccn able to do this because itowns a major proprietary personal computer platform with niche requirementsfor image and text which have becn addressed with thc PostScript- bascd laserprinters.andM;Currently, there is no major PCL competitor to Hewlett-Packard in the laserprinter world.andP;  Many vendors hoped to compete with a lower cost, 6 PPMprinter.andP;  The LaserJet IIP eliminates that option.andP;  As a consequence, thesevendors will be struggling for replacement products which are competitive.andM;Hewlett-Packard does not have competition in the monochrome inkjetenvironment.andP;  Vendors will continue to struggle to find competitivesolutions.andP;  The problems of 24 wire dot matrix printer manufacturers willbecome more acute as time passes.andM;It means opportunity for end-users .andP;  The strong price/performance levels ofthe HP inkjet and laser printer families means that printcr users can choosefrom excellent products priced to provide strong value.andP;  If the marketbecomes more competitive, lower prices will simply give users cvcn moreopportunities to select good printing solutions.andM;It offers a challenge to Hewlett-Packard.andP;  Hewlett-Packard has positioned itsproducts well, with the Deskjet family, offering laser quality to dot matrixprinter users, and with the LaserJet IIP offering a low-cost, high qualitypcrsonal laser printer solution.andP;  HP's challenge is to continue to developits print programs with the same degree of excellence.andP;  In 1990, we shouldexpect PCL 5 products, HP entry level network printers, better PostScriptsolutions, and a replacement for the LaserJet II.andP;  We might also wonder abouta portable printcr based upon inkjct tcchnology.andP;  HewlettPackard hascertainly maintained its leadership of the printcr industry in 1989.andP;  theycan continuc their leadership in 1990 with the promise of these new products.andO;-Michael WeissandM;Editor's Note: Michalel Weiss is President of MWA Consulting in Palo Alto,CA.andP;
