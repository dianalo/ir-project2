The samples collected are treated appropriately to providesolutions for analysis. Their analysis is carried out as follows. Eachsample solution prepared is first neutralized. After sodium carbonateis added, the precipitate of strontium and calcium carbonates is separatedand the supernatant solution is used for cesium-137 determination. Thecarbonates are converted into oxalates, which are then dissolved in nitricacid. Strontium is separated by successive fuming nitric acid separation.The supernatant is acidified and cesium is absorbed on ammonium molybdophosphateadded. Stable strontium, calcium and potassium are also determined. Thecontents of the substances in the samples are tabulated. (Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
