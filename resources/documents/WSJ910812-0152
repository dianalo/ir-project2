Analysts speculated the problem could delay the early 1993launch of the country's first domestically made rocket. Theso-called H-2 is the centerpiece of Japan's space program forthe 1990s, and is slated to carry many of the country'ssatellites in the future.</LP><TEXT>   Officials at the National Space Development Agency andMitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. -- the developer of theengine -- couldn't be reached for comment over the weekend.   The explosion comes less than two weeks before the agencyis scheduled to carry out one of its most significantmissions ever -- the launching on its current generation H-1rocket of a satellite that will permit commercial domesticbroadcasting later this year of high-definition television.   Although NASDA has never had a serious problem with an H-1launch, officials are holding their breath because of recentproblems by foreign launchers with Japanese broadcastsatellites.   The H-2 is supposed to replace the H-1, which has limitedpayload capability.   Last week's accident -- reportedly the first fatality inJapan's space program -- follows a string of difficulties inthe development of the H-2 rocket engine. This was at leastthe sixth fire during testing in the past two years. In May,an explosion shattered the windows of houses near thesouthern Japan testing site.   Those problems already forced the space agency to delaythe launch from the original 1992 date.   Eiichiro Sekigawa, a Japanese aerospace analyst said theproblems leading to the most recent accident -- involving apipe in the propulsion system -- &quot;are easily repaired orredesigned.&quot; Still, he said the event &quot;will inevitably affectthe H-2 launch schedule.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
