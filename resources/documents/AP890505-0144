ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   While President Bush had reason to feel lastElection Day that the American people had delivered their verdicton his role in the Iran-Contra affair, much to his annoyance,questions persist.   But there is a widespread feeling that the demand for answersdiminishes rapidly the farther one is from Capitol Hill.   ``The thing has been around so long, it's kind of old news,''said Mike Hamby, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party.   With a slight nod toward partisanship, Hamby quickly added that``if there's any curiosity out there,'' it concerns Bush's role inthe Reagan administration deliberations on arms sales to Iran andthe diversion of funds to the Contras. Bush has said he knew aboutthe Iran arms sales but has denied any knowledge of the diversion.   ``I don't think there's any outcry of any kind across thiscountry for any questions about this issue,'' said Eddie Mahe, aRepublican consultant. ``This issue ceased to exist for theAmerican people a long time ago.''   The fact is that neither the foreign policy scandal nor thepersona of Oliver L. North quite lived up to the expectations ofpartisans on both sides.   Democrats saw the Iran-Contra affair as an issue that wouldcripple Republican chances to hold the White House in the 1988election.   Conservatives saw North, the Marine lieutenant colonel with achest full of medals, as a symbol who would rally voters to rejecthis Democratic tormentors.   For a while, both had reason for high hopes.   ``Where was George?'' shouted exuberant Democrats at their 1988nominating convention and at later rallies for nominee MichaelDukakis. It sounded and looked like a great way to focus attentionon the unanswered questions about Bush's role in the affair.   But voters seemed to care more about Willie Horton than OllieNorth and were more disturbed about the Massachusetts prisonfurlough program than the Iran-Contra scandal.   At the same time, North never emerged as the national heroconservatives sought.   Americans responded with a flood of pro-North letters andtelegrams after his televised appearance before congressionalinvestigators in July 1987, an outpouring that generated a quickflurry of what was dubbed Olliemania, complete with T-shirts andappeals that he run for public office.   North still commands speaking fees of up to $25,000 anappearance, but his presence no longer makes politicians _particularly Democrats _ uneasy.   If anyone is uneasy these days it might be White House aides asthey watch conservatives try to generate pressure on the presidentto pardon the former National Security Council aide.   ``He was never as hot as he was that week in July 1987,'' saidDemocratic pollster Peter Hart. ``It was that one period of time,it was a very short T-shirt sale period.''   As the jury in the Oliver L. North trial was preparing toannounce its verdict Thursday, Bush welcomed the question about hisrole in the Iran-Contra affair as if he thought one more answerwould put an end to the inquiries.   It didn't and now he might want to take his press secretary'sadvice and leave the questions ``to the historians.''   Bush invoked the prestige of his office in trying, once and forall, to deal with questions about his meeting with the president ofHonduras in 1985. At issue is whether the then-vice president knewthe Reagan administration was expecting Honduras to aid the Contrasin return for American aid.   ``The word of the president of the United States _ George Bush _is, there was no quid pro quo,'' responded Bush.   ``There has been much needless, mindless speculation about myword of honor and I've answered it now, definitively,'' said anobviously annoyed president.   But as Bush must know, such questions never can be answered``definitively.''   Details about the Bush trip to Honduras were disclosed in a memoplaced in evidence at the North trial. The documents suggested Bushhad a greater role than acknowledged in U.S. efforts to keep theContras in business. Congressional investigators never got thatinformation and they now want to know why.   ``The North trial raised a number of questions that I think arestill unanswered,'' said Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who chaired theHouse investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.   ``We still have many, many unanswered questions aboutIran-Contra and those should be pursued,'' he said.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said he wouldadvise the president to refuse to answer further questions.   ``If there are unanswered questions, my vote would be to leavethem to the historians and others who want to delve into this,'' hesaid.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Donald M.
