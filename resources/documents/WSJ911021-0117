PictureTel said it has reached a joint marketing agreementwith International Business Machines Corp. under which IBMsalespeople will start selling the devices in the second halfof next year.</LP><TEXT>   PictureTel plans to show the prototypes today at theComdex computer show in Las Vegas, Nev.   Robert Mitro, vice president sales and marketing ofPictureTel, said pricing hasn't been set but the companywants to keep the cost of the video-conference system under$5,000. That price would be in addition to the IBM PS/2personal computer and monitor needed to show the picture.Still, it marks a big cut from the $20,000 price forPictureTel's cheapest current video-conference system.   Robert L. Carberry, assistant general manager, systemstechnology, for IBM's personal computer group, said that withthe new systems, &quot;desktop users will have access tovideoconferencing and powerful business tools in one system.&quot;   Of course, picture telephone prototypes have beenperennial sights at conferences on the future, ever since the1964 World's Fair. But the PictureTel-IBM devices will be thefirst to use a computer circuit board with special chipsbeing developed jointly by PictureTel and Intel Corp. Thatdevelopment effort is aimed at slashing the size and cost ofPictureTel's codec, the device that compresses pictures tosend them over telephone wires.   PictureTel's archrival, Compression Laboratories Inc., SanJose, Calif., has said it will unveil a desktop videophonenext year that is being developed under contract withAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.   PictureTel's prototype has a two-inch-high box on top ofthe PC monitor that contains the video camera and microphonefor picking up sound from the user. It also includes aseparate speaker to carry sound from the other end.   IBM's marketing muscle in large companies should helpfast-growing PictureTel penetrate the market. IBM also hasagreed to buy systems from PictureTel and install them on IBMexecutives' desktops. PictureTel declined to estimate thesize of its business with IBM.</TEXT></DOC>
