Time spent with a single parent during the formative, preschool years seems to have a particularly negative impact on a boy's future education, said Sheila Fitzgerald Krein and Andrea H. Beller of the University of Illinois at Urbana.    Single, working mothers appear to be better role models for their daughters than their sons, Ms. Beller said. She said that while the role-model influence for girls appears to compensate for the mother's loss of time at home, &quot;the boy doesn't have this model, he just has the loss of a parent.&quot;    An estimated 60% of all children spend at least some of their childhood in a single-parent situation, the researchers said.    &quot;Educational advancement is one route out of poverty, but the children in these families get significantly less of it. Thus, this lower level of education will have long-term consequences for the economic well-being of the future family of this young adult,&quot; the researchers reported in Demography, the journal of the Population Association of America. They said they studied effects on education because it &quot;has been shown to be a predictor of welfare recipiency and persistent poverty&quot; and &quot;lack of education is one determinent of chronic unemployment.&quot;    Ms. Beller and Ms. Krein used a pair of long-term surveys to study two generations of mothers and their offspring, totaling 2,500 boys and girls.    The largest impact was among white males with each year spent in a one-parent family reducing eventual education by about one-tenth of a year. &quot;White men who spent an average number of years {5.1} in a single-parent family completed 0.5 {year less} of schooling than those who spent none; white men who spent all 18 years in a single-parent family completed 1.7 fewer years of schooling,&quot; they found.    Black males who spent eight years in a one-parent situation, received 0.6 year less schooling than those who spent their entire childhood in a two-parent home. Black males spending 18 years with one parent had 1.3 fewer years of school.    But for white women, a single-parent family had no impact on eventual education. The impact was slight for black women. &quot;This suggests room for a powerful role-model effect of the working mother,&quot; the researchers said.    The greatest impact on eventual education was among youngsters whose preschool years were spent in one-parent families, the study said. It suggested that, &quot;Since the preschool years matter most, affordable day-care with an educational component could replace some of the functions of the absent parent.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
