Republican nominee Bush, who boasts ``I am an environmentalist,always have been,'' finds himself battling both Dukakis and aReagan administration record that environmental groups contend wasoften inimical to the causes of clean air, land and water.   Bush took that battle to Boston Harbor on Thursday, where heaccused the Democratic nominee of dragging his heels while thepollution-clogged harbor got ``dirtier and dirtier.''   Dukakis ridiculed Bush's ``election-year conversion,'' sayingBoston harbor has ``been polluted for hundreds of years, and I'mvery proud to be the governor who's cleaning it up ... no thanks toVice President Bush and the administration he is part of.''   ``Boston Harbor is not Michael Dukakis' shining moment,'' saidJeff Webb, a Friends of the Earth lobbyist. ``But that's one issuein one state. What about eight years of neglect?''   In a March assessment, the League of Conservation Voters leaguegave Dukakis a grade of B and Bush a D-plus.   Arlene O'Donnell of the Massachusetts Audubon Society saidDukakis has exhibited a growing sensitivity to environmentalissues, although ``he still tends, on bulldozer-versus-trees kindof things, to take the business side.''   Bush said Wednesday that ``1988, in a sense, is the year theEarth spoke back.'' He called for an international conference nextyear to discuss global warming and ozone depletion, which may bebehind the unusually hot summer.   Republicans say one of their own, Teddy Roosevelt, was one ofthe first environmentalists, and Bush hopes to reclaim theenvironmental mantle for the GOP.   But to do that, he must overcome distrust left by PresidentReagan's problems with the Superfund to clean up toxic waste, thepresident's go-slow attitude toward new measures to curb acid rain_ measures Bush endorsed in a speech Wednesday _ and Reagan's 1987veto of a $20 billion authorization to clean up U.S. waterways.   Environmentalists also criticize Bush for heading a deregulationtask force that paved the way for a Reagan executive order givingthe White House Office of Management and Budget veto power overenvironmental and other regulations. Dukakis has promised to revokethat executive order.   In reply to a questionnaire from the League of ConservationVoters, Bush said: ``In the past few years, we have not done enoughto protect the environment. I will do more.''   Bush has backed a goal of ``no net loss of wetlands.''   Dukakis has called for protecting existing wetlands andrestoring ``part of the vast endowment of wetlands that America haslost.'' But his administration approved filling a swamp for ashopping center near Attleboro, a development the ReaganEnvironmental Protection Agency went to court to block.   Dukakis has won high marks among some environmentalists for hisdogged battle to block licensing of the stillborn Seabrook nuclearplant in New Hampshire, as well as court fights to block oildrilling in the Georges Bank off the New England coast.   Bush, himself a pioneer of the offshore drilling industry, lastspring endorsed a moratorium on drilling in sensitive offshoreareas such as California. He also has promised to seek an end todumping of wastes in the ocean by 1991.   Dukakis said Bush recently supported offshore drilling in aTexas appearance, prompting the Democrat to declare that the nationneeded ``a president whose environmental policy doesn't change withthe time zones.''   On nuclear power, Dukakis opposes construction of new commercialreactors until a new, safer design is developed and ways are foundto treat and dispose of nuclear waste.   Bush says, ``I believe nuclear power must be a part of ourenergy mix,'' and says he will ``insist on the highest safetystandards.''   On acid rain, Bush promised Wednesday to ask Congress to cutmillions of tons of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2,000 andto reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.   Dukakis has said he will use authority under existing law toforce industrial states ``that are major contributors to the acidrain problem to find solutions within three years.''   Both favor ``clean coal'' research to tap the nation's abundantsupply of fossil fuel.</TEXT></DOC>
