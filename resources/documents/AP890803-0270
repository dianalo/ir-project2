The Labor Department's preliminary data for the April-Junequarter showed that output in the non-farm sector of the economyrose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.7 percent, whiletotal hours worked climbed 1.5 percent.   The 0.2 percent gain compared with a 1.3 percent drop innon-farm productivity in the first quarter.   The data showed hourly compensation paid non-farm workersclimbed at an annual rate of 5.5 percent in the second quarter butcontinued to lag behind the rate of consumer inflation.   In real dollars _ wage gains minus the toll of inflation _hourly compensation fell at an annual rate of 0.9 percent in theApril-June period, the Labor Department reported.   The report is the first look at productivity in the secondquarter. The preliminary data often are revised when a final reporton the quarter is issued a month later.   Manufacturing productivity increased at an annual rate of 2.4percent in the second quarter _ a seemingly encouraging sign atfirst glance but also an indication of the slowing economy.   The productivity gain in manufacturing came as output climbed atan annual rate of 2.1 percent and hours worked decreased 0.3percent.   When broken down, that data showed that productivity increasedamong manufacturers of durable goods _ items expected to last morethan three years _ but declined among makers of nondurables.   Manufacturing has been among the hardest hit sectors of theeconomy in the recent slowdown and today's data showed that realwages paid manufacturing workers declined for the sixth time in thelast 10 quarters.   In the second quarter the hourly compensation for manufacturingworkers rose at an annual rate of 2.5 percent _ down from a 3.1percent gain in the first quarter and well behind the growth inconsumer inflation, which has been climbing at an annual rate ofmore than 6 percent.   In another gauge that includes the farm sector, the LaborDepartment said productivity increased at an annual rate of 0.9percent in the second quarter, with output rising 1.4 percent andhours worked growing by 0.4 percent at seasonally adjusted annualrates. Those figures have been influenced by the rebound from lastyear's drought.</TEXT></DOC>
