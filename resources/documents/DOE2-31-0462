<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-31-0462 </DOCNO><TEXT>A lightweight, noninvasive, continuous, distributed sensing system basedon the use of a single optical fiber is described. The method relieson applying optical time domain reflectometry in a multimode opticalfiber to observe the magnitude and location of structural distortionsor other measurands. The fiber can be distributed throughout the structureto detect various components of flexure, including cantilever bending,torsion, longitudinal extension, and temperature. The spatial locationand magnitude of the measurand is contained in the time domain returnsignal. The particular property measured is a function of the methodin which the fiber is attached to the structure. Absolute displacementsof 0.2 microns are measured reliably.</TEXT></DOC>
