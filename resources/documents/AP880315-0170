The deficit in the U.S. current account was 13.7 percent higherthan the 1986 deficit of $141.4 billion and marked the fifthconsecutive year that this trade deficit has hit a new record.   The Reagan administration has sought to downplay thesignificance of the trade deficits, but private economists contendthat the rapid buildup of foreign debt could eventually topple thecountry into another recession, triggered by a plunge in the valueof the dollar.   ``The increasing indebtedness of the United States is the mostinsidious and potentially damaging long-run problem the countrymust deal with,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the BostonCo.   The current account is the broadest gauge of America's dealingswith other countries because it measures not only the flow ofmerchandise across U.S. borders but also the flow of services,primarily investment earnings.   For 16 of the past 17 years, the country has run deficits in themerchandise trade category. But the current account was in surplusas recently as 1981 because Americans' earnings on overseasinvestments were enough to offset the merchandise deficits.   But in this decade Americans have handed over billions ofdollars to foreigners in exchange for imported goods, transformingthe country from the world's largest creditor to the world'slargest debtor nation.   That means that foreigners now own more in U.S. investments thanAmericans hold in foreign investments. America was last a netdebtor in 1914. It regained that status in 1985 with a foreign debtof $111.9 billion. That debt grew to $263.6 billion at the end of1986.   Based on Tuesday's current account statistics, Jeff Faux,president of the Economic Policy Institute, estimated that the U.S.foreign debt now totaled $424.2 billion, more than four times theburden of the previous debt leader, Brazil.   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III and other administrationofficials have argued that the country's debt status was not acause for alarm because the debt was still a tiny fraction of thetotal U.S. economy.   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, testifying beforeCongress on Tuesday, said the fact that more and more U.S. assetsare being acquired by Japanese and other investors was a plus forthe U.S. economy, providing American jobs.   But private economists argue that the increase in foreigninvestment means that more American assets will be flowing intoforeign hands in the years ahead to service the growing debt,lowering American standards of living and leaving the countryincreasingly vulnerable to the whims of foreign investors.   ``The most profound and enduring legacy of the Reagan period isits conversion of the United States from the largest creditorcountry in the world to the largest debtor,'' said C. FredBergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics.``As long as the United States has to rely on foreign financing ofsuch magnitudes, events could at literally any moment trigger asharp turndown in our economy.''   Bergsten said that America endured two such turbulent episodesin early 1987 and again in the fall when weakened foreignconfidence sent the value of the dollar plunging and U.S. interestrates up sharply. The last such event has been blamed as acontributing factor in the record collapse of stock pricesd whichoccurred on Oct. 19.   The new report on the current account showed that the tradedeficit actually narrowed somewhat in the final three months of theyear, dropping to $39 billion, compared to record quarterly deficitof $43.4 billion in the third quarter, reflecting higher Americanearnings abroad because of the decline in the value of the dollar.   But this improvement did little to shrink the deficit for theyear, an imbalance reflecting a continued worsening in merchandisetrade and a shrinking of the investment surplus.   The merchandise trade deficit, on a current accounts basis,totaled $159.2 billion last year. Adding to that deficit were U.S.foreign aid and other government transfer payments totaling $13.5billion.   The deficit was lowered slightly by a surplus of $12 billion inthe service category. While foreigners now own more in U.S.investments, the payments still show a slight surplus in America'sfavor because many of the older U.S. investments are earning ahigher rate of return.   Economists said the $12 billion surplus in 1987, down from $18.6billion in 1986, will shrink even more in 1988 and by 1989 willdrop into a deficit, further complicating the country's efforts toreduce its trade imbalance.   Bergsten estimated that total U.S. debt held by foreigners wouldrise to around $700 billion to $800 billion by 1995, requiring netinterest payments of around $25 billion annually.</TEXT></DOC>
