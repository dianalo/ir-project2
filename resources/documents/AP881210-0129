FRAZIER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South Africa's release of journalist ZwelakheSisulu and better treatment of long-imprisoned black nationalistleader Nelson Mandela are time-buying tactics by the white minoritygovernment, members of Sisulu's family said Saturday.   The relatives were in Atlanta to accept the third annual $100,000Carter-Menil Human Rights Prize at the Carter Center.   In remarks prepared for delivery at the ceremony Saturday night,former President Jimmy Carter said that despite improvements in theMiddle East, Latin America and the Soviet bloc, ``I cannot reallysay that the human rights conditions in the world have improvedsignificantly in 1988.''   Sisulu, editor of the New Nation and one of South Africa's mostprominent black journalists, was arrested two years ago, hours afternew censorship laws were imposed. He was held without charges untilhis unexpected release Dec. 2.   Sisulu, 37, a former Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, isunder indefinite orders not to work for a newspaper, giveinterviews, be in the presence of more than 10 people at once orvisit schools. He must report to police twice a day and stay at homebetween 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.   ``The regime wants a pat on the back,'' said Max Sisulu, abrother who is active in the banned African National Congress andhas lived in Zambia since 1963. ``They release some but they arrestmore. It will continue.''   The restrictions, he said, are making his brother ``his ownjailer. It is the most vicious form of restraint. He is a journalistand he cannot earn a living.''   Their father, Walter, a former ANC official, has served 24 yearsof a life sentence and remains jailed.   Max Sisulu and sisters Lindiwe, who is studying in England, andBeryl, who lives in Johannesburg, came to accept the award on behalfof the family. They said the money likely would go to a trust fundto help families of political prisoners.   They urged international sanctions to try to halt South Africa'spolicy of apartheid, or racial separation, peacefully if possible,but Max Sisulu questioned whether it would work.   ``When the regime closes peaceful avenues, what is left for thepeople to do?'' he said in an interview. ``People are starting notto see the government as a vehicle for change.''   Carter, in a brief interview, said President-elect George Bushmay take a stronger stand against South Africa than President Reaganhas.   Bush, he predicted, ``may not be so readily inclined to vetopolitical and economic restrictions the U.S. Congress would like toput on South Africa.''   He agreed with the Sisulus that apparent concessions to blackdissident leaders have been largely ``window-dressing.''   Mandela, 70, recently was moved to a house on a prison farm afterbeing treated for tuberculosis. He was sentenced to life in prisonin 1964 for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government.   Dominique de Menil, a Houston philanthropist who funds the prize,said ``the answer lies with the South African government'' as towhether apartheid ends peacefully or through bloodshed.   Carter and Ms. Menil picked the Sisulu family to win the awardfrom a list of candidates drawn up by a committee of human rightsrepresentatives.   Last year the award went to the a group called La Vicaria de laSolidaridad of Santiago, Chile, for its work in human rights. In1986, the award was shared by Soviet dissident Yuri Orlov and theMutual Support Group of Guatemala, which works with missing familymembers of victims of political violence in that Central Americancountry.</TEXT></DOC>
