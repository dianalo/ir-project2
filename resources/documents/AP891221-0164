Itwas still too cold.   The arctic onslaught of record low temperatures that has plaguedmuch of the nation for 10 days sent another thrust across theborder, closing hundreds of schools from Montana to the EasternSeaboard, freezing an Amtrak train in its tracks in North Dakotaand threatening Texas' citrus crop.   But the double wallop of frigid temperatures and high polarwinds blamed for more than 40 deaths nationwide was expected toslacken after Friday, promising a Christmas that would be merelyseasonably cold, forecasters said.   ``We're going to moderate right into Christmas,'' said NationalWeather Service forecaster Steve Kahn in Chicago. ``Temperatureshave stopped falling _ they are going to rebound a little bit.''   That was small comfort across the Midwest and West, where windchills Thursday dipped to as low as 83 below in North Dakota, morethan 70 below in Minnesota and Nebraska and 61 below in Illinois.   In Havre, Mont., an overnight low of 43 below broke a record forthe day set 1884. Chicago set a new record with a minus 13, colderthan in 1872, when the previous record of 12 below zero was set.   In all, at least 17 cities reported new record low temperaturesfor the date Thursday morning, including 20 below zero in Omaha,Neb.; 19 below in Dubuque, Iowa; 17 below in Des Moines; and 7below in Topeka, Kan.   Numerous record lows were likely to be established east of theRockies by Friday night, and before the cold wave is over parts ofthe country may experience their coldest night of record, accordingto National Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City.   Snow generated by the cold front blew across much of the HighPlains and parts of the central Rocky Mountain region, the OhioValley and the central Appalachian region in the afternoon.   Weather service officials warned that the subzero temperaturescombined with stinging wind could cause frostbite in a matter ofminutes.   ``This is just about as bad as it can get in Iowa,'' saidNational Weather Service forecaster Scott Truett in Des Moines.``Especially this time of year.''   Chicago police opened station doors to the homeless seekingshelter while waiting for vans to take them to city-operatedwarming centers. At least 10 people have died of exposure in theChicago area since the cold snap began, said a spokeswoman for theCook County Medical Examiner's office.   Among the deaths elsewhere were two elderly Pittsburgh-areawomen whose space heaters, their only source of heat, were notenough to withstand the cold, officials said. ``Basically it meansthey froze to death,'' Deputy Coroner James Gregris said.   Winter officially began at 4:22 p.m. EST Thursday, but itclearly had its own timetable. By mid-morning, hundreds of schoolshad been closed in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri,Wisconsin, Ohio and New York.   Some school officials said they did not want young childrenwaiting for buses or walking to school.   ``We thought it might be dangerous,'' said Jean Kennedy, aspokeswoman for Mthe Parkway school district in the St. Louis, Mo.,area.   Business was good at towing companies and auto parts stores, ascustomers sought out batteries, thermostats and engine heaters.Tammy Collett of Council Bluffs, Iowa, said she called 10 towersfor assistance, but only one would send a truck.   ``They said they were too busy or they wouldn't come out, andthey were all 24-hour towing companies,'' she said. ``It was notvery pleasant, that's for sure.''   ``We haven't seen anything like this for five years,'' AmericanAutomobile Association spokeswoman Maureen Quinn said in Madison,Wis. ``The number of road calls for road service is seven times ournormal level.''   Other businesses that employ outdoor workers gave employees theday off Thursday. In Indiana, the Salvation Army issued ``takecover'' warnings to its bell ringers.   ``The roofers are off,'' said Louise Wolotka, a secretary withCharles Gluth andamp; Sons roofing company in Gary, Ind. ``Even theground crews are off. We wouldn't do that to them. It's toodangerous with the wind chill up on the roof.''   ``Everybody's getting calls. I hope it stays like this foranother month,'' said Jason Grosz, a district sales manager in theBismarck, N.D., office of the American Automobile Association.   In Minot, N.D., Amtrak's Empire Builder passenger train came toa halt as fuel froze in its engine, stranding about 300 passengersin area motels overnight Thursday.   Forecasters in Texas and Louisiana feared a worse cold snap thanthe December 1983 freeze that virtually wiped out the Rio GrandeValley's citrus crop, killing hundreds of thousands of orange andgrapefruit trees. Temperatures were expected to drop into the lower20s Friday and Saturday.   That disaster crippled the Valley's economy and forced growersto replant trees that were expected to mature this season andproduce a full crop for the first time.   In Louisiana, citrus farmers got all hands into the groves,picking frantically to save as many oranges and satsumas aspossible.   ``If it gets down to 25 and stays there for five hours, which isvery possible, we would lose the fruit,'' said Gwen Becnel.   Elsewhere, strong northerly winds produced squalls with heavysnow in the Great Lakes region. Subzero temperatures and blowingand drifting snow blanketed parts of upstate New York Thursdaymorning. The town of Pulaski was buried under 4 feet of snow in onenight, and 2 feet of snow was reported at Barnes Corners.   In western Pennsylvania, the arctic cold front was expected tosend the wind chill index plunging to 40 degrees below zero Fridaynight.   Sunny skies and seasonable temperatures prevailed across much ofthe West, however, with the Rocky Mountain range serving as kind ofa protective barrier from the arctic invasion.</TEXT></DOC>
