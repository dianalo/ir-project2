Specifically, these new policies contemplatedthe enhancement of possibilities for direct negotiations between buyersand sellers. They were formulated at a time when there was a known surplusof supply, hence the possibility that a change to market-oriented pricingcould result in a large drop in price, with serious consequences to theindustry. A balance between the interest of producers committed to long-terminvestments and the interest of those who had not had previous accessto markets outside Alberta was therefore necessary. The results of thisnew situation have seen increased activity by Alberta producers in othermarkets, although the export market to the USA is still not completelycompetitive. Most of the gas is flowing under relatively short contracts.As the market situation matures, it is expected that long term contractswill reappear.</TEXT></DOC>
