Friedley, the 48-year-old vice president and general manager of its communications group.    The maker of scientific instruments said Mr. Friedley will succeed Earl Wantland in those posts. Mr. Friedley will assume the new positions on Nov. 1. Mr. Wantland will become vice chairman, a post that had been vacant. In a statement, Mr. Wantland said he asked the board a year ago to begin seeking a successor because he thought the company &quot;could benefit from the energy of a new leader.&quot; Mr. Wantland, 56, has been president since 1971 and added the chief executive title in 1974.    In addition, Tektronix said it named director Robert W. Lundeen, who is a former chairman of Dow Chemical Co., to the post of chairman. Mr. Lundeen, 66, will succeed John D. Gray on Nov. 1. Mr. Gray will remain a director. Tektronix said the move is in line with a company policy of having outside directors serve as chairman.    A spokeswoman said Mr. Friedley will be named to the board within a few weeks. Board membership remains at 11 after the management changes scheduled for Nov. 1. </TEXT></DOC>
