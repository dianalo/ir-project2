<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-67-0098 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Cr-Mo-V steels have been frequently used for turbine rotors in powergeneration facilities because of their superior high-temperature properties.When such a rotor fails during service due to cracking from fatigue,creep, or stress corrosion, there are several options one can take. Oneis to replace the rotor with a new one, which is the traditional approach.Another, now being used more commonly, is to repair the rotor using welding.The latter approach is considered increasingly feasible as welding techniquesfor rotor materials are developed, and it is attractive because the costsof weld repairs are significantly less than those of replacement. Oneof the difficulties in this kind of welding is the potential susceptibilityof the rotor steel to various kinds of cracking. This investigation,which is part of a larger program on rotor steel welding concerns hotcracking and its mitigation. The tendency for cracking is therefore increasedwhen alloy elements that promote the formation of low-melting liquidfilms are present. Other forms of cracking may also be of concern inthese steels, such as delayed cracking or stress relief cracking. However,this paper is concerned with hot cracking. The results of the study areintended to provide potential ways to improve the quality of rotor welding,and especially repair welding.</TEXT></DOC>
