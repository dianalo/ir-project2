<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-0109 </DOCNO><TEXT>The energy dependence of the relative production rate of three-jet eventsis studied in hadronic e/sup +/e/sup -/ annihilation events at centreof mass energies between 22 and 46.7 GeV. Three-jet events are definedby a jet finding algorithm which is closely related to the definitionof resolvable jets used in O({alpha}/sub s//sup 2/) perturbative QCDcalculations, where the relative production rate of three-jet eventsis roughly proportional to the size of the strong coupling strength.The production rates of three-jet events in the data decrease significantlywith increasing centre of mass energy. The experimental rates, whichare independent of fragmentation model calculations, can be directlycompared to theoretically calculated jet production rates and are ingood agreement with the QCD expectations of a running coupling strength.The hypothesis of an energy independent coupling constant can be excludedwith a significance of four standard deviations.</TEXT></DOC>
