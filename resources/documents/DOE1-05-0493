MRI was superiorto plain CT in the detection of collateral vessels in liver cirrhosisand extrahepatic protal vein occlusion. MRI could also demonstrate theoccluded part of the inferior vena cava in Budd-Chiari syndrome. However,MRI was almost the same as CT in the visualization of the hepatic configurationin liver cirrhosis. In liver cirrhosis, T1 values of the liver and thespleen were longer than those in normal controls, and T1 values of theliver were correlated with ICG R-15. Hepatic T1 values in Budd-Chiarisyndrome were longer than those in normal controls.</TEXT></DOC>
