Military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said thecommand recommended Friday that the Taipei District Court chargeZhang Qingguo, 27, and Long Guiyun, 26, with endangering flightsafety. The maximum sentence for committing such a crime is thedeath penalty.   Lawmakers of the governing Nationalist Party said in a statementissued Friday, ``They (the hijackers) had noble goals, but theirmethods were mean.'' The two young workers commandeered the Boing737 shortly after it took off Thursday evening with 118 peopleaboard from communist China's coastal city of Xiamen in Fujianprovince. The two men made the pilot fly to a military air base incentral Taiwan.   After more than five hours in Taiwan, authorities allowed theplane to return to Xiamen early Friday morning with everyone aboardexcept the two hijackers, who were quickly granted asylum. No onewas hurt.   Government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming said Friday the two hijackerswere allowed to stay because they would have faced ``their doom''if sent back home. While denouncing hijacking, he called theirmotives ``simple and noble.''   The Nationalist government, which fled to Taiwan from theChinese mainland after losing a civil war to the communists in1949, still claims to be the rightful ruler of all China andremains technically at war with Beijing.   A group of nine legislators, however, condemned the twohijackers for threatening the lives of passengers aboard the planeand urged the government to treat them as criminals and put them ontrial.   It was reported earlier that authorities and lawmakers here wereconcerned that the quick granting of asylum would tarnish Taiwan'simage.   The incident was the first hijacking of a Chinese commercialairliner to Taiwan.   ``We would have been sending them to their doom if we turnedthem back to the communists,'' Shaw said.   ``They have risked their lives to seek freedom and democracy. Wemust respect their wishes and offer them protection.''   In a television interview, the air pirates triumphantly detailedtheir do-or-die mission.   Zhang, a worker at an arsenal in south China's Yunnan province,told the official Chinese Television Service he and his companion,Long, a steelworker from neighboring Guizhou province, used a toypistol and a bottle of fake explosives to force the plane to Taiwanlate Thursday.   ``We would have committed suicide if we failed,'' Zhang said inthe televised interview. ``We never planned to return (to China).''   In 1983, six Chinese hijacked a Chinese airliner to South Koreaand spent less than a year in jail there before resettling inTaiwan, where they received a hero's welcome and financial support.</TEXT></DOC>
