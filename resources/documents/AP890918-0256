Dennis DeConcini said Monday he isreturning re-election campaign money raised by American ContinentalCorp. founder Charles H. Keating Jr., who is being sued for his rolein failed Lincoln Savings and Loan.   Federal regulators on Friday filed a $1.1 billion fraud andracketeering civil lawsuit against Keating and a number of relativesand associates on behalf of Lincoln, a wholly owned subsidiary ofAmerican Continental of Phoenix.   Defendants named in the suit included William J. Keating, brotherof Charles Keating Jr. and a director of American Continental fromFebruary 1986 through March 1987.   William Keating, who is an attorney, is president of the DetroitNewspaper Agency and chairman of the board of directors of TheAssociated Press.   The civil lawsuit, filed by the federal Resolution Trust Corp.under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, alsoalleges negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.   The lawsuit charges fraud in the takeover of Lincoln andsubsequent mismanagement that squandered the thrift's assets,diverted ``enormous'' sums of money to the parent company andbenefited American Continental and its executives at Lincoln'sexpense.   DeConcini, an Arizona Democrat, said he would return $48,000raised by Keating because the government's suit ``raises the seriouspossibility that money from Lincoln Savings may have been illegallyfunneled into a number of political campaigns.''   Two U.S. senators from other states said Monday they would notreturn contributions. Another U.S. senator previously returnedKeating-related contributions.   DeConcini had told reporters Friday he would repay the money ifthe charges held up in court. But DeConcini spokesman Bob Maynessaid Monday the senator was in the process of issuing checks to 26individuals.   ``I regret that there may be any appearance of impropriety on mypart,'' DeConcini said. ``In all of my relations with the FederalHome Loan Bank Board I was acting in good faith in seeking toprotect over 1,500 Arizona jobs.   ``My actions were not in any way related to the contributionsraised for my campaign,'' he said.   Maynes said the 1,500 positions were held by American Continentalemployees.   Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who received $112,000from Keating and associates, will return contributions only if acourt determines they were illegal, spokeswoman Victoria Clark saidMonday.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., has no intention of returning$39,000 raised by Keating for his 1986 campaign, Cranston spokesmanMurray Flander said.   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich., alsoreported campaign contributions from executives and other employeesof Keating's company, but returned the $76,100 after it waspublicized during his 1988 re-election campaign.   Keating, a former Cincinnati lawyer, and associates also gave$200,000 to a now-defunct committee that paid for U.S. Sen. JohnGlenn's political appearances prior to and after the Ohio Democrat'sunsuccessful 1984 presidential campaign.   Glenn said he has ``no plans to return this or any otherpolitical contribution.''   Edwin Gray, then-chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,and other officials met in 1987 with DeConcini, McCain, Glenn andCranston to discuss Lincoln Savings, then under examination by theFederal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco.   Gray maintains he was asked, apparently on Keating's behalf, torevoke a thrift regulation limiting investments.   The senators have denied any wrongdoing, and DeConcini saidMonday he would not have participated in the meeting ``if theinformation that is now known about the activities of Mr. Keatingand American Continental had been known to me.''</TEXT></DOC>
