RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court, in a victory for civilrights lawyers and their clients, today upheld the award of morethan $4 million in legal fees to lawyers who won a Kansas City, Mo.,school desegregation suit.   The justices, voting 8-0, ruled that paralegals, law clerks andrecent law school graduates are entitled to compensation at themarket rate for their work.   By a separate 5-3 vote, the court said states that lose suchcases may be forced to pay extra money to civil rights attorneys ascompensation for a delay in payment.   State and city officials were held responsible for segregation inthe Kansas City school system and were ordered in 1985 to spend$87.7 million to improve and integrate the schools.   A federal judge then ordered the state to pay more than $1.7million to Arthur A. Benson II of Kansas City, the lead attorney forstudents who sued, and $2.3 million to the NAACP Legal Defense Fundfor its work.   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the attorneys' feeslast year under a federal civil rights law that awards them tolawyers who win such cases.   Missouri officials argued the legal fees were inflated illegallyto compensate Benson and the others for waiting years to be paid.   Justice William J. Brennan, in his opinion today, said theadditional compensation is not barred by a constitutional provisionthat protects states against some lawsuits.   He was joined in that part of his opinion by Justices Byron R.White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy.   Dissenting on that issue were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquistand Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.   Justice Thurgood Marshall did not take part in the ruling.   The case is Missouri vs. Jenkins, 88-64.</TEXT></DOC>
