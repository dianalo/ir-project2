Higher education, he wrote, is a &quot;labor intensive enterprise,&quot; with faculty pay at the private New Orleans school &quot;comprising a substantial portion of total expenditures.&quot;    A look at Tulane's budget shows that &quot;substantial&quot; has many interpretations. In the 1986-87 school year, compensation for its 402 full-time faculty members cost Tulane about $19.6 million -- 12% of its budget, not counting the university hospital. (Tulane says that total faculty compensation, including part-timers, is higher, but that it doesn't know the figure.) Most of the rest went to administration, scholarships and nonprofessional staff.    &quot;Dear Parent&quot; letters like Tulane's have become hardy perennials in the 1980s as colleges have sought to justify tuition increases far exceeding inflation. But as Mr. Kelly's version suggests, they don't always tell the whole story.    Faculty salaries and scholarships -- the expenses colleges most often cite as the reason for tuition increases -- have indeed gone up. But their growth has been surpassed by exploding administrative costs on campus in the past decade. Recruitment spending is way up, new nonacademic services have inflated student fees and colleges have added faculty at a rate higher than the growth in enrollment.    Add it all up, and the average college spends about 20% more to educate each student, after inflation, than it did a decade ago. Increased government funding for higher education has picked up some of the slack. But parents, too, are paying with bigger tuition checks -- much bigger.    Private four-year colleges surveyed by the College Board, a national admissions group, raised tuition by an average 141% in the past 10 autumns, vs. a rise in the consumer price index of 87% over the same period. At public schools, which receive state subsidies, the gain was 114%.    With room and board, a year at a private college now costs $11,982 on average; at a public college, $5,789. The price of such prestige schools as Harvard or the University of Chicago now exceeds $17,000 -- meaning that, counting future tuition increases and other costs, this year's privileged freshmen will pay more than $75,000 for a bachelor's degree.    Rising tuition has been one of the most rancorous issues dividing academe and the Reagan administration. U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett and his aides argue that colleges are inefficient and have been encouraged to raise prices because federal grants and loans make it easier for some students to pay.    &quot;The governing principle of colleges today is to raise as much money as they can, and to spend as much money as they can,&quot; says Bruce Carnes, deputy undersecretary of education.    College officials counter that the Education Department is using the tuition issue as a stalking-horse for cuts in federal student financial aid, which has fallen in real terms during the Reagan presidency. &quot;Inefficiency?&quot; asks Mr. Kelly of Tulane. &quot;Nonsense. The administration has clearly set out to reduce government spending on domestic programs, and (Mr. Bennett) is looking for a soft target.&quot;    Whatever Mr. Bennett's motive, colleges haven't exactly looked frugal of late. In the past two school years, for example, new art museums have been completed or planned at Harvard, Dartmouth, Ohio State and California State at Long Beach. Big spending at the University of South Carolina touched off a criminal probe earlier this year. While the inquiry found no evidence for charges, it did focus attention on such items as $300,000 paid to Jehan Sadat, the widow of the former Egyptian leader, for three semesters of part-time teaching.    At congressional hearings in September about college costs, educators offered familiar explanations for rising tuition: faculty pay has been boosted sharply to make up for meager past raises; operating costs outside their control have ballooned; government aid has fallen, making it necessary for them to provide more of their own money to needy students.    But government figures paint a different picture. Between the school years 1975-76 and 1985-86, the total budget for all 3,340 colleges in the U.S. increased 28% after inflation to $97.62 billion. Instructional costs, including faculty salaries, were up by 21% in constant dollars to $31.03 billion; student financial aid rose 32% to $4.25 billion.    The fastest-growing items in collegiate budgets during that period, however, were academic support, institutional support and student services -- the areas in which colleges book administrators' salaries, admissions-office budgets and other nonacademic operations. These costs were up 42% after inflation to $18.03 billion -- nearly 20% of the universities' total budget.    &quot;Some people call it the 'expense preference theory,' which is just another way of saying charity begins at home,&quot; says W. Bruce Bassett, a former Columbia University finance officer who has studied college costs. &quot;It's the administrations that decide what is spent and where, and they simply have been spending it on themselves.&quot;    Some state governments have moved to monitor or control the trend. In June, for example, the California legislature capped most of the spending on management salaries in the California State University system at $143 million, or 12% of total personnel costs. The move came after a legislative analysis found that the number of administrators had grown 31% since 1983, while enrollment rose only 5%.    The California Faculty Association charged that the growth in management was hidden by transfers of up to $18 million to the administrative budget from elsewhere. The union said California State at Long Beach was budgeted by the legislature for 23 executive posts in the 1984-85 school year, but actually filled 33 that year.    Caesar Naples, head of personnel for the 19-campus CSU system, denied that overall growth in management ranks was 31%. Mr. Naples said the legislative analysis was the result of reclassifying certain positions, not new hiring, which he said had added only 2% to 3% more administrators a year. Mr. Naples said he wasn't familiar with Long Beach's budget figures, and added that the legislature has launched a study to see whether administrative growth was justified.    Another huge source of nonacademic spending in recent years has been recruitment. Between 1977 and 1985, the number of high-school graduates in the U.S. dropped about 16% to 2.7 million. But the number of college students, at 12.3 million, is off only 2% from peak levels in 1983 and is actually up 9% from a decade ago.    Better marketing is part of the reason there hasn't been a major enrollment drain, says Ronald Ingersoll, who runs a Denver recruitment consulting firm. Mr. Ingersoll estimates that colleges now spend an average of about $800 to recruit each freshman, a substantial increase over estimates for past years.    Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland is typical of schools with strong reputations that are battling demographics with dollars. This year, Case will spend about $1.4 million on admissions -- or about $2,700 for each freshman -- up more than 20% from last year.    Case will blanket 100,000 prospective freshmen with half a million pieces of mail, much of it unsolicited. It will play host to hundreds of visiting candidates and circulate promotional films among high schools. One new gimmick: a 10-minute cassette tape, mailed to 20,000 prospects, with the sounds of such local attractions as Browns football, the Cleveland Orchestra and the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.    &quot;Spending is up, but we're all upping the ante,&quot; says Jean Scott, Case's admissions director. &quot;We've gone from a situation where colleges just sat back and waited for kids to come to them, to a situation where we go out and find them.&quot;    Colleges are also adding services far beyond such traditional amenities as the student union and the health clinic. Psychiatric services and counseling for such things as study problems and eating disorders have increased sharply in the 1980s, says Robert Gavin, president of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn. He adds that, although students and parents demand such services, colleges &quot;don't want to talk about it&quot; lest they appear to be wasting money.    Many colleges, too, have felt a need to upgrade facilities to keep pace with the competition. A new $12 million recreation center at Tulane will include racquetball courts, a health club and the campus's second and third swimming pools.    One of the reasons for the center, Tulane's building officials say, was a feeling that visiting parents and students were unimpressed with an aging gym compared with newer facilities at competing colleges. To help pay for the project, Tulane students voted for a mandatory fee increase of $80, which parents in the future won't have the option of declining.    Amid the growing emphasis on recruitment, however, faculty ranks have grown faster than student bodies. Between 1975 and 1985, the total faculty at U.S. colleges rose 13% to 710,000, while enrollment gained only 9.4%, according to government figures. A 1984 report by the Carnegie Commission for the Advancement of Teaching found faculty workloads declining to between five and 10 hours a week from an average of about 15 several decades ago, as colleges have become more research-oriented.    Part of the resulting increase in research time has been taken up by swelling government demand in recent years -- particularly in the area of defense -- on projects that are typically self-supporting. But some critics argue that the growth in career-oriented research, by which professors stake their claim to tenure, has proliferated without justification.    Colleges are afflicted by &quot;a kind of latter-day scholasticism -- debates about angels dancing on the head of a pin,&quot; says Mr. Bassett, the former Columbia official. &quot;There are hundreds of disciplines; each has its own subdisciplines, and each of these has its own occult journal. And each of these journals is more capillary than jugular.&quot;    Among the offerings in the expanding list of journals are such titles as the International Review for the Sociology of Sport, the Journal of Molluscan Studies, and Advances in Contraceptive Delivery Systems. The number of U.S. scientific journals alone has doubled since 1970, to perhaps 5,000 titles, publishers say.    The other major factor colleges have often cited as contributing to upward pressure on tuition is financial aid. Students nationwide got about $15.9 billion in federal aid in the 1985-86 school year, an after-inflation loss of $1 billion from a decade earlier. Colleges, on the other hand, spent about $1.04 billion more, in constant dollars, of their own money on scholarships.    Colleges say most of the new money is going to needy students, but just how much isn't known. Some poorer parts of the population, such as blacks and Hispanics, make up about the same part of the campus population as they did in 1976. Image-enhancing merit scholarships, meanwhile, have spread to at least 85% of all schools from 54% in 1970. Such grants, which reward promising athletes or scholars, don't consider need.    The Oklahoma legislature this fall mandated automatic scholarships for any student in the National Merit Scholarship program, which requires only high admissions-test scores. Students among the top 10 in their high-school class pay a discounted tuition at Bard College in New York state, saving some up to $16,000 a year. Tulane, which raised financial aid about 123% in five years to $18.2 million in the 1985-86 school year, now offers 100 full academic scholarships to incoming freshmen, up from 10 five years ago.    Colleges say such grants help students who couldn't qualify for need-based aid. But the grants are also a powerful recruiting tool. They prompt the interest of sharp students who wouldn't otherwise consider a particular school. They also boost the school's average freshman Scholastic Aptitude Test score -- an intensely watched indicator of quality.    &quot;The market for merit scholars (high SAT scorers) is about as hot as the market for good football players,&quot; says Dan S. Hobbs, interim chancellor of the Oklahoma board of regents.    What lies ahead? In August, three-fourths of the college officials surveyed by the American Council on Education predicted tuition rises next year would be lower than those this fall, when private schools raised prices by 8% and public schools by 6%. But the same group had underestimated this fall's increases, and some analysts see no end in sight to growing tuition bills, especially at select schools.    Like many others who have studied college costs, Michael McPherson, an economist at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., sees little possibility of developments in teaching that would radically improve productivity and thus lower costs. &quot;The long-term trend,&quot; he says, is &quot;for the costs to outpace inflation.&quot;    (See related stories: &quot;One Small College Provides a Lesson in Thrift&quot; and &quot;For Hard-Pressed Students, Financial Options Abound&quot; -- WSJ Dec. 11, 1987)    ---                   Ten Most Expensive Colleges                      1987-1988 school year                                Tuition     Room     Total                               And Fees   And Board  Costs    Bennington College (Vt.)   $14,850     $3,140   $17,990    Sarah Lawrence (N.Y.)       12,375      5,065    17,440    Barnard (N.Y.)              12,104      5,192    17,440    U. of Chicago (Ill.)        12,460      4,730    17,190    Columbia U.,     Columbia Coll.
