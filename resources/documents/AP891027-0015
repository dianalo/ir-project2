President Bush has refused to involve the government in thedispute despite his well-established power under the Railway LaborAct. Bush has said he wants management and the employees to resolvethe dispute.   The Senate, on a 65-35 vote, approved its version of a bill tocreate a commission to resolve the strike affecting about 30,000machinists, flight attendants and pilots who have been off the jobsince March. 3.   The House earlier approved a similar measure.   The Senate version would create a four-member bipartisancommission consisting of one House member and one senator from eachparty, appointed by the respective party leaders in Congress.   Fifty-five Senate Democrats were joined by 10 Republicans insupporting the bill. No Democrats voted against it.   Bush's Republican allies have tried for almost as long as thestrike to forestall a vote, but Senate Democrats voted earlier thismonth to close debate.   On Thursday, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said Bush'sinaction was incomprehensible.   ``Mr. President, nobody is asking you to come down on the sideof the workers, the strikers,'' Metzenbaum said. ``Nobody is askingyou to come down on the side of management.''   Metzenbaum cited 34 occasions in which presidents have appointedemergency boards, settling 26 strikes.   The panel created by the Senate bill would make recommendationson how to settle the strike and make further recommendations onmaintaining competiveness in the airline industry. The panel alsowould make recommendations on how to protect employee collectivebargaining rights in bankruptcy proceedings involving air carriers.   The report would be due in 45 days after enactment.   Five days after the strike began, Eastern filed for protectionunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Act. The company has continued efforts toreorganize in bankruptcy court and has said it plans to emerge as acarrier two-thirds its former size.</TEXT></DOC>
