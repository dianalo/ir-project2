All three sourceshave soft power-law X-ray spectra with low-energy cut-offs consistentwith absorption in the line-of-sight gas column density through our owngalaxy. The three objects also exhibit significant spectral variabilityin the X-ray band on time-scales ranging from a few days to a year. Ineach case, X-ray flux and spectral index appear to be correlated, inthe sense that the X-ray spectrum hardens as the source brightens. Theintrinsic ultraviolet to X-ray spectrum of these and several other X-raybright BL Lac objects can be modelled as a power-law continuum of energyindex {similar_to}1.0 below about 0.1 keV, above which the spectral slopesteepens.</TEXT></DOC>
