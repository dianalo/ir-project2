<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-51-1221 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have carried out conversion-electron Moessbauer (CEM) spectroscopystudies in rf-sputtered amorphous Tb/sub x/Fe/sub 1-//sub x/ films withx = 20, 24, and 25. The samples present a well-defined uniaxial anisotropyK/sub u/ on the order of 1 x 10{sup 6} erg cm/sup -3/, and the magnetizationis well aligned along the film normal as shown by rectangular hysteresisloops (both magnetization and polar Kerr). However, the analysis of theCEM spectra shows that the Fe moments deviate strongly from the filmnormal. The semiangle of the cone is calculated to be 35{sup 0} for x= 20 and 25{sup 0} for x = 24 and 25. Exchange coupling between Fe andTb moments and the well-known tendency in some amorphous alloys to formantiferromagnetic coupling between Fe moments are offered as possibleexplanations for this result. Finally, the average hyperfine field forFe is found to be 165 kOe with the high-field peak centered at around190 kOe.</TEXT></DOC>
