(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim and Tammy Bakker, along with a formertop aide, must repay $7.7 million to PTL for reaping undeservedprofits and mismanaging the TV ministry, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge RufusReynolds ordered Thursday.   Reynolds said he determined that the Bakkers and former PTL vicepresident David Taggart were overpaid during their last four yearsat the ministry.   PTL, now under administration of the bankruptcy court, sued theBakkers and Taggart last Feb. 1 for $52 million, alleging theygrossly mismanaged the ministry by taking huge sums for personal usebetween 1984 and 1987, while PTL couldn't pay its bills.   During the suit's trial before Reynolds in September and October,PTL dropped its claim to all but $7.7 million. Reynolds' judgment isthe first time any court has ruled that Bakker or other PTL leadersused PTL donors' money improperly.   In the order signed Wednesday and filed Thursday, Reynolds saidJim Bakker, who founded PTL and left in March 1987 after admittingto a tryst with former church secretary Jessica Hahn, must pay PTL$4.9 million. Tammy Bakker, his wife and former co-host of the PTLClub television show, must repay $677,397, and Taggart must repay $1million.   In addition, Reynolds ordered, Bakker and Taggart jointly mustrepay PTL another $1 million. Taggart was fired in April 1987 afterBakker handed over control of PTL to the Rev. Jerry Falwell.   Reynolds, in his 50-page explanation for the judgments, said theexpenditures at PTL under the Bakker administration were``unbelievable'' and a ``waste of PTL's money.'' He also accused theadministrators of ``gross mismanagement'' and ``total disregard forreality.''   The judge rejected Bakker's attempts during the trial to justifythe $6.6 million in salary and bonuses he and his wife collectedbetween 1984 and 1987.   Reynolds said in his order, ``In conforming with the religiousoverture of this case, this court observes that James Bakker eitheroverlooked or ignored parts of the Bible, including 1 Timothy 6:10... `For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while somecoveted after, they have erred from the faith and pierced themselvesthrough with many sorrows.'''   Reynolds said Galatians 6:7 should be applied to the PTL case:```Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man soweth,that shall he also reap.'''   Reynolds also said it appeared the PTL board of directors wasnever informed that the ministry and Christian theme park near FortMill was in ``any kind of precarious financial position.''   Bakker and Taggart, Reynolds said, ``approached the management ofthe corporation with reckless indifference to the financialconsequences of their acts.''   ``We plan to appeal,'' said Ryan Hovis, an Rock Hill attorneyrepresenting the Bakkers. Hovis said he could not comment onReynolds' order but said Bakker could not repay the ministry because``he doesn't have anything.''   Hovis said Bakker is ``obviously disappointed, as I think anybodywould expect him to be.''   A secretary at the Bakkers' new organization, Jim and TammyMinistries in Pineville, N.C., said Jim Bakker will not commentuntil he reads the order.   Taggart's attorney, Ben Cotten of Washington, did not immediatelyrespond to a message left on the answering machine seeking comment.   A federal grand jury in Charlotte has been investigating Bakkerand other former PTL officials for more than a year.   Last month, Bakker and several former PTL associates werenotified they are targets of that investigation, which focuses onpossible mail and wire fraud, conspiracy and criminal tax violations.   PTL attorney Brad Leggett said Thursday that although the Bakkersand Taggart have the right to appeal Reynolds's judgment to U.S.District Court, PTL intends to begin trying to collect.   ``We will start procedures to locate their property, which can besold to pay the judgment,'' Leggett said.   It was unclear how much money and property remains in theBakkers' names, as they are living in a home supporters rent forthem.</TEXT></DOC>
