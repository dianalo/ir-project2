Democrat-Herald on the space program:   If America wants to lead the way in space exploration, as itshould, now is the time to start. ...   On the 20th anniversary of the first moon landing July 20,President Bush called on the United States to build a permanentbase on the moon in the next century and then to send explorers tothe planet Mars. These are worthy goals, and they can be met. Butthey can't be met the way things are going now. ...   The government in the 1960s could afford an ambitious spaceprogram. Today it can't. ...   A space program to colonize the moon and strike out for theplanets might cost around _ to take a wild guess _ $100 billion ayear to start. ...   Bush, Congress and the American people ought to make up theirminds to overcome the present hurdles and to tackle this project.   To start, tens of billions of dollars going to the Pentagon forexpensive and unlikely-to-work weapons should be diverted to NASAinstead.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 21   Post-Bulletin, Rochester, Minn., on the space program:   The question is not whether America should renew and extend itscommitment to space exploration. It must do so.   The essential questions are about the priority this commitmentshould have, relative to other national purposes, and about thegoals the program should accomplish.   A manned flight to Mars, as suggested by President Bush, wouldbe a challenge equal to the moon flight. But the $30 billion costwould be staggering, and a project of that magnitude should requiremore specific justification than the desire to demonstrate ourvirtuosity in space.   What are the specific scientific goals? What are the practicalbenefits, either now or in the future?   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration should nothave the last word on such a project. It is a vast bureaucracy thatneeds an new mission to justify future expansion.   The president and Congress should consult the best scientificminds in the country before making irrevocable decisions on theissues.   It would profit us little to conquer Mars while losing our baseon Earth to poverty, crime and pollution.   A sense of proportion is needed, as well as the desire foradventure and discovery in space.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 24   The Seattle Times on offshore drilling:   To hear Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. tell it, the answerto the nation's energy needs lies ``just several miles off ourshores and in Alaska.''   Since imported oil accounts for a significant part of thecountry's total energy requirements, Lujan said, we're stillvulnerable to a paralysis like the one created by the Arab oilembargo of the 1970s.   The speech gave off disturbing signs that the Bushadministration is no more sensitive than its predecessor to theserious environmental issues involved in expanding offshoredrilling in areas such as Alaska's Arctic National Refuge andfragile sections of the Washington and Oregon coasts.   Lujan's remarks also signified that the administration istotally out of touch with the hot anger still being felt by mostAmericans over the oil spill outrages of recent months. ...   Lujan is right to remind Americans that the nation's domesticenergy suppliers do not meet demand. But a long-term solution tothe problems of U.S. dependence on foreign oil will be foundelsewhere _ a greater emphasis on conservation, for example.   The Bush administration ought to be more aggressive instiffening the timetable for fuel-efficient vehicles andencouraging a faster search for environmentally safe alternativesto the burning of fossil fuels.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 23   The Leaf-Chronicle, Clarksville, Tenn., on changing U.S. coins:   Does Abraham Lincoln need a ``facelift''?   The image of Mr. Lincoln, as well as of the other formerpresidents who appear on the obverse of U.S. coins, will berevamped if Congress has its way. The flip side of the coins willbe completely changed.   The director of the U.S. Mint, Donna Pope, testified before aHouse committee that she hasn't heard any demand from the publicthat the coins be altered. In fact, she said that the only peoplewho seem to be calling for new coins are coin collectors.   Regardless, Congress appears ready to go ahead with theredesign. Pending legislation would give the former presidents anew look and replace the ``tails'' images of the Lincoln Memorial,Monticello and the bald eagle with themes and freedoms guaranteedin the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.   Coins would continue to be the same size, weight, color andmetal content. All current inscriptions would also remain,including ``In God We Trust.''   Congressional supporters of the change have pointed out thatother Western countries alter their coinage every few years. Incontrast, Mr. Lincoln's face on the penny has been the same since1909.   Well, so what? With the United States falling behind somenations in vital areas such as the production and export oftechnology, should Congress be worrying about keeping up on pocketchange?   In the end, the legislative debates promise to be time consumingand the redesign procedure costly.   To recoin a phrase: The penny's image saved is a penny earned.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
