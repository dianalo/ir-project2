Platelets were deposited on C III mainlyas surface-bound aggregates. In contrast they were deposited on C IVmainly as spread forms of individual cells. Formation of aggregates onC III was more extensive for PRP than for GFP; in contrast platelet spreadingon C IV was more extensive for GFP than for PRP. The effects of an extractof the plant feverfew on platelet-collagen interactions were determined.Feverfew extract inhibited the deposition of {sup 51}Cr-labeled plateletson both C III and C IV in a dose-dependent way. Similar concentrationsof extract were needed to inhibit the formation of surface-bound aggregatesand to inhibit platelet spreading in both PRP and GFP.</TEXT></DOC>
