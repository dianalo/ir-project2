Rostenkowski said he had instructed his staff to &quot;make a thorough review of selected areas of the tax code with a view toward making them more rational.&quot; He didn't offer specifics, but the tax-writing committee is looking at potential changes in tax deductions allowed individuals, the corporate minimum tax and foreign taxes. The Ways and Means Committee also will consider easing rules that restrict tax write-offs for real estate owners who are active in the business, although any change in that area would reduce rather than increase revenue.    Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) agreed that a significant revenue increase is likely in 1989, but said in an interview that the shape of any tax boost &quot;depends on who the next president is.&quot;    Both Rep. Rostenkowski and Sen. Bentsen said Congress won't pass a major tax bill this year. Instead they plan to offer legislation that would only make technical corrections to the 1986 and 1987 tax laws. &quot;I'm confident that there will be no major tax changes this year,&quot; Rep. Rostenkowski said.    The Ways and Means chairman said that the &quot;driving force&quot; in shaping a tax increase next year will be &quot;sound policy principles, rather than the need to collect more dollars.&quot; Rep. Rostenkowski has been frustrated in the last year with having to make tax-increase choices to get the most revenue possible, even when that complicated the way taxes are levied. Tax increases now being considered by his tax-writing staff would attempt to simplify certain taxes.    For example, current law allows individuals to take miscellaneous deductions -- these are generally business expenses that aren't reimbursed by the employer -- only to the extent the expenditures exceed 2% of adjusted gross income. The Ways and Means staff will look at getting rid of the 2% floor and specifying what can and can't be deducted.    Another area under consideration is the corporate minimum tax. The Ways and Means staff will look at replacing the current system of calculating that tax based on a company's book income. The staff also will look at changes that would simplify but also increase the taxes on international income.    Some members of the Ways and Means Committee are sympathetic to complaints made by active real estate operators about the provision in the 1986 law that restricted the use of tax losses to offset other income. The committee staff will look at easing those rules for active real estate operators but wouldn't reopen the part of the law designed to clamp down on tax shelters.    Rep. Rostenkowski said he wants to take action on certain kinds of single-premium life insurance, to prevent their use as tax shelters.    The Ways and Means chairman said he expects the National Economic Commission, which is charged with making specific deficit-reduction recommendations by next March 1, &quot;will squarely address the tough questions and inevitably recommend that we do something to increase revenues.&quot; Rep. Rostenkowski said the federal budget deficit is &quot;dangerously high,&quot; and is &quot;a major contributor to our enormous trade deficit.&quot; The new president and Congress will have to take &quot;strong action to bring the deficit down,&quot; he added. </TEXT></DOC>
