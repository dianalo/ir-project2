form factor within two years, believes JimSpinehelfer of PrarieTek Corp, pioneering the baby drives: he says that theeffect will be a further reduction in the cost per bit of storage because thesmaller drives are cheaper to make than big ones.andM;International Message Switching Inc of North Hollywood, California has afive-year agreement with the Bulgarian state under which it will build aplant to manufacture high-speed data and image transmission systems developedin Israel: the cost of the project is put at $5m.andM;Priam Corp, San Jose has come out with a line of its 3.5&quot; Winchestersspecificallly configured for use with AT-alikes based on the 80386 and 80286:the internal drives come in capabilities of 41MB, 43Mb and 45Mb are availablenow in the US, with the 43Mb ID45t-AF having an AT interface; the 45MbID45T-SC an SCSI, and the ID45T-QC with standard 3.5&quot; 41Mb RLL storage systemand 45m9 access time; no prices.andM;THe biggest failure of the Comecon countries is in mastering the technologyto put the creations of their laborabories into serial production - theSoviet Union is able to match the US in the space race because all itsspacecraft and control systems are in effect one-offs - so no-one will belosing too much sleep over the news that Kombinat Carl Zeiss Jena willproduce prototype 4M-bit memory chips next year.andM;The challenge to the validity of Advanced Micro Devices Inc's patents onprogrammable array logic has failed: the Sunnyvale chipmaker says that itspatent on PAL circuits has been upheld in a re-examination proceedingconducted by the US Patent Office; the company looks for a re-examinationcertificate to be issued next month.andM;In a bid to cash in on the lucrative Apple Computer Macintosh add-on market,Maxtor Corp has XT-4000 5.25&quot; SCSI disk drives that are now compatible withMacs and offer formatted capacities ranging from 120Mb to 870MB: Maxtor'sline of LXT-50/100 3.5&quot; disk drives with formatted capacities of 45Mb and90Mb are also Macintosh-compatible; turnkey subsystems based on theseproducts are available from the Maxtor subsidiary Storage Dimensions Inc; noprices were given.andM;National Semiconductor Corp and Cabletron Systems Inc have joined forces todevelop an integrated family of Ethernet IEEE 802.3 local area networkrepeaters: the development is intended to result in the industry's first VLSIrepeater with comprehensive network management and control, and the device isexpected to be available late this year to form the basis for a newgeneration of lower cost, more reliable Ethernet products, supporting theIEEE 802.3 standard for Multi-Port Repeaters and the emerging 10Base-Tstandard for 10M-bit per second transmission over unshielded twisted pairwiring, as well as enabling distribution of network management intelligenceacross the entire system; it will also be cascadable to form large repeaterconfigurations, and Cabletron will use this and future NatSemi parts in itsMultio-Media Ethernet products.andM;Adobe Systems Inc has granted Canon Inc full licensing rights to itsPostScript interpreter, and Canon will be launching a line ofPostScript-compatible laser printers in due course: royalties on the deal arenot expected to feed through to Adobe's bottom line before 1990; Adobe hasalso licensed PostScript to Volt Information Sciences Inc on behalf of itsAutologic Inc subsidiary, which will use it in future laser imaging systems,notably a PostScript Page Image Processor.andM;Tandem Computers Inc's San Jos-based Atalla Corp says its new A-5000 HighPerformance Security Module is now available for channel-attachment to TandemNonStop VLX, TXP, EXT and NonStop II machines, claiming that it offers morethan six times the performance of its previous genrations A-1 SecurityModule: the new one is claimed to process over 60 transactions per second toproviding a secure, cost-effective system for high-volume transactions,protecting the data against unauthorized access or alteration as it passesthrough the network; Personal Identification Numbers are translated, verifiedand encrypted in hardware so that they remain private to the owner - and ifany attempt is made to open the Security Module, all cryptographic keys areautomatically erased; available in April, it is $47,500, and Atalla claimsthat complete fault tolerance can be achieved by installing two of the newModules.andM;Unisys Ltd has beaten off competiton from IBM, ICL and Nixdorf to win #3mworth of orders for shop automation projects from three UK electricityboards: the largest order is for London Electricity which is to install 270B28s and B26s linked to an IBM host; South Western Electricity is to install250 BTOS stations also linked to an IBM mainframe; the third order is fromNorthern Ireland Electricity where nearly 120 B28 workstations will be linkedover an X25 packet-switched network to the board's distributed Prime Computerminis and to its ICL mainframe.andM;DEC and Scicon Industry, a division of SD-Scicon Plc, have each won acontract worth #2m from the National Grid Division of the UK CentralElectricity Generating Board to supply a Settlement System for the privatisedelectricity industry: the system will run on a DEC 8820 VAXcluster andcommunication software and will use Sciconic, an advanced mathematicalprogramming package from Scicon; testing will be completed by mid-July 1989,followed by a three months trial so that the system can be audited byDeloitte, Haskins and Sells.andM;Unisys UK Ltd is to supply Keighley, Yorkshire-based home improvement companyMagnet Plc with an A17 dual processor mainframe so that it can developapplications using the Mapper generator: Magnet currently runs a Unisys A15with applications programs developed in Linc for accounting, personnelrecords, stock control, production control and so on; the A17 will be used tofurther develop these types of applications - but the company clearly prefersMapper from the Sperry side of the house to Linc from the Burroughs side,even though Linc is native to A-series.andM;Computer Network Technology Inc, Minneapolis has introduced three models ofits ChanneLink 5000 series of InterProcessor Gateway Products and a DS3high-speed data link capability; the ChanneLink Models 5411, 5438 and 5474link mainframe computers to IBM printers and terminal controllers, with theModel 5411 available for immediate delivery and the others following in June:base price for each is $42,500, and the DS3 and fibre optic link productswill be on limited release in the third, generally available in the fourthquarter.andM;Already building the UK Government Data Network that will provide a privatedata communications network for four ministries, Racal Electronics Plc willbe hopeful of getting the follow-on business to set up an operate a fullprivate telecommunications network for the government, business that theFinancial Times reckons could be worth #2,000m to #3,000m over seven years -but Plessey Co Plc will no doubt be hopeful of getting at least some of thebusiness on the back of its own new ISDN network (CI No 1,136).andM;Digital Equipment Co Ltd - DEC UK - has put local prices on the newVAXstation 3520 and 3540 symmetric multi-processors, which will be availablewith Ultrix in April and VMS in May - how about that - Unix arriving beforeVMS: an 8Mb diskless 3520 with keyboard, mouse and base software is #22,047,and a 16Mb version with 330Mb disk, 296Mb tape as well as the stuff in thebase configuration costs #38,071.andM;Millicon Inc has joined forces with the London Taxis International subsidiaryof premier Black Cab builder Manganese Bronze Holdings Plc to acquire theassets of Capital Taxifone Plc, the company putting cellular telephones inLondon cabs, on a 51%-49% basis: the venture will also offer facilities thatwill enable cab users to pay their fares by credit card; terms were notdisclosed, but Alan Patricof Associates originally put up the venture capitalfor the business and will get performance related payments over the next fiveyears.andM;British Telecommunications Plc has taken a 12% stake in TelehouseInternational Corporation of Europe Ltd, a company formed to offer acustom-built centre for computing and telecommunications services in London'sDocklands: the company was established a year ago with initial capital of#15m and the biggest two shareholders are both Japanese - Kokusai DenshinDenwa Co with 33% and a Nomura Securities Co subsidiary, which has a 23%shareholding.andM;Morino Inc, Vienna, Virginia and Duquesne Systems Inc, Pittsburgh are almosthitched: shareholders of both software companies have now voted to approvethe proposed combination, which is now expected next week; a new company willbe formed at formal closing, but they have not said what the new name willbe.andM;The US Federal Communications Commission voted 3-0 yesterday to cap ATandamp;T Co'srates instead of limiting the profit it is allowed to make, as at present:the phone company had been arguing for the switch, saying that capping itsprofits inhibited it from developing new services; the change comes July 1.andM;Hitachi Ltd has firmed up plans for a US software conversion centre, which isnow set to open in Los Angeles next month: the centre will convert Japanesesoftware for use on US computers, and US softwawre for use on Hitachicomputers - and is likely to be a key instrument in Hitachi's plannedonslaught on IBM with its own operating software as well as hardware in theUS market.andM;Honeywell Inc, Minneapolis has got rid of yet another business, its SignalAnalysis Center unit going to privately-held Integral Technologies Inc inHunt Valley, Maryland, on terms that were not disclosed.andM;And VEB Kombinat Robotron of Leipzig is having talks with Honeywell Inc aboutthe Minneapolis company building the East German's computer technology intoits automation and control systems, Reuters reports.andM;Guilderland, New York-based Intermagnetics General Corp says it has beengranted protection by the US Patent Office on a patent that covers a newconcept and production process for fabricating superconducting materials: thenew process is to fabricate multifilamentary superconductors withsubstantially higher electric current carrying capacity that singlefilaments, and has been successfully demonstrated for presently producedNiobium Titanium superconductors, although the company believes it to beapplicable to all superconductors, including new high temperature materials.andM;MCI Communications Corp is offering speech, data and facsimile services toand from ships at sea via the International Maritime Satellite system -provided the ships have Inmarsat earth station terminals.andM;We deplore the growing practice of running April Fool items in publicationsthat don't actually appear on the morning of the day in question - if youdon't have an issue that appears on April 1, the joke is on you - but theembarrassment they cause can sometimes be quite amusing, witness thefollowing apologia: &quot;The iconoclast column by Steve Levy that appeared in theApril issue of Macworld is an April Fool's joke; Microsoft and IBM have NOTcollaborated on a $1,000 color Macintosh clone; Macworld regrets anyconfusion that resulted from the satire&quot;; who's folling who(m)?andM;IBM UK has increased prices 3% on all hardware apart from 3090 seriesequipment, the new deep discount price to dealers who take enough of thethings on the PS/2 Model 30, and typewriters, effective today - but it's notlikely that too many people will end up paying the new prices because themarket is so competitive these days that users can usually twist the arm oftheir friendly neighbourhood IBM salesman to get a deal - although resellersmay not be so lucky: IBM puts the increases down to increases in &quot;the cost ofdoing business&quot;; software tags are not affected this time.andM;The UK Ministry of Defence is demanding that if the GEC Siemens Plc bid forPlessey Co Plc is allowed to proceed, the Monopolies andamp; Mergers Commissionmust insist that Plessey's sonar and torpedo divisions be sold on to preservecompetition; with the Commission now considering the impact of the transferof the last UK chipmaker to Siemens and GEC (CI No 1,135) - despite thesqueals from GEC, with a failed joint venture with Fairchild Camera andamp;Instrument and a second source agreement on the pioneering Intel 8080 thatwas never activated, that company's record in semiconductors is so dismalthat it hardly sounds a convincing guardian of the UK's interests - it looksincreasingly likely that any green light from the Commission will be sohedged around with restrictions that it may not be worth the two companieswhiles to proceed with any new bid.andM;Hewlett-Packard Co has added a 20MHz 80386 model to its HP Vectra line ofpersonal computers: to be available from April 1, the QS-20 comes in fourmodels ranging from $4,500 to $6,000, with a fifth model with high-capacitydisk drive and a list price of $6,700, is expected to be ready later in thesecond quarter, the company said.andM;Looks as if Dataproducts Corp's days as an independent are numbered: theWoodland Hills, California OEM printer maker says Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co hasdistributed non-public material on the company to a number of potentiallyinterested buyers of Dataproducts that have signed confidentialityagreements.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
