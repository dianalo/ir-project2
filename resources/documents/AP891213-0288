One day after hotel queen Leona Helmsley was sentenced to sevenyears in prison for tax evasion, a federal jury convicted chemicalsmanufacturer GAF Corp. and vice chairman James T. Sherwin of stockmanipulation, securities fraud and other charges.   The verdict _ which followed two mistrials in the same caseearlier this year _ was another notch in the government's belt ofsecurities fraud convictions.   But some lawyers said it was surprising because of controversialand often contradictory testimony by admitted felon Boyd L.Jefferies and surprise evidence introduced at the trial's closeundermining central portions of the government's case.   ``The pattern you see from a variety of these cases is that ifthere is some smoke there _ circumstantial evidence _ then juriestend to find there is some fire,'' Columbia University securitieslaw professor John C. Coffee Jr. said.   ``I do think the jury particularly in Wall Street cases has agood deal of skepticism of the motives of people,'' he said. ``Thisis a case where there was some evidence but it was a one-witnesscase.''   Wayne, N.J.-based GAF, Sherwin and two subsidiaries wereconvicted of eight counts of stock manipulation, securities fraud,wire fraud and conspiracy. Two GAF subsidiaries were acquitted ofall charges.   They were found guilty of manipulating the price of UnionCarbide Corp. stock in collaboration with Jefferies in October1986, seeking to push up the share price before selling a largeblock GAF had amassed in a failed takeover.   With the exception of one split verdict, juries this year havereturned convictions in all major Wall Street fraud cases _ againstsix defendants in the Princeton-Newport Partners trial, takeoverspecialist Paul A. Bilzerian, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. bondtrading assistant Lisa Jones and others.   In addition, the government has obtained guilty pleas fromfigures such as former investment banker Martin A. Siegel,arbitrager Robert Freeman and stock speculator Salim B. Lewis.   ``It's another part of the message that the U.S. attorney'soffice has been sending to the financially fortunate of ourcountry, that manipulation of our financial mechanisms and failureto pay taxes are going to be severely dealt with,'' said attorneyGerald Walpin, a former prosecutor.   The GAF jury returned a verdict after about only eight hours oftestimony. The second mistrial, in March, was declared after 12days and 93 hours of deliberations. The first mistrial was declaredbecause the government unintentionally withheld a piece of evidence.   ``Maybe all the media concentration on fraud on Wall Street haspressured the public that all the fraud on Wall Street was moresevere than it thought initially,'' said Alan Bromberg, asecurities law professor at Southern Methodist University.   ``I think we're developing a pretty healthy distrust of ourfinancial institutions,'' he said.   GAF lawyer Arthur Liman introduced evidence in the last week ofthe trial that appeared to show that telephone calls allegedly madeby Jefferies to Sherwin after Jefferies tried to manipulate thestock never actually occurred.   ``It seemed to be a pretty significant piece of evidence but thejury didn't think so,'' said one defense lawyer in a major case whoasked not to be named.</TEXT></DOC>
