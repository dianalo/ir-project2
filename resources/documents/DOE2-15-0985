This paper will review estimates of current and historicalemissions and analyze projections of future emissions of these pollutants.Historical changes in emission levels can be used in the investigationof long-term trends in precipitation acidity, dry deposition, air quality,and cumulative effects on forests, aquatic systems, and agriculturaland material resources. Projections of future emissions aid in the assessmentof the possible future intensity and geographical distribution of acidicdeposition that might occur in the absence of additional control measuresand in the analysis of the effectiveness and costs of possible new measuresto reduce emissions.</TEXT></DOC>
