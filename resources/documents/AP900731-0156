Opponents of the white-minority government had been demandingPresident F.W. de Klerk disband the military's Civil CooperationBureau as a signal that he was serious about curbing abuses by thecountry's security forces.   The chief of the Defense Forces, Gen. Jannie Geldenhuys, saidthe Civil Cooperation Bureau was being closed down and members werebeing transferred to regular army units.   Geldenhuys gave no reason for the decision.   Opposition activists have accused the Civil Cooperation Bureauand other branches of the security forces of involvement in thekillings of dozens of anti-apartheid figures in recent years.   Anti-apartheid leaders welcomed the government's decision.   ``The (bureau) was made up of people trained to kill, peoplewith tremendous vested interests in the status quo, and with aninterest in derailing the present (black-white) negotiatingprocess,'' said Denis Worrall, a co-leader of the liberalDemocratic Party.   Murphy Morobe, spokesman for the anti-apartheid UnitedDemocratic Front, said, ``the important thing is whether (thebureau) has really been disbanded or whether it will be transformedinto the same beast under another guise.''   De Klerk appointed a judicial commission in March to investigatethe killings of anti-apartheid activists.   During weeks of testimony, top military officials haveacknowledged that the bureau, formed in the mid-1980s, bombedanti-apartheid targets. The bureau also has claimed responsibilityfor delivering a baboon fetus to the home of Anglican ArchbishopDesmond Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize.   But military officials have denied bureau involvement inkillings of opposition figures.   The military has said the bureau had 139 members and an annualbudget of $11 million, and was engaged in highly sensitiveintelligence gathering operations in South Africa and abroad.   However, Defense Minister Magnus Malan and other top militaryofficials have claimed they didn't know about the bureau until lastNovember.   The judicial hearing into the unsolved killings ofanti-apartheid activists was scheduled to resume Wednesday after asix-week break.   In the past year, former policemen have said they were part ofauthorized death squads that killed anti-apartheid figures. Policehave denied authorizing any killings.   There has been no evidence directly linking the CivilCooperation Bureau to the alleged police death squads.   Since assuming power last year, de Klerk has downgraded the roleof the security establishment, which figured far more prominentlyunder his predecessor, P.W. Botha.   De Klerk says he wants to end the country's apartheid system ofracial segregation and negotiate a power-sharing agreement betweenthe 5 million whites and 30 million blacks.</TEXT></DOC>
