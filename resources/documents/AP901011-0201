But are Britons ready to have their favorite drink - or``cuppa'' - any other way?   Nestle failed to woo tea drinkers with an instant version morethan a decade ago, and many Britons are still horrified by officeinstant tea made by machines.   A spot check on a London street found Britons unenthusiasticabout the idea of tea granules, which Brooke Bond and PremierBeverage Products said Wednesday they will begin distributingnationwide.   ``That would be dreadful,'' said Garnham Trotter, a 48-year-oldelectrical engineer. ``We have instant tea in machines in theoffice and it's really dreadful.''   Susan Essex, a 26-year-old secretary, said: ``I think part ofthe pleasure of tea is the brewing of it.''   In the United States, instant iced tea is popular but the hotversion never caught on.   Tea is the favorite drink in Britain; 80 percent of thepopulation over age 10 drinks tea every day and the average persondrinks three to four cups a day, the Tea Council says.   Successful test runs in the Midlands in central England over thepast few months have convinced the two companies that their instanttea is the biggest development in the $1.2 billion tea market sincetea bags hit Britain 37 years ago. Tea bags make four-fifths of allcups brewed, loose tea the rest.   The Tea Council's executive director, Illtyd Lewis, said there'sbound to be a market for instant tea.   Still, he said, ``I don't see it turning the tea world on itshead. People will continue to brew the product in the traditionalways as they have done for hundreds of years.''   The two companies are spending $18 million marketing thegranules, and Premier Beverage Products even plans to distributefree samples to half of Britain's homes.   ``It's a natural progression,'' said Premier spokesman TonyCamp. ``This is what coffee has done.''   Camp conceded that making a traditional cup of tea is not sodifficult, or time-consuming - wet leftover bags aside. But ``ifyou can put convenience and taste together, it seems to be awinner,'' he said.   Nestle sold Nestea as an instant hot tea in Britain in the 1960sand 1970s, but it was not a success, said Nestle spokesman AllanAllbeury.   ``It was probably before its time,'' Allbeury said. ``Peoplewould brew their tea very much to their particular tastes. Nesteawas a very standardized flavor.''</TEXT></DOC>
