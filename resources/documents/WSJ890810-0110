The bank, which was set up in 1988 to hold low-quality loans of Mellon National Bank when that bank went through a restructuring, reduced the expected cumulative cash flow forecast by $275 million, mainly to reflect expected lower realizations from real estate assets. However, because the cash will be obtained more quickly, thus reducing interest costs, the bank said it wasn't necessary to reduce the value of its portfolio.    Shareholder equity at June 30 was $39.7 million, Grant Street said, after declining $16.1 million in the second quarter. While second-quarter collections on assets of $114.9 million exceeded the original cost basis of assets liquidated, collections didn't cover financing costs, expenses and other items.    &quot;We have shifted our strategy in the direction of more rapid liquidation because of continued very soft conditions in several real-estate markets where we have exposure,&quot; said William B. Eagleson Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer. Also, he said, &quot;We are becoming more concerned about the effect of Sandamp;L problems on real-estate values in the years ahead.&quot; With the federal government liquidating troubled savings and loan institutions, there may be enough real estate dumped on the market to depress prices, Grant Street officials explained.    Grant Street has a number of office buildings and other commercial properties in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Louisiana that could be affected by thrift liquidations, officials said. The bank also has residential land and other property awaiting development, as well as loans secured by real estate. </TEXT></DOC>
