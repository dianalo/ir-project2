It overhauled the federal tax code, slashed income-tax rates, and strengthened the U.S. military. But the changes that President Reagan wrought at home led to serious distortions in the international economy. Now the administration must spend its last two years trying to cope with the global economic problems.    The combination of soaring deficits and tight money kept interest rates in the early 1980s. That and the investment incentives in the 1981 tax cut lured foreign investors in droves, propelling the dollar to record heights. The rapid U.S. recovery, which helped pull the rest of the world out of recession, also sucked in a flood of imports, generating a huge U.S. trade deficit.    &quot;The U.S. economy has been living beyond its means more than is realized,&quot; Paul Krugman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, asserts. Now, he says, the U.S. is facing a painful choice; &quot;We're going to have to pull in our belts&quot; on our own terms, &quot;or the markets will force us to do it&quot; more abruptly.    The situation already is serious. The outsized trade deficits reflect a stunning deterioration in U.S. competitiveness and have produced massive trade imbalances around the globe. The U.S. is expected to run a trade deficit of about $165 billion this year, while West Germany and Japan are accumulating lopsided surpluses. Economists warn the disparity is unsustainable and ultimately could lead to a recession.    Worse yet, much of the setback is apt to prove lasting. The high dollar and strong demand here at home have enabled producers from even the most unlikely exporting countries to make inroads they never would have been able to before -- with firmly entrenched U.S. distribution systems.    U.S. companies lost market share to foreign competitors. Investment and productivity growth here are stagnant. The U.S. has become overly dependent on foreign capital, and America has begun amassing a foreign debt burden that eventually will prove costly to service.    Yet Washington still has no long-term policy to deal with the trade problem. The administration's primary response so far has been to devalue the dollar in hopes that that would make foreign goods less competitive. Treasury Secretary James Baker launched a late-1985 dollar-bashing effort that accelerated the dollar's slide. The U.S. has been trying -- unsuccessfully -- to persuade West Germany and Japan to spur demand at home so they can absorb more imports. And Congress has been flailing around, flirting first with protectionist trade legislation and, lately, with new incentives to &quot;improve U.S. competitiveness.&quot;    The dollar-devaluation effort has had only limited effect so far; the trade deficit has begun to shrink but very slowly. The huge profit margins that foreign producers amassed during the high-dollar days have enabled them to forestall the price setbacks that the devaluation was supposed to have forced. &quot;The exchange-rate has to come down a lot further,&quot; Barry Bosworth, a Brookings Institution economist, says. But Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker warns that much further devaluation of the dollar could threaten to reignite inflation, boost interest rates and spur a recession. Congress's trade proposals don't address the underlying problem.    To MIT's Mr. Krugman there's no mystery about what's needed: The U.S. must stop consuming as much as it does and must start saving -- and investing more. It then must begin girding itself like Argentina and Brazil -- to export its way out of its trade problem. &quot;What we're talking about is a muted version of what debtor countries have had to do,&quot; Mr. Krugman asserts.    Steve Hanke, chief economist for Friedberg Commodity Management Inc., says that means making a more serious effort to pare the federal budget deficit, eliminating the hundreds of government subsidies that bolster inefficient industries and raising taxes if necessary. Excessive government borrowing seriously saps available investment capital. &quot;An economy that saves as little as we do can't afford to be wasting resources,&quot; Mr. Hanke asserts.    Norman Bailey, a Washington-based consultant, contends the U.S. also needs to revamp its tax system to dampen consumption and encourage more saving and investment. Mr. Bailey suggests a new national sales tax; elimination of taxes on capital gains; removal of deductions for interest payments; and an end to taxes on interest from bank deposits. The touted tax-revision bill Congress passed this year may cut taxes for individuals, Mr. Bailey says, &quot;but it is heading us in the wrong direction&quot; on trade.    Finally, there's need for a massive effort by business and labor to invest in the production capacity and resources needed to make American products more competitive. The Fed's Mr. Volcker points out that with the current world-wide glut in agriculture, righting the U.S. trade balance will require a 30% increase in U.S. manufacturing output over the next five years. &quot;We are not investing in industry at a rate to support that growth,&quot; he says. Wage levels also will have to become more competitive. Adds MIT's Mr. Krugman: &quot;That means declining living standards for the next five years.&quot;    All that isn't as easy as threatening foreign producers with new protectionist measures or embracing faddish new ideas for &quot;improving competitiveness.&quot; But at least it addresses the real problem. </TEXT></DOC>
