The president used the White House signing ceremony to reiteratehis call for increased domestic oil exploration and drilling tocurb the country's reliance on oil imports.   ``The bottom line is, a strong domestic drilling and producingbusiness is essential for the national security of the UnitedStates of America,'' Bush said.   He said Energy Secretary James Watkins will develop a detailednational energy strategy in the coming months to deal with futureenergy requirements.   Watkins was to present a general outline of the administration'senergy policy at a congressional hearing. It is expected to includeemphasis on expanded reliance on nuclear power and a call for moreoil exploration along coastal areas.   In signing the natural gas decontrol bill, which was passed byCongress earlier this year, the president signaled the end to 35years of price control on the fuel.   Full natural gas decontrol is not expected to affect retailprices significantly because most gas already is selling below theofficial ceilings. However, critics maintain that full decontrolwill set the stage for price increases in the 1990s.   The administration's energy strategy was expected to includerenewed efforts to win public acceptance for an expanded nuclearpower industry and a call for more oil exploration, including alongcoastal areas.   Offshore oil drilling has raised widespread concerns because ofthe devastating damage and pollution caused by the massive oilspill from the Exxon Valdez tanker in Alaska's Prince William Soundin March.   Legislation is advancing in Congress that would extend amoratorium on such drilling to vast offshore stretches from NewEngland to Alaska. The Bush administration has opposed any suchmoratorium extension.   Shortly after he became energy secretary, Watkins ordered thedepartment to develop an ``action plan'' for dealing with expectedenergy needs, including more accurate estimates on future energyrequirements.   Calls for a revised national energy policy have intensified amidfalling U.S. petroleum production and increasing demand. At thesame time, there has been increasing pressure fromenvironmentalists to curb the use of fossil fuels because they area chief contributor to global warming.   Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore has said the department hadno preconceived notions about the focus of a national energypolicy. But he suggested an effort would be made to revive thenuclear industry by making nuclear power more acceptable, and thatoil companies could be given more latitude to explore for oil onfederal lands or in promising offshore areas.   Moore acknowledged the department must assemble more in-depthinformation on energy needs that is viewed as credible by producersand consumers alike.</TEXT></DOC>
