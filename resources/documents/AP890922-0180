They also said at least 17 Palestinians were wounded in clasheswith Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,which were shut down by a general strike. The strike was called bythe underground leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organizationto show solidarity with jailed activists and deportees.   According to government statistics, 9,392 Arabs are imprisonedincluding 2,124 held under administrative detention, which allowsthe army to jail a suspect for up to one year without trial. SixtyPalestinians have been deported from the occupied territories sincethe anti-Israeli uprising began 21 months ago.   In other developments, Israeli political leaders remained dividedover the Middle East peace plan proposed by Egyptian President HosniMubarak and a court acquitted a secret service agent who had beenaccused of negligence in the death of a jailed Palestinian.   Israel radio and Arab journalists said that in the Gaza Striptown of Rafah, masked militants attacked 36-year-old Saeed Abu Jazarwith clubs near his house and beat him to death. The journalistssaid Jazar was suspected of collaborating with Israel and of being adrug dealer.   At the Ketziot prison camp in the Negev desert, Palestinianinmates killed another suspected collaborator, 23-year-old KarimAbed Kareem, Arab reports said. The army confirmed the death andsaid it was checking the circumstances.   The two deaths raised to 116 the number of Palestinians killed byfellow Arabs for suspected collaboration.   Hospital officials reported 17 Palestinians were wounded inskirmishes with Israeli troops in three Gaza Strip refugee camps,Jebaliya, Khan Yunis and Bureij.   At least 573 Arabs have been killed by Israeli soldiers andcivilians since the uprising began in December. Forty Israelis haveperished in the violence.   There were no indications of a compromise between the rival Likudand Labor groups in Israel's coalition government over Mubarak'speace proposals.   Defense Minister YItzhak Rabin, speaking to members of hiscenter-left Labor Party, said he supported Egypt's offer to arrangea meeting of Israelis and Palestinians, including some Palestiniansdeported from the occupied territories.   He also repeated his party's support for the principle of tradingoccupied land for peace _ a point vehemently opposed by PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc.   ``Rabin is fed up with the uprising and I'm fed up with theseinternal wars,'' Shamir told the newspaper Maariv. ``We shouldadhere to our initiative and tell the Arabs ... if you want peacewith us you have to adopt the principles of this initiative. Let usstart negotiations without preconditions.''   The arguments are likely to continue until early October when theCabinet is to discuss the matter following the return of DeputyPremier Shimon Peres and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens from theUnited States.   A Shin Bet secret service agent accused of negligence in thedeath of a Palestinian during interrogation was found innocent bythe Jerusalem magistrates' court, an attorney for the agent said. Hesaid the court ruled there was lack of evidence in the case. Theagent was not identified.   Awad Hamdan, 23, died in custody in July 1987, two days after hisarrest for allegedly belonging to an illegal organization.   Israeli security officials reported Hamdan died of a heart attackor was bitten by a snake. Hamdan's family took the matter to court,saying they were told the prisoner died of suffocation but therewere torture marks on his body.</TEXT></DOC>
