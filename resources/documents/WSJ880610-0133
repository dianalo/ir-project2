The Nasdaq composite index of 4,637 stocks ended 1.19 higher, at 384.60 -- besting the previous post-crash high of 383.41 set April 13 and tied Wednesday.    Nasdaq volume remained higher than the recent average, with 143.3 million shares changing hands. Winners led losers by 1,234 to 851.    Nasdaq's medium-size and small-size issues were responsible for the rise. Huge issues such as Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems, LSI Logic and Seagate Technology all declined yesterday, and the Nasdaq index of the 100 biggest OTC stocks slipped 0.48 to 365.55. Some of the slippage was due to profit-taking on big OTC technology issues, which had been rallying this week.    In contrast, the Nasdaq industrial index, which tracks both big and small issues, added 0.86 to 397.92.    Radio was the big news on Nasdaq yesterday. Infinity Broadcasting Class A soared 9 to 30 1/2 on 1.1 million shares, nearly 50 times its daily average turnover. The New York company, the largest independent operator of U.S. radio stations, said a management-led group offered to buy it for $30 a share.    Other radio stocks perked up on the news. Jaycor added 1/4 to 5 7/8 on 148,000 shares; Malrite Communications Group rose 1/4 to 7 3/4, and on the American Stock Exchange, Clear Channel Communications jumped 1 to 13 3/4.    James Pappas, a money manager in Redding, Conn., who has been a major fan of these radio issues, said yesterday that while Infinity is clearly the foremost OTC radio stock, it and other stocks in the group have been undervalued. &quot;It's been my feeling for a long time that there's value in radio broadcasters,&quot; he said, but these issues &quot;have been sluggish for a long time.&quot;    Mr. Pappas said the sluggishness in radio stocks has been puzzling in light of the popularity of OTC cable and cellular-communication issues lately.    Among other active OTC issues yesterday, LyphoMed gained 3/4 to 10 1/4 in heavy trading of almost 1.3 million shares. The stock, which has been the No. 1 target of short sellers as measured by May's short-sales data, rose on news that the company received Food and Drug Administration clearance to begin producing two antibiotics at its Melrose Park, Ill., plant. The company said the approvals are the first it has received for drugs made at the plant since the FDA cited it for apparent quality-control violations last November.    Meritor Financial added 1 to 5 1/2 on more than a million shares. Roger S. Hillas, currently chairman of PNC Financial, will succeed Frederick S. Hammer as chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. Hammer will assume the newly created posts of president and chief operating officer at the Philadelphia thrift.    Hunter-Melnor climbed 3 1/2 to 14 1/2. The company agreed to be acquired for $15.50 a share by Leach McMicking andamp; Co., a San Francisco-based investment banking firm.    H.B. Fuller plunged 6 1/4 to 31 1/4. The St. Paul, Minn., chemical company estimated that net income for its second quarter, ended May 31, was less than the $6.9 million, or 73 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.    Dixie Yarns added 1 1/4 to 18 1/4. The Chattanooga, Tenn., yarn maker said it plans to repurchase as many as one million of its 11.1 million common shares. </TEXT></DOC>
