<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-61-0787 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report is the first phase of a study which examines the market potentialfor renewable forms of energy in remote locations in Canada (i.e. thoselocations not within reasonable distance of an existing main electricitygrid). Current and predicted energy demand and energy use are given forvarious areas, also categorized by fuel types, end uses, and type ofremote location. Separate attention is given to electrical energy, withspecial emphasis on diesel generation, the primary power source in remotecommunities. The renewable energy resource base in remote areas is surveyedand possibilities for alternatives to current energy sources are discussed.In general, data have been found to be sparse, except for small hydro,wind, solar, and non-aquatic biomass. Preliminary conclusions are thatsolar energy may have a limited role to play, the main problem beinglarge seasonal variations; small hydro sources look promising for a numberof sites; wind resources are comparatively attractive in some remotelocations; and biomass, especially peat and forest biomass, is availableand already being used, having a potentially significant role as a sourceof electricity generation. The study concludes, in a tentative fashion,that conditions do exist for a renewable energy role in remote locationsand that government should be involved in fostering that role. 20 refs.9 figs. 52 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
