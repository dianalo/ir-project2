Background</ITAG>On October 17, 1986, the President signed the Superfund Amendments andReauthorization Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-499), which extends and amendsthe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Actof 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 <T3>et seq.</T3>).As added by SARA, section 104(i)(2) of CERCLA requires the preparationof: (1) A list of hazardous substances found at NPL sites (in order ofpriority), (2) toxicological profiles of those substances, and (3) a researchprogram to fill data gaps associated with the substances.A priority list of the first 100 substances was published (52 FR 12866,April 17, 1987) (See Appendix), with a short summary of the procedure usedby ATSDR and EPA to compile that list. In that notice, the agencies solicitedpublic comment on the approach adopted for evaluating and ranking hazardoussubstances found at NPL sites, and announced the intention to refine thelisting process in response to these comments and ongoing efforts by theagencies to improve the listing process.The changes in the procedure used to prepare the second priority list aresummarized below. The agencies solicit public comment on this approach;such comments should be submitted in accordance with the instructions givenin this notice. The agencies will continue to seek improvements in thelisting process as future revisions of the list are prepared. All nonconfidentialcomments will be placed in the public file for this notice. A more detaileddescription of the revised listing methodology is contained in supportdocuments which have been placed in the public file and are available forpublic review (see unit V of this notice).<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Review of Methodology for Selecting Substances on the First PriorityList</ITAG>A. General Approach for the First Priority ListTo obtain the first list of 100 hazardous substances, ATSDR and EPA defineda subset of the 717 hazardous substances which formed the CERCLA list (undersection 102 of CERCLA). The subset was defined as those chemicals whichEPA has identified at National Priority List (NPL) sites. To rank the chemicalswithin this subset, three criteria were considered: (1) Chemical toxicity,(2) frequency-of-occurrence of subset substances at NPL sites or facilities,and (3) potential for human exposure to the substances. These criteriareflect the requirements of section 104(i)(2) of CERCLA, as well as thegeneral practice of defining human exposure potential of a chemical substance.To develop a detailed ranking system employing these criteria, ATSDR andEPA first reviewed a number of hazard scoring systems for their applicabilityto the ranking criterion of toxicity. From all the approaches considered,the Reportable Quantity (RQ) scoring scheme was selected for ranking toxicityof the 100 priority substances. The RQ scoring scheme is described in several<T4>Federal Register </T4>documents (50 FR 13456, April 4, 1985; 51 FR34534, September 29, 1986; and 52 FR 8140, March 16, 1987).The second criterion used by ATSDR and EPA to prepare the first prioritylist of hazardous substances was the frequency-of-occurrence at NPL sites.Data from the Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) was used for determiningfrequency-of-occurrence. The CLP is an EPA program which supports thatAgency's hazardous waste activities by providing a range of contract chemicalanalysis services. A statistically-designed survey of a subset of the CLPdata (CLP survey) was developed in 1984. The CLP survey represents a random,stratified sample of sites and waste samples from those sites that wereanalyzed under the CLP from 1980 to 1984. The survey provides data on thepercentage of sites at which a substance was detected at least once inany medium (i.e., frequency-of-occurrence) and the average and range ofconcentrations across media or matrices (e.g., soil, ground water, drums).The third criterion used to prepare the first priority list of hazardoussubstances was the potential for human exposure. ATSDR and EPA evaluatedvarious sources of data associated with this criterion, and selected theCLP survey data to derive a rough estimate of potential for human exposureto hazardous substances at NPL sites. Three types of exposure-related datafrom the CLP survey were used: the average concentration of the candidatesubstances detected in ground water and surface water across the 358 NPLsites included in the CLP survey; the frequency of detection of those substancesin ground water and surface water across the 358 sites; and whether thesubstances had been selected for detailed exposure and risk assessmentat Superfund Remedial sites.B. Generation of the First Priority ListUsing the ranking factors described above, as well as some minor criteria,ATSDR and EPA developed an algorithm incorporating these criteria to calculatea hazard index value for each candidate substance. This algorithm servedas the basis for generating the ranked order of the first 100 prioritylist substances.The starting point for the hazard index calculation was the subset of hazardoussubstances which EPA had identified at NPL sites based on the site percentdata from the CLP survey. The agencies divided the site percent data valuefor each substance (representing frequency-of-occurrence) by the lowestRQ value for the substance (based on acute toxicity, chronic toxicity,or potential carcinogenicity) to generate a site index for each substance.ATSDR and EPA ranked the candidate substances based on their site indices.The agencies then calculated an exposure index for each substance by rankingthem based on the three exposure-related factors (with each factor receivingequal weight). The final step in the algorithm was to combine the siteindex rank and the exposure index value to obtain a hazard index for eachsubstance. The substances were prioritized based on their hazard indices.For purposes of assessing hazardous substances in toxicity profiles, ATSDRand EPA combined some of the candidate substances into groups. If substancesare stereoisomers of one another, are readily metabolized to other substanceson the list, or generally are characterized as mixtures with respect totoxicity and/or frequency-of-occurrence, they were grouped together andoccupy only one position of the priority list. Examples of these typesof substances include: heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide; endrin and endrinaldehyde; PCB's.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Methodology for Selecting Substances on the Second Priority List</ITAG>A. Bases for Improvements in Methodology for Selecting SubstancesSince publication of the first priority list of hazardous substances, ATSDRand EPA have continued to seek improvements in the listing process to incorporateinto future revisions of the list. The agencies have solicited public commentand conducted critical reviews of the above-described prioritizing methodin order to identify potential improvements. The resulting suggestionsfor improving the method center primarily on improving the estimation ofthe potential for human exposure to substances at NPL sites. The supportingdocument for the first priority list of 100 substances identified optimalsite-specific data for an exposure assessment that include identificationof human exposure pathways, characterization of potentially exposed populations,and determination of exposure concentrations and durations. Lacking suchdata, rough estimates of potential human exposure were made which reliedprimarily on surface water and ground water concentrations as measuresof potential human exposure. Consequently, no consideration was given toexposure by air or soil, which may be more relevant for some substancesthan exposure by ground water or surface water. Considering this limitationin the exposure estimate, ATSDR and EPA sought to expand the ranking systemto include a better estimate of potential for human exposure than was usedfor the first priority list of 100 substances.Further suggestions for changes in methodology stem from differences inthe type and quality of information available for substances of lower priority.It is noted, for example, that toxicity information on those substancesthat are more frequently encountered (and therefore, more likely to rankhigher on the hazard index than less frequently-encountered substances)tends to be of a higher quality and more readily available. In addition,using the CLP statistical data base alone, the frequency-of-occurrencetends to vary significantly only for the most frequently detected substances,which makes the frequency of occurrence term relatively nonselective forprioritizing the second list of 100 hazardous substances.Based on the foregoing considerations, ATSDR and EPA have considered suggestionsfor utilizing alternative methods to estimate (1) the frequency of occurrenceof substances and (2) the relative toxicity of substances. The changesadopted are described in the following description of the procedure usedto generate the second priority list of 100 hazardous substances underSARA Section 110.B. Determination of the Frequency-of-Occurrence Criterion of the RankingMethodologyIn the procedure for selection of the first 100 priority substances, thenumber of NPL sites at which a substance is known to occur was estimatedfrom the information on the substance drawn from the CLP statistical database as it existed at the time of development of the first list (e.g.,April, 1987). For selection of the second 100 priority substances, an updatedCLP statistical data base, containing additional data entered through August10, 1988, formed one of the bases for selection of frequency-of-occurrencedata on candidate chemicals. Two additional estimates of frequency-of-occurrencewere employed.The first source of additional information for frequency-of-occurrencewas the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) data base. The HRS was developed toevaluate hazardous waste sites for listing on the NPL, and assigns a scoreto a site based upon a uniform scheme incorporating information on toxicity,persistence, and quantity at the site. During evaluation through the HRSmethod, up to 15 chemicals of concern can be listed at each site. The numberof times that a given substance was listed as a chemical of concern ina HRS evaluation was used to estimate the frequency-of-occurrence at NPLsites, by dividing the number of times listed as a chemical of concernby the total number of NPL sites in the current data base (1,177).The second source of additional information used to estimate frequency-of-occurrencewas the Special Analytical Service (SAS) data base. This data base containsinformation on the occurrence of substances which do not appear in theCLP statistical database for methodological reasons. Most of the informationin the CLP statistical data base is obtained under the Routine AnalyticalServices (RAS) program, in which samples submitted for analysis are screenedfor certain target chemicals; additional substances are then determinedby matching their mass spectra to known standards. A request for determinationof a substance under SAS may occur when there is reason to believe thata specific hazardous compound is present in a sample at a concentrationbelow the detection limit of the RAS, or when there is reason to believethat a specific hazardous substance which is not a target substance maybe present in a sample.The SAS data files were examined to identify substances with five or morerequests for SAS which are not present in the CLP statistical database.Those substances were then examined further to determine the number ofNPL sites at which the substance had actually been detected. This numberwas then divided by the total number of NPL sites to obtain a site percentfrequency.The overall site percent value used for a particular substance was thehigher of the CLP statistical data base site percent (as determined byeither RAS or SAS data) and the NPL Technical data base site percent whenboth were available.C. Determination of the Exposure Component of the Ranking MethodologyATSDR and EPA expanded the bases for evaluating the potential for humanexposure to the priority substances in two ways: (1) By considering theair and soil as additional routes of potential exposure, and (2) by consideringadditional databases reflecting the potential for human exposure to thesubstances.The potential for exposure to candidate substances through soil was consideredby incorporating data on soil concentrations from the CLP statistical database in the calculation of an exposure index for each substance. To estimatethe potential for air exposure, ATSDR and EPA used an indirect method,since no data are readily available on actual air concentrations of thecandidate substances at NPL sites. ATSDR and EPA considered the retentiontime on a gas chromatography column to be a useful indicator of potentialfor air exposure, since these values can be determined from the SAS andRAS databases, and since these values correlate positively with boilingpoint, which in turn correlates negatively with volatility. The potentialfor air exposure was included in the calculation of an overall exposureindex.Exposure potential also was represented in the second 100 ranking procedurethrough the incorporation of eight separate data sources. The data sourcesused were:<ITAG tagnum="15">CLP statistical data base (CLPs)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">NPL Technical data base (NPLt)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">National Human Adipose Tissue Survey (NHATS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of Transportation Hazardous Materials Information System(DOT/HMIS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Acute Hazardous Events data base (AHE)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">National Response Center data base (NRC)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Removal Tracking system data base (RTS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">NEXIS</ITAG>Information from these sources was incorporated in one of three ways: (1)As part of the water, soil and air exposure potential rank (CLP soil andwater concentration data, and gas chromatography retention time); (2) asan alternate to the exposure potential rank in determining the overallexposure rank (NPL chemical of concern rank); and (3) as a weighting functionapplied to the overall exposure rank (NHATS, DOT/HMIS, AHE, NRC, NEXIS,RTS).<ITAG tagnum="81">The CLP Statistical Data Base (CLPs)</ITAG>The Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) statistical data base contains dataon the occurrence and concentration of chemicals found at NPL and otherhazardous waste sites. The data base was derived from CLP Routine AnalyticalService (RAS) analyses and contains concentrations of specific chemicalsfound in soil, ground water, and surface water from a subset of the totalNPL sites.<ITAG tagnum="81">NPL Technical Data Base (NPLt)</ITAG>The Hazard Ranking System (HRS) was developed to evaluate hazardous wastesites for listing on the NPL, and assigns a score to a site. Data fromthe HRS evaluation are stored in the NPL technical data base (NPLt). TheHRS scores chemicals based upon toxicity, persistence, and quantity atthe site. During evaluation through the HRS method, up to 15 chemicalsof concern may be listed at each site. The number of times that a givensubstance was listed as a chemical of concern in the NPLt data case wasused to estimate the frequency-of-occurrence at all NPL sites and as acorrelate of exposure potential.<ITAG tagnum="81">Special Analytical Services Data Base (SAS)</ITAG>Under the Routine Analytical Service (RAS) contracts, samples from CERCLAsites are analyzed for a limited set of `'target chemicals.'' When thereis reason to believe that a specific hazardous compound is present at concentrationsbelow the detection limits of the RAS, or when the substance is not a targetchemical, a request may be processed through the Special Analytical Services(SAS) contract, in which the contractor makes an analytical determinationof the presence and concentration of the specified substance. Frequencyof detection of a substance at NPL sites through the SAS was determinedby direct analysis of SAS data files.<ITAG tagnum="81">National Human Adipose Tissue Survey (NHATS)</ITAG>The National Human Adipose Tissue Survey (NHATS) data base contains chemicalanalysis data of human adipose tissue collected from individuals in hospitalsacross the United States. Information is available for 372 substances,derived from 800 individual adipose tissue samples that were pooled into46 composite samples (approximately 17 individual samples per composite).This data base gives some indication of the degree to which the populationof the United States has been exposed to the substances detected. The ATSDRand EPA considered occurrence of a substance in human tissue, as reportedin the NHATS, to be an indication of potential for significant human exposure,and therefore ATSDR and EPA assigned greater weight to the exposure indexfor such candidate substances.<ITAG tagnum="81">Department of Transportation Hazardous Materials Information System(DOT/HMIS)</ITAG>The Department of Transportation's Hazardous Materials Information System(DOT/HMIS) data base contains information concerning accidental releaseof hazardous substances during transportation. A written report must besubmitted to HMIS within 15 days of the accidental release. The reportscontain an identification of the substance released and an accounting ofany injuries or fatalities resulting from the release. The ATSDR and EPAconsidered occurrence of a substance in the HMIS data base to be an indicationof potential for significant human exposure, and therefore ATSDR and EPAassigned greater weight to the exposure index for such candidate substances.<ITAG tagnum="81">Acute Hazardous Events Data Base (AHE)</ITAG>The Acute Hazardous Events (AHE) data base was developed by the EPA, followingthe tragic release of a toxic substance in Bhopal, India, to provide informationconcerning sudden, accidental releases of toxic chemicals in the UnitedStates. The main purpose of the data base is to characterize the kindsof events releasing acutely toxic substances, the substances involved,and the causative factors leading to their release. The ATSDR and EPA consideredoccurrence of a substance in the AHE data base to be an indication of potentialfor significant human exposure, and therefore ATSDR and EPA assigned greaterweight to the exposure index for such candidate substances.<ITAG tagnum="81">National Response Center Data Base (NRC)</ITAG>The National Response Center (NRC) data base contains information concerninghazardous substance releases exceeding the RQ, pipeline failures and certaintransportation incidents involving hazardous substances, and certain releasesof toxic or flammable gases. ATSDR and EPA considered the occurrence ofa candidate substance in this data base for any release that resulted indeath, injury, or evacuation, to be an indication of potential for significanthuman exposure. Consequently the agencies increased the weight of the exposureindex for any candidate substances listed in the NRC.<ITAG tagnum="81">Removal Tracking System Data Base (RTS)</ITAG>The Removal Tracking System (RTS) data base describes activities undertakento clean up a site under the Superfund removal program. It lists the materialsof concern that triggered a removal action and frequently lists other majorcontaminants being addressed at a site. ATSDR and EPA considered that theoccurrence of a candidate substance in this data base indicates potentialfor significant human exposure. Consequently the agencies increased theweight of the exposure index for any candidate substances listed in theRTS.<ITAG tagnum="81">NEXIS</ITAG>The NEXIS information system contains full-text articles reporting therelease of toxic substances in over 125 newspapers, newsletters, and wireservices. ATSDR and EPA considered the reporting in this data base of releaseof a candidate substance which led to human death, injury, or evacuation,to be a significant indicator of potential for significant human exposure.Consequently, the agencies increased the weight of the exposure index forany such substance.D. Determination of the Toxicity Component of the Ranking MethodologyATSDR and EPA decided to continue to use the reportable quantity (RQ) approachas a hazard scoring system, for the same reasons that guided its choicefor the first priority list of hazardous substances. This approach providesthe most complete characterization of toxicity of all hazard scoring systemsreviewed by the agencies, and all other schemes reviewed were more limitedin some aspect of toxicity evaluation.The reportable quantity ranking scheme was developed by EPA to set RQ'sfor hazardous substances as required by CERCLA. Each RQ category correspondsto a weight, in pounds, for which releases must be reported. Section 103of CERCLA requires immediate notification from any person in charge ofa vessel or an offshore or onshore facility that releases an amount ofa hazardous substance equal to or greater than its RQ. RQ's are developedfor individual chemicals and waste streams that have already been designatedunder CERCLA as hazardous substances.Each CERCLA hazardous substance is assigned to one of five RQ categoriesbased on chronic toxicity, acute toxicity, carcinogenicity, aquatic toxicity,and ignitability and reactivity. RQ's are determined for each criterionseparately, and the lowest of these is selected to represent the RQ adoptedfor the substance. Only values for acute and chronic mammalian toxicityor carcinogenicity were considered for ranking the second 100 hazardoussubstances.Some of the candidate hazardous substances have not yet been assigned RQvalues. In these cases, the ATSDR and EPA adopted a technique used by EPA'sOffice of Toxic Substances (OTS) to evaluate the potential health hazardsassociated with new chemicals submitted to the Premanufacture Notice Program.Generally, there are few experimental data available for these chemicals.In these cases, OTS employs a panel of expert toxicologists to assign alevel of concern for the potential for toxicity, based upon the limitedavailable experimental data, and other information, including physical-chemicalproperties, known toxicities of analogous substances, and known toxicitiesof possible metabolites of the substance, or of substances analogous topossible metabolites. Based on this expert opinion, a consensus level ofconcern for potential toxicity was adjusted to a five-point scale to coincidewith the five-point RQ scale. This value was then used to represent theRQ value in the ranking algorithm.As was done for the first priority list of hazardous substances, ATSDRand EPA used secondary criteria to adjust the RQ's (or RQ-equivalents assignedby the panel of experts) where appropriate. One set of secondary criteriaincludes biodegradation, hydrolysis, and photolysis. The use of these criteriais based on the fact that substances which have a tendency to be transformedto innocuous products pose a less serious health concern than equally toxicsubstances that have less tendency to be so transformed. ATSDR and EPAalso used other secondary criteria such as bioaccumulation, high reactivity,and hazardous reaction products to determine if an adjustment of RQ valueswas appropriate for a given substance.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Second Priority List of 100 Hazardous Substances</ITAG>A. Generation of the Priority ListATSDR and EPA generated an algorithm to calculate the hazard index valuefor each candidate substance, for the purpose of placing the substanceon the second priority list of hazardous substances. The starting pointfor the hazard index calculation was the subset of hazardous substanceswhich EPA had identified at NPL sites by means of site percent data fromthe CLP survey, or from the NPL or the SAS data bases, for those substancesnot in the CLP. The agencies divided the site percent data value for eachsubstance (representing frequency-of-occurrence) by the lowest RQ valuefor the substance (based on acute toxicity, chronic toxicity, or potentialcarcinogenicity) to generate a site index for each substance. ATSDR andEPA ranked the candidate substances based on their indices, then calculatedan exposure potential index for each substance. This index was based uponwater concentration, soil concentration, and gas column retention timeof each substance. The final step in the algorithm was to combine the siteindex rank and the exposure index value to obtain a hazard index for eachsubstance. The substances were prioritized based on their hazard indices.The algorithm for calculating the hazard index is described in greaterdetail in the support document for this notice, which is contained in thepublic file notice.B. List of SubstancesATSDR and EPA have continued the practice initiated with the first listof prioritized substances, of grouping the substances in the second listof 100 into 4 priority groups of 25 substances each. Within each group,the agencies have listed the substances in order of their Chemical AbstractsServices (CAS) Registry numbers, to reflect the somewhat inexact natureof the ranking algorithm and the uncertainties of the underlying databases.The following 100 hazardous substances comprise the second set of 100 prioritysubstances that will be the subject of toxicological profiles preparedby ATSDR. This set, and the first set of 100 priority substances previouslypublished by ATSDR and EPA, constitute the revised list of at least 200hazardous substances required under SARA, section 110.<ITAG
