It is shown that the relaxation curves consistof two parts: a fast one with a duration of 0.5 ms and a slow one witha duration of 10 ms. From an analysis of these results it is concludedthat at high intensities the difference between the behaviour of idealand non-ideal heterostructures is negligible. Therefore it must be possibleto use the CdS-Cu/sub 2/S successfully under concentrated sunlight.</TEXT></DOC>
