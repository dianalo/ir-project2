Azinger's10-under-par 134 placed him two strokes ahead of Rocco Mediate (69-67--136)and Jay Delsing (68-68--136) and three ahead of Larry Mize (71-66--137) andDavis Love III (67-70--137).;    Breezy conditions on the more exposed holesat the three courses -- Pebble Beach, Spyglass Hill and Poppy Hills -- tooktheir toll on the field.;    This was especially so with first-day leader MikeStandly, who ballooned from his 65 at Pebble to a 78 at Poppy Hills. And hisfellow Hogan Tour graduates, Jeff Maggert (67-75--142) and John Daly(68-76--144), suffered similarly -- both at Poppy Hills. They now have fallendanger of missing the cut, which will be made tonight to the low 60 pros andties and low 25 pro-am teams and ties.;    But Azinger is in no such trouble,overcoming a recent habit of hooking his woods and irons. He also began tosink those tricky putts.;    &quot;I'm finally learning how to read these greens,&quot;said Azinger, who has finished in the top four on the money list in three ofthe past four years. &quot;I've played here six to eight times and I only broke 70twice as I recall. Last year I played with Jack Nicklaus, Lanny Wadkins andHale Irwin on the final day and hit it great tee to green but couldn't makeany putts. I didn't know what to do. . . . I'm not guessing as much anymore.&quot;;   Azinger said a 20-foot putt on Spyglass' first green in the first roundThursday illustrated how his knowledge is paying off.;    &quot;Chip Beck's amateurpartner (Ray Knowles) asked me it he had to move his coin so I could putt,&quot;Azinger said. &quot;I told him that if it were three years ago, I would be aimingsix inches right of his coin. But I know the greens better, so I'm going to gosix inches left of the coin. And I made the putt.&quot;;    Azinger missed onefairway and three greens in his five-birdie, no-bogey round at Pebble Beach.The birdies came on Nos. 2, 5, 7, 9 and 10. He made putts of 14 feet or moreto record birdies at Nos. 7, 9 and 10.;    While drought-plagued Monterey-arearesidents are searching the skies for rain clouds, Azinger said the dryterrain is a boon to the players. That might end today -- a 30 percent chanceof rain is forecast by the weather bureau.;    &quot;Spyglass in particular hasbeen wet the last few years,&quot; said Azinger, who plays at Poppy Hills today.&quot;On the (par-4) sixth hole, for example, I would hit driver, 4 iron, with abig lump of mud on the side of your ball. This year I hit driver, 6 iron, witha clean ball, and made birdie. That hole has always been hard for me to makepar on.;    &quot;The greens are firmer, too, which helps the putting. In the pastheel prints were a problem, even with 4-foot putts.&quot;;    Azinger, whose lastvictory was at the Tournament of Champions in Carlsbad on Jan. 7, 1990, saidhe was in a &quot;desperate state&quot; in last week's Phoenix Open when a recentproblem with a duck-hooking -- a sharp-breaking hook -- erupted again.;   Teaching pro Jim Flick helped Azinger get his swing back in the groove.;   Mediate, in his fifth year on the PGA Tour, scored a hole-in-one on No. 15 atPoppy Hills during his 5-under 67 round. It was the ninth ace of his career.His 5-iron carried 193 yards.;    &quot;I was at the green with our baby (RoccoVincent, 4 1/2 months) when the ball went in,&quot; said Linda Mediate, Rocco'swife. &quot;I screamed and everybody yelled and the baby got scared and startedscreaming, too.&quot;;    Delsing, 30, who like Mediate has yet to win a PGAtournament, posted six birdies in his assault of Poppy Hills.;    &quot;I wasreally glad to get through Poppy with a round of 4 under,&quot; the 1983 UCLAgraduate said.;    Arnold Palmer and Nicklaus struggled, Palmer taking a 78and Nicklaus a 77 at Spyglass. Defending champion Mark O'Meara, also atSpyglass, logged his second straight 73.;    Mize's 66 at Poppy tied thecourse record set Thursday by John Cook.;    Cook came in with a 72 Friday atSpyglass. His 138 is four shots out of the lead.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAN HRUBY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910202  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  847  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday February 2, 199100033014,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
