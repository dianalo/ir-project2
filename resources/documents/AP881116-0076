But the Greenpeace conservationist group charged that the plan,which calls for a 50 percent cut in the emission of pollutants intothe Baltic and North seas by 1995, does not go far enough.   Environment ministers and Parliament members from Norway, Sweden,Finland, Iceland and Denmark adopted the anti-pollution plan at anextraordinary session of the Nordic Council, an advisory body to thefive governments.   The program also calls for reducing air pollution and oilpollution from offshore platforms and improving environmentalprotection.   The special session of the Nordic Council was called followingalarming signs of deterioration in the marine environment innorthern waters last summer.   Fishermen, some of whom serenaded the 87 participants at themeeting with horns, claim the worsening pollution is killing marinelife and putting them out of business.   In the summer, giant blooms of yellow algae killed hundreds oftons of fish along the coasts of Norway and Sweden. In addition,thousands of seals died from a viral epidemic whose origin was amystery. Vast tracts of the seabed in the Kattegat Strait, shared byNorway, Sweden and Denmark, were found to be devoid of sea life dueto lack of oxygen.   The pollution is caused mainly by metals from industrial wastes,phosphorus from inadequate sewage treatment and nitrogen fromfertilizers and chemicals used in agriculture.   ``There is reason to believe that in the Kattegat permanentdamage has been done,'' said Danish Fisheries Minister LarsGammelgaard.   Gammelgaard said fish stocks in the strait had been reduced byhalf between 1980 and 1987, and that many species had become extinct.   ``You can see from one day to the next that there are greater andgreater pressures on marine fauna. And we have reached a limit wherenature cannot deal with this pressure on its own,'' said Swedishmember of Parliament Karin Soeder.   The Nordic Council program was the first major action by all fiveNordic countries to rescue the marine environment.   The environement ministers were instructed to draw up proposalsfor reducing the emissions and to present them in February. Themeasures will be reviewed at the next session of the Nordic Councilin 1990.   But Greenpeace was not satisfied with the new plan, saying in astatement:   ``Fishermen and environmentalist have every reason to be angryand disappointed about the result (of the meeting) and not least,the suffocating political wrangle behind the scenes.''   Critics of the plan presented the 87 participants at the NordicCouncil session with five barrels of smelly ooze from the bottom ofthe Oeresund Strait.</TEXT></DOC>
