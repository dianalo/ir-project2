The SS-1 Scud rockets were displayed in the Afghan capital afterUndersecretary of State Michael H. Armacost complained to SovietAmbassador Yuri V. Dubinin on Monday about sending long-range TU26Backfire bombers into combat there for the first time.   The Soviets are backing the Afghan government against U.S.-armedrebels in a war that has raged for nearly nine years. On Aug. 15,the Soviets completed the pullout of more than half the 100,000troops that had fought alongside the pro-Moscow government.   The remaining troops must depart by Feb. 15 under an agreementsigned in Geneva last spring. The Soviets hinted recently that thesecond stage would begin Nov. 15. But a U.S. official, who spokeTuesday on condition of anonymity, said that might be delayed.   He also said the United States would see to it that the rebelshad an ``adequate'' arsenal, although missiles to match the Scudsprobably would not be provided through Pakistan.   Two Scud-B missiles, which have the range of about 175 miles,were displayed in Kabul, the official said. It was not clear whetherthe Soviets delivered more of them, which are mobile and can reachthe Pakistani frontier as well as vast areas of Afghanistan.   ``It's clearly intended to intimidate Pakistan,'' the officialsaid.   U.S. weapons to the guerrillas are delivered through Pakistan,which also has given sanctuary to millions of Afghan refugees.   The Afghan news agency, in a dispatch Tuesday, accused Pakistanof instigating attacks by ``extremist'' guerrillas on populationcenters and demilitarized areas. ``This is why a new kind of weapon,mainly long-range missiles with a great destructive power, wasadopted for service by the Afghan army,'' the Afghan general staffsaid.   ``The missiles will be used to stop the criminal activities ofthe extremist group,'' the dispatch added, without referringspecifically to the Scud-B.   Gennady Gerasimov, the spokesman for the Soviet foreign ministry,said at a news conference last month in New York that Pakistan'ssupport for the rebels could have ``unpredictable'' consequences.   ``We don't want to be specific,'' he said. But he left open thepossibility that the withdrawal of Soviet troops might be suspended.   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman cautioned Moscow onTuesday that the United States was determined to protect Pakistan.   ``If the purpose of these latest military developments is tothreaten Pakistan, the Soviet Union knows that Pakistan enjoys ourfull support in this situation,'' he said.   The version of the Scud the Soviets are believed to have providedto the Afghan forces is a mobile rocket, 37 feet long, 34 inches indiameter, and weighing 14,000 pounds. The Scud has a simple guidancesystem, uses liquid fuel, and can be equipped with either a nuclearor high-explosive conventional warhead.   ``This action,'' Redman said, ``calls into question the Soviets'stated desire to achieve a genuine political settlement inAfghanistan and their undertakings to us not to engage in offensiveactions. This display is only the latest attempt by the Soviets toprop up a desperate regime which lacks legitimacy among the Afghanpeople and clearly demonstrates that the regime is incapable ofdefending itself.''   In San Bernardino, Calif., White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater, accompanying President Reagan on a political speakingtour, issued this formal statement:   ``We are concerned about the display of SS-1 missiles in Kabuland the deployment of Soviet MiGs and Backfire bombers. Theseactions call into question the Soviets' stated desire to achieve agenuine settlement in Afghanistan.   ``This display of military hardware will only increase tensionsin the region. Our support for Pakistan and the Mujahedeen remainsunshakeable.''   Redman welcomed, meanwhile, the visit to the United States ofBurhanuddin Rabbani, leader of the Islamic Society guerrilla group.He called Monday in Islamabad for elections to create a newgovernment after Soviet troops withdraw.   ``Our position is that we can support any proposal for apolitical solution which reflects the will of the Afghan people andmeets their aspirations for self-determination,'' Redman said.   Redman said Rabbani will be in Washington next week.</TEXT></DOC>
