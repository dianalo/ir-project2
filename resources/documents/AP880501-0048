(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   They've had to call out a team fromthe U.S. Geological Survey to resolve the question of which riveris the world's shortest.   A fifth-grade class at Lincoln elementary school in Great Falls,Mont., recently had Montana's Roe River measured and declared theworld's shortest, replacing Lincoln City's D River in the GuinnessBook of World Records.   The Roe River flows between 275 and 307 feet from a spring intothe Missouri River. The D River flows from Devil's Lake into thePacific Ocean.   However, the record book's entry listing the D River as 440 feetlong was based on an outdated survey a century old; a variety ofstate agencies in Oregon say the river could be as short as 100feet long.   The answer about which river wins the trophy for shortness isexpected soon.</TEXT><DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mickey Mouse acted as host at a surprisereunion in Disneyland of a former Soviet officer and a U.S. Armyofficer who first met at the Elbe River during World War II.   The Soviet visitor, Vladimir Kabaidze, 64, mentioned to hisAmerican hosts that he had exchanged addresses in 1945 at Torgau,Germany, with an American when they were both first lieutenants.   Kabaidze, in the United States after being honored by Sovietleader Mikhail Gorbachev as a model of Soviet labor, said he hadwritten his address on a Russian ruble and had gotten in return theaddress of GI Frank Parent written on a German mark.   The reunion Saturday of the two men was arranged by Kabaidze'shost, Barney Oldfield, according to Disneyland spokeswoman BarbaraWarren.   Oldfield, a retired U.S. Army colonel now working for LittonIndustries, located Parent, 78, in Texas and flew him to Californiafor the Disneyland surprise.   ``Mickey Mouse acted as intermediary,'' Ms. Warren said. ``Aftergreeting Mr. Kabaidze, he waltzed the Russian gentleman over towhere Mr. Parent was standing.   ``He was pleasantly shocked when Mr. Parent handed him the rublenote,'' she said.   The date written on the ruble was April 30, 1945, Ms. Warrensaid, exactly 43 years to the day of the reunion.</TEXT><DATELINE>SOUTH HAVEN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Third Annual Polar Bear Classic,sponsored by the Great Lakes Surfing Association, ran into somepoor weather. It was too nice.   The 35 participants in Saturday's event enjoyed clear blue skiesand unseasonably warm temperatures in the upper 60s. For GreatLakes surfers, who rely on insulated suits, gloves and hoods, balmyweather makes for poor surfing.   Waves reached a respectable 4 to 6 feet Friday night, butSaturday's nice weather generated so-called ankle snappers of just1 to 2 feet.   Jeff VanHoeven of Kalamazoo, 27, won the men's competition usinga push-off method. With one foot on his board and one on the lakebottom, he timed a wave and kick-started.   Dave Irwin of Bloomfield Hills used a similar technique to winthe long board competition.   ``Michigan is surrounded by fresh water seas,'' said Irwin, theassociation founder and a former Californian. ``You've just got tosearch a little to find waves good enough to surf.''   Other surfers, their competitive spark doused by the lacklusterwaves, simply laid on their boards and engaged in friendly paddleraces.   Higher waves come during storms, and the association's telephonenetwork goes into action when Great Lakes marine forecasts call forrough weather.</TEXT></DOC>
