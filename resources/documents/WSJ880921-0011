Chipello (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> PRD FUJIY </CO><IN> TNM FLX </IN><DATELINE> CAMBRIDGE, Mass.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Polaroid Corp. rejected as financially inadequate a $2.4 billion hostile tender offer by Shamrock Holdings Inc., and threw another potential barrier in Shamrock's path.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Polaroid said it has been holding &quot;preliminary negotiations&quot; with unidentified third parties concerning the issuance of new preferred stock or other equity securities &quot;representing a minority, noncontrolling interest&quot; in Polaroid.    Polaroid's &quot;strong recommendation&quot; that its stockholders turn down Shamrock's $42-a-share tender offer had been expected; the SEC filing provided the first indication that Polaroid may be prepared to seek help from a friendly suitor.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Polaroid's shares dropped $1.125 to $40.125 as traders reacted to the news.    &quot;The ability of Shamrock or someone else to pursue this company {would be} substantially impaired,&quot; should a new minority investor emerge, said Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities. What's more, issuance of new stock could be &quot;substantially dilutive&quot; of the company's stock price, he said.    Although Polaroid has no preferred shares outstanding, its board has authorization to issue as many as 20 million preferred shares, a spokesman said. In addition, the company's 71 million common shares outstanding represent less than half the 150 million shares that have been authorized, he said.    As previously reported, Shamrock's legal challenge to Polaroid's employee stock ownership plan is scheduled to be heard in Delaware Chancery Court Oct. 19, and was already considered crucial to Shamrock's bid. The ESOP holds 14% of Polaroid's stock, and Shamrock has made its offer conditional upon, among other things, receipt of 90% of Polaroid's shares.    With the specter of a major new investor added to the ESOP barrier, &quot;it's getting to be a pretty sticky wicket,&quot; said Prudential-Bache's Mr. Henderson.    Stanley P. Gold, president of Shamrock, the Burbank, Calif., investment vehicle of the Roy E. Disney family, said in a letter to Polaroid's directors yesterday that Shamrock will make every effort to block the proposed placement of preferred stock, &quot;and will hold Polaroid directors and management and the purchaser of any such securities responsible for partipating in what we perceive is an unlawful scheme. Furthermore, any such placement will not achieve its purpose since it will not divert us from our efforts to acquire Polaroid.    &quot;On the other hand, if for some reason unknown to us the placement of such securities will serve a legitimate business purpose of Polaroid, we are prepared to offer to purchase such securities,&quot; Mr. Gold said.    The executive ended his letter by saying: &quot;We were also disturbed to read in the {SEC filing} that Polaroid management has sought to protect itself further with enriched golden parachutes. While there may be circumstances where such payments are justified, it can hardly be so in a situation such as Polaroid's where many employees have been discharged and others have unwillingly been subjected to substantial wage cuts and benefit reductions.&quot;    In its SEC filing, Polaroid noted that at a meeting held Monday, its board authorized supplemental severance-pay agreements with 19 officers. Under the agreements, the officers would receive one year's base pay if dismissed, under certain conditions, for any reason other than &quot;serious or willful misconduct.&quot;    Sources in the Shamrock camp said the Delaware trial will be critical. They also indicated Shamrock plans to mount a public-relations campaign, including advertisements and direct telephone appeals to Polaroid's directors, to step up pressure on the Massachusetts company.    Polaroid, in its filing with the SEC, said it had begun talks with &quot;certain third parties&quot; before the public announcement of the Shamrock offer. The talks &quot;are expected to continue and discussions with other parties may commence,&quot; said Polaroid. The company added that &quot;there can be no assurance that any transaction will be negotiated,&quot; but noted that any transaction of the type contemplated &quot;may have an impact on the Shamrock offer and would be inconsistent with its conditions.&quot;    Polaroid declined to name any of the third parties or to discuss possible terms of any transactions. As previously reported, Wall Street sources have said that Forstmann Little andamp; Co., a New York leveraged buy-out concern, previously approached Polaroid about a friendly takeover, but was rebuffed.    Leveraged buy-out firms generally prefer to buy controlling stakes in companies, but discussions about a possible minority stake wouldn't be unprecedented. Another major buy-out firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., last year proposed buying preferred stock or subordinated debentures that could have been converted to a large minority stake in Gillette Co., according to testimony in a civil case brought by dissident Gillette shareholders.    Mr. Henderson of Prudential-Bache said he believes that a Japanese company with potential business ties to Polaroid, such as Fuji Photo Film Co., would also provide a potential investor. Japanese companies often take stakes in companies with which they do business, and Mr. Henderson says Fuji could supply Polaroid with the conventional film that Polaroid has said it plans to sell. A spokesman for Fuji's U.S. operations declined to comment.    Polaroid's plans to enter the conventional-film market are but one element of a restructuring plan which it says will add substantially to shareholder value beginning next year. I. MacAllister Booth, president and chief executive officer, said in a prepared statement yesterday that a planned 15% reduction in Polaroid's domestic work force and other streamlining measures are expected to yield annual savings of about $100 million.    Polaroid expects &quot;a very significant improvement in earnings in 1989, although nonrecurring severance costs and related expenses to be charged off in 1988&quot; will likely result in a loss for the year, Mr. Booth said. </TEXT></DOC>
