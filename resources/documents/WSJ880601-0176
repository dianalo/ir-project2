Wyoming has suffered in its efforts to attract industry during the past several years due in part to the erroneous perception that the state has an undesirable business climate. National studies, such as those cited in your article, have failed to adequately analyze the components of a state's taxing system. Often, states are ranked on the basis of total per-capita tax collections -- those with the highest per-capita collections are labeled the &quot;worst&quot; and those with the lowest collections are labeled the &quot;best.&quot;    Wyoming's per-capita tax collections rank it among the highest of the 50 states. Contrary to recent national studies, however, this does not mean that the tax burden on Wyoming's citizens and industry is high. In fact, our study, &quot;Wyoming 1988,&quot; clearly proves that Wyoming's relative tax burden is the second lowest in the U.S., followed only by Alaska. This enviable position among the states has been made possible largely because of Wyoming's abundance of natural resources.    About 70% of all tax revenues in Wyoming are derived from mineral-related activities. Most of this tax, in fact, is exported from the state as its oil, gas, coal and other minerals are shipped out of state for consumption in other parts of the country. The remaining 30% of total tax revenues comes from a variety of tax sources, all of which are among the lowest in the 50 states.    Our analysis of both personal property and agricultural property taxes placed Wyoming among the lowest taxing states in the country. Additionally, a study of mineral taxation placed Wyoming in about the middle of the states with mineral production.    Obviously, nearly all of the states are competing to attract industry to their borders. Wyoming, as does others, offers many incentives to businesses through various low-interest financing programs, low taxes, and quality public services. These incentives, unfortunately, are often mitigated by this &quot;myth&quot; of high taxes.    David G.
