In the 1989 first quarter, net was $317 million, or 95cents a share, on sales of $2.45 billion.</LP><TEXT>   The health-care products concern, which cited adversefactors in certain Latin American nations for the charge,didn't offer comment in a prepared statement on how overallfirst-quarter results will compare with year-ago figures. Acompany spokesman said he wouldn't speculate about such acomparison.   The spokesman said Canada and all of Latin Americaaccounted for $1.2 billion of 1989 sales. The company doesn'tprovide a more detailed breakdown. In recent years, theimpact of foreign currency translations has been positive andnegative. Excluding the effects of foreign currencytranslations, 1989 sales would have increased 11% rather thanthe actual 8.4%, the spokesman said. In 1988, favorableforeign currency translations boosted sales gains by anadditional 1.7%.   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,Johnson andamp; Johnson closed at $58.25, up 12.5 cents.   The company said the charges reflect &quot;severe economicturmoil, inflation, exorbitantly high and volatile interestrates and deteriorating business conditions&quot; in certain LatinAmerican countries. The bulk of the charges includeprovisions for writing off and restructuring units inArgentina and for paying additional interest on the company'sdebt in that country. That debt has been liquidated, thecompany said.   The charge also recognizes &quot;the impact of the recentunprecedented monetary restrictions&quot; imposed by Brazil,Johnson andamp; Johnson said.</TEXT></DOC>
