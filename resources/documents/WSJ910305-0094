The plans -- by the Health Insurance Association ofAmerica and the Blue Cross andamp; Blue Shield Association -- areaimed at alleviating a growing crisis among small companiesstruggling to provide coverage for their employees. At thesame time, they reflect broad concern over the plight of thenation's 33 million medically uninsured, two-thirds of whomare in families with at least one wage-earner.</LP><TEXT>   The plans were developed separately over the past twoyears and differ in some respects. But their similarities arenotable, and if they are adopted by insurers, regulators andlegislators around the U.S., they could have a significanteffect not only on small companies and their employees, buton the U.S. health care system.   &quot;The {proposals} have the chance to dramatically increaseaccess to insurance&quot; for employees of small businesses, saysDouglas Peters, a senior vice president at Blue Cross andamp; BlueShield Association, Chicago. But he cautioned that the BlueCross plan, at least, doesn't directly address the soaringcost of health care. &quot;We're trying to stimulate and broadenaccess for small group market coverage,&quot; he says. &quot;No oneshould be misled to believe that they address the underlyingcost of health care.&quot;   The basic terms of both proposals include:   -- Guaranteed coverage to all employees in a business,regardless of health or occupation. This includes employeeswho need expensive cancer treatments, who have acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome, or who have such chronic ailmentsas diabetes or heart disease. Canceling insurance for healthreasons would be prohibited. The HIAA plan would guaranteecoverage even after job changes. This would &quot;assure that nosmall employer, and no employee of a small employer, will beturned down for health insurance because of poor health,&quot;says Carl Schramm, president of the HIAA.   -- A basic, stripped-down health plan that covers doctorvisits, surgery and other basic medical needs, but wouldn'tlikely pay for mental health and substance abuse treatment,or some more exotic services such as high-tech infertilitytreatment. This would require states to exempt small businesspolicies from laws mandating certain levels of insurancecoverage.   -- A requirement that all insurers -- from commercialcompanies, to Blue Cross plans to pre-paid health maintenanceorganizations, who provide insurance to small business playby the same rules, and share in the risk of providingcoverage to those who need expensive care.   The proposal by HIAA, which represents commercialinsurers, is aimed at companies employing three to 25persons, and premiums for the policies would be limited to nomore than 150% of the cost of comparable coverage for largergroups. Blue Cross, the association for more than 70not-for-profit insurance plans around the U.S., considerssmall groups as those with under 50 people.   &quot;Overall, the fact that the insurance industry is taking agood hard look at itself is positive,&quot; says Carolynn Miller,legislative counsel for the National Federation ofIndependent Business. &quot;We applaud them for that. But some ofthe changes, we don't know if they are positive or not.&quot;   While neither plan requires any public funds to pay forhealth insurance, both call for substantial legislative andregulatory changes in all 50 states that could cost money --and could erect hurdles. The HIAA plan, for instance, callsfor the establishment of not-for-profit organizations toadminister reinsurance funds to cover the cost of high-riskcases. The cost of regulation itself could concernbudget-strapped legislatures in some states.   Bare-bones health plans are certain to provoke debatesover equity in the health care system as well as lobbying onbehalf of medical societies over what constitutes basic care.And Mr. Peters notes that some lawmakers and policy makerswill worry about what the impact of broader access to carewill have on costs.   About 36 million people work for companies with 25 orfewer employees, and just 10.5 million get coverage directlyfrom their employers, according to the Employee BenefitResearch Institute, Washington. Another 8.8 million arecovered by plans from a spouse, while 9.1 million have nocoverage at all.   The insurance industry says that the small business marketis expensive in part because employee turnover is high, andbecause small businesses are much more likely to go out ofbusiness than bigger companies. Moreover, companies, often atthe instigation of insurers, constantly shop for coveragebased on price, and thus frequently change carrriers. Andjust one high-risk employee in a company can result inenormous increases in premiums, sometimes forcing employersto either exclude or essentially fire such workers or abandoncoverage altogether.   Meanwhile, both big business and the insurance industryitself have a major stake in proposals to expand coverage tothe uninsured. When they get sick, those without insuranceseek care anyway, and one result is that doctors andhospitals routinely raise the cost of care to those insuredby large employers to subsidize care for the uninsured.   And the inability of the current system to providecoverage for so many people is fueling calls for nationalhealth insurance, even from some businesses -- big and small-- which normally would oppose such efforts. A recent surveyby Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. found, for instance, thatas many as 60% of chief executives of small companies wouldfavor national health insurance if the ills of the currentsystem aren't resolved within a few years.   One target of proponents of national health insurance isthe insurance industry itself, which has come under fire forpractices that deny coverage to some of the nation's sickestpeople. &quot;We believe that a public-private partnership canwork best in our society,&quot; Mr. Peters says. &quot;We've got todemonstrate it can work.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
