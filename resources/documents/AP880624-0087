He was among more than 500 political prisoners PresidentCorazon Aquino released following Marcos's ouster and her rise topower in February 1986.   About 400 human rights advocates attended the so-called``people's tribunal.'' Survivors of assassination attempts andvictims of mass arrests, torture and labor harassment related theirexperiences.   A five-member panel that included Rep. Anna Dominique Coseteng,chairperson of the House committee on human rights, issued astatement at the end saying ``the government and the police ... areguilty of systematic human rights violations in Manila.''   Later, they joined about 1,500 leftist protesters in a downtownsquare and marched towards the presidential palace, where hundredsof anti-riot police armed with sticks stood guard.   A statement from the Alex Boncayao Brigade, a communistliquidation squad operating in the capital, was distributed duringthe march. It called on the people to ``join the armed struggle''and give the rebels information on activities of government forces.   Speakers denounced the government and urged people to defendhuman rights in a brief rally near Mendiola, the main road leadingto the presidential palace. Four layers of barbed wire barricadessealed off the road.   The protesters chanted ``Down With Fascism'' and dispersedpeacefully after the demonstration.</TEXT></DOC>
