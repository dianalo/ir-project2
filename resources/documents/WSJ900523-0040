Government policy is to try tomaintain the fund at about 1.25% of insured deposits. Underthe savings-and-loan bailout law, the premiums paid by bankswill rise this year with the goal of increasing the fund.   Mr. Seidman reiterated that the bank fund could increasethis year because bank failures have slowed. However, hewarned that the failure of a big bank could cause a loss.</TEXT></DOC>
