The New York-based company, which runs nine stores in New York,New Jersey and Connecticut, blamed ``serious cash flow''difficulties for its decision to file for protection from creditorsunder Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.   The cash crunch was created by a ``number of serious problemsover the past few months,'' the company said, but did notelaborate. Company executives refused to discuss the situation.   The financial trouble developed despite a $4 million infusionAntonovich received in July when investors bought a controllinginterest in the company.   Peter Masanotti, a Fairfield, Conn., attorney with the law firmrepresenting Antonovich, said the bankruptcy court filing wasnecessary now because the company faces a series of hefty paymentsto lenders in the next few months.   Masanotti said weakness in the market also has contributed toAntonovich's troubles.   Fur sales have been in a slump that started with the October1987 stock market crash, industry analysts say. More recently,prices have been weighed down by an oversupply.   Antonovich and the two other major publicly traded fur companiesall experienced losses in their past two fiscal years.   As of Dec. 1, Antonovich had about $20.4 million in liabilitiesand $18.8 million in assets, according to document filed in U.S.Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.   Phil Bell, Antonovich's president, said in a news release thatthe company intends to reorganize and will continue operatingduring bankruptcy court proceedings. Besides selling furs,Antonovich provides related services such as storage, cleaning,repair, restyling and insurance.   ``Our current sales and sales projections are encouraging, andat this juncture we are optimistic,'' Bell said.</TEXT></DOC>
