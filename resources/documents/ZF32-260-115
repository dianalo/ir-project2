Fundamentally, IBM sees the world of schools as atraditional hierarchy with the state school department at the top and thecounty, district, and individual schools layered below.andP;  What IBM wants to beable to offer is an integrated system that allows the top manager at any onepoint in the hierarchy to find out instantly what is happening anywhere inthe system whether administratively or academically.andP;  So IBM is in thebusiness of selling hardware to anyone that wants to buy it, but EducationalSystems is mostly in the business of installing what are affectionately knownas Integrated Learning Systems (or ILS).andM;IBM has a line of products that, in order to be used effectively, must beused by an entire class or school so that the system is not only integratedin the technical sense of being wired together but is also integrated in thesense that it sets up the curriculum for the student in advance.andP;  IBM's mostfamous such product is called Writing to Read, which is actually not anetwork-based system, but is instead a system for teaching children how toread without forcing them to learn to spell or use correct grammar at first.andO;This system uses computers to teach the kids how certain sounds areassociated with certain letters and also to let them practice writing theirown stories using those characters.andP;  IBM now claims that this system is beingused to teach 20% of American children in kindergarten and first grade.andO;Writing to Read is actually a small part of the curriculum software, most ofwhich IBM offers under the general moniker of TLC (for Teaching and Learningwith Computers).' This software, which deals with the primary subjects ofreading, writing, mathematics, and science, works on top of a network systemthat's built around Novell's Netware Plus running on Ethernet.andP;  IBM hasdeveloped a shell for Netware which it calls I-Class that gives untrainedteachers and administrators basic network management tools for installingsoftware on the server, managing files and workstations, and so forth.andM;With TLC and with IBM's educational sales force (made up of about 75full-time sales representatives and about 500 Education InstructionalSpecialists, or part-time consultants who are paid by IBM to help adviseprospects, make presentations to school boards, and install and maintainsystems), IBM can now approach a school system or district and offer toautomate entire classes.andP;  And it can draw a picture of how, over time, itwill be able to tie together all the systems it installs today into anintegrated system that reaches from top to bottom and allows administratorsto monitor their schools academic performance and measure it against theiroperating costs or other factors.andP;  Indeed, it can even go to an entire state(as it did in the case of one Southern state, with the help of a fellow in Los Angeles named Dick Reardon) and promise similar kinds of benefits.andP;  Withthe kudos it has gotten for the Writing to Read system from some circles aswell as some of the flashy multimedia software it is working on with NationalGeographic and Robert Abel and others, it can really make a persuasiveargument that it is on the leading edge in instructional technology at thesame time that it is appealing to the most conservative instincts of schoolboard members and administrators.andM;Condition #3: With the introduction of the Macintosh Classic and II1c, we nowhave the makings of a classical religious war.andP;  Apple previously had not beenable to counter IBM's moves effectively because the least expensive computerit could switch schools to cost $1000 with school discounts and was fouryears old.andP;  Now the company has a rock bottom school machine for about $550and a hot box with color and Apple 11 emulation for about $1,300, or aboutthe same price as IBM's recently announced Model 25-286.andM;Indeed, the comparison becomes most clear when you look at the NationalEducation Association's Edstar program, which is a program meant to recommendto the two-million teacher members of NEA specific configurations of theperfect' home computer for teachers.andP;  IBM's such system is a PS/1 bundledwith MS-DOS, Microsoft Works, IBM Linkway, Express Publisher (from Power UpCorp.), Prodigy, Promenade, and Excelsior Grade 2 (which is a teachermanagement program).andP;  Apple's such system is presumably a Macintosh II1cbundled with Claris programs like Macwrite, Filemaker, and Macdraw as well asHypercard, some special stackware for teachers, and the usual systemsoftware.andM;If one is left with the idea that these systems are roughly equivalent(whatever you might think of the differences between Linkway and Hypercard orthe other equivalent programs), then all you are left with is religion.andP;  Andthe difference is striking.andP;  IBM believes wholeheartedly in a systematicapproach that predefines solutions for large groups of people in a particularsystem, including administrators, teachers, and students.andP;  Apple believes ina grass-roots approach that puts the fundamental decision making in the handsof teachers and principals.andP;  IBM's sales staff is composed of experienced IBMcorporate salespeople.andP;  Apple's sales staff is composed mostly of formerteachers.andP;  IBM's most famous software (Writing to Read) is a system.andP;  Apple'smost famous software (Hypercard) is a tool.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
