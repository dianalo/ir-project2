TaylorStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CANDAENVIRONMENT (ENV)EXECUTIVE (EXE)ENERGY DEPARTMENT (ERG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Reagan administration plans to request an advance appropriation of $500 million for fiscal 1989 to help fund clean coal-burning demonstration projects aimed at reducing acid rain.    Energy Secretary John Herrington told a news conference that the administration plans to select projects in about a year to receive aid from the $500 million fund, together with $350 million the administration had requested over five years. Under the new plan, the full $850 million would be available to be spent in fiscal 1988, which begins this Oct. 1, and in fiscal 1989.    Mr. Herrington portrayed the budget requests as the next steps toward fulfilling President Reagan's recommitment to Canada last week to spend $2.5 billion over five years on projects to demonstrate cleaner ways to burn coal.    Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney defended Mr. Reagan's acid rain initiative, which some politicians and environmentalists have criticized as inadequate. Speaking to the North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference in Quebec City, Mr. Mulroney said that &quot;given the budgetary constraints under which both our governments are living,&quot; the president's request to Congress for funds to combat acid rain &quot;is a significant commitment.&quot;    President Reagan will meet with Mr. Mulroney early next month in Ottawa. Canadians are increasingly concerned that the Reagan administration isn't doing enough to limit sulfur emissions from U.S. power plants that fall as acidic precipitation in Canada.    Mr. Reagan first endorsed the $2.5 billion spending goal about a year ago, after it was recommended by his envoy, former Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis, and Canada's envoy, William Davis. But for a year, his administration made no plans to spend that much, and Energy Department officials suggested that existing plans fulfilled his commitment. Mr. Herrington's announcement was the first to identify where and when the administration would seek to spend the cash.    According to Mr. Herrington, the administration will raise the balance of the funds by seeking congressional approval to spend another $500 million a year for the fiscal years 1990 through 1992 and by taking credit for $150 million already committed to clean-coal projects.    The Energy Department has selected nine clean-coal projects to receive almost $400 million in its first round of project subsidies. Mr. Herrington's proposal takes credit for spending allocated on five of them. The Congressional Research Service, Environmental Protection Agency and Canadian government each has concluded, however, that only three or fewer of those projects meet the special envoys' criteria.    Jim Wright, head of the environmental section of the Canadian Embassy here, said that the $2.5 billion funding was a &quot;significant step&quot; and that he wouldn't &quot;quibble about how much of each program is directly responsive to the Lewis-Davis criteria.&quot; But he noted that ultimately, Canada wants tighter limits on U.S. sulfur emissions.    ---   John Urquhart in Ottawa contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
