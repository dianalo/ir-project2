Birnbaum (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a victory for the gun lobby, the House voted to remove from the anti-drug bill a provision to require a seven-day waiting period before anyone can purchase a handgun.    By a 228-182 vote, the House knocked out of the bill the waiting-period provision, which is called the Brady amendment for James Brady, the White House spokesman who was shot along with President Reagan in 1981 by an assailant using a handgun.    The amendment, sponsored by Rep. Bill McCollum (R., Fla.), instead would direct the Justice Department to develop a system under which gun dealers can discover if potential purchasers of guns are convicted felons.    The House Judiciary Committee's approval of the Brady amendment earlier this year -- as part of the omnibus anti-drug bill that is making its way through Congress -- represented a defeat for the National Rifle Association. But yesterday, the powerful gun lobby bounced back and demonstrated its clout by mustering the votes to pass the McCollum amendment. Members attributed the vote in large part to the approaching November elections.    The NRA is often a major factor in races in rural districts. In the House vote, it defeated an imposing coalition favoring the waiting period -- including most of the nation's law enforcement organizations. One of its most prominent advocates was Sarah Brady, the wife of James Brady.    President Reagan favored the idea of a waiting period, though he didn't specifically endorse the House bill's provision.    Brady amendment advocates trotted out an array of NRA members who said the NRA was wrong to oppose the waiting period provision, and argued that the provision would give the law-enforcement community a deserved extra safeguard. One was Rep. Bill Nichols (D., Ala.), who said he has been a hunter for 50 years.    &quot;On the Brady amendment they (the NRA) are wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;It does nothing for the legitimate hunter.&quot;    NRA backers argued that the federal government has no place in directing states how to sell guns. They asserted that the seven-day period wouldn't prevent hand-gun sales to the criminally inclined. But more importantly, they said that the provision was a first step toward gun control, and even gun confiscation.    &quot;The national waiting period won't work,&quot; Rep. McCollum said. &quot;What felon in his right mind is going to produce his own name? A 20-day waiting period won't do it.&quot;    Both sides lobbied intensely, but the NRA out-flanked the waiting-period advocates by producing its own group of law-enforcement officials opposed to the Brady amendment. &quot;It's never an easy vote,&quot; said Rep. Richard Durbin (D., Ill.), who favored the Brady approach. &quot;A lot of members from rural areas and western and southern states stood with the NRA.&quot;    Mrs. Brady, who stood on the House steps imploring lawmakers prior to the vote, said she was disappointed, but would press for a waiting period next year.    The Brady amendment would have required someone purchasing a gun to provide his or her name, address and date-of-birth to the gun dealer, who would then turn the information over to the police. It is illegal for convicted felons and people who have been judged mentally incompetent to purchase handguns.    Under the amendment, if the police have no objection to the sale, the gun could be picked up by the purchaser in seven days or fewer.    While directing the Justice Department to develop a system that would allow gun dealers to check whether a hand-gun buyer is a felon, Mr. McCollum's amendment wouldn't provide for the system to be put into effect. </TEXT></DOC>
