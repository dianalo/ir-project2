Machinist leaders celebrated the end of the bid, and unionflight attendants, who have been seeking a new contract for abouttwo years, were left disgruntled after the UAL board announcedMonday it would remain independent while directors examinealternatives to the scrapped $6.75 billion offer.   However, despite the machinists' opposition to the buyout, JohnF. Peterpaul, a vice president of the union, told The New YorkTimes he would meet today with other machinist officials andadvisers to discuss ways of making UAL less vulnerable to atakeover.   ``This company will continue to be in jeopardy and we want tosee what we can do to help,'' he said.   The Times also quoted a source as saying several Japanese bankshad contacted the union to see whether it might support analternative buyout proposal.   The main union involved in the failed buyout bid, the Air LinePilots Association, planned to meet today in New York withrepresentatives of the flight attendants' union to try to revivethe failed plan, union sources told the Chicago Tribune.   UAL management, however, will not be represented at the New Yorkmeeting, the Tribune reported.   ``Management is free to participate in a buyout bid, but as apractical matter, they can't lead the charge,'' the newspaperquoted an unidentified union source as saying.   Management worked with the pilots during the effort to take overthe nation's second-largest airline, but it was unclear how therelationship would weather the collapse of the deal earlier thismonth, analysts said Wednesday.   ``You've had crummy (labor) relations all along _ it certainlywasn't made better by this deal,'' said Edward Starkman, an airlineanalyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York.   ``It's going to have Mr. Wolf walking a fine line,'' Starkmansaid of Stephen Wolf, UAL's chairman and the leader of the buyoutoffer.   The contract with the machinists union, United's largestorganized labor group representing more than 24,000 employees, isopen to negotiations beginning in November.   Machinist spokesman Jim Conley said the union wants to proceedwith ``normal'' talks and does not expect increased difficultybecause of its view of the failed deal.   The union will pursue wage and benefit increases and may alsoseek to strengthen job protection language that currently allowsthe machinists to extend their contract provisions for three yearsin the event of a buyout, Conley said in a telephone interview fromMemphis, Tenn.   The flight attendants, while negotiating to join the buyoutplan, had also balked at some concessions outlined in the proposal.   Now they want an immediate resumption of the federal mediationthat was suspended in August due to the buyout speculation.Resuming the talks could lead to a walkout if the negotiations areas unsuccessful as they have been for the past two years, said PatFriend, spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants inChicago.   For their part in the buyout effort, the pilots agreed, amongother things, to accept a 7-year contract with a no-strike pledgeand to grant about $250 million in annual concessions.   That contract is no longer valid. Some good-faith concessions,such as flying four additional hours a month without pay, have beenin effect for about a month, but some pilots are calling for thoseconcessions to be rescinded.   Calls to UAL and the pilots union for comment were not returned.   The Air Line Pilots Association said it will continue to pursuean employee ownership plan for UAL, but some analysts predicted itwould be some time before a new offer was presented by the union oranyone else.   ``One thing this board's clearly demonstrated is they're notquickly moved into action to do anything on their own,'' saidRobert Decker, an airline analyst with Duff andamp; Phelps in Chicago.``They'll follow that approach until someone emerges and forcesthem to take action.''</TEXT></DOC>
