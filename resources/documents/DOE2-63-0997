The experience ofa medium-sized exploration company in developing an integrated capitaland operations reporting system is reported. Improvements in softwareavailability since that time have occurred, meaning that the total softwaresolution is one of the most cost-effective ways of delivering a new integratedsystem, although at the cost of having to change company procedures tocorrespond with those of the software. An alternative approach suggestedin this paper is the use of prototyping, which refers to applicationsdesigned under a common technical architecture that are used as modelsand customized to fit a particular company's needs. Prototyping providesaccess to the collective experiences of other oil and gas companies,and reduces the cost and risk of developing integrated systems whilestill allowing delivery of customized applications. 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
