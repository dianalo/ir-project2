In July, the Office of Management and Budget proposed that the Census Bureau drop about 30 of 61 questions from the questionnaires it planned to use in next spring's &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for the 1990 census. But yesterday, the OMB instead ordered the bureau to drop only three questions entirely.    The questions involved the type of heating equipment people use, the type of fuel and the cost of utilities.    The bureau will use the dress rehearsal to test its questionnaires, equipment and computer programs in preparation for the nationwide census in April 1990. The questions selected for the dress rehearsal are almost certain to be used in the 1990 census.    Earlier, the budget office had challenged the need for many of the planned questions, saying some of the data aren't needed or are available from other sources. Among questions it sought to have eliminated were a number dealing with housing quality and cost, including whether homes have telephones and complete plumbing facilities, the number of bedrooms, utility costs, and the amount of rent or mortgage.    Other questions the budget office wanted trimmed included questions on where people lived five years ago, the number of children born, and the number of vehicles owned.    The agency also had questioned whether the bureau needs to survey as many households as planned. The Census bureau planned to administer a &quot;short form&quot; containing 17 questions to all of the approximately 96 million households in the country, and then to ask an additional 44 questions on a &quot;long form&quot; to a sample of about 16 million households.    In July, the budget office proposed moving some questions planned for all households to those planned for the sample, while reducing the total number of households surveyed. Yesterday, it said it decided to order seven housing-related questions intended for all households to be moved to the sample form, but it didn't order a reduction in the sample size.    The earlier budget office proposal prompted an outcry from planners, demographers, local officials, academics and a wide array of other users of census information.    They deluged the OMB with hundreds of letters, telegrams, and resolutions arguing that the information the census provides cannot be obtained elsewhere or would be too expensive for small businesses and governments to collect themselves.    Some critics also accused the Reagan administration of seeking to diminish public concern over certain social issues by reducing the availability of information about them. </TEXT></DOC>
