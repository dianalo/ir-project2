(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A couple locked in a legal tug-of-warover Baby M will meet with Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould in an attemptto reach a settlement on visitation for the surrogate mother, anewspaper reported Saturday.   William and Elizabeth Stern agreed to a private meeting ``aftermuch soul-searching,'' said their attorney, Gary N. Skoloff, TheStar-Ledger of Newark reported.   When the state Supreme Court ruled on the case earlier thismonth, it directed a Superior Court judge to set visitationguidelines for Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and the nearly 2-year-old child.   The state's highest court overturned a lower court decision thatupheld a $10,000 contract under which Mrs. Whitehead-Gould wasartificially inseminated with Stern's sperm and bore the child forhim and his wife.   In addition to stripping her of her parental rights, the lowercourt last March 31 awarded custody of the baby to the Sterns.   The Supreme Court maintained custody for the Sterns, but voidedthe contract and and the termination of Mrs. Whitehead-Gould'sparental rights, and ruled she was entitled a hearing on visitingher child. She now gets to visit the child two hours a week, undera temporary visitation order.   As of late last week, a court date for a visitation hearingbefore Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween had not been set.   Harold Cassidy, attorney for Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, did not saywhat visitation she would seek during the meeting with the Sterns,or when the meeting would take place, the newspaper said.   The proposed meeting marks the first time the Sterns havepursued an out-of-court settlement in the dispute over Baby M,named Melissa by the Sterns.   The Sterns ``have decided, after much soul-searching andadditional professional advice, that it is in the best interest ofMelissa Stern to seek a meeting'' with the surrogate and herhusband, Dean Gould, Skoloff said.   Cassidy did not return a phone call to his home on Saturday.There was no answer at Skoloff's office.</TEXT></DOC>
