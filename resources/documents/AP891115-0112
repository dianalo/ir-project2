In Kunsan, 130 miles southwest of Seoul, protesters threw rocksand firebombs at the main gate of a U.S. Air Force base, demandinga ban on food imports, U.S. authorities said.   South Korean police arrested five students. U.S. officialsreported minor damage to a guardhouse, but no injuries.   About 2,000 students and farmers hurling firebombs and rocksbattled riot police at Konkuk University in eastern Seoul afterthey were prevented from marching into the street to protest thepolice blockade of their planned rally.   The protesters demanded the downfall of President Roh Tae-woo asriot troopers, backed by armored vans firing tear gas, maderepeated charges to drive them back.   ``Drive out the Yankees who enforce the opening of agriculturalmarkets!'' the protesters chanted. They say cheap U.S. importsthreaten their livelihood.   Police reported no injuries but said about 500 farmers andstudents were arrested in Seoul.   Protesters gathered at Konkuk after some 7,000 riot police weredeployed around Seoul's Yoido Plaza to foil the farmers' rallydemanding an end to U.S. imports and also seeking an increase inprices for domestic farm products.   Police blocked the rally after Prime Minister Kang Young-hoonordered security forces Tuesday to launch a crackdown to blockanti-government rallies by students, workers and farmers.   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said groups of farmersheld protests and sit-ins in about 20 rural areas, occupyinggovernment and political party offices, after police checkpointsblocked them.   Police said about 8,000 farmers were blocked from leaving forSeoul across the country.   About 100 farmers occupied an opposition party office in Najunear the southern city Kwangju after police stopped them fromleaving for Seoul, Yonhap said.   The United States, which buys about 35 percent of South Korea'sexports and ran an $8.6 billion trade deficit with the country lastyear, has been pressing for greater access to South Korean markets.Seoul is reluctant to open agricultural markets to protect farmers.   Dissidents and radical students are supporting farmers to try toexpand anti-government forces.</TEXT></DOC>
