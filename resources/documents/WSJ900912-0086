The Census Bureau said the number of black-owned companiesin the U.S. jumped 38% in the five years ending in 1987, thebureau's newest figures, to 424,000 companies. That's roughly2 1/2 times faster than the 14% growth rate of total newbusiness formations in the same period.</LP><TEXT>   While the bulk of black-owned companies remain tiny,owner-operated &quot;mom and pop&quot; retail and service outlets, theCensus report showed an 87% jump to 70,815 in the number ofblack-owned companies with paid employees. The number ofcompanies with workers had remained virtually unchanged inthe previous five years ending in 1982.   &quot;I think that's a pretty encouraging sign,&quot; said JohnDodds, chief of the Census Bureau's enterprise statisticsbranch, which compiles the report. &quot;Before, people weremaking a business go just by hard work, maybe with a coupleof family members. Now they're expanding and hiring people.It shows that black-owned firms are growing beyond theformative stage.&quot;   Timothy Bates, professor of urban policy at the New Schoolfor Social Research in New York, says the increase in totalblack-owned companies is &quot;pretty impressive,&quot; but lesssignificant than the sharp rise in less traditional areas ofblack business activity such as business services andconstruction. The Census figures show the number of blackgeneral contractors with paid workers doubling in the fiveyears ending in 1987, and business-service concerns withemployees more than tripling.   &quot;You're seeing a qualitative shift in the types ofbusiness,&quot; said Mr. Bates. &quot;Fewer barber shops and morebusiness-service companies. These are growth areas.&quot;   But if black business ownership has been surging, otherfigures in the Census report paint a more sobering picture ofthe economic realities of minority entrepreneurship. Averageannual receipts for all U.S. companies covered by the report(which didn't include publicly owned corporations) were$146,000 in the 1983-1987 period, but only $47,000 for theaverage black company. The annual sales of slightly more thanhalf of all black-owned companies were less than $10,000.   Black-owned concerns in 1987 represented just 3% of allU.S. companies and accounted for only 1% of gross receipts.   Harry Brooks, chief executive officer of Advanced ConsumerMarketing Corp., Burlingame, Calif., says problems don't goaway as minority companies get larger. He notes that 19 ofthe 100 largest black-owned industrial and service companieslisted by Black Enterprise magazine have gone out of businessin the past year. &quot;That is a scary trend,&quot; he says. &quot;When youlose one of those companies, it's awfully difficult toreplace.&quot;   Mr. Brooks, whose own concern is one of the biggerblack-owned businesses, says shortage of capital is a primaryconcern for larger minority-owned companies. &quot;We don't havethe staying power,&quot; he adds. &quot;As you start growing, you usecash at an accelerated pace. If you don't have some semblanceof deep pockets, you can be profitable and still go out ofbusiness.&quot;   Black entrepreneurs who have flourished underaffirmative-action programs also worry they'll be hurt by aSupreme Court decision last year. In a case brought againstthe government of Richmond, Va., the court said nearly allprograms that set aside a share of state and localpublic-works programs for minority-owned companies areunconstitutional. These local set-aside programs weredesigned to spur minority-business formation.   By sales volume, automobile dealers and service stationsranked at the top of black-owned industry groups with $2.2billion of receipts in 1987. Next were business services,health services and special trade contractors.   Not surprisingly, black business ownership is strongest inareas with large black populations. The cities with the mostblack-owned companies were New York, Los Angeles, Washington,D.C., Chicago, Houston, and Atlanta.   The Census Bureau began following minority businessownership trends in 1969. Tracking down black-owned companiesinvolves considerable statistical legwork.   The Internal Revenue Service gives the Census Bureaunames, addresses, Social Security numbers and dollar receiptsof every business tax return filed with the IRS. Names on thebusiness tax returns are then cross-matched with race codeson an individual's Social Security application to compile alist of black business persons. The bureau says its strictnon-disclosure policy protects the confidentiality of the taxdata.   Mr. Dodds says the bureau also reviews lists from theSmall Business Administration's minority business office, andvarious minority company directories in compiling itsfive-year survey. &quot;This is a real efficient operation,&quot; Mr.Dodds adds. &quot;It's very inexpensive because it uses existingrecords.&quot;   Because of statistical difficulties involved in matchingstockholder ownership by race, the report doesn't includepublicly owned companies, including those that may havepredominantly black ownership.   Similar reports on companies owned by Hispanics, Asians,American Indians and women will be released later.</TEXT></DOC>
