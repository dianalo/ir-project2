Businesses were closed today across the country as a three-dayperiod of mourning began, and soldiers were posted at governmentbuildings under a state of emergency declared by the head of acaretaker government, Ghulam Ishaq Khan.   Air force investigators flew to the scene today as unofficialreports and rumors circulated that Zia's American-made C-130 wassabotaged or shot down.   The remains of the plane lay strewn across a sandy plain nearthe Indian border in Punjab province. The plane exploded Wednesdayafter taking off from a nearby airport.   Soldiers slid the flag-draped coffins of Zia, U.S. AmbassadorArnold Raphel and 28 others onto planes bound for Islamabad andother Pakistani cities where relatives of the victims were waiting.   The government had originally put the death toll at 37.   Most of the wreckage lay in a 100-yard radius. A wing lyingabout 1,000 yards away was the only piece not charred and mangledwhen the turpo-prop aircraft fell to the ground shortly aftertakeoff from Bahawalpur airport.   Ishaq Khan said he could not rule out sabotage but was awaitingfor a probe to be completed.   A Pakistani air force crash investigation team flew to the scenetoday in search of the plane's flight recorder. A similar U.S. teamwas also expected, but no details were disclosed.   Unofficial reports and rumors circulated that the C-130 was hitby an anti-aircraft missile or a helicopter or was shot down byIndia.   The United News of India news agency today quoted a ``highlyplaced Pakistani military official'' as saying a sophisticated timebomb may have caused the explosion.   It quoted the official, who was not identified by name, assaying the pilot did not radio any message to the control tower. Hesaid the pilot probably would have had time to radio if the planehad been attacked by a missile.   Heavy security surrounded the crash site which was covered withweeds and stagnant pools. The site is about eight miles northwestof the airport and 330 miles south of Islamabad.   An army brigadier who identified himself only as Zaidi said somewitnesses reported seeing the plane explode shortly after takeoff,but others said it was only smoking when it lost altitude andcrashed.   ``If it burst in the air it would be spread over a large areabut it is all in one area,'' he said. But he said the far-flungwing was ``a puzzle to investigators.''   Businesses were shuttered in official mourning for Zia. It wasnot immediately clear what civil rights were curtailed by the stateof emergency.   A funeral for Zia, a close U.S. ally, was set for Saturday. TheU.S. Embassy said Secretary of State George P. Shultz would attend.   The people killed aboard the plane included U.S. defense adviserBrig. Gen. Herbert M. Wassom and five top Pakistani generals. Thegroup had been inspecting a military unit near Bahawalpur.   The Indian border states of Jammu and Kashmir were placed undercurfews today after pro-Pakistanis tried to set two bridges ablaze.Indian news reports said three people were killed and nine woundedby security forces when a crowd defied the curfew.   Pakistan was created from Moslem-dominated areas ofpredominantly Hindu India when the subcontinent became independentof Britain in 1947. The two countries have fought three wars.   A U.S. official in Washington, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the United States will help Pakistan investigatethe crash. ``There is no confirmation of any foul play, but we arenot taking anything for granted,'' the U.S. official said. ``Anincident like this arouses suspicion.''   Zia allowed his country to be used as a staging ground forU.S.-backed guerrillas fighting Soviet and government troops inneighboring Afghanistan. Since the Soviet troop withdrawal beganthere May 15, the Kremlin has accused Pakistan of continuing tofunnel arms to the insurgents.   ``The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR sent to theinterim president of that country ... our deepest condolences,''Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov announced at a newsbriefing.   Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil also expressed condolencesbut declined to speculate whether it could affect Islamabad'spolicy.   Rajiv Gandhi, India's prime minister, said he was ``deeplyshocked and distressed'' by the death of Zia and sent condolencesto the president's family. The Indian government declared threedays of mourning for Zia.   Zia, 64, ruled Pakistan for 11 years, longest of anyone in thenation's 41-year history.   Ishaq Khan pledged to continue Zia's foreign policy of closeties with the United States and with fellow Moslem nations. He saidhe would proceed with Zia's vision of an Islamic society under aMoslem code of law.   There were no reports of major unrest.</TEXT></DOC>
