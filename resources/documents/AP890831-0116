(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge suspended Jim Bakker's fraud andconspiracy trial today and ordered the PTL founder committed forpsychiatric testing after he was told Bakker suffered hallucinationsand was found cowering under a couch.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter ordered Bakker, who was not incourt at the time, to be taken to the Federal Corrections Facilityin Butner to see if he is competent to stand trial.   Potter's court order allows Bakker to be held at the institutionfor up to 60 days. Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Scofield saidpsychiatric evaluations normally take about 45 days.   A sobbing, disheveled Bakker was later brought to the courthouse,then taken away in handcuffs 90 minutes later to the mental facility.   The fourth day of Bakker's trial opened with his psychiatrist,Dr. Basil Jackson, testifying in a brief hearing out of the jury'spresence that Bakker ``was lying in the corner of his attorney'soffice with his head under a couch, hiding. He was expressingthoughts that someone was going to hurt him.''   Jackson, who has been treating Bakker for nine months, saidBakker suffered hallucinations after breaking down Wednesday when awitness collapsed during cross-examination. That witness, former PTLvice president Steve Nelson, was back at the courthouse today,saying he felt better.   ``Mr. Bakker reported that when he left the courthouse, suddenlypeople outside took on the form of frightening animals which he feltwere intent on destroying him, attacking him and hurting him,'' saidJackson, a Milwaukee psychiatrist whom the prosecution dismissed asa ``hired gun.''   Potter summoned the jurors and told them the trial was beingdelayed, without saying why. He instructed them to check with thecourthouse Tuesday to see if the trial would resume Wednesday.   After Potter suspended the trial, U.S. marshals drove Bakker fromhis attorney's office to the courthouse.   ``Mr. Bakker, I'm going to have to ask you to sit up, please,'' adeputy marshal said to Bakker after he curled up in fetal positionin the back seat.   Jackson asked that Bakker be sent to an unidentified privatehospital, but Potter instead ordered marshals to deliver Bakker tothe Butner facility.   Jackson said Bakker had not agreed to be voluntarily committed.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller told Potter the defense hadpresented its motion for a psychiatric evaluation just 15 minutesbefore the trial was set to resume.   ``This time he (Bakker attorney George T. Davis) didn't summonhis client to come up to pray,'' Miller said, referring to Bakker'spraying over Nelson when he collapsed on the stand Wednesday. ``Thistime he summons a psychiatrist to come up here.''   Davis told Potter that Bakker wanted the trial to continue,quoting the evangelist as saying, ``I want to go to court. I want tobe on trial.'' Davis told the judge Bakker lay on the floor in afetal position.   It was not the first time that Bakker was described asemotionally distraught since the PTL scandal broke. His wife, TammyFaye, said in a fund-raising letter to supporters last fall that helay in a fetal position for hours after he was forced to leave theministry in March 1987.   Mrs. Bakker was in Florida, continuing broadcasts of the couple'sevangelistic cable television show. Today's show made no mention ofthe morning court developments. It was taped earlier, said a womanwho answered the phone at at Jim and Tammy Ministries in Orlando.   The drama followed Wednesday's collapse of Nelson, who faintedduring cross-examination. During the incident, Bakker, prompted byDavis, went to Nelson's side and prayed aloud.   Patterson said Nelson recovered consciousness after 15 to 30seconds and explained his fainting today by saying he hadn't eatenanything in the past few days because he had felt ill.   Also Wednesday, Richard Dortch, another former PTL executiveexpected to testify against Bakker, was hospitalized in Florida foran undisclosed condition.   Dortch, 57, was sentenced to eight years in prison after pleadingguilty to fraud and conspiracy relating to PTL fund-raising. He wasBakker's top aide when the evangelist quit PTL in 1987 amidrevelations about his 1980 sexual encounter with church secretaryJessica Hahn and a $265,000 payoff for her silence.   Nelson testified that he told Bakker and Dortch that ``lifetimepartnerships'' good for lodging and other benefits at PTL's HeritageUSA religious retreat and theme park in Fort Mill, S.C., had beenoversold.   ``I told them I thought we had some big-time problems,'' Nelsonsaid. ``I specifically said, `Someone could go to jail for this.'''   When court recessed Wednesday after Nelson's collapse, Bakkerbroke into tears at the courthouse door.   ``I can't go out,'' he told his lawyers.   When attorney Harold Bender moved to open the door, Bakkeryelled: ``Harold, Harold, don't leave me here!'' After Benderreturned to his side, Bakker regained his composure.   If convicted on all 24 counts, Bakker could be sentenced to 120years in prison and fined $5 million.   Prosecutors say Bakker and other PTL executives diverted fortheir own use more than $4 million of the $158 million raised fromPTL ``partners.''   In the ``partnerships,'' $1,000 contributors were guaranteedthree free nights' lodging each year for life at PTL. The ministryhad one hotel and others under construction, but prosecutors saythose lodgings could not support the more than 66,000 partnershipssold by the time Bakker resigned.</TEXT></DOC>
