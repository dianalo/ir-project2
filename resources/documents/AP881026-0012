JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A commuter airliner crash last February thatkilled all 12 people on board was caused mainly by an excessivelyrapid turn after the aircraft took off from Raleigh-Durham, N.C.,airport, federal investigators say.   The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday blamed piloterror for the AVAir crash, but it said contributing factors were thecommuter line's failure to act when it received information thepilot had previous flying problems and the government's inadequatemonitoring of the airline, which had financial problems.   The AVAir plane, flying as American Eagle Flight 378, crashedshortly after it took off in dense fog on Feb. 19, l988, landing inwooded area about a mile from the airport runway.   The Fairchild Metro III commuter was bound for Richmond, Va.,with 10 passengers, a pilot and a copilot.   The NTSB criticized the Federal Aviation Administration for notkeeping a closer watch on AVAir's financial problems during a periodof rapid expansion and not forwarding such information to theinspectors assigned to the airline.   AVAir had undergone rapid growth in 1987 as a feeder for AmericanAirlines at Raleigh-Durham. It was ranked the 30th largest commuterairline in the country last year carrying 351,522 passengers but methard times in late l987. It filed for bankruptcy last January,resumed operation in February but sold its commuter operation toAmerican Airlines in May.   The NTSB said the probable cause for the Feb. 19 accident was``the failure of the flight crew to maintain a proper flight pathdue to the first officer's inappropriate instrument scan, thecaptain's inadequate monitoring of the flight and the flight crew'sresponse to a fault in the airplane's stall avoidance system.''   The investigation revealed that the copilot, Kathleen Digan, 28,who had been hired by AVAir in May 1987, had a spotty flying recordand on a number of occasions had been the subject of criticalevaluations by various AVAir captains.   In July 1987 an AVAir captain wrote the airline's operationschief on hotel stationery that Ms. Digan had trouble on eight of 10landings she flew during their trip together and that he consideredher performance ``unacceptable.'' Two months later another AVAircaptain reported in an evaluation that Ms. Digan had problems inclmb, cruise, descent and landing maneuvers.   According to the NTSB, she was hired by AVAir, on March 5, 1987,when the airline needed scores of new pilots because of expansionplans. Ms. Digan was one of 123 pilots hired by AVAir in the secondquarter of l987, according to the safety board.   Ms. Digan had 2,080 hours of flying including a total of 450hours on a Fairchild Metro II and Metro III at the time of theaccident.   Investigators determined that Ms. Digan was at the controls whenthe Metro III commuter plane departed Raleigh-Durham on Feb. 19,although there was evidence that the captain, Walter Cole, 38,attempted to help keep the aircraft aloft in the final seconds.   The flight was the first she had flown in instrument conditionsin 4{ weeks, the report said.   Flight 378 had been told by air traffic control to bank to theright as soon as possible after takeoff because of the heavy trafficloads at the time of the departure, investigators said.   But Ms. Digan, flying in foggy conditions, banked the aircraft atonly 200 feet and at a 40 degree angle, almost twice as sharp aswould have been prudent, and likely became somewhat disoriented,allowing the plane to descend, the safety board said.   The pilots were relying on instruments because of the poorvisibility and the NTSB concluded that if the pilots had scannedtheir instruments adequately they would have known the bank was toosharp and at too low an altitude.   The NTSB report said the pilots also might have been distractedby a light indicating that the aircraft's stall warning system hadactivated. The system automatically forces the nose down if theaircraft is approaching a stall.   According to the investigation, the aircraft's performanceindicated that the stall warning system actually had not deployed,and the problem stemmed from a false warning light.</TEXT></DOC>
