The event's organizer, Peter Mowbray, originally wanted Oxford tocompete against a Midwest team, but when he realized no local teamscould match England's talent, he contacted Cambridge.   Oxford's nine-man crew won Saturday's race by less than half alength, though it won't count in the official win-loss recordcompiled since 1829 _ 69 victories for Cambridge and 66 to Oxford,which has won 14 of the last 15 matches.   ``Only London counts, but all of them matter,'' said GeorgeCheveley, 22, of Oxford. ``We don't ever want to lose to Cambridge.''   The Chicago race was two miles, about half that of London's, andhad a hairpin turn that prompted a staggered start.   It was the first time the British universities raced each otherin the United States. The official races are held in March on theThames.   The crews had some time to socialize and see the sights ofChicago, Cheveley said. ``But when we get to racing together,there's no love lost on the water.''   As the Oxford team stepped up to collect their trophies, theyhoisted their 113-pound coxswain _ or steerman _ on their shouldersand tossed him into the river.   ``I did a good job, so that's why,'' said Martin Watts, 20, ofLondon, as he pulled himself up and wrung himself out.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dah-dah-dah-duuuuum.
