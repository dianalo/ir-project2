Coetzee's latest novel, &quot;Age of Iron&quot; (Random House, 198pages, $18.95), is built on just such an awareness: theprivilege of the dead, or the dying, to carry on in words.Set in South Africa, it is the narrative of a retiredclassics professor who is dying of cancer, and who devotesthe final weeks of her life to writing a long, last letter toher only child, a daughter who has moved to America.   But if the dying Mrs. Curren, a widowed white liberalliving alone in Cape Town, had expected to pen a letter freeof the contagion of apartheid and full of the certainties ofthe educated, that illusion is shattered when she returnsfrom the doctor. Reeling from the news of her cancer, shediscovers an alcoholic vagrant camped in an alley beside hergarage. Filthy, taciturn, alternately sullen and solicitous,the drunken Vercueil, whose race is never specified, isdestined to become the unlikely helpmate, confessor andsurrogate lover of her final days. And as the man to whom sheeventually entrusts the letter to be delivered to herdaughter, he is destined too to become her angel ofannunciation.</LP><TEXT>   When Mrs. Curren's black housemaid, Florence, laterarrives with her two daughters and her 15-year-old son,Bheki, the festering consequences of apartheid begin slowlyto impinge on her world. The housemaid explains that she hasbrought Bheki with her, because, &quot;he will get into trouble&quot;in the townships, where the schools have been set afire andrebellion is &quot;burning with a low flame.&quot; Bheki and a youngschoolmate, both hardened by the oppressions of apartheid,are driven relentlessly by the iron indignation of thevictimized.   But what seems at first only a domestic drama spiralsrapidly into a fierce pageant of modern South Africa. Mr.Coetzee portrays with equal vigor the insidiousness of theapartheid system and the moral astonishment of a woman who inher dying days is forced to witness as well as participate init.   Mrs. Curren is outraged that her housemaid accepts withplacid fatalism the way in which her son and his schoolmatehave been radicalized by struggle in the townships. &quot;Becareful: They may start by being careless of their own livesand end by being careless of everyone else's,&quot; she tells her.To Florence's boast that they are &quot;children of iron&quot; livingin an age in which there are &quot;no more mothers and fathers,&quot;Mrs. Curren pleads for the constant necessity of moralauthority. &quot;You wash your hands of them and they turn intothe children of death,&quot; she says.   To be sure, Mr. Coetzee has in mind more than a littlelesson on how decent societies are built on good households,for it is clear as events unfold that no individual in thebody politic can immunize South Africa from the cancer thatis killing it. Bheki, and then his companion, are shot todeath by white policemen in separate incidents that flow sosmoothly from the logic of blind hatred that one is baffledthat the deaths can be viewed as anything but the inevitablemechanisms of a corrupt society. Still, Mrs. Curren plungesforward in her private crusade, scuffling with policeofficers, screaming of injustice, raging like an impotentLear, convinced to the bitter end that shame put to wordswill right the world.   And all the while, she is succumbing slowly, sometimes inmoments of drugged hallucination, to her own cancer. Whatmakes the novel so powerful is how skillfully Mr. Coetzeeweaves the tale Mrs. Curren tells of South Africa with theold woman's tortured love of her own daughter, whom shehasn't told she has cancer.   In one passage, she tries to bridge the thousands of milesseparating them by imagining her daughter preparing dinner:&quot;She empties the peas into a bowl. She takes two onions andbegins to peel them. Imagine the peas, imagine the onions.Imagine the world in which she is doing these things. . . . asummer evening in North America, with gnats at the screendoor, children calling from down the street. Imagine mydaughter in her house, in her life, with an onion in onehand, in a land where she will live and die in peace.&quot;   Ironically, &quot;Age of Iron,&quot; Mr. Coetzee's sixth novel, ishis most explicit about apartheid, and it is published at atime when the system is yielding slowly, but finally, tochange. It is a remarkable work by a brilliant writer,although it lacks the sustained, if at times lunaticintensity of his earlier novels, &quot;In the Heart of theCountry&quot; and &quot;Waiting for the Barbarians.&quot; There are momentsof uneven quality in Mrs. Curren's narrative that existnowhere else in Mr. Coetzee's fiction, but they are minorblemishes.   One is haunted on finishing the novel by a doubt thatplagues Mrs. Curren throughout this swan song to herdaughter: Will the vagrant Vercueil ever deliver it to her?In that puzzle lies a central assertion of the novel -- thatthe utterances of the doomed dignify our hope forunderstanding, even if no one is around to hear them.   ---   Mr. Plott is a correspondent for AP-Dow Jones in Zurich.</TEXT></DOC>
