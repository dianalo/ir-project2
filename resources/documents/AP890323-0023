(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The head of NBC Entertainment said thenetwork would boost the quality of its programming next seasonbecause of viewer and advertiser concerns over the content of showssuch as ``Nightingales.''   ``When we set the fall schedule, we can ... upgrade the qualityof NBC by carefully choosing what shows return and what (prospectivenew) shows we select,'' Brandon Tartikoff said Wednesday.   ``We've beefed up broadcast standards. We are sensitive tochanging audience tastes.''   The executive spoke at a preview for advertisers and advertisingagencies of 32 prospective new programs for next season. The newofferings will include the return of ``M-A-S-H'' star Alan Alda in aone-hour dramatic series, and a comedy created and produced by MelBrooks.   Tartikoff said NBC was concerned about the ``content issue'' ofits shows and the ``restlessness on the part of advertisers,affiliates and the audience.''   He did not name any specific program, but ``Nightingales'' hasbeen criticized by nursing groups that claim it demeans theprofession by showing scantily clad nurses. Chrysler Corp. andSears, Roebuck andamp; Co. said they would stop advertising on the showbecause of such complaints.   Tartikoff acknowledged some advertisers had withdrawn from theshow, but he said such pullouts were common and the show was doingwell.   ``Anytime you push the boundaries of what is acceptable, you'regoing to find that you sometimes push too far,'' Tartikoff toldreporters.   Next season's prospective new offerings were highlighted by thereturn after a six-year absence of Alda, who played Hawkeye Pierceand won five Emmys in 11 years on the smash comedy ``M-A-S-H.''   ``I haven't been tempted to get back into television until now,''said Alda. The actor will be involved in the creation and writing ofthe show, but he declined to say what it would be about except tosay: ``We'll be very proud of it. We're very up about it.''   Tartikoff said the show probably would not debut until the middleof the 1989-90 season.   The prospective programming continues to place a heavy emphasison comedy, which has been largely responsible for making NBC No. 1in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.   Brooks will create and produce a series called ``The Nuthouse''about a New York hotel, starring Harvey Korman and Cloris Leachman.   Rodney Dangerfield will have cameo roles in ``Young Rodney,''about a boy whose idol is the comic.   Also among the shows previewed:   _ Jack Warden, Mason Adams and Hope Lange will star in ``Knightand Daye,'' a comedy about two feuding former radio partners forcedto reunite after a long separation.   _ Ann Jillian will star as a widow and mother of a teen-age girlwho moves from New York to California to start a new life.   _ Robert Mitchum will play a homeless former merchant seaman whobecomes a surrogate grandfather for four newly orphaned children in``One Man's Family.''</TEXT></DOC>
