Mr. Rice's warning, the Defense Department's mostpessimistic official projection yet of cost overrunsafflicting the C-17, reflects escalating concern among seniorPentagon officials about the program's status. With the cargoplane's maiden flight scheduled for the summer, everybodyfrom Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to midlevel Air Forceacquisition officials are eager to avoid a repeat of theembarrassing cost problems that less than three months agokilled the Navy's A-12 attack plane, also built in part byMcDonnell Douglas.</LP><TEXT>   In testimony before the Senate defense appropriationssubcommittee and comments to reporters, Secretary Rice madeclear that a review is under way to pin down the extent ofthe overruns and define steps McDonnell Douglas must take toreduce overhead. &quot;There is still some remaining uncertainty&quot;about production costs, Mr. Rice told lawmakers,acknowledging that the cargo plane's problems have risen &quot;toa level none of us can be comfortable about.&quot;   The review is considered especially sensitive because itis being conducted by Donald Yockey, a high-ranking Pentagonofficial President Bush has named to head the Pentagon'sacquisition system.   In a brief interview, Mr. Rice acknowledged that thelatest overrun estimates range from $600 million to $900million. The Pentagon contends that the contractor is liablefor all of the unanticipated costs, though the companydisputes the problem is as serious as Mr. Rice indicated.   An earlier Air Force review suggested that McDonnellDouglas may have to write off as much as $580 million, andthe Defense Department temporarily withheld progress paymentsfrom the company because of disagreements over the dataMcDonnell Douglas was using for its cost calculations.   Nonetheless, McDonnell Douglas has insisted that it won'texceed the $6.6 billion ceiling on its C-17 contract, whichcovers development and the first two production lots to bebuilt by 1994. The company's own calculations show that itwill break even after recovering some $125 million from thePentagon for settling claims the company plans to submit tothe government, including reimbursement for schedule delaysthe company contends were caused by the Pentagon.   David Swain, the company's vice president and generalmanager on the C-17, maintained in an interview that onereason the company and the Air Force are so far apart oncosts is that the service is using &quot;historic data&quot; and hasn'tgiven McDonnell Douglas enough credit for reducing overheadin the past few months. The Long Beach, Calif., plant wherethe massive plane is built has trimmed expenses $11 million aweek since last summer, according to Mr. Swain. As many as2,000 people working directly on the C-17 have lost theirjobs in the past year, and another 800 jobs are scheduled tobe eliminated by year end.   &quot;We have a whole lot of work ahead of us, and it's notgoing to be easy to meet our milestones,&quot; Mr. Swain said,&quot;but we'll get there.&quot;   The Pentagon has proposed ramping up production bypurchasing six C-17s during the next fiscal year. Iflawmakers sharply reduce that purchase, the company may havetrouble keeping the production line flowing without a break.&quot;It could be a very big problem,&quot; Mr. Swain said.   Congressional skepticism about the C-17, however, evenprompted the Air Force and some lawmakers to start exploringthe possibility of restarting Lockheed Corp.'s C-5B transportline, though such a step is considered remote.</TEXT></DOC>
