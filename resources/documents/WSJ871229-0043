In a single morning, the market swung widely under influences that drove it throughout the year -- the rising yen and the power of Japanese brokerage firms.    After falling for five days in a row and losing about 1400 points, or about 5%, the Nikkei index continued to plummet in the first hour of trading. By 10 a.m., it had fallen 596.49, dipping below the 21000 level to 20936.95.    But then major brokerage houses stepped in and bought for their own accounts, determined to assure a rosy finish to the year.    Within an hour, the market had recouped its early losses. The last trading session of 1987 ended higher, up 30.56 at 21564.00.    Leading brokers such as Nomura Securities Co. were &quot;very active in whipping up market support for the index,&quot; said one equities salesman at a major foreign brokerage house. &quot;It's a very bad omen for the market to have it closing down. It was a fairly staggering feat of market manipulation.&quot;    The slide in the market during the past week disappointed many investors who had looked forward to the usual year-end rally. Since Oct. 20, when the market average plunged 3836.48 to 21910.08 in the wake of Black Monday in New York, the average had recovered to around 23000 and maintained that general level. But from mid-December, instead of turning upward, the average began to slide.    The yen's continued sharp rise played a major role in the decline over the past two weeks. On Monday, the dollar hit a new low of 123.30 in early Tokyo trading, prompting Bank of Japan intervention. But traders said the intervention was limited to keeping the fall smooth rather than counteracting it, and the dollar ended the day at 123.55, down 1.65 yen.    Stock market investors had been expecting the yen to stabilize. The U.S. moves to reduce its budget deficit and last week's statement by the Group of Seven that a further dollar decline could hamper world economic growth were taken as supporting evidence. The yen's persistent advance despite these factors undermined stock investor confidence, said Tatsuo Kurokawa, a senior equities analyst at Nomura.    In addition, the yen's continued strength had a broader impact in the stock market than usual, analysts said. Usually a strong yen tends to depress share prices mainly of export-oriented companies because it threatens their ability to sell competitively overseas.    But some analysts said currency movements are no longer linked only to specific sectors of the equities market. In the past few days, for example, export shares performed relatively well while the classic domestic beneficiaries of a strong yen, such as utility companies, have been falling, said Simon Smithson, research manager at the Tokyo branch of the securities company Kleinwort Benson International Inc.    &quot;There's a feeling that if the currency is not brought under control, it has serious implications for the U.S. economy and consequently for the Japanese economy too,&quot; he said. &quot;It's gone beyond specific sectors, it's not good for anybody.&quot;    Elsewhere, the London markets were closed Monday for a holiday. In Frankfurt, share prices fell across the board as the dollar drifted to postwar lows in thin trading.    Traders said the weaker dollar casts a pall over earnings prospects for the export-oriented West German economy.    The dollar was fixed in Frankfurt at 1.6022 marks, a record low, and was down more than three pfennigs from the previous fixing last Wednesday.    Central banks of West Germany, Switzerland, Japan and Italy bought dollars in the open foreign exchange market earlier Monday, giving the dollar a slight boost. But the scope of the banks' intervention wasn't sufficient to give the dollar more than a temporary lift, dealers said.    At the same time, trading wasn't active, traders noted. They said that many foreign and domestic market participants stepped to the sidelines, wary of the potentially sharp price swings that a thin, end-of-the-year market can create.    Stocks also closed lower in Paris, Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Milan. Traders in all markets cited the dollar's decline as the chief reason.    Among Asian exchanges, stocks fell in Hong Kong, Singapore, Manila and Taipei. Markets in Sydney and Wellington were closed.
