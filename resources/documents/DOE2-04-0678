The associated gas derived from this operation is analysedby gas chromatography (g.c.) and the gas volumes of the constituentsare converted into liquid volumes employing conversion factors, followingadjustment of the PVT volumetric data to standard conditions. This methodwas found simple, efficient and accurate, with no loss of lighter components,as indicated by comparison of results with those of cold distillation.10 refs., 2 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
