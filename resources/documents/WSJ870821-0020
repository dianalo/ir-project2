In addition, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board closed two thrift institutions in Louisiana and will reopen them under its management-consignment program. The action brings to 20 the number of thrifts in the program, under which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. takes over the thrift and replaces its management.    The failed banks were American Exchange Bank andamp; Trust Co., Norman Okla., with assets of $98.4 million; First State Bank, Willow, Okla., with assets of $6.1 million; and American National Bank of Evanston, Evanston, Wyo., with assets of about $8.5 million.    American Exchange's only office was to reopen today as a branch of Bank of Oklahoma, Tulsa. First State's only office was to reopen today as a branch of the Guarantee State Bank, Mangum, Okla.    In Wyoming, American National had deposits totaling $8.3 million in about 1,800 accounts, including about $75,000 in 20 accounts that exceeded the $100,000 insurance limit per depositor. American National's sole office is to reopen today as a branch of Pioneer Bank, also of Evanston. It was the only bank failure in Wyoming this year.    Twenty-three banks have failed in Oklahoma so far this year, more than in any other state but Texas, where 35 banks have failed.    Twin City Savings Bank FSB, West Monroe, La., a federally chartered stock association with $187.2 million in assets, was closed by the Bank Board, and its four offices are to reopen today as Twin City Savings Bank FSA, a federally chartered mutual association.    First Savings of Louisiana, La Place, La., a stockholder-owned thrift with assets of $33 million, was closed by the Bank Board and is to open today as First Savings of Louisiana FSA.    Both of these new Louisiana thrifts will be managed by Dixie Management Corp., a subsidiary of Dixie Savings andamp; Loan Association of New Orleans. </TEXT></DOC>
