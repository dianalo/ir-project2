Customers bought ``anything that looks ugly, that looks like anassault weapon ... anything that may look military,'' said TonyCucchiara, president of Trader Sports in San Leandro, the state'slargest retail gun dealer.   Buyers of the weapons included collectors, investors,``yuppies,'' and others who hoped to escape the more restrictivebuying process going into effect Thursday.   Most of Cucchiara's customers were older men, and many shopperswere ``buying the more expensive guns and buying more than one,putting them away for investment purposes.''   ``There are people buying these things as souvenirs, too,'' hesaid Tuesday. ``Little old men and little old women are walkinginto the store, saying they want to buy an AK-47.''   People who bought an assault weapon before Thursday merely hadto get it registered.   But beginning June 1, the sale of more than 50 kinds ofsemiautomatic assault rifles, pistols and shotguns is virtuallybanned in California by a new law that includes a restrictivepermit process.   The legislation, and the heightened interest in semiautomaticweapons, was prompted by a January incident in which a man with anAK-47, a Soviet-designed assault weapon, attacked a elementaryschool playground in Stockton, killing five students and himself.   Between June 1 and Jan. 1, buyers must submit an application fora state permit _ similar to one required of movie studios formachine guns _ that is ``very restrictive,'' said Lynn Montgomery,an aide to state Assemblyman Mike Roos.   Possession of a permit is required as of Jan. 1, when the lawbanning sales of more than 50 specified semiautomatic rifles,shotguns and handguns goes into effect.   People who buy those guns between June 1 and Jan. 1 but aredenied permits must sell their guns to a dealer, a permit holder orsomeone living outside the state, Montgomery said. Violators willbe subject to a maximum four-year prison term.   A man who gave his name only as Barry at Bandamp;B Sales in NorthHollywood said most weapons on the restricted list have already``dried up.''   Many gun dealers said they expected the last-minute surge ofinterest in the weapons and compared the demand to bread andgasoline shortages.   ``The public reacts very uniformly,'' said Joe Ellithorpe,president of Pony Express in Los Angeles. ``They run on anythingthey can't get their hands on. That's not unusual. That's a publicnature item.''   Shop owners said prices also were skyrocketing.   Carmichael said that when the boom was starting, he got twoAR-15s, the civilian version of the military's M-16, from asupplier for about $569 each.   ``I called them back about three weeks later and asked them ifthey had any more. They said they still had several AR-15s in stockand wanted $1,975 wholesale,'' he said.   Sales have been brisk ever since Gov. George Deukmejian said hewould sign the legislation, said Don Smith, manager at Arms andamp; AmmoSupply in San Bruno. ``People are feeling a little more rushed. Nowwe're selling about 60 to 70 a week. We've been selling 10 guns aday for the last week.''   At Fremont Discount Gun, a manager named Gary who declined togive his last name, said cost distinguishes the gun collector fromothers. ``Anyone who goes out and pays $3,000 for a SIG assaultrifle is not going to shoot it. It's like a fine work of art, likebuying a piece of sculpture.''   Just north in Castro Valley, Combat Arms owner Richard Bash saidhis customers have been white-collar professionals ranging fromattorneys to police officers. ``What I'm seeing is the professionalpeople buying while the buying's still good,'' he said.   ``One wholesaler brought in 700 (AK-47s) in one day and sold allof them,'' said George Alger, store gun buyer for Big R CountryWest Guns in West Sacramento.   Bash declined to give numbers on sales, but said he's sellingthree times the usual number of semi-automatic weapons. Cucchiaraof Trader Sports said his shop used to sell two or threesemi-automatics each day, and is selling 30 to 40-a-day now.   At Handamp;H Enterprises in Redwood City, a telephone recording toldMemorial Day weekend callers that the answering machine was onbecause business was so good that no one had time to come to thephone.</TEXT></DOC>
