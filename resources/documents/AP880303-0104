Iraq said women and children were killed in Baghdad and Iransaid 13 people were killed in Tehran.   Iran also said 20 people were wounded when a missile hit ahospital in Tehran.   The missile exchange is the first time both belligerents havebombarded each other's capitals with missiles since the PersianGulf war began in September 1980. It is also the worst escalationof the so-called ``war of the cities'' since it began in early 1985.   Iran has listed 30 killed and more than 130 wounded in Tehransince the Iraqi missiles began crashing into the capital Mondayafternoon. It said another five people were killed in an air raidon the northern town of Rasht Wednesday.   Iraq has given no official breakdown of its casualties sinceMonday, when Iran fired two missiles into Baghdad, a city of 5million people. The official Iraqi News Agency has reported onlythat ``many civilians'' have been killed or wounded, but given nofigures.   The news agency said Iraq lobbed two surface-to-surface missilesinto Tehran soon after dawn. Iraqi warplanes also bombed Dezful inwestern Iran and the southern city of Shiraz.   It said the Iraqi pilots ``destroyed their targets, leaving themgutted by fire.'' It did not elaborate.   Tehran Radio said the air strikes hit residential areas, killing13 civilians and wounding 40.   That raised to 24 the number of missiles the Iraqis claim tohave fired since Tuesday into the Iranian capital, which has apopulation of 6 million.   The Iraqi agency also said another missile was fired into theholy city of Qom, the cradle of Iran's Islamic revolution and southof Tehran, around daybreak, when Moslems pray.   The Iraqis said they have fired three missiles into Qom sinceWednesday morning. The Iraqi agency was monitored in Nicosia.   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitoredin Nicosia, said that Revolutionary Guards fired two missiles intoBaghdad early today.   That brought the number of missiles Iran says it has launchedsince Monday to 10. Iraq has so far acknowledged that eight hitBaghdad.   Tehran Radio quoted military communiques as saying the Iranianmissiles were aimed at Iraq's intelligence headquarters and acenter of the ruling Baath Socialist Party.   Iraq said both missiles hit residential areas, killing orwounding ``a number of civilians, including women and children.''   The agency quoted a military spokesman in Baghdad as saying Iraq``will make the rulers of Iran taste real agony.''   Baghdad's army daily, Al-Qadissiya, declared: ``Whole Iraniancities will be wiped off the map and our missile strikes willinclude other cities besides Tehran.   ``The number of missiles we have used so far is only a sample ofwhat we have in store to deter the enemy once and for all.''   IRNA quoted Kamal Kharrazi, a member of Iran's Supreme DefenseCouncil, as declaring in Tehran that Iran is ``quite capable ofcontinuing the war of the cities'' until Baghdad stops its``inhuman attacks.''   Until Monday, Iran had fired 37 missiles into Baghdad, but theIraqis had not launched any in retaliation.   Western military analysts believe both sides are usingSoviet-made SS-1 missiles, known as Scud-Bs. Western militaryanalysts were unsure how many the two belligerents had before theybegan their long-distance dueling.   The Iraqis are believed to be firing Scuds fitted with strap-onboosters to extend their normal 190-mile range to hit Tehran, 290miles from the Iraqi border.   Iran does not have problems with range as Baghdad is only 80miles west of the battleground frontier.   IRNA quoted a Revolutionary Guards communique as warning thatIran's ``retaliatory operations, including missile and artilleryattacks, on Iraqi cities will continue powerfully and severelyuntil the Baghdad regime stops its vicious acts.''   The missile strikes were the first on Qom, although Iraqiwarplanes bombed the city several times in January last year. Qom,a city of 250,000 residents, is about as far from the border asTehran.</TEXT></DOC>
