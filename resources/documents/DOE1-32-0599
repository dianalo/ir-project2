CRISis made up of sub-systems, each composed of one more programs or taskswhich operate in parallel on a VAX-11/750 microcomputer in PediatricRadiology. Tasks are coordinated through dynamic data structures thatinclude system event flags and disk-resident queues. This report outlines:(1) the CRIS data model, (2) the flow of information among CRIS components,(3) the underlying database structures which support the acquisition,display, and storage of text and image information, and (4) current databasestatistics.</TEXT></DOC>
