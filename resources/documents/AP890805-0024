HAMM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A group of adoptees, birth mothers andadoptive parents say their rally at the Lincoln Memorial is part ofan effort to seek the unsealing of confidential birth records.   The 40 participants concluded a 2{-week march from New York toWashington on Friday and launched a two-day public awarenesscampaign that will include the rally today at the Lincoln Memorial.   The group picketed Friday in front of the city's Office of VitalRecords while five members went inside to request original birthcertificates.   The five, including two adoptees and three women who had givenup children they bore in the District of Columbia when they wereteen-agers, were turned down by Registrar Jack Crandall.   ``I have the old nothing answer, I guess, because it's thelaw,'' Crandall, an adoptive father himself, told the group. ``Thelaw says that when a person is adopted ... we create a new birthcertificate and the old certificate is under seal and can only beopened by order of the court.''   Similar efforts to obtain birth records had failed in New York,Philadelphia and Baltimore earlier in the march.   The president of another adoption group objected to themarchers' efforts to have records unsealed.   ``People have a right to be left alone,'' said William Pierce,president of the National Committee for Adoption, which represents141 adoption agencies and 2,000 individuals. ``The courts have saidrather clearly that ... a person's right to privacy is greater thanthe right to the information.''   He pointed out that many birth mothers don't want to be found,but Adoption Congress president Kate Burke insisted adoptees wouldnot abuse an open record system by disrupting the lives of birthmothers.   ``If a birth mother doesn't want to be found, all she has to sayis, `I don't want a relationship''' when her child contacts her,said Burke.   Pierce said he favors a mutual consent arrangement, in effect in22 states, which allows birth mothers and their adult children tomeet if both register to express that desire. He called mutualconsent ``a sensitive legal way for adults to be able to gettogether if they both want to.''   ``If most of them do have a burning desire to meet, then most ofthem will voluntarily register,'' Pierce said.   Ten states use a system that allows an adult adoptee to requesta search for his or her mother and then meet her if she consents,said Pierce. Three states _ Alaska, Alabama and Kansas _ openrecords once an adoptee reaches age 18. The remainder of the stateshave sealed records.</TEXT></DOC>
