The Food and Drug Administraiton, in one of the largest actionsof its kind, warned consumers Monday not to eat fruit imported fromChile after cyanide was found in two seedless red grapes shipped toPhiladelphia.   Boston wholesaler Tom Freni said Tuesday he thinks ``it's goingto be the end of the season for Chilean products.''   ``You're not going to turn people's minds around after what theFDA said last night. Who's going to take a chance on buying theproduct,'' said Freni, general manager of the J.R. Freni Co.   Big supermarket chains and small grocers alike voluntarily pulledgrapes, plums, peaches, nectarines, raspberries and other Chileanproduce off the shelves nationwide. Although most stores put thefruit in cold storage to await further instructions from the FDA,some destroyed it.   ``Public confidence is extremely perishable. Destroy a person'sconfidence that they can enjoy a piece of wholesome fruit and youhave effectively closed down the market,'' said Tom Kovacevich,chairman of the New York Produce Trade Association at the HuntsPoint produce market in New York City.   Boston wholesaler Paul Tavilla predicted huge losses nationwideas frightened customers shied away from all fruit, not just Chileanproduce.   ``I figure we're losing $400 to $500 in (fruit) sales a day.We'll probably have to eat it,'' said Tom Calcagno, manager of theYoungs Bay Food Pavilion in Warrenton, Ore.   Jack Montgomery, manager of Montgomery Produce in Yuma, Ariz.,said wholesalers and retailers are hurt by such a scare ``but on along-term basis, even the local growers are hurt.'' He said thewarnings ``will make everyone scared of grapes.''   A Los Angeles produce importer gobbled Chilean grapes at a newsconference Tuesday to dramatize his claim that the fruit is safe andthe government is ruining a booming industry unnecessarily.   ``I think it's a major, major overreaction,'' Rick Eastes,general manager of the David Oppenheimer California importer, saidof the FDA advisory. ``An industry worth $750 million in the UnitedStates and Canada has been brought to a standstill. ... We have beenassassinated by insinuation.''   The FDA said cyanide was confirmed in testing ordered at Americanports after an anonymous threat to poison Chilean fruit wastelephoned to the U.S. Embassy in Santiago, Chile's capital.   Although federal officials said cyanide had only been found intwo grapes, FDA Commissioner Frank Young urged Americans to be``safe rather than sorry.''   Not all stores were heeding the warning. The Valu-King FoodCenter in Morgantown, W.Va., is leaving the decision up to customers.   ``If they want it (the fruit), fine. If they don't want it, letit sit on the shelves,'' said employee Anthony Edward Bell.   Most store managers said customers who return produce will getrefunds. They said most inquiries had been from concerned people whohad already eaten fruit. The FDA said consumers should not beworried about fruit already consumed because cyanide is fast-acting.   Emptied food bins were quickly filled with U.S.-grown produce.``We may have more squash than usual out,'' said John Goodell, realestate manager for Dan's, a Utah-based chain with seven stores.   Virtually all the fresh grapes sold in the United States at thistime of year come from Chile, FDA officials said. Grapes make upabout two-thirds of the Chilean fruit currently being shipped to theUnited States.   Meredith Auerbach, director of marketing for California TableGrape Commission, said most of California's crop is marketed fromMay through January or February each year, so there shouldn't bemuch on grocery shelves from California harvests now.   Joey LaBarba, a manager at Dallas-based American Food Service,said he personally wasn't worried about tainted fruit.   ``A shipment of raspberries came in today, and when they got hereI ate them myself,'' LaBarba said.</TEXT></DOC>
