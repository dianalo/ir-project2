And the largest counties spend even more.   A survey of county governments released Sunday found spending bycounties averaged $426.22 per resident nationwide in the 1985-86fiscal year.   But counties with populations of 500,000 or more spent anaverage of $503.99 per resident, while counties of fewer than100,000 spent $383.12 per resident, the report found.   Seven counties spent more than $1,000 per resident to provideservices, the Census Bureau noted. They were lead by MontgomeryCounty, Md. which spent $1,684 per resident.   While education generally is a small share of most countygovernments per resident spending, the report found it made up asmuch as half of the spending for the four counties with the largestper capita expenditures.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Government Economist Sees Big Economic, Pleasure Loss In Smaller</HEAD><TEXT>   Cars</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A government economist says it would be lesscostly to the U.S. economy to add a gasoline tax of 2 or 3 centsthan to steer car buyers away from purchasing big cars.   Andrew N. Kleit, a member of the Federal Trade Commission staff,says the U.S. economy would lose $4.80 for every gallon of gassaved in dissuading people from buying big cars while just as muchfuel would be saved by an additional tax on gasoline of 2 or 3cents a gallon.   ``People clearly get pleasure from buying large cars and I don'tsee anything illicit in that at all,'' Kleit said in an interviewabout his report, ``The Impact of Automobile Fuel EconomyStandards.'' He said the report represents his own views and notthose of the FTC' Bureau of Economics which published it as WorkingPaper No. 160.   Current Transportation Department standards requiremanufacturers to meet a 26 mpg fuel efficiency standard. But thatstandard will increase to 27.5 mpg for the 1989 model year unlessthe department acts to make changes.   The lower standards, imposed in 1975, were meant as afuel-saving alternative to higher taxes on fuel or imported crudeoil. But environmentalists who want to see less fossil fuel burnedsupport the higher standards.   But opponents of the higher standards, including auto safetyproponents, estimate that a 1 mpg increase in the standard for 1989cars could mean an extra 220 to 390 deaths a year for a decadebecause the large cars people might be discouraged from buying aregenerally considered safer than small ones.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Report: States Should Provide Prenatal Care For Poor Women</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A House committee says it is costing thegovernment three to 10 times more to provide neonatal intensivecare and other health and education expenses for babies bornprematurely than it would to provide care for pregnant women withincomes below the federal poverty level who have those babies.   And the panel, the House Government Operations Committee,recommended Sunday that states be required to provide prenatalhealth care to prevent premature births.   The committee said only 26 states are currently taking advantageof a two-year-old option to extend Medicaid to all pregnant womenwith incomes below the federal poverty level.   ``Since the majority of women below the poverty line cannotpossibly afford health insurance, it is necessary to requireMedicaid coverage for pregnant women below the federal povertyline,'' the report said.   Citing various studies, the report said professional prenatalcare, not including labor and delivery fees, costs about $400,while the lifetime cost of health and custodial care for alow-birthweight handicapped infant can amount to 100 times thatmuch.   About 40,000 U.S. infants born each year die before their firstbirthday, a rate higher than many other industrialized nations.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Report Says Sexual Harassment of Women in Marines Still a Problem</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A task force report says it's up to the MarineCorps commandant to set the tone that will help remedy continuingsexual harassment of women in the corps.   The report released Sunday said existing directives and thecorps' primary grievance system are ``appropriate tools toimplement Marine Corps policy on this issue'' but emphasized thatthe commandant must convey that sexual harassment will not betolerated in the service.   The Task Force on Women in the Marine Corps, formed in September1987 at the request of then-Secretary of Navy James Webb, also saidthe corps did not have a ``significant problem'' withfraternization.   The report recommended certain steps to improve the quality oflife for female Marines, including solving the problem of shortagein uniform items and lengthy delays in filling special orders,ensuring full investigation when homosexual conduct is suspectedand allowing a pregnant Marine to request a 30-day delay in thenotification of her commander by the medical officer.   Women account for about 10 percent of the nation's 2.1 millionmilitary personnel.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Israel, US Company Push For Export Permit For Air-Launched Bomb</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.S. defense contractor and the Israeligovernment are trying to get the State Department to grant thecompany an export license so it can aid Israel in designing anair-launched armor-seeking eapon system.   But U.S. officials have refused to issue the company thenecessary license because they say the system would violate asix-year ban on the sale of ``cluster bomb'' technology to Israel.   In the memo from C.R. Bergwin, director of export licenseadministration for United Technologies to under secretary of statefor security assistance, science and technology the company arguesthat the ban should not apply to the $50 million contract.   ``In order that we may proceed with the program, we urgentlyrequire an interpretation that the U.S. government's clustermunition policy does not apply to our contract,'' Bergwin wrote.   He said the company believes that the 1982 ban was aimed atcluster bombs designed to be used against people, not against tanksand armored vehicles.   The White House imposed the cluster bomb ban on Israel in 1982after evidence surfaced that the devices were used by Israelagainst civilians during its invasion of Lebanon, an apparentviolation of assurances Israel had previously given U.S. officials.</TEXT></DOC>
