The reduction of about $720 million, primarily affecting the regional Bell companies, is almost five times greater than the telephone companies had proposed. Agency officials said the FCC will probably order American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. to reduce its costs at least 3.5%, or more than $750 million, to reflect the lower connection costs.    Other long-distance carriers usually follow ATandamp;T's pricing moves. Since ATandamp;T was broken up in January 1984, long-distance prices have dropped by about a third, largely as a result of reductions in charges to connect customers to local telephone systems.    The FCC decision was a victory for ATandamp;T, which had been pressing the agency to force local companies to reduce connection costs. Last month, ATandamp;T proposed to cut long-distance rates by 3.6% annually, or $800 million. The FCC largely adopted ATandamp;T's reasoning, asserting that the local companies, by underestimating the growth in long-distance traffic, were proposing to overcharge ATandamp;T and other long-distance carriers.    The local companies in October had asked for reductions of $151 million, based on their estimates of the growth in long-distance traffic.    In New York, ATandamp;T said that it appears the company will reduce rates about $500 million. The company will file its revised rates with the FCC late this week.    The Bell operating companies, in general, expressed disappointment about the FCC's ruling, saying that the rates they proposed were warranted. But a spokesman for Pacific Telesis Group, San Francisco, said the company was pleased with the order because the agency accepted that company's special access rates.    In Washington, MCI Communications Corp., the nation's second largest long-distance company, said it is pleased with the FCC order &quot;because it reduces our costs.&quot; An MCI spokesman said the company expects to receive &quot;the same kind of benefit as ATandamp;T&quot; from the lower connection costs. But he declined to estimate the magnitude of the savings until MCI has had a chance to study the order and review the new rate filings by the regional Bell companies.    The FCC also ordered rate reductions of $39 million in some proposed price increases for interstate private lines. At the same time, the FCC said it is suspending for two months other requests for private-line rate increases while it investigates whether further reductions in the rate increases are necessary.    Brian Moir, an attorney for the International Communications Association, a trade group representing business telephone customers, called the private-line rate reductions &quot;a step in the right direction.&quot; Earlier this month, the association filed a petition in the court of appeals here to force the FCC to complete a proceeding to determine whether the regional Bell companies are charging unlawfully high rates for private lines.    The FCC also said it is looking into whether ATandamp;T was acting improperly by offering special discounts to business customers who buy large telephone networks. The agency said it will look at whether such pricing discriminated against other customers and whether it improperly put ATandamp;T's competitors at a disadvantage.    The agency's order to reduce connection charges to long-distance companies also reduces by about 50 cents an hour the amount computer users would have to pay, should the agency decide to assess so-called access charges on computer communications networks. The fee should drop about an additional 50 cents an hour by April 1989, because consumers then will pay more in connection charges.    Even after those reductions, however, agency officials estimated, computer users face potential access charges of as much as $5.50 an hour. This summer, the agency proposed to assess access charges to hook up computer communications networks to local telephone systems. The proposal has run into fierce opposition from computer users and some lawmakers, and the agency has delayed making a final decision, until at least the spring. </TEXT></DOC>
