(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>According to SunRiver Corp., its Fiber Optic Station was the computerindustry's first bitmapped graphics terminal designed for 386-based multiusersystems.andP;  Being first to market has many advantages, including the chance togamer more third-party support, but it also makes you a target for vendorswanting some of the action.andM;SunRiver offers four different models of fiber-optic stations ranging frommonochrome with Hercules graphics to full VGA.andP;  There are several parts tothe system.andP;  First, you need a LightAdapter interface card inside the machineacting as a host.andP;  These cards come in AT-bus and Micro Channel versions, andeach board can handle up to four remote workstations.andM;The rest of the system consists of connecting cables and the desktopworkstation.andP;  SunRiver has EGA and VGA stations available, and you can mixthe types of stations as long as you can separately configure the applicationsoftware.andP;  The SunRiver VGA terminals use Mitsubishi monitors with optionalanalog inputs and excellent screens.andP;  You pay a lot for this hardware, but itis very high quality.andM;Each workstation's terminal box, which acts as a pedestal for the monitor,includes an IBM PC-compatible 8254 counter/timer with a speaker, as well asone parallel and two serial ports for connecting a printer and serialdevices.andM;When you add all this up, a system with four VGA workstations costs about$2,600 per station, not counting the price of the single PC acting as host.andM;OTHER OPTIONSandM;You can also connect existing VGA-based PCs to the host using a $999 ($799for EGA-based) PC LightCard.andP;  This card gives a PC, XT, AT, or compatible theability to act as a multifunction workstation.andP;  It allows you to access theshared resources of the host PC while retaining your investment in existingPCs.andM;SunRiver sells cables with the connectors installed in lengths ranging from50 to 1,000 feet.andP;  Costs start at $99 for a 25-foot cable and go to $1,259for a 1,000-foot roll.andP;  Also available from SunRiver is a system the companycalls CADLight, which is aimed at AutoCAD users.andM;HIGHLY SUPPORTEDandM;Among the DOS-based multiuser environments, SunRiver has drivers for all ofthe popular ones.andP;  These include Concurrent DOS 386/MGE, PC-MOS/386, QuickConnect/386, THEOS DOS, 386/MultiWare, and VM/386 MultiUser.andP;  This broadsupport gives users a choice of operating systems without restricting them toa single vendor.andM;SunRiver's Unix support includes SCO Xenix/Unix System V, 386/ix, and ATandamp;TSystem V Unix.andP;  In addition, SunRiver offers the first multiuser,multitasking support for AutoCAD on the market.andP;  (Drivers for otherapplication software are available as well.)andM;Installing the SunRiver Fiber Optic Station is a breeze: the host adapterfits into a single slot in an ISA- or MCA-bus PC.andP;  Each workstation requiresa dual fiber-optic cable for sending and receiving.andP;  The user manual suppliedwith the SunRiver workstations has detailed installation instructions foreach major operating system, although we think that anyone who understandsDOS subdirectories and can screw together a few parts should have no probleminstalling the multiuser system.andM;If you do happen to run into trouble, SunRiver offers technical supportthrough an 800 number and has a mail-in card repair or replacement service aswell.andP;  The standard warranty period on all SunRiver products is one year.andM;ARCHITECTURE AND FEATURESandM;The architecture of the SunRiver Fiber Optic Station is quite different fromthat found in the AMR and Viewport products.andP;  SunRiver puts the videohardware out at the end of the fiber-optic cable instead of in the bus of thehost system.andM;This configuration gives it several advantages: the cables can be longer andare less susceptible to electrical imbalances, such as ground loops orelectromagnetic interference; also, installation procedures aren't controlledby electrical codes.andP;  In addition, the high speed of the fiber-optic cablesallows you to connect two serial ports and a parallel port at every terminal.andM;SunRiver's bus extension architecture also gives you room for growth.andP;  Sincethe video adapter is close to the terminal, it should be easy for SunRiver toupgrade to 1,024-by-768- and 1,280-by-1,024-pixel displays soon.andM;On the downside, the fiber-optic hardware costs more and, because the videohardware talks to the CPU over a path that includes communications andtranslation of data into different formats, the video response is slower thanin systems with the video in the data bus.andP;  The difference in video responsebetween local and remote hardware architectures isn't subjectively noticeablein actual applications, but it showed up clearly on our tests.andM;The SunRiver Fiber Optic Stations fit nicely into an organization that needsflexible and high-quality color graphics displays.andP;  They are costly comparedwith the competition, but this architecture has strong potential for easygrowth into screen resolutions that the competition will have to work veryhard to match.andM;FACT FILEandM;SunRiver Fiber Optic StationandM;SunRiver Corp., 11500-1 Metric Blvd., #150, Austin, TX 78758; (512)835-8001.andM;List Price: LightAdapter fiber-optic server interface card: for AT bus, $699;for MCA bus, $899.andP;  SunRiver Fiber Optic Station (includes monitor andkeyboard): for 800 by 600 VGA, $1,999; for 640 by 350 EGA, $1,499.andP;  LightCardfor standalone PCs: VGA, $799; EGA, $599.andM;Requires: 386-based host PC, compatible multiuser operating system.andP;  ForHercules monochrome system, compatible monitor and keyboard per workstation.andM;In Short: The SunRiver Fiber Optic Station is a complete and sophisticatedmultiuser graphics solution that can suit most needs.andP;  Using fiber-opticcable for the distribution medium allows the workstation to be up to 1,000feet from the host.andP;  Without doubt, this is the Cadillac of the bunch.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
