You maybe asked who says:   _``Senator, that's a smear!''   _``Mr. Ambassador, Alexandria police are reporting that the nudebody of your secretary was found floating in your swimming pool. ... Care to comment on that?''   _``I was a bachelor until I was 39. I had a lot of women, a lotof women. That was then, this is now. Now _ I'm married.''   _``Remember Chappaquiddick? I want the truth, not a paint job.''   _``I've been through your file, Mancuso. You are a dinosaur. Youare a hangover in a $10 suit.''   If a key word in all this leads you to believe all this is intonight's premiere of ``Mancuso FBI,'' you need not take the test.Go read Shakespeare.   The rest of you, watch this show. It will illustrate how even afine actor named Robert Loggia can be sandbagged by a script thatgives bad a bad name.   Loggia plays FBI agent Nick Mancuso, a raspy-voiced,world-weary, 30-year FBI veteran. He is cynical but unswervinglybelieves in the U.S. Constitution, despite all the powerful,immoral, unethical, scheming, rotten people in Washington,particularly those who jog.   Mancuso-Loggia was wonderful last year in NBC's kinky,sentimental and pretty good ``Favorite Son'' miniseries. That's theone where the president, apparently of NBC, persuaded him not toretire but do his own series.   An unwise move, if tonight's show is typical. Written by two ofthe series's producers, Ken Solarz and ``Mancuso'' creator andexecutive producer Steve Sohmer, it is of value only toclassic-dialogue collectors.   Told in brisk, witless fashion, it concerns a scandal brewingamid Senate confirmation hearings on a nominee for secretary ofdefense. The nominee _ stand back, friends and neighbors _ is aliberal.   He also a former U.S. ambassador to Belgium, a war hero and aheartless seducer of young women before he married at age 39. Heclaims to have given up seducing young women. But there are those,like everyone, who think that were he a Marine, his motto would beSemper Infidelis.   As mentioned in the dialogue, the deceased of tonight's plot isone of his secretaries. She lived in the guest house of the mansionthe nominee and his wife shared. ``She was a good secretary,'' hetells Mancuso.   ``Yeah,'' Mancuso sneers. ``What else was she good at?''   Why is Mancuso on the case? The FBI has been told to ``quietly''re-open its background investigation on the nominee for secretaryof defense.   In Washington, quietly means reliable sources climb to the topof the Capitol Dome and shout, ``HEY, THE FBI HAS RE-OPENED ITSBACKGROUND INVESTIGATION INTO THE LIFE OF THE NOMINEE FOR SECRETARYOF DEFENSE!''   Despite this, Washington's reporters learn something's up here.   Sex, murder and national-security-threat rumors blossom. So dosuch dramatic Old Reliables as Mancuso's ambitious yuppie superior,a smarmy TV anchor lady, and even a shadowy figure who tries todrive over Nick and an apparently key potential witness at night.   The plot twists and turns before going into the Pentagon. Nearthe finale, in what probably will become a weekly event, Mancusopassionately rants about his beloved U.S. Constitution and causes asevere attack of righteousness.   Loggia's acting is good, likewise that of Charles Siebert, whoplays his best friend, a forensics expert. But most of the otherplayers give the impression that, on the whole, they'd rather be inPhiladelphia. You can't blame them. It is difficult to be in aWashington show that is so darn realistic that early on, a keycharacter up and says:   ``Senator, I'm going to ask you a question. Is it liberal tosupport self-determination in Central America? Is it liberal toendorse sanctions against South Africa? Civil rights? Tougherenviromental standards?''</TEXT><TEXT>   ELSEWHERE IN TELEVISION: Peter Allen, the Oscar-winningsongwriter, is coming to TV next fall in a new syndicated versionof the old game show, ``Name That Tune.''
