<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-68-0092 </DOCNO><TEXT>Thin films of the high-temperature superconductor Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-oxide weredeposited by dc magnetron sputtering onto various substrates. Films depositedon (100) MgO substrates achieved zero resistance between 78 and 82.5K depending upon the annealing conditions. The best films were producedwith a quick post-anneal in oxygen at 870 {sup 0}C followed by a sloweranneal in air at the same temperature. The composition of the sputteredfilms was uniform within +- 3% over an area 40 mm in radius, and filmsdeposited at 15 and 40 mm from the center of deposition both exhibitedhigh T/sub c/ transitions.</TEXT></DOC>
