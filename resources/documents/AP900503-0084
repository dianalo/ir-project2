Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., violated Senate rules andfederal law in his financial dealings.   The committee decided in February that there was ``substantialcredible evidence'' of such violations by Durenberger..   It voted Wednesday to begin trial-like public hearings on thematter June 12, the committee said in a press release today.   In the meantime, the panel will continue investigating Senatereimbursement Durenberger received for stays in a condominium hepartly owned, according to the three-paragraph release.   ``We have received the ethics committee's release and lookforward to a final resolution of the issues before the committee,including those involving the condominium,'' Durenberger'sadministrative assistant, Bert McKasy, said in a statement.   ``We share with the committee an interest in getting thesematters resolved in a timely fashion.''   Durenberger's press secretary, Lois West, said the hearing dateamounted to a deadline for settling the case. She said attorneysfor the senator had been talking to the committee about ``how toresolve the issues and how to come to closure.''   Most of the allegations involve a $100,000 deal under whichDurenberger made speeches and accepted fees to promote two books hewrote.   The committee said Durenberger may have:   _ Violated outside income limits by accepting payments forspeeches in 1985 and 1986. Durenberger made numerous appearancesduring that time which he characterized as book promotion speechesfor his publisher, Piranha Press Inc. of Minneapolis.   _ Failed to report on his financial disclosure forms for 1985and 1986 ``the acceptance of reimbursement'' for travel undertakenin connection with the book-publishing deal.   _ Violated a rule by converting a campaign contribution topersonal use, and violated federal election law by failing toreport and deposit the contribution, which he transferred to hispublisher. The check of $5,000 was made out to ``Durenberger forU.S. Senate.''   _ Violated federal law and a Senate Rules Committee regulationprohibiting the commercial use of Senate space. The committee saidhe was paid an honorarium or other fee for six appearances inSenate-controlled areas.   _ Broke the Senate's gift rule when he accepted limousineservice in the Boston area during 1985 and 1986, in connection withpersonal travel to Concord, Mass. Durenberger made a number oftrips to the Boston area in which he combined trips to a marriagecounselor with official appearances.   The committee will decide whether to recommend disciplinaryaction to the full Senate. The possible punishments range from areprimand to expulsion.</TEXT></DOC>
