The most commonmethod of evaluating the subsidy is economic analysis, which evaluatesthe social costs. In this paper we describe Net Energy Analysis (NEA),a method based on thermodynamics, which estimates the energy expended,directly and indirectly, in the physical processes of accessing, refiningand transportation of a physical energy resource. Examples which describedinclude the NCB and H-Coal processes for converting lignite into liquidfuels, and the Mobil process for converting coal-derived methanol intogasoline. An analysis of strip mining of coal is included, for completeness.The results are compared with those for production of liquid fuels fromwood, a renewable resource. 4 refs., 2 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
