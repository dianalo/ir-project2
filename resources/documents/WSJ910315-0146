Thisremarkable transformation, thanks to the policies ofPresident Carlos Salinas de Gortari, has won praise frompublic officials as well as business leaders in the north.But little noticed has been Mexico's positive influence onthe countries south of its border. The nations of CentralAmerica today seek Mexico's advice and cooperation in theirown transitions to more open economies. And one stimulus tosuch discussions is Mexico's push for a free-trade zone withCentral America.   Two weeks ago, Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderonwent to Mexico -- his second visit this year -- to conclude awide range of agreements that will eliminate some tradebarriers to Costa Rican goods, increase air and landtransportation between the two countries and encourageMexican firms to invest in Costa Rica. One major Mexicanfinancial organization -- Serfin -- already announced plansto open a bank in San Jose, and a group of prominent Mexicanexecutives will come to Costa Rica in June to defineinvestment plans. Mr. Calderon also obtained from his hostpromises of support for programs designed to assistindustries in becoming more competitive and to cope withdecreasing levels of protection.</LP><TEXT>   President Calderon has not been the only Central Americanhead of state trying to enhance economic ties with Mexico. Inmid-January, Mr. Salinas invited Mr. Calderon and thepresidents of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaraguato meet during two days in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital ofthe Mexican state of Chiapas. The summit produced a newarrangement concerning the payment of Mexican oil andformalized the plan for a free-trade zone with the Isthmus.   Mexico and Venezuela are the main providers of petroleumto Central America. (Oil imports of the five nations totaledsome $400 million last year.) Pursuant to the 1980 Pact ofSan Jose, importing nations pay 20% of their bill in localcurrency into their own central banks and use such funds indevelopment projects. From now on, according to the newChiapas declaration, Mexico and Venezuela will apply theremaining 80% to finance regional projects through theInteramerican Development Bank. In addition, if internationaloil prices exceed $27 a barrel, the percentage kept by eachcountry in local currency will increase to 30%.   More important, the presidents also committed to create afree-trade zone by the end of 1996, possibly extending toColombia and Venezuela. This is to be accomplished through agradual reduction of tariffs, accompanied by measures toeliminate domestic subsidies and other unfair practices.Mexico's tariffs top off at about 20%, compared with a 40%average top rate in Central America, a substantial differencethat should cushion the shock of competition for protectedindustries.   Although trade with Mexico has been relatively modest sofar, the planned commercial integration holds a hugepotential for Central America. Currently, Central Americanimports from Mexico consist mostly of oil, and exports tothat country are largely foodstuffs and some finishedproducts. Costa Rica, for instance, last year imported $100million of goods -- half of it oil -- and exported to Mexicoonly $15 million worth, a third of which were foodstuffs.   As could be expected, the lowering of protection facesresistance from the region's industrialists who areaccustomed to protective barriers. Local producers wouldprefer duty-free access to foreign markets -- as provided bythe U.S. Caribbean Basin Initiative -- while enjoying tariffprotection at home. However, all but the most rigidprotectionists seem to understand that the price to be paidfor falling trade barriers is more than offset by theopportunities of entering the global economy.   The views of Samuel Yankelewitz, president of the CostaRican Chamber of Industry, are typical. He expresses concernabout &quot;Costa Rican producers becoming overdependent onMexican suppliers of raw materials.&quot; However, he anticipatesthat the elimination of barriers is bound to stimulateCentral American exports, particularly agricultural ones, forwhich there is increasing demand in Mexico. In addition,investment facilities may encourage Mexican firms toestablish operations in Central America.   Central American nations would love to expand open exportmarkets beyond Mexico. But we must be realistic. For example,while Costa Rica has taken the lead in signing a frameworkagreement with Washington, protectionist pressures on CapitolHill and existing limitations might not be so easy toovercome. Moreover, as a top U.S. diplomat told an audiencehere recently, Costa Rica and other small nations will have&quot;to queue up&quot; in order to negotiate a lengthy process inwhich the larger Latin American countries will, no doubt,take precedence. The new trade arrangements with Mexico willbe much faster and less difficult to achieve than bilateralagreements with the U.S. under the Bush initiative.   Of course, by itself access to larger markets does notguarantee expanded exports or sustained economic growth. Tosucceed in the new international environment, localentrepreneurs must be unshackled from oversized statebureaucracies, red tape and high taxes. Costa Rica and itsneighbors have pursued programs in conjunction with theInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank meant tobalance their governments' accounts. But little can beachieved in this regard if, at the same time, taxes areraised to wash away mounting government expenses and fiscaldeficits.   Mexico's current revolution goes far beyond foreign trade.It involves a wide and unprecedented liberalization of theeconomy. Undoubtedly, it has a long stretch ahead, and itseconomic liberalization still needs to be coupled with a moredetermined commitment to political democracy. But the dynamicis right, and it just may help to pull prospective CentralAmerican commercial partners in the direction of openmarkets.   ---   Mr. Daremblum is a Costa Rican business lawyer and acolumnist for La Nation newspaper.</TEXT></DOC>
