It covers a subject of increasingimportance because it is believed that carbon dioxide buildup from combustionof fossil fuels is a worldwide problem that will require both researchand development for its solution. The evolution of carbon dioxide fromfossil fuels, particularly from coal and coal gasification, threatensthe atmospheric balance of the world and the world climate. The bookconsists of 14 chapters discussing catalytic routes for the use and conversionof carbon dioxide as well as some thermodynamic and equilibrium data.Some of the chapters briefly discuss the economic outlook of variousprocess routes. Overall, the book provides a good introduction to a numberof ideas and projects for conversion of carbon dioxide, and the variouschapters contain lengthy references for those wanting more detailed studyof particular routes of carbon dioxide removal.</TEXT></DOC>
