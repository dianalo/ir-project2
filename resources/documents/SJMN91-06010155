The data, hesaid, are probably classified.;    industry watchers predict oil prices coulddouble or triple  from the current level. Gasoline and home heating oil couldjump to over $2 a gallon.;    But some have said prices are likely to dropwithin a few days if reports from the field indicate no serious damage toSaudi fields and no indications of a drawn-out war.;    The volatility of thecrude oil market was illustrated Wednesday after Secretary of State James A.Baker III announced his talks with the Iraqi foreign minister had failed toachieve any agreement on an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.;    Prices on theNew York Mercantile Exchange shot up from $23.35 a barrel before the pressconference to $31, but then dropped back to $26.80 by the time the marketclosed. The closing price was down 37 cents from Tuesday.;    The upward spikein oil prices that followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait is widely blamedfor pushing an already weak U.S. economy into a recession. Before theinvasion, the price was about $20 a barrel; since then, it has reached as highas $40.;    Committee Democrats criticized the Bush administration for lack ofaggressiveness in preparing for the effects of war on the domestic economy.;   &quot;I gather one of the important ingredients in the tool box is prayer,&quot; saidchairman John Dingell, D-Mich. &quot;The pricing situation seems to be . . . basedon 'Trust the Lord.' &quot;;    In the event of war, Easton said the EnergyDepartment would immediately recommend a release of stocks from the StrategicPetroleum Reserve, which contains 586 million barrels of crude oil, enough toreplace Middle East imports for a full year.;    Easton said he did not expectsignificant disruptions in supply. Saudi oil fields and refineries, which havereplaced the bulk of Iraqi and Kuwaiti production, are well-defended and wouldprobably survive a war, he said.;    In addition, said Easton, tankerspresently at sea are holding 100 million barrels of Saudi and Iranian oil.;   &quot;I think supplies are adequate,&quot; said Easton. &quot;If there were any disruptionsin supply, that's precisely what the strategic stocks are for.&quot;;    But Rep.Edward Markey, D-Mass., said plentiful supplies of oil are no comfort topeople who cannot afford another large increase in prices.;    &quot;You're talkingabout shortages, we're talking about prices,&quot; Markey told Easton. &quot;There is alarge disparity between what you are testifying the supply is, and the pricesbeing charged to consumers in America.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  R.A.
