The Sunnyvale council also decided to offer the county $15 million infinancial aid for the extension, an offer financially pressed Mountain Viewwould have a tough time matching.;    Mountain View spokeswoman Diane McNuttsaid Sunnyvale's move amounted to blackmail, and at least one member ofSunnyvale's city council agreed.;    &quot;The question is, is Sunnyvale trying tobuy the light rail?&quot; asked Mountain View Mayor Arthur Takahara. &quot;I feel it'sunfortunate that Sunnyvale is trying to come up with obstacles. The success ofSanta Clara County mass transportation is based on regional cooperation. Whatit seems like they're saying is if Sunnyvale is not chosen, (light rail)basically should not go through their city.&quot;;    Sunnyvale Councilman StanKawcynski, the lone opposition to saddling the county with the more costlyalternative if Mountain View is chosen, called the recommendations &quot;blackmailand ransom-holding.&quot;;    But David Vossbrink, Sunnyvale's community'srelations officer, said that if Mountain View wins the project, the morecostly route would be needed to reduce noise and traffic problems from lightrail for the city's residents.;    &quot;If the light rail bypasses downtownSunnyvale, the trade-off would not be worth it,&quot; Vossbrink said. &quot;If it goesto Mountain View, it wouldn't be worth the inconvenience to our residents.&quot;;   He also took issue with the accusation of blackmail.;    &quot; 'Blackmail' is toostrong a word. It implies covert and unethical business practices and hasloaded implications. We shouldn't have to bear the costs of a system thatdoesn't go through us.;    &quot;What we're saying is that if you come through us,there are levels of cooperation. You'll have the benefit of the red carpettreatment. If you don't, we have to do what is professionally required, andthat is to protect our citizens and our community,&quot; Vossbrink said.;   Sunnyvale's decision advances in the form of a recommendation to the countyboard of supervisors' Tasman Corridor Project Joint Policy Subcommittee onJuly 18, and on July 23 to the board itself, which will make the finaldecision on the light-rail route.;    Current plans are for the light-railsystem to be completed in 1997, and the county has the authority to move aheadwith the project even if a city objects.;    Andy Arias, who is in charge ofthe Tasman Corridor Project, said the county's decision ultimately will bebased on such factors as cost, potential ridership and effects on thecommunity.;    IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The Tasman Corridor Project Joint PolicySubcommittee meets July 18 at 2:30 p.m. in the board of supervisors chambersat the County Administration Building, 70 W. Hedding St., San Jose. The SantaClara County Board of Supervisors will meet at 9 a.m. July 23.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  THERESA VILORIA, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910711  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; MAP  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  575  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday July 11, 199100193080,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
