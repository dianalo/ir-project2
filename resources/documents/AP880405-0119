Mohammed Hamadi was charged in February with murder, hijacking,hostage-taking and other crimes stemming from the June 1985hijacking of a TWA jetliner to Beirut. U.S. Navy diver RobertStethem was killed during the hijacking and 39 Americans were heldhostage for 17 days.   Frankfurt state court spokesman Falk Thomas said the exact dateof the trial's opening remained to be set but that it was expectedat the end of next month. He said the court will hold hearingsthree times a week.   Thomas spoke to reporters at the Duesseldorf trial of AbbasHamadi, Mohammed Hamadi's older brother, who is accused ofmasterminding the kidnapping of two West Germans in a bid to forcethe West German government to release Mohammed.   Mohammed Hamadi, a 23-year-old Lebanese Shiite Moslem, wasarrested at Frankfurt airport Jan. 13, 1987, when a customs agentdiscovered liquid explosives in his luggage.   The United States requested Mohammed Hamadi's extraditionshortly after his arrest to answer charges of murder and air piracy.   The West German government, reportedly fearing for the lives ofthe two West German hostages, rejected the extradition demand lastJune and instead pledged to try Hamadi in this country.   Abbas Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport two weeks afterhis brother's arrest.   At the trial of Abbas Hamadi on Tuesday, prosecutor HartmutReibold asked that the accused be sentenced to two years and threemonths on the explosives charges he is being tried on.   In his closing arguments, Reibold alleged that Abbas and hisbrother had smuggled a potent liquid explosive, methylnitrate, fromBeirut to West Germany at the beginning of 1987. The explosive wasfound buried in a field not far from the French border after AbbasHamadi's arrest.   Abbas Hamadi, 29, is also charged with masterminding thekidnapping of West German businessmen Rudolf Cordes and AlfredSchmidt to try to force the West German government to releaseMohammed Hamadi. Schmidt was released by his captors in Septemberin a ``gesture of good will,'' while Cordes remains in captivity.   The verdict in Abbas Hamadi's trial is expected on April 19.</TEXT></DOC>
