Sunbelt National, which was closed by banking regulators Thursday, had assets of $11.2 million and held deposits of $11.1 million in 3,500 accounts -- including $32,000 in 21 accounts that exceed the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor.    The FDIC will make an advance payment to the holders of the uninsured deposits equal to 35% of their uncovered claims. That figure reflects the portion of the claims against the bank that the agency believes the bank's assets will cover. If, in liquidating the assets, the FDIC generates more than the estimate, the uninsured depositors will share the excess proportionately with other creditors. If the sale yields less, the FDIC will absorb the difference.    The FDIC said it decided to pay off the deposits because it received no adequate bids to buy the failed bank.    The number of bank failures this year stands at 21. </TEXT></DOC>
