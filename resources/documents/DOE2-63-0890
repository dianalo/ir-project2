<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-63-0890 </DOCNO><TEXT>WATSUN is a computer program, written in Fortran IV, designed to testthe economic and technical feasibility of solar space heating systems.The program is capable of simulating three types of systems: liquid-basewith short-term storage; air-base with short term storage; and liquid-basewith long-term seasonal storage. WATSUN is modular in nature, each moduleconsisting of a system model rather than a component model (except foran optional flat plate collector model). Contained within WATSUN aresubroutines which evaluate the life-cycle cost of the system; it canalso evaluate the cost of a conventional system, for comparison. Theprogram evaulates a range of system sizes and displays the results, allowingthe designer to select the system most suitable to meet individual requirements.The underlying assumption contained within WATSUN is that over a givenhour, the ambient temperature, parameters are constant; this dramaticallyreduces computation costs. Furthermore, quantities which are independentof the system size are calculated initially and then stored for use eachtime the collector area or storage volume is changed and the system re-evaluated.This document serves as a user manual and presents information on thesystem models, inputting of data, printed data output, and a programlisting. 9 refs., 6 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
