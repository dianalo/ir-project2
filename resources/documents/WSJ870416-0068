Jefferies, former chairman of Jefferies Group Inc., is scheduled to waive indictment and plead guilty today to two felony counts of securities fraud in federal court, according to a court spokesman.    Three prominent Wall Street takeover speculators indicted on insider-trading charges last week also are scheduled to enter pleas today in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Lawyers for Robert Freeman, head of arbitrage and a partner at Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., Richard Wigton, the currently suspended head of arbitrage and over-the-counter trading at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., and Timothy L. Tabor, a former arbitrager at Kidder Peabody, have said their clients will plead innocent. If they do, their cases will be assigned at random to a judge who will preside over all further proceedings.    Last month, Mr. Jefferies, 56 years old, settled related charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC had charged that he engaged in multiple violations of securities laws in connection with a stock parking scheme with Ivan F. Boesky, and in a separate scheme involving a public offering of Fireman's Fund Corp. stock.    As part of the settlement, Mr. Jefferies resigned as chairman of Jefferies Group, was barred from the securities industry for at least five years and is cooperating fully in the government's insider-trading investigation.    Morris E. Lasker is the federal judge scheduled to hear Mr. Jefferies' plea and later sentence him. Judge Lasker has a reputation among criminal defense lawyers as one of the most compassionate, and hence one of the most lenient, of the federal judges in the Southern District of New York. </TEXT></DOC>
