On the barren waste near Moshe Shakah's office at Sde Boker inthe Negev desert, pine, carob and pistachio trees grow withoutirrigation in an area that averages only 3{ inches of rain a year.The reason, Shahak says, is a grayish, segmented, armor-platedrelative of the wood louse known as an isopod.   The species Shahak is studying _ Helilepistus realuluri _ has aname longer than its .7-inch-long body.   ``The isopod has two qualities you'd never expect to find in thedesert,'' says Shahak, a Ben Gurion University desert ecologyspecialist who has studied the isopods since 1972. ``Its rate ofwater loss is very high and it has an inflexible life routine.''   To survive, isopod families stick together and workcooperatively, Shahak says. ``They formed the first kibbutzim inthe Negev.''   In order to survive the summer, when temperatures soar over 104degrees, the isopods must find soil with a moisture content of 6percent to 10 percent. The family _ an adult male and female and upto 90 offspring _ digs a tunnel up to 27 inches deep, knowingintuitively where the moisture content of the soil will be highenough to sustain them, Shahak says.   As they burrow, the isopods leave a tell-tale mound of chewed-upsoil above ground, indicating their presence and thus the presenceof life-sustaining soil under the hard desert surface, he says.   Shahak took soil readings to determine the relative density ofisopod habitation and found a direct correlation between the numberof isopods and the presence of moisture in the soil.   Aharon Yair, a Hebrew University geomorphologist, did hydrolicexaminations of the soil that verified Shahak's research andcontradicted current belief on where to find moisture in the desert.   Desert specialists had believed that the soil with the highestwater content was found at the bottom of desert valley beds. Yair'sreadings showed that isopods dig their holes halfway down theslopes of the desert hills, at the point where the rock ends andthe soil begins, Shahak says.   Five years ago, he planted five species of trees based on thosereadings; so far, they are flourishing, he said.   Dr Eliyahu Ravitz, an expert on desert research at HebrewUniversity's Faculty of Agriculture, says that while the findingsare interesting, moisture was not the only element that contributedto soil's fertility, and that most trees need soil with at least 20percent water content, far more than the 6 percent to 10 percentneeded by the isopods.   Shahak said there appeared to be enough nitrogen, phosphorus andother elements necessary to sustain the growth of trees in additionto water. He said he increased the moisture in the areas pinpointedby the isopods by digging holes to trap rainwater not normallyabsorbed by the baked earth.   Shahak believes his findings could help solve the severe foodshortages caused by extended periods of drought in Ethiopia andother African nations.   ``If it works here, it will work in Africa too,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for July 14</NOTE></DOC>
