In the past year, banks have been reluctant to lower theprime rate, even after the Fed eased the federal funds rate,because of sagging profit margins. But several factors,including better-than-expected third-quarter earnings at manybanks, are likely to make bankers more receptive to cuttingthe prime, economists say. Also, banks are under strongpressure from the Bush administration to take steps tostimulate the economy.</LP><TEXT>   Still, the cut by First Fidelity, a big New Jersey bankholding company, puzzled some bankers because it came beforethe Fed took any action on the federal funds rate.   &quot;It's an anticipatory adjustment, which probably will beproved to be the right adjustment,&quot; said William Sullivan, amoney market economist for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. He saidthere &quot;is a strong possibility the Fed will cut the federalfunds rate before long.&quot; By doing so, the central bank makesit cheaper for banks to borrow fed funds from each other,giving them reason to lower their lending rates to borrowers.   Some banks are taking a wait and see attitude. RichardBoyle, vice chairman of Chase Manhattan Corp., said: &quot;I'mpuzzled by First Fidelity's move. I don't see any change inthe rates that would effect the prime since we last changedon September 13.&quot;   Even if the Fed cuts the fed funds rate, a reduction inthe prime is not a sure thing, he said. &quot;We'd have todetermine if low rates are sustainable,&quot; he said.   First Fidelity's action came on what economist RussellSheldon of Mellon Bank Corp. called a &quot;wild day&quot; in terms ofeconomic signals. He cited the sharp decline in consumerconfidence reported by the Conference Board to levels reachedduring the recent recession. Other economists noted how thestage also was set yesterday for a stimulus to lending whenGross National Product growth for the third quarter indicatedmomentum had slowed in September.   &quot;The odds are quite high that the fed funds rate and theprime rate will be cut,&quot; said Neal Soss, chief economist forFirst Boston Corp. He added that the financial marketssignaled yesterday that &quot;a further cut in rates would bewelcome.&quot;   Banks recently have waited for the Fed to cut both the fedfunds rate and discount rate before lowering the prime,although a cut in the discount rate is not expected now.Economists generally expect the fed funds rate, currently5.25%, to be cut 1/4 percentage point, although they didn'trule out a 1/2 percentage point cut. The discount rate iswhat the Fed charges member banks for loans.   A cut in the prime would directly affect small tomedium-sized business borrowers and consumers who seek newmortgages that are priced off the prime rate. Equally, a cutin the fed funds rate would also trigger cuts in othershort-term rates which would reduce costs for any consumer orbusiness loan that adjusts periodically to changes in rates.   Banks may follow a cut in the fed funds rate because theprofit margin between fed funds and the prime rate &quot;is prettysatisfactory now,&quot; said Mr. Sheldon of Mellon Bank. For mostof this year, they were widening that spread by not loweringlending rates each time the fed funds rate was cut as the Fedmoved to stimulate the economy.   Mr. Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds added that Fed datain recent weeks show that despite the sluggish economy therehas been some pickup in commercial and industrial loans forthe first time this year. Banks &quot;may be entering somewhatmore competitive conditions,&quot; and will respond by loweringthe prime rate, he said.   Also, in response to criticism that they are inducing acredit crunch by not lending to creditworthy businesses,banks have said weak loan demand is primarily to blame. A cutin the prime rate would be the politically correct thing todo, showing they are doing their part to stimulate theeconomy.   First Fidelity is not known for leading the bankingindustry in changing the prime. One banker speculated thatFirst Fidelity's Chairman Anthony Terraciano might be jumpingthe gun on a prime rate move to signal to middle marketcustomers in New Jersey and Connecticut that his bank wantsto book more loans, in contrast to the sheepish attitude ofsome competitors.</TEXT></DOC>
