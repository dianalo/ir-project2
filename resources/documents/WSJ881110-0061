Mr. Bush also made clear that he intends to inject a large dose of new blood into his administration by replacing many Reagan administration officials with his own appointees. &quot;As I have stated over the campaign, I think there is something to be said for reinvigorating the process with new people,&quot; he said.    In a smooth news conference the morning after he soundly defeated Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Mr. Bush talked comfortably about his plans to deal with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, with whom he exchanged communications yesterday.    He didn't deviate from the positions he took during his campaign but did alter his tone. He was more conciliatory to Democrats and even to liberals, whom he had regularly bashed. &quot;I want to be president of all the people,&quot; he said.    The tenor of his words was, at least in part, a matter of necessity. Democrats still control both chambers of Congress, with slightly larger majorities. Mr. Bush will also face a persistently harsh critic in the Senate's Republican leader, Robert Dole of Kansas. Mr. Bush said he would like to have a meeting with his former rival for the GOP nomination.    Mr. Bush didn't repeat the uncompromising language that had characterized his opposition to tax increases during the campaign, when he repeatedly told doubters of his no-tax-rise pledge to &quot;read my lips.&quot; But he didn't budge on the substance of that issue, insisting that Americans &quot;must have understood&quot; his opposition to tax increases &quot;when they voted in rather large numbers for my candidacy.&quot;    He also continued to boost the idea of a &quot;flexible freeze&quot; to cut the deficit, a plan that would hold the growth in federal expenditures to the projected inflation rate. &quot;I will just push for it in the Congress as best I can,&quot; he said.    Mr. Bush tacitly acknowledged that his margin of victory wasn't so big -- and his quest to bring Republicans into Congress wasn't successful enough -- for him to claim some clear public mandate. &quot;I don't know whether I want to use the word 'mandate,'&quot; he said. Instead, he chose to call his victory &quot;a big win.&quot;    Prior to the news conference he told reporters that dealing with a Democratic Congress is one of the &quot;problems&quot; that he will face &quot;everywhere&quot; he turns as president.    In addition to picking former Treasury Secretary Baker as secretary of state, Mr. Bush named his chief of staff, Craig Fuller, and his campaign's pollster, Robert Teeter, as co-directors of the team that will direct the transition to the new administration.    He also gave jobs to two longtime advisers: He named C. Boyden Gray as his legal adviser both in the transition and in the White House. And he picked Chase Untermeyer, who has run a small office that has been preparing for the transition, to be personnel director in both the transition and the White House.    Mr. Bush said he would treat Vice President Dan Quayle the same way President Reagan treated him, including ensuring that he receives full, regular intelligence briefings and sees sensitive documents.    Gov. Dukakis, at a farewell appearance before the national press in Boston yesterday, appeared relaxed, a demeanor that often eluded him on the presidential campaign trail. He told reporters that Democratic victories in gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races prove that the party can win the critical South and West and can successfully appeal to blacks as well as so-called Reagan Democrats, even though his campaign fell short of those goals.    &quot;I think if you are able to get that agenda and communicate it effectively to the people you are trying to represent they will respond in a very strong way,&quot; he said. &quot;These national campaigns will have to do a better job of making clear these are the kinds of issues that bring us together.&quot;    Meanwhile, in an interview, the Rev. Jesse Jackson complained that &quot;the black vote did not get the attention it deserved in terms of its numbers.&quot; And he added that &quot;if I had not covered more miles than the ticket did itself, {the Dukakis vote} would have been even lower.&quot; But he said that he has &quot;given no consideration at all&quot; to another presidential run and that comment at this time would be &quot;very premature.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
