A staffof 970 worked in the WBK mining schools, technical and scientific institutes,and in the German Mining Museum. 200 of these are scientists and scientificexperts, and 250 are teachers. The economic problems of the mining industryhave affected the WBK. There are less students than in the years before,and some services, e.g. exploration, had to be cut. Innovations madein 1987 will reduce costs and enhance safety in mining. Technical know-howdeveloped on the mining sector will be transferred to other industrialbranches. Environmental protection has a key role in WBK activities.</TEXT></DOC>
