SeaseStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/07/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CANDA FREST EUROP JAPAN FORGNMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX) </IN><TEXT>   Fifteen months after the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France agreed to work together to reduce the value of the U.S. dollar and reverse the burgeoning American trade deficit, the deficit still shows few signs of narrowing very much.    The dollar has indeed weakened against the currencies of Japan and the major West European nations attending the so-called G-5 meeting in September 1985. But so far, that hasn't stopped the influx of products from them or helped American manufacturers lift exports. Worse, the dollar has fallen little or not at all against the currencies of a dozen or so other nations that are combining their dollar-linked currencies with other competitive advantages to flood the U.S. with imports.    The Reagan administration is criticizing U.S. industry for failing to exploit the weak dollar in selling to world markets. Richard G. Darman, the deputy secretary of the Treasury, accuses the nation's big companies of being &quot;bloated, risk-averse, inefficient and unimaginative.&quot; And Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker warned recently that &quot;the great question is whether management can and will seek out and exploit the new competitive opportunities here and abroad made possible by better-aligned exchange rates.&quot;    But a growing number of executives term the criticism unfair because the currency realignments haven't aided them at all in competing against some major competitors, including those in such nations as Canada, Taiwan, South Korea and Brazil.    &quot;People in the administration are talking themselves into believing the dollar is really down, while we're being wiped out by imports,&quot; says Fawn Evenson, a vice president of the Footwear Industries of America, a trade group. &quot;If it isn't Italian shoes killing us, it's Taiwanese shoes.&quot;    One problem is simply trying to decide how to measure the dollar's value. The popular indexes, such as those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board or Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., average the dollar's value against the currencies of America's traditional trading partners, such as Japan and large West European nations. Not surprisingly, such indexes show a sharp decline in the dollar since its peak in early 1985. The Fed's index has the dollar down nearly 32%, and Morgan Guaranty's index is down about 24%.    But other economists argue that such limited measures ignore the rapidly growing U.S. trade with newly industrialized countries in Asia and Latin America, where currencies often are linked to the dollar. Donald Straszheim, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch, says that when the dollar is measured against the currencies of the 25 countries from which the U.S. imports the most merchandise, the greenback has edged down only 9.1%. And Michael Cox, an economist at the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, calculates that when averaged against the currencies of all U.S. trading partners, the dollar is down a bare 6.4% from its 1985 peak.    &quot;People have taken the dollar's drop against the yen and blown it up in their minds to be the whole universe,&quot; Mr. Straszheim says. &quot;But when you look at the total trade picture, the dollar is down a whole lot less than most people think. At some point, it's going to become a major issue.&quot;    If so, the question will be what can be done about it. Japan's economy already is reeling from the suddenly stronger yen, and West European nations, long burdened with high unemployment, aren't likely to do much more to impede their own exports. Many developing countries enjoying new-found competitive advantages in U.S. markets are heavily in debt; some are resisting U.S. entreaties to strengthen their currencies and are offering only token changes. A look at what has happened to the currencies and trade flows between the U.S. and the five nations with which it is running the largest trade deficits suggests how complex the trade situation is.    Canada   On weekdays, the bridge and tunnel linking Detroit with Windsor, Ontario, are filled with trucks hauling industrial products such as steel and auto parts in both directions. On weekends, they are filled with Americans heading to Canada to buy bargain-priced furs, silverware, china and even cars.    The industrial traffic across the Detroit River illustrates how integrated the U.S. and Canadian economies have become. The two countries, exchanging some $150 billion in merchandise annually, are each other's biggest trading partners. But the weekend consumer traffic shows why many American manufacturers are worried. Unlike the currencies of America's other traditional trading partners, the Canadian dollar has been weakening against the U.S. dollar, making Canadian products more attractive to Americans and widening the U.S. trade deficit with Canada to $18.8 billion in the first nine months of 1986 from $16.5 billion a year earlier.    &quot;It would help us immensely if the Canadian dollar would strengthen some,&quot; says Richard Rosenberg, vice president of Bassett Furniture Co. He blames the Canadian currency for a 16% increase in U.S. imports of Canadian furniture in the 1986 first half.    To some extent, the Canadians agree. &quot;The weak Canadian dollar is the major factor behind our successes&quot; in the U.S. market, concedes George Sinclair, executive vice president for the Ontario Furniture Manufacturers' Association. But he argues that it offsets the advantage of a big pool of low-cost labor available to furniture manufacturers in the Southeastern U.S. Other Canadians say they are hurt by their country's big overall trade deficit and relatively high inflation.    U.S. government officials, in turn, seem to see some truth in this. Last May, Treasury Secretary James Baker told a congressional committee that &quot;the lack of appreciation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar really reflects the market's assessment of the relative attractiveness of those currencies.&quot;    In any event, Canadians are cool to the idea of strengthening their currency to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with Canada. They accuse the U.S. of conveniently ignoring a big deficit in services that Canada runs with the U.S.    &quot;U.S. movies, franchise businesses and publishing all enjoy their success in Canada,&quot; says William Mackness, the chief economist of Bank of Nova Scotia. &quot;If they want to continue to enjoy it, then it stands to reason that we need to run a surplus in merchandise.&quot;    Taiwan   Taiwan may turn out to be the big villain in the U.S. trade problems unless its currency strengthens sharply and soon. Taiwan's estimated U.S. trade surplus of nearly $14 billion last year, up from $11.2 billion in 1985, is worrisome enough. But unlike many industrializing countries, which need foreign exchange to pay off huge borrowings, Taiwan has only negligible debt. Instead, it has been amassing big foreign-exchange reserves, estimated by some experts to exceed $40 billion and second only to West Germany's.    That convinces many economists that Taiwan's dollar is grossly undervalued. The U.S. has warned Taiwanese officials to strengthen their currency, and the Taiwan dollar has been climbing recently. Yesterday, it traded at $0.028169, up only 14% from September 1985.    &quot;From a planning standpoint, we're expecting to see some dramatic pressure to make Taiwan less competitive,&quot; says Scott Rodgers, the vice president of sales and marketing for Pro Kennex, a Taiwanese maker of sporting goods. &quot;The implication is that there's going to be a pretty drastic change in currency values.&quot;    One reason Taiwan wasn't targeted earlier for U.S. pressure to strengthen its currency is that the bustling island nation has maintained a low profile in America's trade woes. Pro Kennex is a rarity among Taiwanese companies -- a manufacturer with a recognizable brand name. Many of Taiwan's exports to the U.S. come from relatively small factories rather than big, well-known conglomerates.    Moreover, most of its consumer-goods exports to the U.S. are sold under American brand names such as Wilson athletic equipment and Schwinn bicycles. American companies with factories or suppliers in Taiwan haven't any incentive to press for a stronger Taiwanese dollar.    &quot;From a purely nationalistic point of view, we would much prefer to manufacture in the U.S.,&quot; says Jack Murray, the chairman of Wilson Sporting Goods, &quot;but we've got to go where we can be competitive.&quot;    And not only American companies are attracted by Taiwan's weak currency. To escape the rising value of the yen, many Japanese manufacturers are streaming to Taiwan. A Matsushita radio sold in the U.S. may increase Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. rather than Japan's.    In any event, American manufacturers competing against Taiwanese products aren't very confident about getting relief even if the Taiwanese dollar climbs.    &quot;It would have to be one hell of a rise, maybe 300%,&quot; says Bassett Furniture's Mr. Rosenberg. He argues that low labor costs and an extremely favorable tax structure are Taiwan's real advantages.    South Korea   Perhaps more than any other country, South Korea is benefiting from Japan's strong yen. Korea's big conglomerates, well staffed with engineers and willing, low-paid workers, have used the Korean won's close link with the dollar to fill much of the gap abandoned by Japanese moving into more sophisticated, expensive markets in the U.S. Hyundai's little Excel sedan, videocassette recorders from Samsung and Goldstar, and personal computers from Daewoo have become price leaders in their U.S. markets.    &quot;No one ever dreamed of this kind of chance&quot; to compete against Japan, says Park Byung-mun, the general manager of planning and research at Korea's Samsung Electronics.    Although many Koreans are proud of their economic success, others worry that Korea will be lumped together with Taiwan in discussions of countries that should try to trim their U.S. trade surpluses.    &quot;That's a big mistake that everyone is making,&quot; says Il Sakong, South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan's economic secretary. &quot;We're the fourth-largest debtor in the world. How can you expect us to pay our debts if we don't export?&quot;    Still, the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea last year was at least $7 billion, wider than the $4.8 billion of 1985. And the South Korean won has risen only about 3.5% since September 1985. What's more, the conglomerates' big outlays to establish their names in the U.S. have made Korean companies much more visible in the U.S. than Taiwanese concerns are. That's irritating some American rivals.    &quot;Koreans are tremendous counterfeiters,&quot; charges Howard Bruns, the executive director of the Sporting Goods Manufacturers' Association. He contends that the Koreans unfairly duplicate American-made sporting goods and sell them &quot;for 10 cents on the dollar.&quot;    Other industries fear that they, too, will soon feel Korean competition. &quot;Hyundai has built four mammoth plants to supply hotel furniture,&quot; says Jerry Epperson, a furniture analyst with Wheat, First Securities. &quot;If they ever unleash that capacity on the U.S., domestic manufacturers will be in big trouble.&quot;    Although the U.S. government is quietly pressing South Korea to push the won upward, many economists doubt that the U.S. will make the currency a big issue.    &quot;Korea is something of a showcase capitalist country on the Pacific rim, and a lot of people want to see that showcase succeed,&quot; says Merrill Lynch's Mr. Straszheim. &quot;It isn't likely that we're going to try to force them to raise the won to the extent that it hurts Korea.&quot;    Japan   Even when a currency strengthens, trade flows don't necessarily shift. To the extent that the G-5 agreement was supposed to drive down the dollar against the yen, it has succeeded. Yesterday, the dollar bought 158.7 yen, a 34% plunge from September 1985. However, the yen's strength hasn't reduced the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Through the first nine months of 1986, the deficit totaled $43.9 billion, against $43.8 billion in all 1985.    One reason the currency shift hasn't been very effective is that Japanese companies aren't responding to the yen's strength in the way that many Americans anticipated. Defending their U.S. market shares, the Japanese aren't raising prices to fully reflect the stronger yen. A 1987 Toyota Corolla, for instance, retails for $8,178, up 14% from $7,148 for a 1986 model. Sony puts the average price increase for products it makes in Japan at 18%.    Even those increases have been offset by other factors. U.S. auto makers diluted the competitive effect of higher Japanese prices by raising their own prices to lift profits rather than gain market share. And Sony compensates for its higher prices by pushing innovative products, such as compact disk players and 8-mm videocassette recorders and cameras.    Over the short term, higher prices for Japanese goods are having the seemingly perverse effect of widening the U.S. deficit with Japan. This phenomenon, known to economists as the J-curve, is illustrated by the climbing value of motor vehicles and parts imported from Japan. Although voluntary restrictions limit the number of cars that Japanese producers can sell here, the value of those cars and parts rose some 21% to about $30 billion last year from $23 billion in 1985.    Still, many economists believe that ultimately the strong yen will help shrink the U.S. deficit with Japan. The portion of the yen's rise that Japanese companies don't pass along to American consumers is being absorbed in slimmer profits and cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and salary reductions. Shoichiro Toyoda, Toyota Motor's president, warned recently that &quot;if the current yen-dollar exchange continues, we will have to face a massive reduction in profit in the current fiscal year.&quot; Toyota's archrival, Nissan Motor, already has slipped into the red.    West Germany   Like the yen, West Germany's currency has strengthened. Yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.92 marks, a 32% drop since the G-5 meeting. Also like the U.S. trade deficit with Japan, the deficit with Germany is still growing. Through the first nine months of 1986, it totaled $11.4 billion, exceeding the record $10.6 billion in all 1985.    In many ways, the German response to the stronger mark resembles the Japanese strategy: holding down price increases in the U.S. while taking lower profits. For example, a Volkswagen Golf sedan cost $7,190 in 1985 and runs $8,190 now. Sales remain steady, while profits are down. In addition, sales of many German goods, like those from Japan, haven't shown much price sensitivity. That's largely due to product sophistication and consumer perception of high quality, and the impact of that combination &quot;in advanced goods like automobiles and machine tools is truly huge,&quot; says Michael Porter, a Harvard Business School professor.    In the past year, Mercedes-Benz, for example, has introduced new models that have driven its average U.S. sale price up 23%, to $43,000 from $35,000. Yet the luxury-auto maker's biggest problem is getting enough cars, says a spokesman, who notes that Mercedes sold 86,903 cars in 1985 and estimates its 1986 sales at 93,000. Machine tools cut a similar pattern.    &quot;The Japanese build the Honda and Toyota equivalents of machine tools while the Germans build the Mercedes and Porsches,&quot; says Burk Kalweit, senior economist for the National Association of Machine Tool Builders. &quot;The Germans aren't selling on price; they're selling on engineering and features.&quot;    And a weak dollar doesn't always penalize a foreign competitor. The German chemical industry, for example, pays for more than half its oil-based feedstock in dollars. Thus, many of its raw-materials costs are declining along with the dollar, and German chemical sales in the U.S., through last August, rose 18% from a year earlier to $1.22 billion. All around the world, industries that buy raw materials priced in dollars are similarly benefiting.    ---        The Largest U.S. Bilateral-Trade Deficits                              U.S. Dollar                              Change               -Deficit-      Vs.
