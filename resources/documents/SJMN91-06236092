This simply is not true.The term &quot;dismissed&quot; is usually reserved in the university for situations inwhich the faculty member is terminated for cause -- because of poorperformance or some other dismissible offense.;   Your editorial the next daycontinues the confusion. Although you did not use the term &quot;dismissed&quot; in thispiece, you did say &quot;San Jose State is laying off 300 teachers.&quot; Except inreference to one special class of temporary faculty who are entitled bycontract to continue in the employ of the university for the life of thecurrent contract, this statement is also false.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  'DISMISSALS' AND 'LAYOFFS' BELIE SJS ACTION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     Temporary faculty, because they are temporary, are appointed for specificperiods of time. Usually, they are appointed for an academic year, but in somecases their appointments are limited to one semester. It is nonsense to say atemporary faculty member who has not been reappointed after serving his or herappointed term has been laid off.;   What is new about the current situationis that we have lost over 150 positions (one position generates fivethree-unit classes when invested in part-time temporary faculty) and we areseverely limited in our ability to appoint or reappoint, either new or formerfaculty.;   Using misleading terms generates misunderstanding and createsexpectations that are not realistic. I know it is far more interesting, andprobably more useful to certain interests, to say a large number of peoplewere dismissed or laid off. But this is not what happened, and I think theMercury News has an obligation to &quot;tell it like it is.&quot;;   -- David H.Elliott; Professor and Chair; Communication Studies; San Jose State University  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910823  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  298  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, August 23, 199100236092,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
