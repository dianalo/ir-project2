Of 31 womenwith a normal intrauterine pregnancy, a gestational sac was identifiedin all 24 cases when the hCG level was above 1,000 mIU/ml(2d InternationalStandard), in four of five cases when the hCG level was 500-1,000 mIU/ml,and none of two cases when the hCG level was below 500 mIU/ml. In comparison,ectopic gestations were characterized by hCG levels above 1,000 mIU/mlin 60% of cases, and 500-1,000 mIU/ml in 20% of cases. The authors concludethat the gestational sac is visualized at a lower hCG threshold on endovaginalUS than on transabdominal US; this information can help the physicianidentify many complicated pregnancies.</TEXT></DOC>
