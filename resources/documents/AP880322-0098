The testimony came as the Senate Foreign Relations Committeebegan working on the final details of the pact after two months oftestimony on the treaty signed Dec. 8 by President Reagan andSoviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   The Foreign Relations Committee is reviewing the pact. SenateDemocratic leaders say they expect the treaty will be approved bythe full chamber next month.   Leaders of both parties have predicted the final tally will show88 to 90 votes for the treaty, far more than the 67 needed forratification.   As part of the Senate review, the Intelligence Committee lookedat American ability to monitor Soviet compliance through a varietyof means including on-site ground inspection and satellites.   ``The intelligence community will be able to monitor thedrawdown and elimination of declared Soviet missile launchers andassociated equipment with great certainty,'' said the report, whichwas unanimously approved by the committee.   But Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the IntelligenceCommittee, told the Foreign Relations Committee that more moneyneeds to be spent to be sure of finding Soviet attempts to cheat ona separate treaty making deep cuts in long-range atomic weapons.That prospective treaty is now being worked on by American andSoviet negotiators.   ``The interests of the United States are served by effective,verifiable limitations on nuclear weapons,'' said Boren. ``Indeed,such limitations must continue to be pursued vigorously long afterthe issue of ratification of the (medium-range missile) treaty hasbeen been resolved.''   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, vice chairman of the IntelligenceCommittee, warned the foreign relations panel that ``noverification and monitoring regime can be absolutely perfect.''   Despite the expected outcome, the pact has come under fire fromboth Democrats and conservative Republicans.   Democrats, led by Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., are consideringattaching a legal condition to the treaty which provides that theinterpretation given by administration officials during treatyhearings is binding on future administrations.   Democratic officials were working late Monday to agree on sometype of language, but no final proposal had been approved,according to congressional sources speaking on condition ofanonymity.   The proposal arises from the ongoing dispute between the Reaganadministration and congressional Democrats over Reagan's assertionthat he has the legal right unilaterally to change the U.S.interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   That change would allow some tests of Reagan's Star Warsanti-missile defense system, but congressional Democrats haveargued that any alteration in how a treaty is interpreted shouldfirst be approved by the Senate.   The White House told congressional Democrats last week itopposed the Democratic-backed effort to attach a condition to thetreaty because the condition would require the executive branch toadhere to every statement made by administration officials duringthe hearings, ``no matter how trivial.''   The conservative opposition is led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee.   Helms has claimed that the administration made``misrepresentations'' about the effect of the treaty, a chargethat was flatly denied by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.   Shultz, who was both the first and last administration witnessto testify to the Foreign Relations panel, said the treaty ``standson its merits'' and ``should not be made a vehicle for statementson other issues.''   Shultz and other administration officials have consistentlyurged the Senate to avoid so-called ``killer amendments'' thatcould force a reopening of negotiations with the Soviet Union.   Administration officials have also argued that rejection of thetreaty would be a deep blow to U.S. prestige and power in the16-member NATO alliance.   One condition which will be opposed is being offered by Sen.Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.   The amendment will require Reagan to ``reaffirm to the SovietUnion the importance Americans place on human rights andfundamental freedoms in the achievement of lasting peace amongnations.''</TEXT></DOC>
