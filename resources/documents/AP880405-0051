If there are no last-minute snags, the release could come ``inthe next few days,'' one of the sources said.   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry would not comment on thereport. British and Lebanese newspapers also have reported thatrepresentatives of France and Iran have been meeting secretly towork out a hostage deal.   The two sources in Damascus declined to be identified but haveproved reliable on hostage matters in the past. They said a specialenvoy of the French government spent two days negotiating with thehostage takers in their stronghold in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.   The sources said the envoy, Alexandre Stefani, an associate ofFrench Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, and an unidentifiedLebanese businessman, returned to Damascus on Monday through acheckpoint on the Lebanese-Syrian border controlled by the Syrianarmy.   The sources said Stefani and the Lebanese businessman wereinvolved in previous negotiations which led to the release Nov. 27,1987, of two French hostages.   The three French hostages held in Lebanon are Jean-Paul Kaufman,42, a journalist taken May 22, 1985, and two diplomats, MarcelCarton, 63, and Marcel Fontaine, 46, both seized March 22, 1985.   The kidnappings were claimed by Islamic Jihad or Islamic HolyWar, a group of Moslems of the Shiite sect loyal to Iran's leaderAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   Moslem militants claimed in March 1985 that they killed a fourthFrench hostage, researcher Michel Seurat, but no body has beenfound.   Shiite militants loyal to Iran are believed to hold most of the22 foreign hostages in Lebanon, including nine Americans. Thelongest held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.   The two Frenchmen released last November were Jean-LouisNormandin, 34, a lighting engineer for France's Antenne-2television, who was kidnapped March 8, 1986, and Roger Auque, 31, afree-lance photographer kidnapped Jan. 13, 1987.   France broke relations with Iran in July 1987 in a dispute overan employee of the Iranian Embassy in Paris who refused to giveevidence to a French court on terrorist incidents.   The Beirut daily As-Safir on March 31 reported progress in``secret negotiations'' to free the three hostages. In London, theDaily Mail, quoting unidentified French intelligence sources,reported Monday that Iran and France are close to sealing a hostagedeal.   France released a terrorist suspect, Mohamed Mohajer, a LebaneseShiite, on March 24. It cited insufficient evidence to hold him forinvolvement in a series of 1986 bombings. Officials denied at thetime the release had anything to do with the hostage negotiations.</TEXT></DOC>
