For additional information on the background, design andapplication of this fiber optic alkali monitor (and its predecessor version)the reader should consult the suggested reading list at the end of thisreport. A slipstream of the process gas is introduced into a controlledflame and the concentrations of sodium and potassium are monitored usingflame emission spectroscopy. The system consists of three basic sections:the light gathering and distribution section, the light filtering anddetection section, and the computer-controlled signal processing section.The light gathering and distribution section consists of four components:a lens arrangement, an optical shutter, a bifurcated fiber optic, andtwo beam splitters. The purpose of the lens arrangement is to reduceflame noise by spreading the image of the center of the flame and focusingit through the optical shutter onto the fiber optic. This technique servesto eliminate the adverse effects of flame movements. The optical shutteris a means to block out all light from the fiber optic bundle while performingdark calibrations. When the shutter is open, the gathered light travelsthrough a bifurcated fiber optic to the sodium and potassium channels,where it is divided by the beam splitters. This beam-splitting techniquedistributes equal amounts of light between each of the two channels'foreground and background subchannels. The divided light beam then entersthe filtering and detection section. 24 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
