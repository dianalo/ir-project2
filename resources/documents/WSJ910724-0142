Saddam has lied before, and he will lie again.   In an interview that appeared in a Lebanese weekly inSeptember 1975, Saddam declared that the nuclear deal he hadjust signed with France was &quot;the first concrete step towardthe production of the Arab atomic weapon.&quot; The Frenchpooh-poohed the statement, and it was ignored until Israelbombed Iraq's French-built Osirak nuclear bomb plant in 1981.Since then, Saddam has never ceased to proclaim his innocentintentions.</LP><TEXT>   Iraq's recent admission that it had indeed been running aclandestine operation to enrich natural uranium to produceweapons-grade fuel came only as a result of very clearthreats from Washington, Paris and London that the alliesintended to resume their bombing campaign to prevent Iraqfrom acquiring nuclear weapons. Without such threats, Saddamwould have continued to seal off his nuclear sites from U.N.inspectors.   The U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency has beeninspecting Iraq's nuclear facilities for more than 10 years.And yet, despite leaks from two disgruntled IAEA inspectorsin 1981, who felt that Iraq had violated both the spirit andthe letter of its treaty obligations not to develop nuclearweapons, the IAEA continued to certify Iraqi compliance withthe provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons. (The two inspectors, both Americans, werefired by the agency for their indiscretions). Last Thursdaythe IAEA board officially declared that Iraq had become thefirst member state to have broken the treaty.   Today, the U.N. says it believes Iraq to be operating nofewer than eight sites -- six of them clandestine -- devotedto its top-secret uranium enrichment program. It has come tothat conclusion reluctantly, in the face of overwhelmingevidence. In fact, assiduous investigators have known the&quot;secret&quot; of Iraq's nuclear weapons program for years. Clueshave appeared in the international media.   But searching for Iraq's uranium enrichment equipment andnuclear weapons labs will be like seeking a bit of straw inthe desert sand. Allied bombers can cripple industrial sitesand conventional weapons factories, but they cannot destroyevery basement and cellar. As one congressional staffer whohas long followed Iraqi weapons programs put it, &quot;It's goingto take something like the Allied occupation of Japan afterWorld War II&quot; to get rid of Saddam's closet nukes. &quot;InJapan,&quot; he recalled, &quot;we went in house by house, stickingbayonets through floors and into closet walls,&quot; to discoverhidden arsenals.   Saddam has proved beyond a doubt the potentially tragicshortcomings of international inspection regimes. Over theyears, pressure from Third World nations at the U.N. hasprevented the IAEA from challenging any nation's nuclearintentions. The IAEA has never staged a private inspection.But with the Security Council's new willingness to get toughon offenders, IAEA officials now believe that this couldchange.   Like Iraq, Iran has shown all the signs of having embarkedon a clandestine nuclear drive, and is a strong candidate fora challenge inspection of its nuclear facilities. And yet,here too the IAEA continues to certify Iran's good intentionsin complying with the non-proliferation treaty.   A radical opposition group, the People's Mujahideen ofIran, has alleged that Iran tucked away $200 million in lastyear's budget to finance a top secret nuclear weaponsprogram. The program is being run by Iran's RevolutionaryGuards, who have set up a secret nuclear weapons researchcenter at Moallem Kalayeh in the Elburz Mountains, just northof the city of Qazvin. According to the mujahideen, IranianPresident Hashemi Rafsanjani considers the clandestineprogram so vital to Iran's future that he increased itsbudget to $500 million for the current year.   The Iranian government has been quick to deny any sinisterintention. Iranian first vice president, Hasan Habibi, toldthe Tehran Times on June 18 that &quot;Iran's nuclear energy planhas been designed purely for peaceful purposes and it will beused in the areas like agriculture and pharmaceuticals. . . .Such propaganda is just to defame the Islamic Republic and ithas no truth at all.&quot;   If that sounds like Saddam, it should come as no surprise.On Oct. 6, 1988, when Iran was still smarting from itsmilitary defeat by Iraq, Mr. Rafsanjani openly called for thedevelopment of nuclear weapons in an address broadcast onTehran radio. Noting that the decisiveness of chemical,bacteriological and radiological weapons &quot;was made very clearduring the war,&quot; he said, &quot;we should fully equip ourselvesboth in the offensive and defensive use of chemical,bacteriological, and radiological weapons. From now on youshould make use of the opportunity and perform this task.&quot;   U.S. intelligence sources say they believe Mr. Rafsanjanihas chosen China as Iran's principal nuclear partner. Chinesetechnicians are said to be present in force at the Qazvinnuclear research center. According to Proliferation Watch, aU.S. Senate Committee on Government Affairs bulletin, Chinaagreed to sell Iran a nuclear research reactor in 1991.Iranian exile sources say that an Iranian scientific andtechnical delegation traveled to China and North Korea onJuly 10 to discuss expanding deliveries of nuclear andballistic missile technologies.   The IAEA and its program of safeguards and inspections isbased on trust. Signatories of the nuclear non-proliferationtreaty are expected to disclose their nuclear activities orface vague reprisals, such as the cutoff of technicalassistance from the IAEA. What Iraq, Iran and China haveshown is that nuclear lies are more powerful than existingcontrol regimes. To keep nuclear weapons from spreading,suppliers such as China need to be watched much morecarefully, and recipients of nuclear technology must besubject to challenge inspections of suspected nuclear sites.This will mean strengthening the IAEA -- and punishingproliferators.   ---   Mr. Timmerman edits Mednews, a newsletter specializing inMideast defense.
