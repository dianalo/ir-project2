Kevin David Mitnick would be sentenced to 12 months in prison andthree years on supervised release under terms of the agreement.   The pudgy, youthful looking Mitnick was described by friends as acomputer genius who called himself ``Condor'' and was capable ofinfiltrating any computer system.   Mitnick pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges he infiltratedDigital Equipment Corp.'s computer system and stole one of itsprograms, and admitted stealing 16 MCI telephone codes and usingthem to make phone calls. It was not clear whether the long distancecodes were used to access computer systems.   Prosecutors agreed to dismiss two additional charges, one ofwhich alleged that Mitnick infiltrated the computer system of LeedsUniversity in England.   U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer declined prosecutors'recommendations until Mitnick is interviewed by probation departmentauthorities. She noted that he has a prior conviction for similaractivities in Santa Cruz, and set sentencing for April 24.   At a bail hearing on Jan. 3, Pfaelzer denied bail for thedefendant, saying Mitnick posed ``a very, very great danger to thecommunity'' _ reflecting public comments made by assistant U.S.Attorney Leon Weidman.   Even Mitnick's access to the telephone was restricted. Mitnick'slawyer, Alan Rubin, has maintained that prosecution comments aboutthe case were wildly exaggerated.   On Wednesday, Rubin said outside court that Mitnick had expresseda desire to undergo psychological counseling, which also was part ofthe plea agreement.   ``He's a very talented man with a lot of ability and for whateverreason ... there's been a misuse of that ability,'' said Rubin. ``Acomputer company that could harness his abilities would really get atalented employee.''   Rubin said Mitnick never intended to damage computer systems orto sell information for profit.   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Asperger said the government basedits sentencing recommendation on Digital's estimate that Mitnick'sactions had cost the firm between $100,000 and $200,000 in ``downtime'' on its computer.   He said the computer system had to be shut down while the firmlooked for damage. The government's initial estimates of damage toDigital's system were set at $4 million.   It turned out there was no damage to the overall system, Aspergersaid, although Mitnick was able to steal and copy one program.   Mitnick already has served more than three months in prison, andRubin added, ``He'll be out by Christmas.''</TEXT></DOC>
