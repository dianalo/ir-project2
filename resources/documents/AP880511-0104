He said this month's action showed ``our strength as well as ourhelplessness'' and that the workers would try again if necessary.   Walesa and about 1,000 haggard strikers who had occupied theplant and refused to work abandoned their strike Tuesday evening.Strike leaders said they wanted to avoid a police raid, butcommunist authorities said the action failed for lack of support.   Still, the government said the two weeks of strikes that endedTuesday will compel it to speed up efforts to revive Poland'scrippled economy.   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told The Associated Press bytelephone that the decision to end the strike was judicious and``so eloquent that it requires no comment whatsoever.''   The official PAP news agency reported some shipyard supervisorswere back at work today and normal work would resume Thursday.Walesa said he got a phone call at home in the morning asking himwhy he was not there.   ``If there are people who think we lost, it is because we stilllack solidarity'' among workers nationwide, he said.   But Walesa said that ``if necessary we will try again. Nothingended. Nothing is finished.'' He added that the 15-member strikecommittee that engaged in five rounds of negotiations withmanagement will not be dissolved.   There was no immediate word on whether the strikers would facelegal charges or disciplinary action. During negotiations, thestrikers had been offered amnesty but only if they left theshipyard Sunday night.   Heads held high, the shipyard workers filed out of the yardwithout a settlement Tuesday but also without having backed downfrom demands whose centerpiece was reinstatement of the yard'sSolidarity chapter.   Through the intervention of the Catholic Church, workers andmanagement met five times from Saturday until Monday.   Police had surrounded the shipyard since Thursday and thestrikers had rejected government offers of wage increases, soquitting was the ``best solution possible,'' said strike committeechairman Alojzy Szablewski.   The strike evoked memories of 1980, when a younger, leanerWalesa cosigned an accord at the same shipyard during a nationwidewave of strikes over price increases that toppled a government. Atime of unmatched freedom followed.   The rest of the country did not follow suit this time, leavingthe shipyard workers in the Baltic port city largely isolated.   Urban said on Tuesday that ``the strikes and protests have notwon the support of the working class and society'' but had taughtthe government important lessons.   ``The May events will compel the government to more consistentlydevelop reform, which should be more strongly felt by society,'' hesaid.   The government planned today to introduce a bill that wouldallow it to take over money-losing enterprises and fire managerswho resist economic change. Its reform program has increased pricesby 42 percent this year.   And a PAP statement on Tuesday's meeting of the ruling Politburospoke of the ``indispensible'' need to quicken democratization _ aprocess it has so far only vaguely described.   Five major strikes since April 25 added up to Poland's worstwave of labor unrest since the 1981 military crackdown onSolidarity. The labor federation was banned in 1982.   During negotiations, the mostly young strikers often appearedmore militant than their elders. On Monday, the young strikersrefused to accept a compromise largely agreed to by the strikecommittee.   Solidarity chaplain the Rev. Henryk Jankowski said the strikecommittee had voted 13-2 to end the stoppage.   ``I wanted to avoid the police taking them out,'' he said.``There were many wonderful young men there, and I could not allowthem to be beaten.''   Besides recognition of Solidarity, the strikers had demandedmonthly raises of at least $38 based on their current average ofabout $105, reinstatement of fired Solidarity activists, freedomfor political prisoners and amnesty for strikers.   Similar demands had been made by workers at the Lenin steelworksin Nowa Huta in southern Poland, whose 10-day stoppage was crushedThursday by a violent, pre-dawn raid.   The other strikes were settled peacefully: at a defense-relatedheavy machinery plant in Stalowa Wola and among transit workers inBydgoszcz and Szczecin.</TEXT></DOC>
