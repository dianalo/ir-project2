Top executives from American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.,MCI Communications Corp. and American Express Co. as well asconsumer and regulatory representatives testified that thebill raises many antitrust concerns while giving regulatorsno extra resources or legal clout to police expected abuses.Moreover, several witnesses said it would lead to higherphone bills for most consumers.</LP><TEXT>   Robert Allen, chairman and chief executive officer ofATandamp;T, said the bill is &quot;bad legislation for consumers, forbusiness, for the telecommunications industry and for thenation.&quot; The biggest problem with the bill, he said, is thatit would cut competition.   The Bell companies' &quot;entry into manufacturing wouldcripple competition,&quot; agreed Bert C. Roberts, president andchief operating officer of MCI, which buys telecommunicationsgear from a variety of suppliers. &quot;The Bell companies aremonopolies and, therefore, would have the same abilities andincentives&quot; to engage in anticompetitive practices as theyhad before the Bell System breakup, he said.   Mr. Roberts contended that hundreds of independentmanufacturers that have flourished since the breakup in 1984would be bought out or put out of business by the Bells.Ultimately, charges for long-distance companies' access tothe local phone networks as well as consumers' monthly billsfor local service would increase, he predicted.   The Baby Bells also were criticized for refusing to sendan executive to yesterday's hearing, yet aggressivelylobbying for the bill. Instead, the Bells sent StephenShapiro, a partner with the Chicago law firm of Mayer, Brownandamp; Platt to testify. Mr. Shapiro argued that lifting themanufacturing ban would encourage competition, benefitingconsumers, spurring technological innovation and stimulatingU.S. trade and employment.   &quot;I consider their refusal {to send an executive} anaffront to the Congress,&quot; said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, (D.,Ohio), chairman of the Judiciary Committee's antitrustsubcommittee.   Ronald Stowe, who heads Pacific Telesis Group's Washingtonoffice as well as a coalition of Bell executives here, saidthat the Bells selected Mr. Shapiro because he was the bestperson to speak for all seven companies. Mr. Shapiro, who hasworked on Bell business and legal issues, recentlyrepresented the companies in court arguments for liftinginformation services restrictions.   Yesterday's hearing was in sharp contrast to theoverwhelming support expressed at a Senate Commerce Committeehearing this spring. The bill, introduced by CommerceChairman Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.) and co-sponsored by 22senators, was approved 18-1 by the Commerce Committee inMarch.</TEXT></DOC>
