The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington,charges that the U.S. government broke an agreement made withthe company when Citizens acquired American Savings Bank, afailing thrift, in December 1988.</LP><TEXT>   According to Citizens, the Federal Home Loan Bank Boardand the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. agreed toprovide financial assistance to Citizens, including a cashcontribution, when it made the acquisition. That cashcontribution -- $86 million -- was to be credited toCitizens' regulatory capital account and amortized over 25years.   In 1989, however, those two federal agencies wereabolished under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recoveryand Enforcement Act. With the passage of that act, accordingto Citizens, all previous regulatory agreements were voided-- including Citizens' ability to count $86 million towardits capital account.   Citizens filed its suit against the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. and the Office of Thrift Supervision, thesuccessors to the two abolished agencies. Citizens said it isasking the court to declare that the Financial InstitutionsReform Act resulted in a breach of contract and, thus, tookCitizens' property without just compensation and due processin violation of the Fifth Amendment. The suit also seeks aninjunction prohibiting enforcement of those provisions of theact that breached the original agreement.   Officials at OTS said they hadn't seen the suit andcouldn't comment. The FDIC said that while it also hadn'tseen the litigation, it believes the spirit of the act iscorrect.
