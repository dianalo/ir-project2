Telecom, owned by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, was aninstant hit Wednesday when its American owners sold a 30%stake in the company in New Zealand and internationally. Inthe U.S., American depositary receipts surged in their firstweek of Big Board trading to $26 from an initial price of$22.58. Each ADR denotes 20 shares.</LP><TEXT>   The company's net income grew 29% in the fiscal year endedMarch 31, and Telecom forecasts 21% growth for the year inprogress. With such a hefty increase in the bottom line,Telecom may, at first glance, resemble Telefonos de Mexico orTelefonos de Chile, both phone stocks that soared oninternational markets after being sold by their governments.But the Latin American companies are harnessed to boomeconomies in developing countries. New Zealand's economy, bycontrast, has been limping along with slow or no growth forthe past five years.   Telecom's net in recent years has been the beneficiary ofcost cutting, enabling profits to surge despite thelackluster 6% annual growth in revenue over the past twoyears. But analysts fear that when Telecom runs out of coststo cut, its stock will become a blue-chip play on astruggling country -- and one that is already well stockedwith telephones.   Nonetheless, Telecom's public offering -- the firstinternational offering of a New Zealand company -- succeededin placing shares and depository shares with a value of $817million, giving the total company a market value of $2.72billion. Just the one-third share of the offering that wasplaced at home in New Zealand represents 20% of the NewZealand Stock Exchange's Top 40 index.   In the U.S., the stock's quick start might be partlyexplained as a reaction to poor earnings from U.S. telephonecompanies that pounded the Street last week. Three of theseven U.S. regional Bell companies -- BellSouth, Nynex andAmeritech -- posted drops in their earnings for the secondquarter. Stocks in regional Bell operating companies havehovered at prices 13 to 16 times trailing 12-month earningsin recent weeks -- compared with the 12.5 times earnings atwhich Telecom was priced Tuesday.   &quot;For the same price, you're getting three times the growthrate with New Zealand Tel&quot; that you get with the regionalBell companies, says Dan Jacobs, a portfolio manager at theTempleton Fund, which picked up some of the ADRs.   &quot;With New Zealand Tel, something like 10% {annual} revenuegrowth is possible even 10 years from now,&quot; he says. Telecomalso contemplates an annual dividend of about 70% ofearnings.   But what, precisely, will move those earnings upward?Mexico's 81 million people are served by only 5.4 millionphone lines, leaving lots of room for growth. By contrast,more than 93% of New Zealand's households and just about allof its businesses are already Telecom customers.   And New Zealand has been hurting from what economistsrefer to as a double-dip recession. &quot;No one is expecting astrong pickup,&quot; says Paul Dyer, an economist forAuckland-based Buttle Wilson, a New Zealand securities firm.Unemployment hit a record 10.9% in the second quarter.   Optimists say an improving climate for the country's wool,dairy and timber exports points the way to a recovery.Stephen Dexter, an analyst at Kemper Financial, says, &quot;Havingcost cutting be your fuel for growth is OK, but once the costcutting starts to run out, you'd better have the economyhelping.&quot; But just how closely are telecommunications profitstied to sheep shearing? What Telecom needs most of all, somethink, is to expand its newer, higher-margin services such ascellular, &quot;0800&quot; numbers, yellow page directories, andservices such as call waiting and teleconferencing. To putthe company in fighting shape, the government has allowedTelecom to cut long-distance rates and increase its localresidential rates as quickly as consumer prices.   However, a new consortium led by MCI Communications andBell Canada has arrived on the scene to compete with Telecomin many areas such as private network services, nationalcalls and outgoing international calls. Robert Barnett, vicechairman of Ameritech, concedes if there's aggressive pricingby the consortium it could damp Telecom's bottom line. Butoverall, he says, &quot;revenues will go up because this is anexciting industry.&quot;   For the sake of the company's new investors, it had betterprove so by September 1993. For by that month, Bell Atlanticand Ameritech are required to sell an additional 10% ofTelecom to the public.</TEXT></DOC>
