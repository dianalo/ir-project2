The inquiry also is examining much of the related researchconducted in recent years by Dr. Robert C. Gallo, the nation's mostprominent AIDS researcher, according to the report published inSunday editions of the Chicago Tribune.   Gallo's laboratory at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda,Md., reported discovery of the virus in May 1984. It was allegedthat Gallo accidentally or deliberately claimed the first sample ofthe virus, isolated in France, as his own.   The scientist is quoted in the current issue of Science magazineas welcoming an inquiry into questions about his research.   ``These allegations have been going on too long,'' Gallo said inScience. ``I have done nothing wrong and I have no apprehension oranxiety about the review.''   At issue is Gallo's recognition as co-discoverer with a team ofscientists from the Pasteur Institute in Paris of the humanimmunodeficiency virus, known as HIV, which most scientists believecauses AIDS.   The achievement has earned him numerous scientific honors andprizes and more than $300,000 in personal royalties made from theblood test with the Gallo virus.   Another potential issue is the ultimate ownership of the patent,now held jointly by the U.S. government and Pasteur, on the testthat has been used to check millions of individuals and units ofstored blood plasma for exposure to the AIDS virus.   The U.S. and French governments in 1987 settled a long-runningdispute when Franch agreed to drop a lawsuit on the patent and thetwo nations set up a plan for sharing proceeds.   Domestic sales of the test are estimated at $175 million a year.   The Tribune said the NIH started its probe Nov. 29, 10 daysafter the newspaper published an article that recounted the historyof HIV and raised questions about the accuracy of Gallo's publishedresearch.   To assist the NIH investigation, Dr. William Raub, theinstitute's acting director, has asked the National Academy ofSciences to help assemble an advisory panel of scientists fromoutside the government with expertise in virology and relatedfields.   NIH officials said Friday that they had not yet received thenames of any potential candidates, the Tribune reported.   An academy spokeswoman said she could not recall a previousrequest to assemble a panel of experts in a case of scientificmisconduct, the Tribune said.</TEXT></DOC>
