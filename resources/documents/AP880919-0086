Heather Hardy, an associate professor of English at theUniversity of North Texas, began the project after receiving anewspaper clipping in 1980 about an Alabama tribe member who wasusing note cards to create a dictionary of her native language.   Ms. Hardy decided to contact the woman.   ``I knew not much had been done on the Alabama,'' she said.``When you've got languages in your own back yard that have hardlybeen described at all and are dying out, that takes priority.''   The Alabama live with the Coushatta tribe on a joint reservationnestled in the Big Thicket National Preserve, 70 miles northeast ofHouston.   Ms. Hardy drove to the reservation and found Cora Sylestine, aformer teacher. The two women struck a bargain: Ms. Sylestine wouldguide Ms. Hardy through the thickets of her native language if Ms.Hardy would help her create the dictionary of her dreams.   First, Ms. Hardy had to create a system of writing to record thelanguage. And the grammar used by its speakers had to be decipheredbefore its words could be broken down for a dictionary.   Ms. Hardy said the process has been laborious, done on weekendsand school breaks, financed mostly with small grants and personalfunds.   As of Sept. 1, though, a team working on the project, whichincludes University of North Texas linguist Timothy Montler, isbeing financed for two years by a $161,000 grant from the NationalEndowment for the Humanities and the university.   Montler, a computer expert, modified a program the team will useto create the dictionary, which will define Alabama words inEnglish and vice versa, Ms. Hardy said.   Transcribing Alabama to written form and translating it toEnglish hasn't been as tough as working with some other AmericanIndian languages, which use many sounds that don't exist inEnglish, Ms. Hardy said. Only one Alabama sound _ a breathy,slurred ``l'' _ is not found in English, she said. The dictionarywill represent it with an l crossed by a hyphen.   But the language has its own special quirks.   In other languages, for instance, plural forms usually addsomething, be it an ``s'' in English or some prefix or suffix, Ms.Hardy said. But in Alabama, to create a plural, the root word isshortened. The Alabama word ``batatli,'' for example, means to hitone time, but the word ``batli'' means to hit repeatedly.   ``We've never found anything like this,'' Ms. Hardy said. ``Itled to the joke that, in Alabama, less is more.''   Ms. Hardy said she hopes the group's work will allow the tribeto start a language reclamation program and create collections ofAlabama folk stories. ``Cora says the language is the culture,''Ms. Hardy said. ``By preserving the language, you preserve a lot ofinformation about the culture.''</TEXT></DOC>
