Chase Manhattan Corp., the parent of Chase Manhattan Bank,was forced to reset the rate on $200 million of auction-ratesubordinated notes to yield 13.017%, up from the previousrate of 9.66%.</LP><TEXT>   The new yield was 4.92 percentage points higher than theyield on two-year Treasury notes and just shy of the maximumpermissible spread of five percentage points above two-yearTreasurys.   &quot;Most people were pretty shocked&quot; by the rate, said onecorporate bond trader who had expected the notes to be resetat a spread of between 2.5 to three percentage points abovethe two-year Treasury note. When the Chase notes were lastreset in 1988, they were priced to yield 1.05 percentagepoints more than two-year Treasury notes.   But times have clearly changed for the banking industry.Spreads between yields on Treasurys and on securities issuedby financial corporations have been widening for months asconcerns about rising loan losses and fears of an economicrecession prompted credit rating agencies to downgradebanking securities. That, in turn, prompted investors to dumpthe securities, sending prices spiraling lower.   Chase Manhattan has a credit rating that is on theborderline of investment grade. If the bank's debt isdowngraded another notch, it would be rated on the same levelas a top-tier junk bond.   In addition to concerns about the industry, analysts saidsome investors demanded a premium because they are worriedthat Chase may be unable to successfully reset the notesagain in 1992. However, syndicate officials said, investorsdemanded premiums because they are concerned that Chase mayretire the debt in 1992.   In any case, many analysts seem to feel that the rateswere priced at exaggerated levels which reflected investorhysteria rather than market fundamenatals.   &quot;In a historical perspective, these spreads seemridiculous,&quot; said Jay Weintraub, a banking analysts atSalomon Brothers Inc. The firm was a member of the syndicatethat managed the reset auction. &quot;There is a lot of negativepsychology about the banking industry. But the fundamentalsare not nearly as bad as the psychology would tell you.&quot;   Officials at Chase Manhattan said the high yields reflectpoor market conditions along with increasing competition forlimited funds with foreign banks which recently beganflooding the global bond market with subordinated debt.   In July, Sumitomo Bank Ltd. issued a total of $1 billionin subordinated debt in the U.S. and Europe. Last week, threeother Japanese banks, Fuji Bank Ltd., Nippon Credit BanksLtd. and Bank of Tokyo Ltd., issued a total of $1.8 billionof subordinated debt in the Eurobond market. Some analystsargue that the aggressive debt issuance of Japanese banks,which have strong credit ratings, may crowd banks with lesserratings out of the market.   Last month, underwriters at Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. wereforced to pull a $100 million issue of Continental Bank10-year subordinated capital notes due to poor marketconditions.   Although Chase could have called its $200 million issue ofsubordinated auction rate notes, corporate bond traders saidthat since it is so difficult for banks to raise subordinateddebt financing today, that wasn't a viable option.   In a sign of how difficult the commercial paper market hasbecome, Citicorp yesterday said it would discontinue itsweekly $100-million commercial paper auction after nextTuesday's sale.   A bank spokesman said Citicorp intends to continue sellingcommercial paper through direct placement, which he saidoffers the bank more flexibility in setting maturities.Commercial paper accounts for less than 1% of Citicorp'soverall funding.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasury securities inched higher in choppy, aimlesstrading as investors gave up hopes for lower interest ratesbut saw a glimmer of hope for a quick deficit-reduction planlate in the day.   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 98 2/32, upnearly 3/8 points from 97 23/32 on Monday. The issue's yield,which moves in the opposite direction of its price, eased to8.92% from 8.96% on Monday. Two year notes ended at 100 5/32,up 2/32 to yield 8.02%.   The recent disappointment that a bipartisan deal to trimthe government's budget shortfalls had not been forthcomingweighed heavily on fixed-income investors. But prices roselate in the session following reports that Congressionalnegotiators were trying to finalize a broad budget outline intime for President Bush's address to Congress yesterdaynight.   But sapping investor interest for much of the day was thespreading perception that the Federal Reserve is not preparedto change its monetary policy despite clear signs of economicweakening. As recently as Monday, the anticipation of animminent Fed easing was boosting shorter-term securities,which are particularly sensitive to any change in Fed policy.   Short-term rates ended little changed. The discount rateon three-month Treasury bills was slightly lower at 7.40% fora bond equivalent yield of 7.63% while the rate on six-monthbills was unchanged at 7.34% to yield 7.71%.                                                                                                          Corporate Issues                                                                                                          The Resolution Trust Corp.'s sale of $70 million ofhigh-yield bonds depressed prices of some junk bonds butbarely bristled the broader market.   Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with lowcredit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended about 1/8point lower.   The junk bonds of GNS Finance Corp. lost even more. GNS's12% guaranteed notes sold on behalf of Golden Nugget, wasreportedly among the names on the RTC's bid lists Tuesday.The notes fell 1 1/2 points to end at 89.   Some analysts said the GNS bonds also were adverselyaffected by efforts on the part of underwriters at SalomonBrothers Inc. to market a new $100 million Golden Nugget junkbond issue.   Among the issues reportedly on the RTC's bid list werebonds from Eastern Airlines, Penn Traffic Co., TelemundoGroup Inc., and GACC Holding Co.   The RTC is expected to sell another $40 million in junkbonds, posssibly as early as today. Market sources said amongthe names included on the new bid list are Coltec Industries,Century Communications Co. and American Cablesystems.   Meanwhile, the Australian government announced that itwould repurchase about $515 million of its outstanding Yankeebonds, which are bonds issued in the U.S. market by foreignissuers.   Syndicate officials at Salomon Brothers, which is managingthe tender offer, said the buy-back will be the biggesttender ever in the Yankee market and one of the few everfixed-spread tender offers.   Rather than offer a fixed price for the bonds, Australiawill pay investors a fixedspread over Treasurys. Australiahas been repaying its debt aggressively since 1987.                                                                                                          Municipal Issues                                                                                                          Municipal bonds were unchanged to 1/8 point higher.   Trading was light as investors focused on more than $753million of new issues priced during yesterday's session.   In one of the largest deals, a PaineWebber Inc. grouptentatively priced $278 million Connecticut single-familyhousing mortgage finance program bonds to yield from 6.1% in1991 to 7.7% in 2022.   An $81.2 million issue of Charlotte, N.C., generalobligation bonds was won by a Merrill Lynch Capital Marketsgroup. About $8.8 million of the issue, which was priced toyield from 5.8% in 1991 to 6.6% in 1999, remained unsold lateyesterday.   Among active issues, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20%bonds due in 2018 were unchanged at 97 7/8 to yield 7.37%.                                                                                                          Mortgage, Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage securities prices rose as much as 1/8 point.   Government National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issuefor September delivery gained 1/8 point to 98 27/32. FederalHome Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National MortgageAssociation 9 1/2% issues for September delivery each rose2/32 to 98 11/32 and 98 29/32, respectively.   In the asset-backed market, a $425 million issuesecuritized with J.C. Penney credit-card receivables soldout, according to First Boston Corp. The certificates,offered through special J.C. Penney Master Credit Card TrustSeries D, carried a coupon rate of 8.70% and were priced at99 23/32 to yield 8.97%.   The securities are rated triple-A by Moody's InvestorsService Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.                                                                                                          Foreign Bonds                                                                                                          In Japan, bond prices continued to fall on speculationthat the long-term prime rate will be raised again soon.   The long-term prime rate, which is set monthly by Japan'slong-term credit banks, was increased by .60 percentage pointto 8.5% at the end of last month. The long-term credit bankstry to keep the prime rate at .90 percentage point above thecoupon rate on five-year debentures issued monthly by thebanks.   The rate on the debentures in September was 7.6%, but theyield is now at 7.96%. As a result, dealers said the couponon October debenture issues is certain to increase, whichwould also push up the longterm prime rate.   At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the No. 11910-year bond was quoted at a price of 82.07, down 0.35 point,to yield 8.345%. (When calculated using the semi-annualcompound method, the yield on the No. 119 ended at 7.64%,according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)   Most West German bonds ended modestly lower. Britishgovernment bonds, called gilts, ended moderately higher.Dealers said that investors have been buying mostlylonger-term gilts because they feel more confident about thegovernment's anti-inflation measures.</TEXT></DOC>
