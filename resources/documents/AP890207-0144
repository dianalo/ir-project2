The report, covering conditions in 169 countries and territories,praised the Soviet Union for ``remarkable changes'' in the humanrights field, including the freeing of all prisoners detained forpolitical or religious offenses.   The section on Israel was one of the harshest on that countrysince the State Department began issuing human rights reports in themid-1970s. It said the actions of Israeli authorities ``resulted inmany avoidable deaths'' among Palestinians since they began theiruprising 14 months ago.   The Palestinian uprising caught the Israeli army ``by surprise,''the report said. The armed forces, ``untrained and inexperienced inriot control, responded in a manner which led to a substantialincrease in human rights violations,'' it said.   Shortly after the report was made public, Israeli Deputy ForeignMinister Binyamin Netanyahu defended the actions of Israeli forces.   ``Israeli soldiers ... maintain as best they can, apart from afew exceptions, the standards of proper conduct that no country inthe world cold maintain,'' he said in Jerusalem.   In a separate statement, the Israeli army's chief prosecutordefended the legality of Israeli operations, saying Palestinianprisoners were given due process of law.   Since the December 1987 start of the uprising, 374 Palestinianshave been killed and thousands wounded, most by army gunfire.   From time to time since the violence started in the occupiedterritories, the State Department has expressed criticism of Israeliefforts to bring it under control, but the report appeared to gobeyond the earlier statements.   Two private human rights groups, Amnesty International and theLawyers Committee for Human Rights, also criticized the Israelis.   In a report to the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreignoperations, Amnesty International said that while both sides haveused violence in the Palestinian uprising, there have been excesseson the Israeli side.   ``Demonstrators have thrown rocks and Molotov cocktails,'' thereport said. ``However, the tactics of the Israeli army haveexceeded the use of reasonable force.''   It said there have been ``hundreds of questionable killings'' byIsraeli security forces and that few have been adequatelyinvestigated.   Amnesty International and the lawyers committee questioned theuse of high velocity bullets by the Israeli forces as well as theuse of plastic bullets which the two organizations said can belethal.   The State Department report cited across-the-board advances inthe Soviet Union but said it was premature to say whether afundamental shift on rights policy has occurred there.   It said all prisoners detained on religious or political groundshad been released and that plans for the amendment or repeal ofstatutes limiting activities in these areas have been announced.   In addition, freedom the leave the Soviet Union temporarily hasbeen significantly expanded, it said. The report said there werealso human rights gains last year in Poland and Hungary.   While suggesting that worldwide trends have been favorable, thereport said there were severe human rights setbacks in Iraq, Burundiand Sudan.   In Iraq, chemical warfare was used against Kurdish rebels,resulting in the death or injury of thousands and forcing tens ofthousands to flee the country.   The report indicated that perhaps the single greatestrights-related tragedy in the world occurred in southern Sudan whereit said some reports estimated that between 100,000 and 250,000civilians died of starvation.   The deaths occurred after elements of the armed forces on eachside in Sudan's civil war interfered with or failed to cooperatewith food delivery efforts.   Elsewhere, the report said there were significant steps towarddemocracy and human rights protection in South Korea, Taiwan andPakistan. It said that the October plebiscite in Chile has raisedhopes for a peaceful return to democracy there.   The section in the report on Israel was praised by James Zogby,executive director of the Arab-American Institute.   ``For the first time in 12 years of reporting, the StateDepartment has fulfilled its mandate to tell the truth,'' Zogbysaid. ``The burden is now on Congress to enforce the law regardinghuman rights and aid. At this point, congressional inaction wouldmake a mockery of our stated commitment to human rights.''</TEXT></DOC>
