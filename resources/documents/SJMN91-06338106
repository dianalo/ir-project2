In a few hours on a Sundaymorning they woke Americans from their isolationist slumber and launched acostly war Japan couldn't win.;   When the fighting ended four years later,much of Japan had been incinerated, a deadly nuclear cloud hung over twocities, hundreds of thousands of civilians were dead, the economy was inruins, the emperor was reduced from head of state to figurehead, and thecountry was occupied by American soldiers.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  AN APOLOGY? WHY?JAPAN'S SURRENDER IN 1945 IS MORE MEANINGFUL THANANY MEA CULPA OF TODAY  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Are Japanese people sorry their nation attacked Pearl Harbor? Many are. Dothey owe us an apology? No.;   The 50th anniversary has stirred upunderstandable feelings in Americans who lived through the attack or lostloved ones in it. In two hours, 2,403 Americans died, and millions of liveswere changed. But Japan lost the war. Surrenders are worth more thanapologies.;   Besides being meaningless, war-related mea culpas have anever-ending quality. A full accounting, for example, would have to deal notonly with Japanese guilt, but also with American excesses: Most of theJapanese killed in the firebombing of Japan's major cities and the nuclearflattening of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were civilians.;   Was that much loss ofinnocent life necessary to win the war? Military historians have been debatingthat for five decades. President Bush rejects suggestions that Washingtonshould apologize for President Harry Truman's decision to drop atomic bombs.But by the same logic that leads some to demand an apology from Japan forPearl Harbor, four years from now -- on the 50th anniversary of Hiroshima andNagasaki -- others doubtless will argue that this nation owes Japan an apologyfor those dreadful disasters.;   World War II ended in August 1945. Japan'ssurrender was unequivocal. There would be no point to an apology from theJapanese people in 1991. They didn't start the war. The only meaningfulapology would have to come from the leaders who gave the orders to attack.Most are long gone.;   To the extent that 1991's renewed attention on PearlHarbor makes people everywhere sorrowful for the suffering caused by wars, wesay that's a positive thing.;   To the extent that some Japanese lawmakerssucceed in adopting contrite resolutions, that's fine too, if it makes themfeel better. But it has little practical value for today's U.S.-Japaneserelations.;   If focusing on Pearl Harbor makes it more difficult for someJapanese fascists to deny their nation's responsibility for the war, and forsome educators to soft-pedal it, good.;   But the truth of the matter is,examining our military past does not necessarily provide practical clues fordealing with our economic present. The Japan of today makes Sonys and Toyotas,not Zero fighter-bombers. And it is both our chief economic rival and, inAsia, our main ally.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911203  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  467  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, December 3, 199100338106,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
