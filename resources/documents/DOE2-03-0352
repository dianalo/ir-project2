Thirteen patients with severe aortic regurgitationwere catheterized as outpatients, without premedication. The pulmonaryartery was entered percutaneously through the femoral vein. Cardiac outputand stroke volume were measured by the indicator dilution method by injectioninto the inferior vena cava and sampling from the pulmonary artery. Theregurgitant fraction was obtained by subtracting the indicator strokevolume from the angiographic left ventricular stroke volume. The followingresults are expressed as mean +- SD. Ejection fraction (%) = 54 +- 6;end diastolic volume index (ml) = 228 +- 40; end systolic volume index(ml) = 198 +- 51 and regurgitant fraction (%) = 59 +- 7 while the pulmonarywedge pressure (mmHg) = 10 +- 3. In 4 cases, comparison with recent catheterizationdata showed good agreement for all parameters (r = 0.90), except ejectionfraction (r = 0.75). In conclusion, this simplified catheterization methodusing digital subtraction enables the procedure to be done on an outpatientbasis. All essential hemodynamic data can be obtained by right heartcatheterization.</TEXT></DOC>
