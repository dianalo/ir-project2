Baker IIIwill ask Mikhail S. Gorbachev for help in forging peace in theMiddle East if the Soviet leader proves to be sincere about globalcooperation, a senior official says.   En route Monday to Moscow to meet with the general secretary,Baker said his goal is ``to make it clear to the Soviets that weare seeking an active, constructive, positive and expandingrelationship.''   ``If we find that the Soviet Union is serious about new globalbehavior, then we will seek diplomatic engagement in an effort toreach mutually beneficial results,'' Baker said.   A senior official expanded on those remarks, telling reporterson Baker's flight from Washington that the Bush administrationwould welcome Moscow's help promoting Arab-Israeli negotiations andwas not trying to exclude the Soviets from those peace efforts.   ``We ought not to somehow be worried about the Soviet Unionbeing a participant in trying to enhance the prospects for peace inthe Middle East,'' the official said. ``The problems there areextraordinarily intractable. We welcome all the help we can get.''   But the official, who responded to questions only on conditionof anonymity, ruled out U.S. concessions in Afghanistan ornegotiations to remove short-range nuclear missiles from Europe.   He insisted the Soviets should suspend their military aid to theMarxist government of Nicaragua, estimated at $500 million a year,and show interest in a peaceful solution in the Middle East byresuming diplomatic relations with Israel and exerting influence onSyria.   The official said the United States would not stop aiding theAfghan rebels in their war with the Kabul government, which wassupplied with Soviet arms and equipment before the Red Army leftthe country in February.   Baker, who has never been to the Soviet Union before, is due inMoscow on Wednesday morning for talks with Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard A. Shevardnadze. They plan to meet again Thursday morning,and Baker will see Gorbachev for two hours in the afternoon.   The U.S. entourage, including State Department, Pentagon andNational Security Council officials, stopped first in Helsinki torest, confer and meet with Finnish officials.   Baker met with Shevardnadze in Vienna in March before the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact openednegotiations to reduce non-nuclear armor and artillery in Europe.   Since then, a U.S. dispute with West Germany over NATO'sshort-range nuclear missiles has rattled the Western Alliance'sunity.   The Germans are resisting U.S. efforts to more than triple themissiles' range to 250 miles, and are demanding U.S. negotiationswith the Soviets to reduce tactical nuclear weapons on both sides.   The Bush administration has refused, arguing that would hurtNATO's defenses.   If Gorbachev tries to capitalize on the disagreement, Bakersimply will refuse to discuss the missiles, the official said.   He predicted the alliance will resolve the problem before or atthe NATO summit meeting President Bush will attend with the leadersof the 15 other allied countries May 29-30 in Brussels.   Baker intends to give priority during his Moscow meetings to theproliferation of ballistic missiles and chemical weapons, which hasalarmed the Bush administration.   Baker will press the Soviets to reconsider joining aseven-nation Western control group seeking to end the sale ofballistic missile technology to Third World nations, the officialsaid.   The group, known formerly as the Missile Technology ControlRegime, was formed in April 1987 by six NATO allies _ France, WestGermany, Italy, Britain, Canada and the U.S. _ and Japan to ban theexport of missiles and related technology to be used to buildmissiles capable of carrying a payload 168 miles or more.</TEXT></DOC>
