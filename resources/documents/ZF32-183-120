It is claimed to offer workstation and X-terminal buildershigher performance than they would get from a dumb frame buffer - but at alower price than existing graphics accelerators.andP;  AFE was using old Intelgraphics technology and had been searching for a replacement architecturewhen it realised that what it really needed was a custom device.andP;  The part isdesigned to sit behind a CPU such as Intel Corp's 80860 like a co-processorand do the rendering - pixel writing - for graphics operations.andP;  Samples at33MHz are expected this month and a 40MHz version will follow.andP;  Fujitsureckons that a Graphics System Processor, attached to the Sbus on aSparcstation 1 - even with no supporting 80860 - can boost X Windowperformance up to 100%.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
