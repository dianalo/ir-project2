Hekmatyar heads the seven-party Afghan Resistance Alliance.   ``We consider the Soviet presence in Afghanistan an aggression ... that will continue until the last Soviet soldier is in ourhomeland. Therefore fighting cannot stop,'' he added.   ``People coming from Jalalabad say the Russians are sendingtheir heavy equipment to Kabul,'' said a rebel official identifiedonly as Kabir, a member of the military committee of the YunisKhalis faction of Hezb-i-Islami guerrilla group. Kabir said anairlift was under way.   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, quotedrebel sources as saying the gunship had been shot down. No detailswere available.   According to the sources, up to 60 Soviet trucks headed westThursday toward Kabul, 110 miles from the Jalalabad garrison.   The diplomat said about the reported attack on the helicopter,``It would indicate the Soviets have resorted to using close airsupport again during their withdrawal.''   Both the Soviets and the Afghans virtually stopped using theirair force in 1986, because the Islamic, anti-Marxist guerrillasstarted shooting down aircraft with U.S.-supplied Stinger missiles.   In Moscow, the Soviet military charged Thursday that foreignsponsors have stepped up arms shipments to the rebels and sent inmore military advisers, endangering Soviet troops who are scheduledto start withdrawing May 15 under an agreement reached in Genevalast month.   A civil war has raged in Afghanistan since April 1978, when aSoviet-inspired revolution brought a Marxist government to power.About 115,000 Soviet soldiers intervened in December 1979 to helpthe Kabul government and stayed on to help fight the insurrection.   Reports reaching Pakistan said the Soviets' 66th Brigade,estimated at 4,000 men, will be deployed in the Kabul area afterleaving Jalalabad, 30 miles from Pakistan. An Afghan division willreplace them.   Jalalabad is the second major garrison evacuated by the Soviets,following the April 22 withdrawal from Barikot.   Hekmatyar said 12 administrative districts and many militaryposts fell to the rebels in recent weeks. He said the government isvacating the areas since it fears that otherwise ``the Afghantroops and militia ... will surrender to mujahedeen (Moslemfighters).''   He said garrisons in the south and north were vacated, and notjust those in the east as Afghan leader Najib claimed two weeksago. Najib said this was to facilitate the return of Afghanrefugees from Pakistan.   About 3 million Afghan refugees live in Pakistan and anadditional 2 million in Iran.   A Pushtu language newscast by state-owned Radio Kabul, monitoredin Islamabad on Thursday, confirmed Hekmatyar's assertion thatevacuation of garrisons is taking place in a large part ofAfghanistan, not just the east.   Hekmatyar claimed that except for the Kandahar air base and themilitary outpost of Spinboldak, all of southeastern Kandaharprovince is under rebel control.   He balked at U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez's proposal forconvening a meeting of all parties to the Afghan dispute, so agovernment acceptable to the rebels, the refugees and Najib'sgovernment can be formed. Cordovez made the proposal in an articlepublished Monday by The Washington Post.   ``There is no place for such a conference,'' Hekmatyar saidThursday. ``We will ourselves elect the Parliament which will formthe government.''   Cordovez brokered the Geneva accord signed by Pakistan,Afghanistan, the United States and the Soviet Union which providedfor Soviet troop withdrawal.</TEXT></DOC>
