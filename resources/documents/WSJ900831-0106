For decades, that name triggered images of burly bad boysroaring down the highway on big black bikes.</LP><TEXT>   It was a mystique molded by popular culture and encouragedby the manufacturer, Harley-Davidson Inc. So what ifleather-clad Marlon Brando didn't really ride a Harley in&quot;The Wild One,&quot; the 1954 movie about a motorcycle-gangleader? People thought he did, and they hankered to hitchalong.   Somewhere, though, the harum-scarum aura of tattooedHell's Angels and Easy Rider-era hippies became as much aliability for Harley-Davidson as an asset. By the early1980s, hurt by leaky, unreliable bikes and plunging marketshare, the lone American motorcycle maker was brushing upagainst bankruptcy. And with baby boomers headed for theirown midlife crises, the company appeared on the verge ofmissing a huge new market.   But it didn't.   Less than a decade later, Harley-Davidson is enticingwhite-collar workers to become weekend warriors. One in threeof today's Harley buyers is a professional or manager. About60% have attended college, up from only 45% in 1984. Theirmedian age is 35, and their median household income has risensharply to $45,000 from $36,000 five years earlier.   All this makes Milwaukee-based Harley the industry'shottest company. Despite price tags that top $15,000 fordressed-up touring bikes, its market share has climbed forsix years in a row. While Japanese competitors were chasingeach other with motorcycles of all sizes, Harley has capturedabout 60% of the market for biggest bikes -- up from 23% in1983. &quot;Harley capitalizes on the impression they have the`real motorcycle,'&quot; says Bruce Johnson of J.D. Power andamp;Associates, a California market-research firm.   Harley-Davidson's turnaround suggests how a company, astimes change, can position a product without dissipating itsmystique. That isn't easy. The marketplace is filled withbrands, such as Coors, Volkswagen and Zenith, that oncecarried, but then lost, a certain cachet. Some letcompetitors erode their market; others failed to realize thatdemographic changes demand new marketing approaches.Successful marketers, says Michael Marsden, professor ofpopular culture at Bowling Green State University in Ohio,&quot;realize their long history and play off it.&quot;   What Harley officials managed to do was broaden theirbikes' appeal while keeping them looking big, mean andAmerican. They improved engine reliability and smoothed thefit and finish -- though even as Harley overtook Honda in thebig-bike market, consumer surveys continued to suggest thatAmerican Honda Motor Co. makes a better motorcycle.   Officials targeted the yuppie generation by smoothingHarley's rougher edges. They told dealers to brighten uptheir stores with more lights. They slapped the Harley nameon cologne and wine coolers. They even competed with bikerclubs such as Hell's Angels with their own Harley OwnersGroup.   &quot;We tried to leave nothing to chance,&quot; says Vaughn L.Beals Jr., Harley's chairman, who headed a 1981management-led leveraged buy-out from AMF Inc. Five yearslater, Harley went public.   The company's restyled mystique captured Todd Van Slyke,for one. The 42-year-old Chicago advertising executive rideshis Harley on weekends with a group called the Rolex Rangers.When you ride a Harley, he says, you're doing something &quot;alittle bit nasty.&quot;   Another devotee is Mike McAlister of Flagstaff, Ariz. Onweekdays, the middle-aged federal government administratorwears a jacket and tie and drives a Honda Accord. Weekends,he dons leather vest, earring and gold neck chain and jumpson his Harley. &quot;This is the real me]&quot; he declares.   Robert Lefton, a St. Louis psychologist, thinks that someHarley buyers are grappling with midlife turmoil, and may seea Harley as a chance to feel free, powerful and, well,virile. &quot;Here you are at middle age, and suddenly you feelyoung,&quot; he says.   Harley's image as a rugged bike goes back decades. In1903, William Harley and the Davidson brothers -- William,Walter and Arthur -- built three motorcycles in theDavidsons' Milwaukee back yard. The bikes were crude buttough; one of the first went 100,000 miles.   They were also all-American. Harleys served as policebikes beginning in 1907 and as scout and dispatch vehicles inboth world wars. In 1953, when Indian Motocycle ManufacturingCo. of Springfield, Mass., stopped making its Indianmotorcycle, Harley was left as the last of what once weremore than 150 U.S. producers.   Harley prospered until its troubles in the late 1970s andearly 1980s forced drastic changes. It successfully lobbiedthe Reagan administration for stiff import tariffs againstJapanese bikes from 1983 to 1987 and then struggled to catchup.   Practically every step Harley took was geared toattracting upscale riders. The first was to improve quality.Officials realized that although blue-collar buyers, loyaland mechanically inclined, might put up with a bike needingfrequent attention, the new generation of Harley riderswouldn't. In 1983 it introduced the so-called evolutionengine, an improvement on the then-familiar V-twin.Reliability increased, and owners no longer had to get theirhands dirty repeatedly fixing their machines.   Harley also reduced vibration on its top-of-the-linetouring bikes by mounting the engines on rubber, and itoffered options such as sophisticated stereo systems andintercoms built into helmets. But the company didn't tinkerwith a few things: Its bikes still come with lots of chromeand iron and a heavy dose of tail-pipe thunder. &quot;It makesyour heart thump a bit,&quot; says Larry Winse, an Arizona dentistwho bought his first Harley in 1985.   Many changes, though, involved marketing, notmanufacturing. Harley officials began wearing red or whiteshirts at motorcycle rallies to dispel the image that Harleyriders wore only black. They revised their ads to lob gentlemessages at yuppies. A 1988 ad by Carmichael-Lynch, Harley'sMinneapolis agency, summed up the appeal with the slogan:&quot;Life should be so simple.&quot; The ad showed a stark 1950skitchen with refrigerator, table, chair -- and a Harley onthe white floor.   Dealers cleaned up their stores, many of which hadconveyed a dark, menacing atmosphere. &quot;Some people told usthey were afraid to walk into a dealership,&quot; says JerryWilke, Harley's vice president of sales and marketing. Thenewest &quot;designer store&quot; dealerships would make a Hell's Angelweep: They sell motorcycle-fashion clothing amid neon lights,mirrored dressing rooms and revolving jewelry cases next tothe 20-W-50 motor oil. Dealers are even advised how to&quot;present a look on a mannequin,&quot; says Clyde Fessler, vicepresident of merchandising.   Harley also worked on its image through licensingagreements, with Mr. Fessler striving to convince retailersthat the bike's black, white and orange logo would attractbusiness, not scare it off. He showed them demographic dataand pictures of celebrities like Kurt Russell and ElizabethTaylor on Harleys. The company tries to let its name appearonly on quality items. In clothing, it monitors cottoncontent and thread counts. And last year's promotionalactivities even included Harley-Davidson fashion night atBloomingdale's.   &quot;As the demographic profile of the baby-boom shifts,&quot; Mr.Fessler says, &quot;so does our program.&quot;   Because motorcycles often are an impulse purchase, one ofHarley's biggest challenges is holding its new customersafter they have bought a bike. Enter the Harley Owners Group,or HOG. Run through local dealers, HOG gives the new riderinstant companionship through organized rides, rallies andcharity runs.   HOG rallies are popular with Harley's new converts, manyof whom shun the tough biker rallies with Harley women whobare their breasts or Harley men who destroy Hondas for fun.Among those at a HOG rally in Phoenix last spring was JerryClark, an IBM engineer who owns six Harleys but sports a&quot;ride straight&quot; pin on his leather vest, and Jean McGrath, aplant dealer who reads books while riding on the back of herhusband's touring bike.   The rallies also give Harley executives a chance to seewhat's on customers' minds. Richard F. Teerlink, chiefexecutive, rode into Phoenix on a new Ultra Glide with hiswife, Ann, on back. Then he held a &quot;town hall&quot; session thatattracted both easy riders in black boots and weekend rebelsin loafers.   One biker asked whether Harley would wimp out and putrubber mounting under the engine of its Softail model.(Probably not.) Another griped that his Fat Boy bike was alemon and wanted to know what the company planned to do aboutit. (A marketing man suggested they talk later.) Somequestions reflected quite different concerns. A gentleman inthe back asked whether Harley-Davidson planned to paydividends on its stock, which is traded on the New York StockExchange. (No.) Another wondered how the company'sacquisition of a recreational-vehicle maker is working out.(So-so.)   So far, Harley has been able to satisfy its new customerswithout alienating the old. Despite a shrinking domesticmarket (last year's industry sales of 217,000 road bikes weredown two-thirds from their 1980 peak), the company sold41,000 motorcycles in the U.S. last year, up from 27,000 in1983. Harley plays only in the super-heavyweight category andlets the Japanese fight over the shrinking market for smallermotorcycles.   Its shareholders have benefited, too. Harley shares,adjusted for June's 2-for-1 stock split, sell for $23, upfrom the $5.50 initial public offering price in 1986. Lastyear's net income surged 38% to a record $32.9 million, or anadjusted $1.91 a share, on sales of $791 million. This year,first-half profits were up 61%.   Nevertheless, after six years of rapid sales growth,Harley may soon face new hazards. Its Holiday Rambler RVdivision is already in a slump, and the higher gasolineprices since the Mideast crisis began bode ill for motor-homesales. A recession could clobber both bike and RV sales.   And Harley's motorcycles may be getting too fashionable.The basic appeal of being bold and different loses somethingwhen nearly everyone seems to be riding a Harley. A few yearsago, the company was happy to persuade Malcolm Forbes, JayLeno and Mickey Rourke to pose for its annual catalog. Today,Harleys are the bike of choice in Hollywood. The unansweredquestion: How many weekend rebels will remain loyal afterHollywood turns to a new toy? &quot;When they get tired of beingbikers, they'll go out and be yachtsmen or whatever the nextthing is,&quot; predicts Carl &quot;Rodent&quot; Metzger, a long-hairedphotographer who travels the country taking pictures ofbikers.   That thought has occurred to Harley and its advisers. Itis one reason the company diversified into RVs in late 1986.   But Harley bets that innovations like HOG will help ithold most of the new riders. Mr. Beals, the chairman, saysU.S. sales have grown steadily, without a sudden boom thatcould lead to a bust. And officials think the fast-expandingforeign sales, now running about 15,000 bikes a year, shouldeventually approach those of the U.S. Exports to Japan arerising, and the company is setting up HOG chapters in Europe.   Harley even sees an untapped market in the U.S. Toencourage more women to ride, the company has formed a&quot;Ladies of Harley&quot; club and come out with a new line oftattoos for women. For those who aren't ready to make alifelong commitment, the tattoos are removable.   ---                         Whole Hog                                                                                                          1989 U.S. market share of super heavyweight motorcycles,in percent                                                                                                        Harley-Davidson                59.1% Honda                          14.9% Suzuki                          9.1% Yamaha                          7.6% Kawasaki                        6.8% Other                           2.5%                                                                                                          Source: R.L.
