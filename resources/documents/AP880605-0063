LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said Sundaythat talks with Iran this week on compensation for damage todiplomatic property are not designed to help win the release ofBritish hostages in Lebanon.   But his deputy, David Mellor, said the talks could ``warm up''relations between Iran and Britain, which worsened after expulsionslast year left only one Iranian diplomat in London and one Britishdiplomat in Tehran.   The Foreign Office said on Saturday that a four-man Iraniandelegation will arrive on Tuesday for talks with Britih officials ondamage to the Iranian Embassy in London and damage to the BritishEmbassy building and other British diplomatic property in Iran.   If an agreement is reached under the British proposal, theForeign Office said, Britain will pay Iran $3.24 million for damageto its embassy in London and give London's Westminster Council$360,000 to maintain the building. Iran would pay Britain $1.6million for damage to British buildings in Iran.   There are 18 foreign hostages held by Moslem extremists inLebanon, including nine Americans and three Britons. The longestheld is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent forThe Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   It is believed the hostages are held by members of thepro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, organization.   David Young, a lawmaker from the opposition Labor Party andvice-chairman of the British-Lebanese Parliamentary Group, said onSunday a compensation deal could mean that Britain was moving towardpaying for the release of the British hostages.   ``It now seems that the government is following the route of theAmericans and the French in buying out their hostages,'' he said.   But Mellor, in an interview on British Broadcasting Corp. radio,dismissed Young's contention as ``absolute rubbish, irresponsiblerubbish.''   In an interview on TV-AM, Howe insisted the talks with theIranians had nothing to do with the British hostages who includeTerry Waite, the archbishop of Canterbury's special envoy whodisappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987.   ``There is an argument about the damage done to the IranianEmbassy premises here and the damage done to our embassy premisesthere,'' Howe said. He added: ``That is what it is about. There isnothing of wider significance. Our policy on hostages is absolutelyclear _ no deals.''   Mellor said Britain had always been prepared to hold talks withIran ``and to warm up relations.''   ``If we can sort out these questions of damage to diplomaticproperties in both of our countries, well, from an acorn grows anoak,'' he said.   From time to time, Britain has raised the question of Iranassisting in the release of the hostages on a purely humanitarianbasis, ``not as a bargaining chip in some rather squalid deal,''Mellor said.   Such a deal would almost certainly make it more likely that otherhostages would be taken and ``drag the name of Britain through themud,'' he added.   The Foreign Office said the compensation talks will focus ondamage to the Iranian Embassy building at London's Princes Gate,which caught fire when British commandos stormed it in 1980 to end ahostage siege, and on damage to British diplomatic buildings and theBritish Embassy in Iran. The British properties were damaged by mobsin 1978, 1979, and 1980.   ``We want compensation for the damage to our property in Iran andwe want to ensure that the necessary repairs are done to the PrincesGate property, which is a health hazard and an eyesore,'' said aForeign Office spokesman Saturday.   Following the release last month of the last three Frenchhostages in Lebanon, families of the missing Britons have beenpressing the government to help secure their release.   Waite disasppeared while on a mission to try to win the releaseof some of the hostages. The other British captives are JohnMcCarthy, a journalist kidnapped April 17, 1986, and Brian Keenan,an English teacher at the American University in Beirut seized April11, 1986. Keenan is from Northern Ireland but holds an Irishpassport.</TEXT></DOC>
