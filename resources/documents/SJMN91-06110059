Maxxam took over Scotia-based Pacific Lumber in a1985 leveraged buyout and later replaced the timber company's pension fundwith an Executive Life annuity.;    State insurance regulators took overExecutive Life a week ago, saying that the big insurer was in danger ofcollapse. At the time, state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said hewould try to ensure that policyholders received their full benefits -- butthat he expected that they would not. Regulators said that payments, whetherfull or partial, might be delayed.;    In a letter to Pacific Lumber employeesand retirees, Maxxam President John M. Seidl said that the state insurancedepartment would ask the court to modify its order governing Executive Life'sconservatorship to allow the uninterrupted payment of annuity checks. Seidlalso said that Maxxam expects Executive Life and the conservator, the state,to honor existing contracts.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CRIS OPPENHEIMER-PITTHAN, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910419  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  238  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday April 19, 199100110059,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
