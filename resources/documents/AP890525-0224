Mission: Collect and share with law enforcement agenciesinformation on drug-, weapon- and alien-smugglers.   Number of arrests: None.   ``Our first task is tactical intelligence _ that which the fieldagents can use to cause an arrest or seizure,'' says WilliamNorsworthy, director of the center at Fort Bliss that publishes itsphone number but reveals little else.   EPIC might tell the Coast Guard where to find a specificmarijuana-laden ship off the Florida coast. Or it might tell theTexas Department of Public Safety who a certain smuggler hangsaround with.   But it looks farther downrange, too.   ``What's going to happen two years from now in what part of theworld? We try to figure that out,'' said Norsworthy.   At EPIC, representatives of 10 federal agencies gather evidenceand piece together a criminological jigsaw puzzle that displaysdrug smugglers and other criminal organizations. The lawenforcement consortium doesn't make seizures or arrests and doesn'ttake credit for the arrests it produces.   ``They are our primary source of intelligence,'' said Jim Bowen,senior tactical coordinator for Operation Alliance, an ElPaso-based union of federal agencies that chases and arrests drugsmugglers along the U.S.-Mexican border. He declined to recountspecific cases in which EPIC information resulted in large-scalebusts.   EPIC started out in 1974 as the Southwest Border IntelligenceService, with 35 employees from the Drug Enforcement Administrationand the Immigration and Naturalization Service working in crampedquarters.   Four years later it had a congressional mandate, a new name, 106employees from six federal agencies and 16,000 square feet of spacein central El Paso.   Now the 15-year-old intelligence network occupies a brand-new,57,000-square-foot building on Fort Bliss, where 200 employees ofthe DEA, INS, Customs Service, Coast Guard, Marshals Service, FBI,Internal Revenue Service, Federal Aviation Administration, SecretService and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms labor 24 hoursa day.   Some of those agencies have been known for fierce turf battles,but Norsworthy said that's rare at EPIC. ``It's pretty unique inthat we all get along good. After 90 to 120 days, agents lose theiragency identity and become part of EPIC.''   EPIC gives Operation Alliance ``threat assessments'' _ dossierson illegal organizations, along with when and where they areexpected to operate next. It prepares similar assessments for theMiami-based Lightning Operations Center, which tries to keep drugshipments out of southern Florida.   Other information goes to the agencies making up EPIC, the leadlaw enforcement agencies in 50 states, the District of Columbia,Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands and Samoa. It gets upwards of300,000 inquiries a year.   Usually, when police ask for information, EPIC asks why.   ``Something made someone make that call _ either he saw or heardsomething,'' Norsworthy said. ``We ask for that information, and webuild on that. We look for patterns and trends all the time.''   Bits of information can be assembled like a puzzle: an ID numberon the tail of a plane, a series of large cash bank deposits andthe sighting of a suspect could start an investigation ending in anarrest and seizure.   Sometimes it turns out that different police agencies areinvestigating the same organization but aren't aware of each other.In those cases, EPIC brings the agencies together and helps plotinvestigation strategies.   Some of the information comes from those cases. Other times,member federal agencies contribute. Some data come from FBI and DEAoffices abroad.   Each agent working at EPIC is limited to the investigativemethods his or her agency is permitted under U.S. law; a wiretap,for example, would require a court order.   If there's any criticism of EPIC among law enforcement agencies,it's that the center's computer system needs to be upgraded.   ``Just bring them up to the state of the art,'' Bowen said.   U.S. Rep. Ron Coleman, D-Texas, represents the district whereEPIC resides. A few years ago, he helped fight off a proposal tomove it to Washington. Now he would like to improve its computers.``My goal is to make it the absolute state-of-the-artintelligence-gathering center in the country,'' he said.   Just how advanced the computer and communications systems are isa secret. Norsworthy isn't telling, but he said a police agencycalling EPIC probably will find the information it wants on asuspect.   ``If he's ever been the subject of an investigation or anassociate of someone who's been the subject of an investigation,''he said, ``chances are pretty good.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for AMs, May 31</NOTE></DOC>
