The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday designated morethan 100 additional counties that must be considered in drawing upnew plans to control air pollution, mostly in urban areas.   Most of the counties are on the edges of 107 metropolitan andrural areas already designated as failing to meet federal standardsfor ozone, carbon monoxide or both.   Not all the new counties are suburban. Nantucket County,Massachusetts, an island 30 miles off Cape Cod, was added to thelist of those that must be considered when new carbon monoxidecontrol plans are drafted by the state.   The counties were picked not because their air is polluted _ inmost of them there are no measurements _ but because census datasuggest they could be contributing to area-wide pollution, such asthrough heavy auto commuting.   Some counties will be dropped as planning goes forward, butthose that remain could find their industries facing additionalcontrols and their residents required to submit their cars forpollution inspections.   ``Clearly what I'm doing is not sufficient to deal with theproblem,'' EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas told a news conference.   Thomas said he was doing nothing that would pre-emptcongressional revisions to the Clean Air Act aimed at eventualcompliance with federal standards, something originally expected in1977.   He said, as he had before, he hoped Congress would tell him whatto do next. But if Congress does not act by Aug. 31, when aneight-month prohibition on sanctions against recalcitrant areasexpires, Thomas said he will require states to come up with newcontrols, as he outlined last November.   EPA had planned to forbid construction of major new pollutionsources in 14 cities when Congress temporarily barred the actionlast December.   EPA lists 68 areas as failing to meet federal ozone standardsand 59 as not meeting carbon monoxide standards, with 20 notmeeting both. Thursday's decision adds 125 counties to the 225counties in the ozone areas and 115 counties to the 96 counties inthe carbon monoxide areas. There is some overlap in the two listsof counties.   Thursday's designations came in expected formal notices to 44state governors and the mayor of the District of Columbia that EPAwas disapproving air pollution control plans, or revoking previousapprovals, for the non-complying ozone and carbon monoxide areas.   Hawaii, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Iowa and Vermonthave no non-complying areas and are not affected.   States have 60 days to submit schedules to complete new plans,which can take two years; to fulfill promises in old plans; tobegin new assessments of actual pollution as opposed to computerestimates; and to add monitors where EPA says they're needed.</TEXT></DOC>
