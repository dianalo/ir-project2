We describe a method to study in vitro the action of LAK cellsagainst three-dimensional tumor tissue. Spherical cell aggregates (spheroids)grown from human glioma cell lines H-2 and U-251 were labeled with 51Crand then incubated for up to 24 h with LAK cells. After the incubation,most spheroids were still macroscopically identifiable, and the measuredreduction of volume did not correlate to the extent of damage. LAK cellsinfiltrated into spheroid tissue slowly as a frontier which explainswhy the specific 51Cr release was clearly slower from spheroids thancorresponding single cell suspensions. The infiltrated area was at 1to 2 h very thin but by 8 to 12 h consisted already of several cell layers.Most H-2 spheroids became totally infiltrated by 16 to 24 h whereas inU-251 spheroids the infiltration usually remained peripheral. In accordancewith the different extent of infiltration, H-2 spheroids were clearlymore sensitive to LAK cells than U-251 spheroids: at E/T ratio 10:1 themean specific 51Cr release by 24 h was 63 and 36%, respectively. A singleexposure to LAK cells released 51Cr from H-2 spheroids approximately12 h but over 24 h from U-251 spheroids. The spheroid model can be usedto study the infiltrative capacity and cytotoxicity of LAK cells againstthree-dimensional tumor tissue, and the method may help to find an optimalmode of local LAK cell therapy, i.e., proper combination of lymphokinesand LAK cells, and proper timing of their administration.</TEXT></DOC>
