Numerical simulation of the global scale dispersion of theradioactive pollutant was carried out by using the operational meteorologicalmodel of the Japan Meteorological Agency. Calculated concentrations inmany places over the world agree well with those observed. The numericalmodel showed that the radioactivity reached Japan about seven days afterthe accident with the maximum concentration of about 10 pCi/m/sup 3/,in agreement with observations.</TEXT></DOC>
