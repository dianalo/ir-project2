It containsa relatively undeformed fill 4 km thick that rests upon continental crustof the Appalachian Orogen. Mid- to Upper Devonian terrigenous strataand volcanics are present locally. The Carboniferous to Permian successionis composed of two fining-upward megasequences, which are separated bya major hiatus. The lower megasequence accumulated over about 27 My,and contains fanglomerates that can be related to contemporaneous strike-slipfaulting. Subsidence to below sea level allowed a prolonged marine incursion,and a subsequent lacustrine phase was followed by uplift of the basinfloor, gentle folding and faulting, erosion and karst weathering. Theupper megasequence accumulated over about 25 My, and indicates renewedsubsidence and largely inactive local faults. Alluvial strata containingcoals, deposited from a long-lived drainage system, record stable tectonicconditions within the basin and the surrounding uplands. Subsidence isattributed to contemporaneous motion on distant fault systems. The hiatusbetween the megasequences represents a phase of renewed tectonic activityand uplift in the Meguma Terrane, with the development of a major sedimentsource and subsequent alluvial sedimentation across the Atlantic region.The increase in abundance of redbeds in Stephanian to Permian times maybe attributed, in part, to an increasingly continental climate followinglandmass suturing and the termination of accretion. 114 refs., 12 figs.,1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
