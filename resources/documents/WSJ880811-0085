The Independent Commission Against Corruption said all were charged in a continuing investigation into stock-exchange operations. The former officials are accused of accepting beneficial interests in shares of companies floating new issues on the exchange.    The commission identified the six as Charles Sin, 52 years old; Kenneth Wong, 57; Cham Siu-leun, 66; John Chong, 53; Joseph Ma, 51; and Edward Woo, 50. All were officials of the exchange until the government ordered a leadership change in January in the wake of the arrest of former chairman Ronald Li, 58. Mr. Li and Jeffrey Sun, another exchange official who was arrested last month, were to appear in court yesterday with the six other former officials.    While the commission said that details of the charges would be announced in court, a statement said Messrs. Sin, Wong, Cham and Chong were charged with accepting preferential allotments of shares in connection with the listings of Video Technology International Ltd. and Q.P.L. (Holdings) Ltd., and with the issuance of new shares in Hysan Development Co.    Messrs. Ma and Woo each were charged with similar offenses in connection with the Q.P.L. and Hysan listings.    Videotech and Hysan executives had no immediate comment on the charges. Q.P.L. executives weren't available for comment.    The six former exchange officials were released on bail. </TEXT></DOC>
