Gorbachev urged thelegislature on Monday to impose a 15-month ban on strikes that hesays are wrecking the Soviet economy and threatening development.   Gorbachev spoke at the end of a stormy two-hour legislativedebate on a proposal of emergency economic measures put forward byFirst Deputy Premier Lev Voronin, the Tass news agency said.   Gorbachev urged legislators to discuss the strike ban overnightand be ready to vote on it Tuesday.   He referred to the possible ban on strikes as a ``necessarymeasure ... which are called for to protect democratization fromanarchy and irresponsible management.''   Plans for future economic development are ``under threat''because of the strikes, he said.   Emergency measures to bolster the rapidly faltering economyovershadowed Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov's lengthy presentation of apackage of legislation covering the government's long-termproposals on property, ownership and use of land, and taxes.   Voronin told the legislature the Soviet economy had lost $6.15billion in July and August alone due to strikes and that suppliesof fuel are low enough that the country might be unable to supplyenough heat to see Soviet citizens through the winter.   The most damaging of a series of strikes to hit the Soviet Unionthis year was a walkout in July by thousands of coal miners in thefar north, Siberia, and the Don Basin of the eastern Ukraine.   That strike alone cost the country millions of rubles, and thegovernment agreed to a package of economic and social improvementsthat officials say will cost about $3 billion.   Strikes also have become a way of expressing ethnic discontent.Such actions have idled the Nagorno-Karabakh region, the center ofa dispute between the neighboring Caucasus republics of Armenia andAzerbaijan.   In Moldavia and Estonia, Russian and other workers walked offjobs at factories and offices during the summer to protest lawsthat they said favored the majority Moldavians and Estonians.   After legislators expressed contradictory viewpoints during adebate, Gorbachev proposed they return Tuesday to vote on thestrike ban, and an overwhelming majority agreed, Tass said.   The package of government proposals also calls for imposing a``special form of administration'' on railroads in Armenia andAzerbaijan, with the ministries of railroads, defense and interiorresponsible for protecting the railroads and their workers.   Armenian activists say Azerbaijani railroad workers recentlyhave blocked the trains that Armenia depends upon for 80 percent ofthe goods brought in from other parts of the Soviet Union.   Food stores have been emptied of many basic goods and there isno fuel even for vehicles such as ambulances.   Gorbachev said when the Supreme Soviet opened its fall sessionSept. 25 that decisive steps would have to be taken if rails toArmenia were not cleared.   Ryzhkov and radical deputies both named the law on property asthe most important of five key economic reforms presented to thelegislature, but they disagreed on what it should say.   Ryzhkov said the central government must learn to refrain frominterfering in local economic affairs _ including its tendency toclaim all forms of property for itself.   ``As long as about 90 percent of the basic means of productionbelong in the framework of one owner _ the government _ all talkabout developing a market will remain empty words, and progress isimpossible,'' he said.   But progressive Deputy Anatoly Sobchak of Leningrad said thegovernment's proposal still started from the point of view that thestate had priority of ownership, and individuals were last.   He said it should be just the opposite.   Ryzhkov said the government saw no reason to allow privateownership of land but supported expanded rights for farmers wholease land on long-term contracts from collective and state farms.</TEXT></DOC>
