The Canadian government also supports a much freer airtraffic arrangement. But a Canadian government spokesman saidCanada will be seeking safeguards &quot;to maintain a viable andcompetitive airline industry.&quot;   Mr. Angevine predicted that removal of restrictions wouldprompt a drop in fares and a proliferation of newcross-border air services, such as occurred between the U.S.and Mexico after they introduced a more liberal air trafficpact in 1988.   Under the current agreement between Canada and the U.S.,airlines may only serve routes specified in the pact, whichwas last revised in 1974. Major U.S. cities, includingAtlanta; Orlando, Fla.; Phoenix, Ariz.; San Diego, and St.Louis, currently have no scheduled nonstop service to Canada.   The U.S. proposed that licensed air carriers be allowed tointroduce air service of any type between U.S. and Canadiancities with rights to proceed to third countries. They wouldbe subject to no fare restrictions.   The current agreement provides 47 routes for U.S. airlinesand 31 routes for Canadian airlines, some of which areduplicated. Of the total, 33 are monopoly routes restrictedto service by only one airline.   The U.S. negotiators proposed lifting restrictions onregional air services between U.S. and Canadian cities. Suchservices are limited to cities with specified populations andno more than 400 miles apart. The service can only beprovided by nonjet planes of no more than 60 seats. Theserestrictions have curbed traffic growth between such citiesas Toronto and Cincinnati, the U.S. negotiators said.   Business groups and cities in both countries have urgedtheir governments to permit freer air travel, arguing thatthe current restrictions limit their ability to takeadvantage of the two-year-old U.S.-Canada free tradeagreement.   On a recent trip to Washington from Ottawa, CanadianTransport Minister Doug Lewis said he spent more time in theairport at Syracuse, N.Y., than he did in the air because ofinadequate air links. &quot;A 90-minute flight became a 3 1/2-hourjourney,&quot; he said.   Mr. Lewis and U.S. Secretary of Transportation SamuelSkinner agreed last October to seek a new &quot;open skies&quot;aviation agreement. Their negotiators, who met in OttawaThursday and Friday, will meet again in Washington in earlyJune. They aim to reach an agreement before the end of thisyear.</TEXT></DOC>
