<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-37-0766 </DOCNO><TEXT>A cohort study of 2103 workers employed between 1942 and 1960 at a uraniummine in the Northwest Territories, Canada, was conducted. A total of57 lung cancer deaths was observed (expected = 24.73, P less than .0001).There was a highly significant linear relationship between exposure andincreased risk of lung cancer, giving estimates for the relative andattributable risk coefficients of 0.27 per working level month (WLM)and 3.10 per WLM per 10(6) person-years. These risk coefficients weresubstantially less than those estimated from the experience of minersin the Beaverlodge mine, which have previously been reported. Any biasesin the present estimates are likely to have been upward, and thereforethey probably represent an upper limit. The major difference betweenthe two mine cohorts is in the exposure rate, since the Port Radium minerswere exposed to much greater concentrations of radon daughters than theBeaverlodge miners. It is postulated that risk of lung cancer from radondaughter exposure may be modified by exposure rate, for which hypothesisthere is some support from other epidemiologic data.</TEXT></DOC>
