Angular distribution of elasticscattering is studied by the Optical Model. The deep well potential andthe shallow well potential optical parameter are obtained and both fitthe experimental results well. By using DWBA and Coupled Channel Theory,in different cases (two channels coupled, three and four channels coupled,with the deep well and the shallow well potential respectively) the angulardistribution of elastic and inelastic scattering are analysed. It isshown that only the shallow well potential parameters fit the experimentdata well. The deformation parameters of some states are deduced.</TEXT></DOC>
