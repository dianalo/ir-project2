 Atsupermarkets throughout the country, the hottest waiting-to-check-out topicis EISA versus Micro Channel.andP;  Over at the quick-lube emporium, you hearnothing but MNP Level 5 versus V.42bis.andP;  And down at the post office, linesof waiting customers engage in endless font-filled disputation over Royal andPostScript.andM;But many of this industry's greatest and best-known standards, refinedthrough years of successive iteration, have never gained officialrecognition.andP;  You recognize them instantly when you see them, yet theseubiquitous archetypes have had neither guidelines nor names--that is, untilnow.andM;Over the past year, the newly formed CCILPV (Comite Consultatif Internationalde Logiciel et Progiciel avec Vins), dedicated to the careful considerationof worldwide standards in a relaxed bistro setting, has begun codifying thestandards that have so far slipped through the cracks.andP;  In secret sessions atVersailles, convened beneath the classic French coat of arms (whose mottotranslates to something about eating cake), members of the organization'svarious subcommittees have been working diligently to create a body of newstandards that conform to recognized industry practices.andP;  The goal is tounite America, Europe, and the rest of the globe in time for the opening ofthe European Common Market in 1992--with the help to of protocols such asthese:andM;BAR (Binder Assembly Required) 2.2.andP;  Propounds an ironclad rule that nothree-ring bound manual may come preassembled with dividers in place; offersadditional recommendations to make the otherwise boring binder-assemblyprocess more challenging and fun for users.andM;SBF (Spiral Binding Formula) 15.andP;  Prescribes that all spiral-bound manualsmust appear absolutely identical when shelved spine out.andM;IO (Index Omission) CP7-7.andP;  Bipartite standard recommends unindexed manualsand also suggests means of rendering indexes useless where inadvertentlysupplied.andM;CP (Chapter Pagination) 4-56-7.7.andP;  Demands that manuals be paginated withinindividual chapters rather than throughout the book to maintain ease ofproduction and updating rather than ease of use.andM;NQS (No Quick Start) X.0.andP;  Mandates that setup instructions be included in aweighty reference volume rather than a slim, pithy quick-start manual.andM;MIS (Mandatory Installation System) 0.1.andP;  Stipulates that programinstallation must always take place from drive A:.andM;SOFA (Standardized Off-standard Format Availability) 1.andP;  A multipart protocolrequiring vendors to offer products in formats other than the ones users areactually like to own.andP;  SOFA 1.1, for example, ensures diskette/drivemismatch; SOFA 1.2 works similarly for jacks and connectors.andP;  Other standardsare reportedly in the works.andM;UPS (Upgrade Path Stymie) 6.7.andP;  Prescribes numerous means of making softwareand hardware upgrades inaccessible to the vast majority of current users byrequiring additional memory, additional hardware devices, costly specialadapters, and so on.andM;UNDOC (Uniform Need for Documentation) 0.2.andP;  Ensures that no salientoperational information (such as jumper settings, basic help, and so on) oridentification (such as function of cable) will appear anywhere on a product,thus requiring consultation of a manual that is certain to be unavailablewhen necessary.andM;NCI (Non-Conforming Interface) F13.andP;  Demands that at least one function inany new software or hardware product work in a substantially different wayfrom all predecessors.andM;MDL (Minimum Difficulty Level) 99.9.andP;  Originally developed for recreationalsoftware, this generic software standard ensures that mastery of even thelowest level will require more time than anyfully employed adult hasavailable.andM;FFC (File Format Change) Level 6.andP;  Requires that each new software upgradeemploy a new file format utterly incompatible with all previous releases, aswell as with all third-party add-on programs.andM;TSRPC (TSR Program Conflict), Parts E and O.andP;  Part E, for TSR programs,ensures noncompliance with standalone software because of interruptconflicts, excessive memory demands, or other incompatibilities.andP;  The similarPart O, for standalone software, ensures noncompliance with TSRs.andM;2BIG (Excessive Memory Utilization)4U.andP;  Requires that device drivers andRAM-resident programs (including network software, described in Subpart Z)occupy sufficient memory that popular standalone programs won't quiterun--or, optionally, will run, but without room for data.andM;VAR (Value Addition Required) 7/70.andP;  Ensures that network systems requireconsultants for successful operation.andM;OS2U (OS/2 Upgrade) 1.3.andP;  Guarantees that IBM versions of OS/2 will not workin their entirely on other computers.andP;  Further guarantees that non-IBMversions will arrive a minimum of six months after the originals.andM;GAS (Graphics Adapter Standard).PC.andP;  Ensures that no VGA card (includingIBM's) will adhere properly to IBM VGA documentation or run the entire suiteof PC Labs benchmark tests.andM;CDXA (CD-ROM Extension Anomalies).andP;  Prescribes that CD-ROM programs conflictwith certain other software and fail to operate under such &quot;advanced&quot;operating systems as OS/2.andM;EEMS (Extended-Expanded Memory Stupefaction) 5.0.andP;  Guarantees utter confusionin all attempts to describe extended and expanded memory functions.andM;NLS (Nationwide Local Support)6.7.andP;  Offers vendor guidelines for maintainingtotal independence from user complaints via a policy of offering support onlythrough dealers who have no idea how to diagnose or fix problems.andM;SCP (Support Call Protocol) 15.6.andP;  Sets standards for the minimum number ofrings, minutes kept on hold, and unavailability of trained help, as well asconsistency and lamenes of excuses.andM;UR (Unnecessary Registration) 7.9.andP;  Strictly limits the use ofregistration-card information to promotional purposes only; prohibits its usefor bug fixes or free upgrade notifications.andM;PDR (Printer Driver Responsibility) 0.0.andP;  Fixes responsibility for thedevelopment of any necessary printer drivers for any purpose whatsoeversquarely on the user.andM;NDP (Network Downtime Procedure) 3.1.andP;  Offers recommendations for determininghow users of a given network installation should pretend to perform theirduties during system outages.andM;U (Standards Development Nomenclature) 3.77bis Level 5.3.andP;  Stipulates thatfuture CCILPV nomenclature is to follow the traditionalinternational-standards policy of incomprehensibility and arbitrariness (asin V.22bis, X.400, and U2), thereby requiring most new CCILPV standards to berenamed next year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
