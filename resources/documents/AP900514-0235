The journal ispublished by the Washington-based Gerontological Society ofAmerica, an association of researchers in aging.   Jacqueline Lowe Worobey of Rutgers University in New Jersy andRonald Angel of the University of Texas at Austin studied 2,498unmarried elderly people. The study group consisted primarily ofnon-Hispanic white female widows. More than half of those studiedwere at least 80 years old, and 40 percent had annual incomes lessthan $7,000.   Worobey and Angel asked participants whether they preferredliving alone, moving into another person's home or having someonemove into theirs, or entering a nursing home.   ``Although the formation of an extended household is an obviousmechanism by which people might pool their resources in order toincrease their aggregate well-being, this option is not readilyadopted,'' the researchers said. ``The strains associated withliving (with family members) appear to outweigh any advantage thatmay result from pooled resources.''   The study did not provide exact figures as to the percentage ofrespondents in each group.</TEXT><NOTE>End advance for May 17</NOTE></DOC>
