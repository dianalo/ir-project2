SchlesingerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GM F LABORAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The day after the United Auto Workers reached a tentative contract with Ford Motor Co., union leaders issued General Motors Corp. an ultimatum: Give us the same thing, or else.    Meanwhile, stock analysts issued their own warning. They would view a Ford-like agreement as a serious burden to the struggling GM, and turn bearish on the already laggard stock.    As contract talks heat up today with the first full-scale meeting between the two sides since August, GM is trying to walk a tightrope between two crucial but conflicting constituencies -- workers and Wall Street. On the surface, the options look lousy: Take a costly strike to break the pattern, or accept the likelihood that even a strike won't soften the union, and swallow whole a pact GM has said it can't afford.    So GM is looking for leeway. It may be able to sign a contract that, while costly, would guarantee jobs yet leave loopholes to make the needed cuts in its work force. While the Ford pact is heralded as an unprecedented job security promise, what really may be unprecedented is its flexibility. It continues a trend in labor relations, where contracts are &quot;living documents&quot; and day-to-day interpretation is as important as the language itself.    &quot;It's a helluva dilemma,&quot; frets one GM official. &quot;We're wracking our brains to see how best to negotiate required differences, but obviously they have the power to break us (with a strike).&quot; However, he adds, &quot;The joint process may end up being the key. Without that, I'd be very downcast.&quot;    The negotiations started in July amid lofty rhetoric of radical revisions in GM's labor relations. Indeed, that would be a welcome change for a company whose past two decades have been scarred by high-profile conflicts. In the 1970s, GM was hurt by one of the costliest work stoppages in recent U.S. history and had a bitter local strike at its Lordstown, Ohio, plant that focused national attention on factory worker alienation. It also tried to dodge the UAW with its &quot;Southern strategy&quot; of opening plants in right-to-work states.    In the 1980s, GM top leadership has vowed to work better with its workers. Still, it has been difficult filtering that message through GM's complex bureaucracy. Those efforts, moreover, have been undercut by a series of public relations blunders, such as paying executive bonuses when workers made concessions or received no profit-sharing.    This past August, the auto maker floated two drastic proposals that would &quot;slaughter the sacred cows,&quot; as company officials put it. GM wanted to get away from many past practices, most notably that of paying fixed wage increases for all workers. It proposed cutting cost-of-living adjustments, tying pay to productivity, and paying assembly and parts workers different wages.    But in late August, when the UAW picked Ford as its pattern-setting company, the chances for a revolution at GM died. Ford did get the union to agree to joint union-management teams at each plant that would recommend in six months ways to improve productivity. But the union offered no guarantees. Essentially, the highly profitable, efficient Ford had no reason to seek major changes, and it didn't.    Now the union, adhering to its long history of pattern bargaining, wants the same thing from GM. &quot;We do have a pattern settlement and that's what we're going to talk about here at General Motors,&quot; UAW President Owen Bieber said at a news conference yesterday. UAW leaders insist that the Ford pact -- which prevents layoffs except during sales slumps, cuts attrition in half, bans plant closings and makes it more costly to transfer work to other companies -- shouldn't impose a hardship on the No. 1 auto maker.    As the union puts it, most of GM's problems stem from mismanagement. The UAW wants to further insulate workers from someone else's mistakes, and to give workers a greater role in those decisions. Union officials say that even GM's least competitive operations can be saved through improving productivity, not worker sacrifice.    GM needs to show workers &quot;that they are an important part of (the company) and that they aren't expendable,&quot; Mr. Bieber said. &quot;I would hope they would begin to talk in positive terms . . . and not spend time talking about how many people and how fast you might lay them off.&quot;    The UAW likes to say the Ford contract &quot;takes a snapshot&quot; of current employment levels and tries to preserve it. But GM officials say that comparative pictures of bloated GM and trim Ford would be like &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; photos from a weight-loss clinic.    Specifically, the company is concerned that by stanching attrition, a Ford-type contract could limit productivity growth to the paltry 2% a year, half of GM's 4% annual attrition. On top of that, the plantclosing ban could make it hard for GM to shed excess capacity.    But the biggest worry is that a pact like Ford's would perpetuate the uncompetitiveness of GM's parts operations. GM claims it employs as many as 54,000 workers to make the kinds of parts Ford buys on the open market -- often from suppliers with labor costs that are less than half of GM's.    GM complains the UAW itself has exacerbated the problem. While winning wage increases for Ford parts workers -- and if the pattern holds, GM parts workers -- the union has in the past two years granted wage and benefit concessions to independent parts companies competing with GM.    But GM may not be able to do anything about it. Even if it were able to persuade the UAW leadership to accept changes, it would be tough to get approval from the rank and file. The past two GM contracts have gotten historically low support of less than 60%. This time, a coalition of dissident local leaders say they will push for rejection of the GM contract if it differs substantially from Ford's.    And while no one rules out the possibility of a strike, many GM officials argue that it wouldn't produce any gains for the company. GM learned that in 1970 when it lost a 67-day showdown over cost of living adjustments. The UAW also made that clear last year in the farm equipment industry, when it refused, even after a fivemonth strike, to let Deere andamp; Co. break the pattern set by Caterpillar Inc.    Even if a prolonged strike did result in the UAW changing its demands, it could seriously damage management's relations with workers, jeopardizing possible productivity improvements later on.    Thus, GM may conclude that it has to live with what it's got. Earlier this week, GM Chairman Roger B. Smith told reporters GM could use the Ford pact as a &quot;framework&quot; for its own contract, albeit with modifications.    Mr. Smith's statement didn't differ in substance from GM's position all along. But it did shift the tone, from complaining that the Ford contract is half-empty, to saying it's half-full. Some within the union and the company interpret them as preparation for explaining why GM will agree to a contract it said all along it couldn't accept.    And to &quot;pragmatists&quot; within GM -- those who say the company can accept evolution rather than revolution -- that isn't such a tragedy. &quot;It may make us take a little more time to get competitive,&quot; says one GM executive, &quot;but maybe we could take a little more time.&quot; That's the way business has been done for years, and anyone who doesn't accept that, they say, &quot;isn't in the real world.&quot;    But some say GM's &quot;real world&quot; has gotten the company into serious trouble, and that now is the time for breaks with tradition. &quot;If we get just another typical union contract where we say 'what does it take to get through the next three years?' that could be the long-term death of General Motors,&quot; says one GM official.    But union staffers say GM should reserve judgment until it fully understands the contract. As company and UAW officials at GM study the Ford pact, flexibilities become more and more apparent.    True, the contract says the company must replace one of every two workers who retire, quit or die. But that can be changed back to one-to-one in certain situations, such as an employee buy-out. And the Ford contract does prohibit plant closings. But if a facility is shut down because its work is shifted elsewhere, that may be allowed as a &quot;consolidation,&quot; and not considered a &quot;closing.&quot; Besides, the Ford contract imposes a $500 million cap. GM probably would set a proportionate, and affordable, limit of roughly $2 billion.    &quot;There will be no major deviations,&quot; insists a UAW official. &quot;When you take a close look at what Ford has done, there's no reason why GM can't do it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
