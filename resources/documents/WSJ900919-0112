The judge's unusual action, which enraged and worriedlawyers in Massachusetts, has sparked a fierce legal battlethat has now reached the state's highest court.</LP><TEXT>   If the judge's fee-cutting is upheld, the life ofcontingency-fee lawyers (and their clients) may never be thesame.   The controversy came when Alan R. Goodman, a Springfield,Mass., attorney, appeared to hit the jackpot in settling apersonal injury case against Browning Ferris Industries Inc.in December.   A contingency fee contract with his client gave Mr.Goodman one-third of the nearly $3 million award -- a tidy$975,000. &quot;He is entitled to be handsomely compensated forwhat he accomplished,&quot; noted John F. Moriarty, the judge inthe Springfield trial.   But not that handsomely, the judge concluded. Althoughneither the client nor anyone else objected to the fee, JudgeMoriarty went on to conclude that it was &quot;unreasonable andexcessive,&quot; so he reduced it by nearly 30%. Now attorneysworry that the case will encourage other judges tosecond-guess the terms of lawyer-client agreements.   &quot;There's not a lawyer in Massachusetts who doesn't knowabout the case,&quot; says Mr. Goodman. &quot;It's a hot issue.&quot;   Mr. Goodman is hardly unbiased, but the Massachusetts BarAssociation says the decision already is creating confusionabout the validity of lawyer-client agreements, and thestandards to be used in future pacts. In afriend-of-the-court brief seeking a reversal of the ruling,it contends the decision will spark unnecessary litigationover fees and prompt attorneys to demand even highercontingency fees, or else avoid such arrangements.   &quot;The substantial adverse effects of this decision onsociety, the courts, litigants and their attorneys must beavoided,&quot; the association argues. The Massachusetts SupremeJudicial Court heard oral arguments on the issue earlier thismonth; its decision is pending.   Contingency-fee pacts, under which an attorney agrees toforgo fees if he loses but to take a hefty percentage --typically 30% to 40% -- of his client's recovery if he wins,is at the center of growing debate. Supporters say the systemenables less affluent plaintiffs to hire top trial lawyers,which, they contend, is why doctors, corporations andliability insurers -- frequent targets of suits seekingdamages -- keep trying to change the system.   &quot;They're trying to make it more difficult for an injuredperson to obtain competent counsel,&quot; says Michael C. Maher,an Orlando, Fla., attorney and president of the Associationof Trial Lawyers of America. &quot;They want an uneven playingfield.&quot;   Mr. Goodman says his client, Donald A. Gagnon, could neverhave afforded a top attorney if required to pay by the hour,the more traditional billing method. Mr. Gagnon waspermanently paralyzed from the waist down when he was struckby a garbage truck owned by Browning-Ferris, a Houston-basedwaste-handling company. For its defense, the company retaineda large Boston law firm, Martin, Magnuson, McCarthy andamp; Kenney.   But critics insist the potentially high payoff ofcontingency-fee arrangements encourages more lawsuits that&quot;puff up&quot; damages, as Martin F. Conner, president of theAmerican Tort Reform Association, puts it. Moreover, theyargue, the all-or-nothing nature of the system promptsplaintiffs lawyers to settle cases -- thus ensuring a fee --even though it may not be in the best interests of theirclients.   &quot;In a system in which over 95% of cases are settled, thewhole notion of contingency looks a little odd,&quot; says Mr.Conner. &quot;We think it needs a lot more regulation -- along thelines of what this judge apparently is doing.&quot;   The push for such regulation has borne fruit. Some states,including Massachusetts, already have adopted legislationthat imposes caps on such fees in medical malpractice cases.And federal procedural rules authorize judges to regulate thefairness of fees in certain types of litigation -- big classactions, for instance, where plaintiffs lawyers sometimesrepresent thousands of plaintiffs with claims totaling tensof millions of dollars.   In Brooklyn, N.Y., last month, U.S. District Judge Jack B.Weinstein capped at 20% the fees that plaintiffs attorneyscan take from certain payments of health claims to asbestosvictims. Given the limited funds available to pay thenationwide personal injury claims, it is &quot;intolerable&quot; that amajor portion has been going to legal fees, the judge said.   But in other areas, regulation of fees is less clear,leading to ad hoc actions such as Judge Moriarty's. The judgesaid in his decision in February that a fee constitutingone-third of a damage award is &quot;reasonable to a point,&quot; butit gets less so as the size of the recovery increases. Evenif the state's medical malpractice cap were applied, Mr.Goodman's fee would work out to be about $300 a hour, thejudge calculated, substantially less than his one-third feecalculated on an hourly basis. The judge also noted that themaximum compensation permitted for appointed counsel inmurder cases is $50 an hour.   In the end, Judge Moriarty devised his own formula,concluding that Mr. Goodman should be paid one-third of thefirst $300,000 recovered, 25% of the next $1.2 million, and20% of anything above $1.5 million.   &quot;At those rates, Mr. Goodman is entitled to an attorney'sfee of $695,000, which I consider to be handsomecompensation,&quot; Judge Moriarty declared. &quot;Anything in excessof that amount would be unreasonable and excessive.&quot;   But Massachusetts attorneys insist Judge Moriarty went toofar, especially when no one had complained about Mr.Goodman's fee. At a hearing to review the fee, Mr. Gagnontestified he was satisfied with the arrangement, and with Mr.Goodman's performance. Paul Keane, lead counsel forBrowning-Ferris, said he was impressed with Mr. Goodman'swork. Even the judge acknowledged that he worked &quot;hard andwell&quot; and achieved a &quot;very favorable&quot; result.   &quot;It's a very unusual situation,&quot; says Mr. Maher. &quot;I'venever seen one like it before.&quot;   In appealing Mr. Goodman's case to the state's supremecourt, Boston attorney Joseph W. Glannon contends a judgeshouldn't be revising a standard contingency-fee contractwhen there isn't any question of fraud, and when thearrangement has worked to the client's advantage. No oneargued in support of Judge Moriarty's decision.   Although the outcome is unpredictable, legal experts saythe case will require the Massachusetts high court to balanceat least two fundamental concepts in American law. One is asort of inherent power of most judges to ensure that legalfees are fair and reasonable. The other is a strong tendencyto respect contracts.   Victor Schwartz, an attorney with Crowell andamp; Moring inWashington, D.C., is one of those who favors more regulationof contingency fees. But he suggests that legislativeremedies may be preferable to judicial intervention such asthis, at least partly because attorneys have a clearer ideaof what to expect.   &quot;If I'm going to get a speeding ticket,&quot; says Mr.Schwartz, &quot;I want to know what the speed limit is.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
