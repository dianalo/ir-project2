TW Services also urged shareholders to withdraw any sharesalready tendered in the bid, which Coniston has amended to $29 ashare in cash for the 81 percent of the company it does not alreadyown.   The tender offer is scheduled to expire Tuesday.   In a letter to Coniston, TW Services Chairman Frank L. Salizzonicalled the offer illusory because it is conditioned on support fromTW's management for a merger agreement and on the withdrawal of TWServices' ``poison pill'' anti-takeover defense.   ``Your `offer' continues to be merely an invitation to enter intomerger negotiations with you,'' Salizzoni said. ``You are alreadyaware of the board's lack of interest in entering intonegotiations.''   Salizzoni said the board concluded the offer was too low.   Keith R. Gollust, a Coniston partner, responded: ``If FrankSalizzoni or the board of directors really believes the offer isillusory then we challenge them to redeem the posion pill. We are ina position to drop all the other conditions and purchase theshares.''   Coniston, a New York-based investment firm that already ownsabout 9.3 million of TW Services' 48.6 million shares, launched atender offer for 15.75 million shares in late October.   Coniston announced Nov. 29 that nearly 30.2 million shares hadbeen tendered, which would give it almost 82 percent of TW Services'outstanding shares. Coniston said it would later acquire theremaining shares in a merger for $29 a share.   The two-step plan was designed to circumvent a Delawareanti-takeover law that restricts hostile bidders from building astake in a company incorporated in that state.   Under TW Services' ``poison pill'' defense plan, purchases inexcess of 20 percent would trigger a provision allowing stockholdersto buy shares at half price, making a takeover prohibitivelyexpensive. Coniston is seeking to have the plan overturned inDelaware Chancery Court.   TW Services owns 1,200 Denny's restaurants, 400 Hardee'sfast-food restaurants, Canteen Corp., a food services company, and27 skilled nursing homes and two retirement living centers.</TEXT></DOC>
