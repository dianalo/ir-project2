EEC and U.S. negotiators agreed over the weekend to form a taskforce to study the dispute over the next 75 days and try to findways to end it.   Frans Andriessen, the leading EEC negotiator, briefed the foreignministers on his talks Saturday with U.S. Trade Representative CarlaHills and other officials.   The foreign ministers said in a statement the creation of aspecial panel was a step in the right direction to prevent afull-fledged trade war.   Hoewver, they stood by the EEC ban on imports of hormone-treaqtedmeat from the United States and other countries.   That ban, which took effect Jan. 1, affects imports of meat andbyproducts from the United States worth $100 million.   The EEC imposed the ban for health reasons. The United Statessays hormone-treated meat poses no health threat to consumers andhas responded by slapping duties on a range of EEC imports worth$100 million.   That in turn led the EEC to threaten retaliation with 100 percenttariffs on $100 million in U.S. imports of dried fruit and walnuts.   But Monday, the EEC ministers refrained from putting that threatinto effect.   Instead, they said they would continue to seek an amicablesolution with Washington. Yet they asked Andriessen to pursue``action within the GATT to get a condemnation of the unilateralmeasures by the United States'' to restrict EEC imports.   The Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is theworld trade organization.   The EEC ministers, who met here for their regular monthlyconsultations, again called on Washington to lift its importrestrictions.   Andriessen's spokesman, Nico Wegter, quoted him as telling theministers, ``The EEC and the United States must get out of thisatmosphere of disputes and, if there are trade difficulties, the twosides should find a solution in a multilateral framework.''   In Washington on Saturday, Andriessen told reporters the UnitedStates had indicated it would lower its retaliatory tariffs by anamount equal to the shipments of hormone-free beef it is able tomake.   He said consideration would be given to doubling the quota of10,000 tons set for shipments of high-quality beef from the UnitedStates. A higher quota would make it more profitable for Americanproducers to raise hormone-free meat.</TEXT></DOC>
