Officials in the Bush administration and several federalagencies say the plan is part of a broad regulatory reviewthat is to accompany a 90-day ban on new regulations.President Bush is expected to announce the regulatorymoratorium in his State of the Union address Tuesday.</LP><TEXT>   The White House is backing a plan to loosen rulesgoverning biotechnology, which has been heavily regulatedsince the 1970s for fear that genetically altered microbescould spread rapidly through the environment, causing largeand unanticipated damage. A senior administration officialsaid that biotechnology research has progressed enough thatscientists can anticipate which genetically altered traitswon't lead to harm. &quot;With benign changes, you don't needgovernment approval,&quot; the official said.   Currently, the Environmental Protection Agency approvesgenetically altered plants or micro-organism that couldspread into the environment. To get EPA approval forpesticides, companies conduct small-scale field tests to seeif genetically engineered products cause harm once released.If the pesticides pass that test, they must be field-testedon areas larger than 10 acres.   According to the administration plan, university reviewboards, rather than the EPA, could decide in some caseswhether field tests are necessary. The administration isexpected to propose that certain genetically engineeredtraits, which haven't yet been determined, wouldn't requirefield testing. A larger field test would be required forpesticides, but it isn't clear whether other geneticallyengineered products would require that large-scale test.   The EPA has been in a battle with the White House Officeof Management and Budget about how to craft rules governingbiotechnology. The EPA has been pushing to keep broadjurisdiction over genetically altered products, and grantonly limited exemptions.   But administration officials say the agency has agreed tosubmit for public comments pesticide regulations that proposereview by university or other outside boards as an &quot;option.&quot;The officials believe that the moratorium will be used to tryto resolve that fight, and push for lessened regulation.   Bruce Mackler, general counsel of the Association ofBiotechnology Companies, Washington, D.C., said theadministration proposal would represent &quot;a great stepforward&quot; and would encourage investment in biotechnology.Biotech regulation &quot;now is like a black box,&quot; he said. &quot;Youput it in, but you never know when it will come out.&quot; The EPAnow is evaluating genetically engineered pesticides and isresponsible for oil-eating microbes, among other products.Last year set a record for new and secondary public offeringsof biotechnology stocks, with the industry raising more than$2 billion.   But Nachama Wilker, executive director for the Council forResponsible Genetics, a watchdog group in Cambridge, Mass.,said that loosening regulation could &quot;endanger public healthand safety.&quot; Universities couldn't be trusted to impartiallydecide which biotech products didn't need field-testing, shesaid, because their review boards are frequently filled withscientists who have financial stakes in biotech companies.   The biotechnology proposals will be overseen by VicePresident Dan Quayle's Council on Competitiveness, which iscoordinating the regulatory review. The goal of the review isto reduce the cost of regulation on business. But it is alsointended to boost President Bush's re-election chances anddeflect charges that he pays little attention to domesticissues and that regulation has grown during his time inoffice.   As part of the review, the administration also intends toissue a report on telecommunications regulation,administration and Federal Communications Commissionofficials say. The report would largely weave togetherpositions taken by the FCC, Commerce Department and JusticeDepartment to increase competition in telecommunications. Butthe administration hopes that having the imprimatur of theWhite House will improve the chances that the changes willoccur.   Among the proposals being considered are auctioning to thehighest bidder frequencies needed for new consumer products,such as calculator-sized telephones, and reducing regulationsso that telephone companies can get into the cable televisionbusiness and cable TV operators can get into the localtelephone business. Many of these changes would requirelegislation.   In addition, the White House will review changes,suggested by the Justice Department, to extend the reach offederal antitrust laws to allow U.S. prosecutors to go afterforeign cartels that lock out U.S. exports. Currently,antitrust enforcers have to prove harm to consumers. Underthe new policy, it would be enough to show harm to exporters,regardless of whether consumers were harmed, says anadministration official.</TEXT></DOC>
