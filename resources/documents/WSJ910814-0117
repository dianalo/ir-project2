The recommendations of the presidential advisory panel'sreport on affordable housing in America included a proposalto deny federal housing money to states and localities thatoppose its recommendations. That is a dangerous step towardrelinquishing powers that belong under local control, such asrent regulations, environmental standards and zoningpolicies.</LP><TEXT>   Whether or not you are an environmentalist, or whether ornot you agree with rent-regulation laws, it is clearly a caseof blackmail when the federal government proposes to cut offfunding in order to impose its opinions on local government.The lack of affordable housing has been caused by thereckless economic policies of the Reagan-Bush era thatincluded a massive reduction of support for our urban areas.For the administration to blame its failures on local rentregulation and environmental concerns is shortsighted andunrealistic.   A myth is being perpetuated that rent regulationsprimarily benefit upper-income people. In reality, mostrent-regulated apartments are occupied by low-income andmiddle-class families and elderly people who have no placeelse to go. As these apartments turn over, they are steadilygoing to market rate.   Instead of using low-income people as scapegoats, weshould talk about the obscene warehousing of apartmentstaking place and the massive reduction of federal housing aidto cities. They are the real causes of the housing crunch.   Rep. Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.)   Washington   ---   Mr. Kemp raises a legitimate issue when he argues thatregulatory obstacles have impeded the construction oflow-income housing. But blaming endangered species forhousing woes is like blaming the health-care crisis on thecommon cold. He views endangered species in isolation, andnot as an intrinsic part of a larger ecosystem. Cast in sucha light, almost any creature becomes an expendable,evolutionary oddity. And &quot;unappealing&quot; ones such as the tigersalamander are hit doubly hard. Yet many such life forms havethrived for millennia. Biologists call them &quot;indicatorspecies&quot; -- their slippery hold on life tells us theecological system that sustains them and us is in jeopardy.   When biologists and community planners work together, amosaic of land use emerges that can include affordablehousing, species protection and a quality of life that wouldotherwise be lost. On the eastern shore of Virginia,biologists are working with planners to create new low-incomeresidential housing and preserve a critical barrier islandecosystem.   We must not use our endangered plants and animals asscapegoats for complex yet solvable human problems.   John C. Sawhill   President and CEO   The Nature Conservancy   Arlington, Va.   ---   I agree with Mr. Kemp that rent control can work againstthe interests of the poor it is meant to help, but I disagreewith his conclusion that environmental rules should bediscarded to accommodate housing. We have abused ourenvironment for too long, and it is no excuse to continuedoing so simply because it would be cheaper and moreconvenient for developers.   Here in Vermont, some people have argued that our strictenvironmental regulations have driven up the cost of housing.But today some housing prices are slipping and developers aretargeting the lower end of the market -- not the high end, asMr. Kemp says happens in regulated states. He shows toolittle faith in the free market.   Philip K. Dodd   Publisher   Vermont Property Owners Report   Montpelier, Vt.   ---   My housing clients and I are pleased that Mr. Kempconcludes that local regulation creates high housing costs.We agree with most of the points he has made, especially theneed to streamline state and local bureaucracies. However, wemust point out that similar circumstances exist at HUDitself. We invite his attention to streamlining regulatoryapprovals within his own agency.   In response to the excesses of the previousadministration, Mr. Kemp has called for tightening HUDguidelines and approvals, including processing insuredmortgages, applications for waivers of rules, and dailycontacts by those seeking to do business with HUD. But insome instances the pendulum has swung to the oppositeextreme, causing regulatory overkill.   For example, HUD recently adopted a policy that will forcebuyers of properties using the low-income-housing tax credit(which is regulated by the states) to jump through a numberof time-consuming, duplicative hoops for approval, all in thename of preventing the buyer from obtaining too much federalhousing subsidy.   What may be saved in subsidies will be more than spent indelays, leading to additional middleman costs, financingcosts and labor costs -- not to mention the additional staffHUD will have to hire to process and review all theapplications. The most difficult, and often the most needed,transactions will not be accomplished, and the poor will onceagain be the victims.   Jerry Levine   Washington   ---   Mr. Kemp says &quot;one little salamander&quot; was responsible forreducing the number of affordable-housing lots on asubdivision in Bridgehampton, Long Island, by 50%. I was theone who discovered the endangered tiger salamander (Ambystomatigrinum) on this site. At the time I was unaware of theproposed subdivision. The salamander and its breeding pondcontained 500 eggs; had they all grown into adults they wouldhave represented as much as 20% of the entire New York Statepopulation of tiger salamander -- that's how low the statepopulation may be]   The subdivision with the salamander is within theboundaries of an area of Southampton Town targeted foracquisition through the efforts of the town, Suffolk Countyand the Nature Conservancy. Mr. Kemp alludes not only tosalamanders as obstacles to affordable housing but also to&quot;NIMBYism.&quot; There were no NIMBYs in this case -- there wereno neighbors.   The developers knew about the acquisition program whenthey submitted their plan. Had they and their consultantsdone their homework, the plan would have been betterconceived when first presented and the tiger-salamanderhabitat would have been put into perpetual &quot;open space,&quot;right from the start.   As it was, the presence of the salamander barely made adifference. The amount of open space preserved went from 52%to 55% -- not enough to undermine an affordable-housingproject as Mr. Kemp misrepresents. As it turned out, thesubdivision has little to do with affordable housing; 10 lotshave been developed, and they and their houses are pricedfrom $169,900 to $219,900. The affordable-housing project isnot affordable after all. It's just another expensivesubdivision in the Hamptons.   Andrew E. Sabin   President   South Fork Natural History Society   Amagansett, N.Y.</TEXT></DOC>
