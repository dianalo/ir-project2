Forest Oil Corporation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Docket No. CP89-2158-000] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">September 29, 1989. </ITAG>Take notice that on September 22, 1989, Forest Oil Corporation (Forest),1500 Colorado National Building, 950 Seventeenth Street, Denver, Colorado80202, filed in Docket No. CP89-2158-000 a petition for a declaratory orderrequesting that certain offshore facilities that Forest intends to constructconstitute production and gathering facilities and are therefore exemptfrom the Commissions' Natural Gas Act (NGA) jurisdiction. In the alternative,Forest seeks a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizingit to undertake construction and operation of the proposed offshore facilities,all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commissionand open to public inspection. Forest states that the proposed facilities consist of three pipelines inthe offshore federal domain to be used for gathering natural gas from wellsattached to offshore production platforms and delivering it to subsea tapswith the jurisdictional interstate transmission lines offshore. Forestrequests expeditious disposition of its petition. Forest states that the largest of the three lines will consist of 5.4 milesof 12\3/4\-inch pipe running from a production platform in Eugene IslandBlock 366 to an existing subsea tap located on TGPL Ship Shoal Eugene IslandBlock 349 Line (referred to as TTT) in Eugene Island Block 342. Foreststates that near its terminus, the proposed line will cross transmissionlines owned by Tarpon Gas Pipeline Company, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company,and Northern Natural Gas Company. Inasmuch as interconnection with anyof these three other pipelines would not have materially shortened theproposed line, and interconnection with these other lines was not feasibledue either to economic or engineering constraints, Forest states that itsproposal represents the shortest line suitable for gathering productionfrom the Block 366 platform for the purpose of delivery to an interstatepipeline. Forest further states that initially, two wells connected to the Block366 platform will be brought on line with an initial combined daily deliverabilityof 90 MMcf per day (MMcfd) and operating pressures of about 1100 psig.Forest states that its present plans include the drilling of two additionalwells on this platform, which will be developed on a schedule intendedto increase deliverability from the platform to a level approximating the100 MMcfd design capacity of the proposed gathering line. Forest aversthat therefore, the 12\3/4\ inch line is sized no greater than necessaryto gather the anticipated production from the block 366 platform for deliveryinto an interstate pipeline. Forest states it does not intend to install compression on the Block 366platform in conjunction with construction of the 12\3/4\ inch line. Compressionmay be installed at some date in the future, but, according to Forest,only if declines in reservoir pressure necessitate compression to maintaindeliverability or to meet pipeline operating pressures. Forest adds that no gas processing will take place on the platform. Foreststates it will flow the gas through a separator on the platform, measurethe stream's condensate and water content, and reinject the liquids intothe gas stream. Any processing will occur at some point onshore. Forest states that its second proposed line will consist of 1.44 milesof 10\3/4\ inch pipeline running from Forest's production platform in EugeneIsland Block 325 to an interconnection at an existng subsea tap with TTTin Eugene Island Block 320. Forest states that this line will not crossany other transmission lines. According to Forest, TTT is the nearest interstatepipeline to the Block 325 platform, and the subsea tap Forest proposesto employ is the nearest feasible point of interconnection with TTT. Forest states that initially, four wells will be brought on line with acombined daily deliverability of 65 MMcfd. Forest states it presently hasplans to drill five more wells on this platform, which will be developedon a schedule that will increase deliverability to a level approximatingthe 100 MMcfd design capacity of the proposed gathering line. Forest statesthat thus, the proposed 10\3/4\ inch line is the shorest possible linesuitable and is sized no greater than necessary for gathering productionfrom the Block 325 platform for delivery into an interstate pipeline. Forest also states that as with the 12\3/4\ inch line, the gas will flowat operating wellhead pressures of about 1100 psig, without compression.Compression would only be added at some later date if declining reservoirpressures necessitate compression to maintain deliverability or to meetTTT's operating pressures. Forest states that liquids resulting from theoperation of a separator to be located on the platform will be transportedonshore via an oil pipeline that will originate on the Block 325 platform.Forest states that further processing, if any, will occur onshore. Forest states that the third proposed line will consist of 0.34 mile of4\1/2\ inch pipe running from Forest's production platform in Ship ShoalBlock 277 to an interconnection with ANR Pipeline Company (ANR) in ShipShoal Block 276. According to Forest, the 4\1/2\ inch line will not crossany other transmission lines, and the ANR interconnection represents thenearest feasible point at which Forest's production can be injected intoan interstate pipeline. Forest states that initially, it will bring online three oil wells, from which the casinghead gas production will amountto approximately 8 MMcfd. After initial deliveries commence, Forest statesit will develop a fourth well, and it is expected that this well will increasethe total casinghead deliverability to approximately the 20 MMcfd capacityof the line. Forest states that the 4\1/2\ line is no larger than necessaryto gather Forest's anticipated production from this platform for deliveryinto an interstate pipeline. Because of the lower operating pressures of the oil wells connected tothe Block 277 platform, Forest states that compression will be necessaryfrom the outset to deliver the casinghead gas that will flow from thisline into ANR's transmission line. Forest states that the Block 277 platformwill contain a separator for the separation of gas from the oil streamand a dehydrator to meet the gas specification requirements of ANR's transmissionline. Forest adds that all other processing of the gas stream will occuronshore. Forest states that the proposed facilities should be found to be nonjurisdictional.However, because time is of the essence and Forest must begin constructionin October 1989 if gas is to begin flowing December 1 as planned, Forestalternatively seeks a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizingconstruction in the event the Commission determines that the proposed facilitiesare subject to NGA jurisdiction. Forest states that it wished to make clearthat its request for alternative relief is made for the purpose of expeditingdisposition of this petition and does not constitute acknowledgment thatthese proposed facilities require certification under the NGA. Additionally, Forest seeks waiver of such Commission Regulations as arenecessary to accept its petition as an application for a certificate. Forestspecifically seeks waiver of andSection;andSection;157.14(a)(6)(D), (14), (17)and (18) of the regulations. To the extent that the Commission deems anyof the omitted material indispensable to the issuance of a certificate,Forest requests that the Commission issue a certificate conditioned uponForest's submitting the essential data in a form acceptable to the Commissionprior to acceptance of any certificate. <T3>Comment date:</T3> October 20, 1989, in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">10.
