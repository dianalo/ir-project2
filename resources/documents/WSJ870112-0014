The Labor Department said the nation's unemployment rate fell to 6.7% of the labor force in December, the lowest level since 6.3% in March 1980. The rate in November was revised to 6.9% from 7%.    Non-farm payroll employment rose a solid 269,000 jobs last month after increasing a revised 239,000 in November. The November gain was previously reported as 249,000. Using a separate measure that counts the military among the employed, the jobless rate last month fell to 6.6% from 6.8%.    Meanwhile, the department's producer price index for finished goods was unchanged last month after rising 0.2% the month before. Producer prices for the year fell 2.5%, the first annual drop since they fell 0.2% in 1963 and the biggest since a 4.6% decline in 1949. Energy prices fell 39.1% in 1986, their biggest plunge since the department began keeping the records in 1973.    In a third report, the Federal Reserve Board said there was a slowdown in the growth of consumer credit in November centered in the auto industry. Credit outstanding rose $4.02 billion, or at an 8.2% annual rate, compared with a revised increase of $7.21 billion, or a 14.8% rate in October. The October rise was earlier reported as $6.78 billion.    The figures &quot;indicate that the economy was quite hale and hardy through last month,&quot; boasted Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. &quot;The new economic year has begun with a roar.&quot;    Many private economists were decidedly less bullish, however. &quot;The economy was chugging along,&quot; said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. &quot;It wasn't sprinting and it wasn't faltering.&quot; He noted that the unemployment report contained both positive and negative indicators.    On the positive side, in addition to the decline in the rate and the rise in payroll employment, the manufacturing sector appeared to be reviving after a prolonged slump. Manufacturing employment rose 31,000 after gaining 41,000 in November and 13,000 in October, and the factory workweek increased to 40.9 hours from 40.8. Manufacturing overtime rose to 3.6 hours a week from 3.5.    At the same time, mining employment, which includes the oil and gas extraction industry, fell 5,000, after dropping 3,000 in November. Construction jobs rose 11,000 after falling 8,000. Overall goods-producing employment, including the manufacturing rise, gained 37,000 after increasing 30,000.    In the service sector, which accounted for 232,000 of the total job increase last month, retail trade employment was practically unchanged, reflecting lower-than-usual holiday hiring. All the figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.    Job gains remained strong in the finance, insurance and real estate industries and in business and health services.    The average workweek for non-farm workers fell to 34.6 hours from 34.8. Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University, called the drop in hours &quot;the one little sour note&quot; in a good report, saying it largely reflected the relatively weak hiring in the retail sector. He noted that construction employment has been basically flat over the past few months, but said &quot;that's good, considering where it's going to go.&quot; The construction industry is widely expected to be weak in the first part of this year, largely as a result of tax-law changes.    Average hourly earnings last month fell to $8.84 from $8.85. The department's hourly earnings index, which excludes wage changes caused by factory overtime and shift differentials, declined to 170.8% of its 1977 average from 170.9% the month before.    The agency's survey of households, which is used in calculating the unemployment rate, showed that civilian employment rose 205,000 last month after gaining 240,000 in November, while the labor force fell 89,000 after rising 261,000.    With this report, the department also announced its annual revision of the seasonal adjustment factors used in calculating the household survey for the past five years. The new figures show that the civilian jobless rate stood at 6.9% in October and November, rather than at 7%, and that the January level, which had been the low point for the year at 6.7%, was actually 6.8%.    The unemployment rate for teen-agers fell 0.9 percentage point but remained high at 17.3%. The rate for blacks fell 0.5 point to 13.7%, while the rate for Hispanics increased 0.9 point to 10.5%.    On producer prices, economists cautioned against expecting last year's impressive performance to be repeated this year. &quot;Nineteen eighty-six was a one-year event,&quot; said Mr. Ratajczak. &quot;It wasn't the beginning of a trend.&quot;    Economists generally expect prices to accelerate this year because the oil-price plunge is apparently over and because of the decline of the dollar against major foreign currencies.    Last month energy prices rose 0.2% after being unchanged the month before. Natural gas prices, however, plunged 6.8% after a 1.4% drop. Mr. Ratajczak expressed surprise at the latest decline in gas prices and predicted they'll show a rise for January. Food prices were down 0.4% in December after a 0.1% drop.    Excluding food and energy, which tend to vary widely from month to month, producer prices were up a scant 0.1% after rising 0.3% in November.    Prices for capital equipment were unchanged last month after rising 0.3% in November.    The department's index for intermediate goods rose 0.2% for the second month in a row. Prices for crude goods fell 1.6% after holding steady in November.    The price figures are also adjusted for predictable seasonal variation. Before adjustment, producer prices in December fell 0.3% to 289.9% of their 1967 average and stood 2.5% below a year earlier.    In the consumer credit report, the Fed said that auto credit expanded a small $844 million in November, reflecting the end of cut-rate financing programs. Auto credit rose $4.27 billion in October and $7.47 billion in September.    Revolving credit grew $1.59 billion after increasing $502 million in October. Mobile-home credit increased $35 million after growing $37 million. Miscellaneous credit, which includes cash loans and certain retail transactions, expanded $1.55 billion after rising $2.4 billion.    At the end of November, consumer credit outstanding totaled $597.55 billion, up 12.7% from a year earlier. The credit figures are also adjusted for seasonal changes.    ---   Here are excerpts from the Labor Department's employment report.
