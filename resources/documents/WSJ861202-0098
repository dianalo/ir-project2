Traders said much of the price gain reflected reaction to news that a pipeline leak had temporarily stopped production at three Occidental Petroleum Corp. oil fields in the North Sea. They said output is likely to resume within days.    News that Iran's oil exports dropped substantially in the past week because of Iraqi air raids in the Persian Gulf also helped prices, analysts said. The Middle East Economic Survey, a respected newsletter published in Nicosia, Cyprus, said Iran's exports fell more than one-third, to less than a million barrels a day, as a result of Iraqi attacks on Kharg Island, Iran's main export terminal.    Heating oil prices, meanwhile, surged on technical factors and colder weather in the Northeast, traders said.    Despite the news, volume was subdued. &quot;The market's pretty quiet; we're not seeing too much action,&quot; said Richard Marose, senior oil analyst for Geldermann Inc., Chicago.    Crude oil futures prices for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 31 cents to $15.31 a barrel. January heating oil contracts rose 1.35 cents a gallon to 44.24 cents.    Spot, or non-contract, prices also gained. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the major U.S. crude blend, rose 30 cents to $15.30 a barrel. And the December price of North Sea Brent, a barometer of European crude oil prices, rose 10 cents to $14.65 a barrel.    Many brokers and analysts expect prices to continue to firm until the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting Dec. 11. Despite skepticism about the cartel's ability to raise prices to $18 a barrel without cutting production, many traders are unwilling to commit themselves to short, or selling, positions, analysts said.    Some traders &quot;are getting nervous about what OPEC is going to pull out of its hat this time,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, oil analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices recovered from their day's lows in a last-minute rally spurred largely by technical program trading. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index contract for December hit a low of 245.10 early in the day but swung back to close at 251.05. Analysts said the rally was driven by program-generated short-covering, or buying contracts to offset those sold earlier. Norman Mains, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said: &quot;There's not been a big fundamental change in market psychology. There's just a general lack of conviction about the market as a whole.&quot; Stock-index futures slumped early, reflecting traders' uncertainty over the Iranian arms affair, analysts said. &quot;Uncertainty is never bullish; it's always bearish,&quot; said Ira Epstein, president of Ira Epstein andamp; Co., Chicago.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle futures prices were mixed. The December contract, which had its first delivery date yesterday, showed the most strength as it continued trading at a discount to cash prices, analysts said. Futures and cash prices tend to converge at the delivery date. Tightness in the supply of cattle ready for market also pushed the December contract higher, analysts said. Most pork belly and hog futures were higher. Hog prices rose on fears that bad weather will limit the movement of animals to slaughter, analysts said.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose in response to a weaker U.S. dollar but closed well below their highs in moderate trading. Platinum prices posted the largest gain, and gold contracts rose for the second consecutive session, largely on short covering, or buying contracts to offset earlier sales, traders said. But the gold rally stalled at the $400-an-ounce level, and the December contract traded on the Commodity Exchange in New York then fell back to close just below $394 an ounce. Traders and analysts cited Soviet and other European selling as the price neared $400, as well as continued weak demand for bullion. &quot;I don't see any gold fever now,&quot; said Bernard Savaiko, senior precious metals analyst for PaineWebber Inc., New York.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Corn futures prices rose as traders' fears about heavy deliveries against the expiring December contract were defused. Deliveries against the contract have been larger than normal, but so far grain processors have accepted most of the delivered corn. Wheat futures also rose amid rumors that a pending U.S. crop payment will include a smaller proportion of so-called generic certificates than expected. Those certificates, redeemable for government-owned commodities, tend to depress prices by making more grain available on the open market. Soybean futures, meanwhile, were little changed in lackluster trading.    COFFEE: Futures prices fell as the New York market, which was closed Thanksgiving Day and Friday, &quot;caught up&quot; with sharp declines in London trading late last week and yesterday, analysts said. Much of the selling was influenced by reports from Brazil that exporters have contracted for large amounts of coffee for which they haven't found buyers. This is a particularly bearish development in light of Brazil's recent purchase of an estimated 600,000 bags of African Robusta coffee, which now seems to be overhanging the market. A bag is 132 pounds. </TEXT></DOC>
