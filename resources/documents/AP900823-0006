National Guard units have a dual role. Guard troops serve as astate militia under the command of governors, but come underfederal jurisdiction if called up by the president.   Members of the Guard and Reserves attend regular meetings intheir home communities and spend two weeks on active duty eachyear. Most guard units are trained for combat; Reserve unitsgeneral serve in such support roles as supply, maintenance,communications and medicine.</TEXT><HEAD>How Many People Are in the Reserves?   Budget documents estimate the size of the Army Reserve at309,200 troops; the Naval Reserve, 153,400; the Air Force Reserve,89,400; the Marine Corps Reserve, 44,000; the Army National Guard,447,300; and the Air National Guard, 116,200.   Short of declaring a national emergency, the president canmobilize up to 200,000 reservists for as long as 180 days.   </HEAD><HEAD>What Is the Role of the Reserves?   More than half of the Army's combat forces and two-thirds of itscombat support and service support manpower are in the ArmyNational Guard and Army Reserve. Two-thirds of the Army's medicalcapacity and three-fourths of its medical evacuation capacity areprovided by reservists.   The Navy Reserve maintains 93 percent of naval cargo handlingbattalions, and the Air Force relies on reserves to man 92 percentof strategic interceptor aircraft in the continental United Statesand two-thirds of its medical evacuation crews.   </HEAD><HEAD>Are Their Civilian Jobs Protected?</HEAD><TEXT>   Under federal law, reservists called out of civilian jobs mustbe treated as any worker on an unpaid leave of absence. When theyreturn, their employers must give them back their jobs _ or jobs ofequal stature _ with full seniority. But a reservist's job can beeliminated while he or she is away if the employer can show thatthe cut would have been made anyway.   Reservists receive military pay while on active duty. When theyreturn to their civilian jobs, they are due any increase in pay orbenefits that other workers received while they were gone.   Though employers aren't required to provide medical benefits,many allow reservists to continue coverage if they pay their ownpremiums. Reservists who serve more than 30 days are covered by themilitary's medical plan.</TEXT></DOC>
