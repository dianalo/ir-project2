The action came about one week after a committee voted topostpone the elections indefinitely, which are scheduled for thefall.   The full council has voted three times previously to postponethe election of ``shadow'' senators and a ``shadow'' representativeafter the city's voters approved the lobbying effort in a 1980referendum.   The unofficial ``shadow'' delegation would have no votingrights. The concept was first used by officials from the Tennesseeterritory prior to its admission to the union in 1796. The group'sonly official duty would be to encourage Congress to adoptlegislation making the nation's capital the 51st state.   ``This is a major victory for us,'' said Dee Hunter, director ofthe Rainbow Coalition's D.C. Statehood office. ``Even without thefunding right now, this will allow the education process _ of cityvoters and those around the country _ to begin.''   Council members said they did not want to include languageproviding public money for the positions out of concern for thecity's budget problems and fears that Congress might block thefunds when it acts on the D.C. appropriations bill later this year.   The measure, however, left open the possibility that money couldbe provided later this month as the the council continuesdeliberations on Mayor Marion Barry's $4 billion budget plan.   Barry's budget includes $400,000 for the posts.   The council defeated an amendment that would have permanentlybarred the city from using city money to pay for them. Severalmembers said use of private funds remained under consideration.   Last fall, the Senate voted 98-2 to shift $150,000 from a citystatehood lobbying commission to anti-drug programs after Sen.Jesse Helms, R-N.C., criticized the statehood lobbying effort aswasteful and irrelevant.</TEXT></DOC>
