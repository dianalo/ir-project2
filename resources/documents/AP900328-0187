Bank of America said Tuesday almost any purchase made by itscustomers using a personal check will be protected for free againstloss, theft, damage or fire for 90 days after purchase.   The protection also automatically doubles the manufacturer'sU.S. warranty, up to one additional year on items such as homeappliances, video equipment, computers, toys and sports equipment.The coverage will be effective almost immediately for the bank'smore than 3 million checking customers.   The move is part of a budding trend by banks to woo depositorsby offering the added services on checking accounts.   Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank in New York plan to startsimilar programs next week, following the lead of First Chicagolast week and several smaller banks, Valley National Bank inPhoenix, Ariz., Napa Valley Bank in California and CrossLandSavings Bank in New York.   ``I think as time goes by, more and more banks will offer thisprotection to their checking customers to remain competitive,''said Chase's marketing vice president, Chester Myszkowski.   Banks aren't the only ones providing this new service. CoastSavings, a California thrift, last week announced a similar plan.   American Express Co. and many bank card companies have beenoffering purchase insurance to premium card holders for more thantwo years.   In addition to providing the protection for check users, Bank ofAmerica also will extend coverage as of April 1 to purchasers usingits regular credit cards. The bank has been offering the service toits premium card holders for 2{ years. Bank of America has 5{million credit card customers.   ``With this service, our customers can save hundreds of dollarsin costly repair or replacement bills,'' said Thomas E. Peterson,vice chairman.   The coverage is being underwritten by National Union FireInsurance Co. of Pittsburgh, and Bank of America has no liabilitiesfor losses, said bank spokeswoman Shirley Rigby Norton.   She declined to disclose the cost of the insurance to the bank,citing proprietary reasons, but said it would not have asignificant impact on the bank's expenses.   ``It's not expensive in what it costs the banks per account,probably less than $1 a year,'' said Robert V. Conte, a broker withCBSI, an insurance marketing company in Harrison, N.Y., that set upthe Chase and First Chicago plans. The underwriter for those plansalso is National Union Fire Insurance Co.   ``There's no comparable policy that consumers can buyindividually,'' he said. ``The extended warranties offered bydealers on things like stereos are expensive and have huge profitmargins built in. Adding it to checking accounts is all the rageall of a sudden.''   The banks' extended warranties may cut into the profits ofretailers who offer their own extended warranties.   But a spokesman for Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., whichoffers a variety of ``maintenance agreements,'' said he ``would notanticipate'' that the bank programs will affect sales of Sears'product coverage.   ``Our coverage does more than extend the manufacturers'warranties, and it can last up to 10 years,'' said Sears spokesmanGordon Jones.   As of April 2, Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, will expand itspurchase protection service now offered only to credit cardcustomers to the bank's 1 million customers who have a combinedchecking and savings account known as Citi-One.   Chase customers with similar ``Better Banking'' accounts willget the coverage as of April 1. The Chase Manhattan Corp. unit hasbeen offering the coverage only to customers using unsecured creditlines and credit cards.   The loss protection plan for all the major banks gives buyers asmuch as $50,000 coverage, limited to the amount of the purchasepaid by check or credit card. The plans have a $2,500 limit forclaims involving jewelry, watches, furs and fine art.   Customers do not have to register to join the programs orregister their purchses. Eligible purchases will be covered only inexcess of other collectible insurance, such as homeowner's ortenant's insurance, and can pick up the deductible from thecustomer's other insurance.   Customers must provide a sales receipt, a copy of their canceledcheck or charge card slip, and damaged merchandise as proof ofpurchase.</TEXT></DOC>
