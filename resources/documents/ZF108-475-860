(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Proof PositiveandM;Even before the advent of desktop color technology, the need to proof, orpreview color images before going to press was always an essential part ofthe production process.andP;  A good color proof provides a reasonable facsimileof what your publication's colors will look like once the pages have rolledoff the printing press.andP;  It helps you make aesthetic design decisions andserves as an early-warning system for catching problems.andP;  Proofs areparticularly important for four-color work, because printing is usually thelargest expense.andP;  If you have to make changes after a job is on the press,the cost can be staggering.andM;There are several options for generating a color proof; the choice depends onyour specific needs.andP;  The quickest and cheapest way to proof a color image isto look at it on a color monitor.andP;  Unless you work with a carefullycalibrated system, however, the monitor's colors won't accurately match whatappears on paper.andP;  This may be adequate if all you need to know is whether acolor is yellow or green, but it's completely useless if you need to be ableto see and fine-tune subtle shades of color.andM;Beyond screen display, there are two basic categories of proofs (see Figure1).andP;  Preseparation proofs, also called digital proofs, are fairly easy togenerate by printing the computer image directly to a color printer or filmrecorder.andP;  Depending on the image and the output device, these proofs can befairly accurate.andP;  However, they aren't as reliable as film proofs, whichrequire that you output four-color film separations on a high-resolutionimagesetter.andM;Digital ProofsandM;Recent advances in color technology have greatly expanded the options forprinting full color directly from the Mac (see &quot;Color on the Page,&quot; May '90Buyer's Guide, page 56).andP;  Thermal-wax printers such as the QMS ColorScript100 and Tektronix Phaser CPS can produce a very decent proof at 300 dpi.andO;Although these devices are extremely useful for previewing color tints andtype in page layouts and for proofing computer-generated artwork, youshouldn't use thermal-wax proofs to make critical color decisions.andP;  They alsocan't accurately render continuous-tone photographs.andP;  Thermal-wax proofs arerelatively inexpensive, costing $1 to $5 per page at a service bureau.andP;  Ifyour output volume makes it more practical to buy a thermal-wax printer, theQMS and Tektronix models -- both of which handle PostScript and provide goodcolor quality -- will set you back around $10,000.andM;If PostScript compatibility isn't an issue, you can proof color on a broadrange of QuickDraw devices.andP;  Inkjet printers such as Hewlett-Packard'sPaintJet ($1,395) and the Tektronix ColorQuick ($2,345) are considerably lessexpensive than thermal-wax printers, so you can probably afford an in-houseunit for instant proofing gratification.andP;  Inkjet printers also print at amuch lower resolution (about 180 dpi), however, making them useful only forbasic proofing of QuickDraw graphics.andP;  They are practically useless if youneed to check text or images with subtle color gradations.andP;  Another inkjetprinter, the Howtek Pixelmaster, offers 240-dpi resolution plus the abilityto output PostScript through a software driver, but it's still barelyadequate as a color-proofing device.andM;Although the color printers that currently interface with the Mac areinadequate by prepress standards, the future holds some promisingtechnologies for preseparation proofing.andP;  Superlative output from the Iris3024 and other high-end inkjet printers has been available to the prepressindustry for years at sky-high prices ($75,000 or so); the imminent additionof a Mac interface may bring these printers to your local service bureau.andO;Sublimal-dye printers are an especially exciting technology.andP;  These machinesvaporize CMYK inks, which blend with each other as they soak into the page;the resulting image resembles a continuous-tone photograph.andP;  The MitsubishiS340-10 has already reached the market, and at $15,995, it may be withinreach of some desktop publishers.andP;  The highly touted Kodak XL7700 ($25,000)and ultra-high-end Du Pont 4Cast printer ($75,000) provide sublimal-dyeoutput that's almost indistinguishable from a photograph.andP;  Color laserprinting may also be a reliable means of generating color proofs.andP;  Canonoffers stunning color on its Color Laser Copier, and it too will soon sprouta Macintosh connection.andM;Film ProofsandM;The most accurate way for you to preview what you'll see on the printed pageis to generate a four-colorproof directly from the separated films that aPostScript image-setter creates.andP;  Because the proof is created from the samefilm that your printer will use to make the press plates, it will give youthe truest rendition of the printed piece.andP;  Film proofs have been used formany years.andP;  Although they are generally the most expensive type of proof --$30 to $50 per page for a set of four films -- film proofs are worth theprice, and there is no real substitute.andM;There are several kinds of film proofs available, each with its ownadvantages and disadvantages.andP;  We can divide these into two basic categories:overlay and laminated.andP;  The overlay method, often referred to as a color key,uses four sheets of acetate that are laid on top of each other to create thefull color image.andP;  The advantage is that the individual layers can be splitapart so that you can view each color plate separately.andP;  This allows you toanalyze in detail the specifics of a color separation, such as the amount ofblack generation or maximum ink densities.andP;  The disadvantage of overlayproofs is that they are not reliable for overall color accuracy.andP;  Thethickness of the acetate and the space between layers tend to produce amisleading image.andM;The laminated proof, also called a match print, provides superior coloraccuracy, but you can't separate the various plates because the four colorlayers are permanently fused together and mounted onto a paper backing by ahigh-pressure roller.andP;  If you prefer, you can laminate the proof directlyonto the same stock that will be used for printing.andP;  If you are usingcustom-mixed spot colors, you may want to use a special kind of laminatedproof called a Cromalin.andP;  A Cromalin is more expensive than a standard matchprint, but it uses powdered inks to produce accurate renditions of customcolors.andP;  Laminated proofs are strongly recommended for any work where coloraccuracy is critical.andP;  In fact, many commercial printers require them for usein compensating for press variables at print time.andM;Even if you use a color printer to produce a color proof from the Mac, youshould strongly consider proofing the film with a color key or match print aswell.andP;  The extra money that you spend here could save you hundreds or eventhousands of dollars down the line.andP;  Although new technologies may soon bringus a more reliable means of accurately producing color proofs directly fromthe computer, there are still no substitutes for the old proofing standards.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
