Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne also said six of the group'sseven Politburo members have been killed.   Upatissa Gamanayake, second-in-command of the ultra-nationalistPeople's Liberation Front, was shot to death Monday night when hetried to escape, Wijeratne said.   Gamanayake, 36, was regarded as heir apparent to the front'sfounding leader, Rohana Wijeweera, who was reportedly killed Sundayalong with his No. 3 man.   A former front leader predicted the group, formed 22 years ago,would disintegrate.   The foreign minister said Gamanayake was captured on informationprovided by Wijeweera and was taking interrogators to a fronthideout when he tried to jump out of the vehicle. Soldiers shot andkilled him, Wijeratne said.   Wijeweera was captured Sunday in the central Kandy hill districtand brought to Colombo, where he was killed, Wijeratne announcedMonday. He said the front's third-in-command, H.B. Herath, waskilled at the same time.   The official said both were killed when Wijeweera was bringingauthorities to the front's headquarters in Colombo. He said Herathpulled a pistol and shot at his colleague and that security forcesthen shot and killed both men.   Wijeratne refused to identify the one Politburo member who hasnot been killed, saying only that he is at large.   The People's Liberation Front began a terror campaign in August1987 to protest the government's signing of an accord intended toend a war by Tamil rebels. The front said the accord granted toomany concessions to Tamils, who comprise about 18 percent of SriLanka's 16 million people.   It accused the Sinhalese-controlled government of selling outits own people and threatened to kill all who supported the accord.   More than 6,000 people have been killed the past years. Thegovernment initially blamed the front for most of the killings, butwhen charred bodies of young Sinhalese men started turning up alongroadsides, officials said pro-government vigilante squads wereslaying suspected front members.   Human rights activists, opposition politicians and frontsupporters also accused government security forces of killing somesuspected front supporters.   Victor Ivan, a former front leader, predicted the front woulddisintegrate with the deaths of Wijeweera and his chief aides.   Ivan was jailed after leading the front's unsuccessful uprisingagainst the government in 1971. Released with other front membersduring a general pardon in 1977, he now edits an independentpolitical magazine.   The People's Liberation Front was founded in 1967 by Wijeweera,an avowed Marxist.   It tried to overthrow the government of Prime Minister SirimavoBandaranaike in 1971, but the uprising was put down and at least20,000 people killed.   The front later dabbled in mainstream politics, then wentunderground before emerging again as a major force in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
