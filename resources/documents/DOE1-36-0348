Hospitals with CT are compared with hospitals without CT.In radiology the substitution effect is investigated, with use of thenumber of radiological performances per clinical patient as a parameter.This parameter proves to decrease in hospitals with a CT, in contrastto hospitals without a CT. The often-expressed opinion that the CT shouldspecifically perform complementary examinations appears incorrect. Asto the efficiency in the hospital this is related to the average hospitalin-patient stay. The average hospital in-patient stay proves to be shorterin hospitals with a CT than in those without a CT. The CT has turnedout to be a very effective expedient which unfortunately, however, isbeing used inefficiently in The Netherlands, owing to limited installation.17 refs.; 6 figs.; 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
