Since malignant tumors with irradiation as an initiatoroften contain DNA aberrations, the DNA content of well-differentiatedthyroid carcinoma in patients with a prior history of low-dose head andneck irradiation was determined and compared with similar nonradiation-associatedlesions. The DNA content of thyroid cancers from 53 patients was determinedwith use of flow cytometry. Sixteen radiation-associated thyroid carcinomas(11 papillary, 3 follicular, and 2 medullary) all were diploid. In agroup of 37 nonradiation-associated tumors, 10 were aneuploid (10 of29 papillary carcinomas and 0 of 2 follicular or 6 medullary carcinomas).This difference in DNA content is significant (p less than 0.02, Fisher'sexact test). These findings were unexpected and suggest that if the initiatingirradiation causes a DNA aberration, this aberration is not reflectedin DNA content as measured by means of flow cytometry.</TEXT></DOC>
