The army, which killed hundreds of people in a crackdown on theprotests over the weekend, reportedly shot and killed at leastthree civilians today.   In Washington, President Bush condemned Chinese authorities forthe ``bloody and violent'' crackdown. He said he was ordering asuspension of American military sales and commerical export ofweapons to China.   One Chinese military source said soldiers fought each otheraround the Nanyuan military air base on the southern outsksirts ofthe city today. He said the fighting was serious.   But residents living near the restricted base said they had seena steady stream of planes landing and taking off but had not seenor heard fighting.   Artillery shelling also was heard in a far northwestern suburb.   Asked whether soldiers were fighting each other, one Westerndiplomat said: ``It's more than that. There is solid evidence.'' Hewould not elaborate.   Chinese sources said the People's Liberation Army is deeplysplit over the government's May 20 decision to declare martial lawand send troops to Beijing. The 38th Army, based around Beijing,reportedly refused to advance on the city.   The source said the 38th was ordered to take over from the 27thArmy, which is responsible for the carnage over the weekend. It isnot clear whether the army is obeying the order.   Although there have been no accurate tallies, more than 1,000people are widely believed to have been killed and thousandsinjured since the army moved to retake Tiananmen Square fromstudent-led protesters.   Philippine Vice Consul Corazon Patarata told a Manila radiostation from Beijing today that the diplomatic community estimates3,000 protesters have been killed by the army.   Protests against the crackdown were reported in severalprovincial cities as the government praised the military attacks asa patriotic effort to put down rioters trying to overthrow thecommunist system.   A Chinese journalist said one man's body was ripped apart withmachine gunfire from his chin to his stomach this morning and threeothers were shot and wounded when 17 truckloads of troops attackeda crowd at a major intersection west of Tiananmen Square.   Chinese witnesses said a girl was shot in the chest around noonwhen troops charged up a narrow residential street near the square.   Two more people died in gunfire from troops who rushed up acentral Beijing street in the late afternoon, other Chinesewitnesses said.   A U.S. Embassy official also said soldiers firedindiscriminately from 50 to 100 military trucks that hurtled down anormally quiet street flanked by a park and foreign embassies. Inthe evening, about 30 tanks took up positions outside an apartmentcomplex for diplomats.   The American and other embassies began sheltering foreignstudents studying at Chinese universities.   Tank and troop convoys moved throughout the night and day, andhelicopters dropped off supplies at Tiananmen Square for thethousands of soldiers occupying the area since they drove outprotesters early Sunday.   Burned-out hulls of buses and military vehicles litteredstreets, which protesters by the thousands refused to quit. Publictransportation was at a standstill and most downtown shops closed.   No Chinese leader has come forth to take responsibility for thedecision to turn the military on civilians, filling hospitals withthe dead and dying, and it was not known how much opposition to themove exists in the government.   Chinese sources said senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 84, orderedthe attack to halt seven weeks of student protests for a freerChina and an end to official corruption. They said Deng was in amilitary hospital being treated for prostate cancer.   Premier Li Peng, who ordered martial law in Beijing, has notappeared in public or commented on the violence. He and old guardideologues, many in their 80s, are believed to support the action.   The massacre has discredited the government, army and CommunistParty and many enraged citizens are calling for revolution.   Before the massive weekend attack, hundreds of thousands ofpeople had thwarted troop movements into the city.   In eastern Beijing, soldiers let off several bursts of automaticrifle fire today as seven military trucks moved on an intersectionwhere crowds had set several army vehicles ablaze.   In Shanghai, the country's largest city, thousands of studentstoday blocked intersections, and in the southern provincial capitalof Changsha, sources said. They said thousands of students in thenortheastern cities of Shenyang and Changchun marched Sunday inmourning.   The people's defiance was symbolized in Tiananmen Square thismorning when a man wearing a white shirt ran in front of a tankcolumn and momentarily brought it to a halt. The man climbed on thelead tank, got down and again moved to block its way when the tanktried to drive around him. Finally, five or six people rushed fromthe crowd at the side and dragged him to safety.   Hundreds of people fled in panic when the column of 21 tanks andarmored personnel carriers pulled out of the square and headedeastward. Many rode bicycles in front of the convoy. Somebicyclists stopped in the road, seemingly daring the soldiers toshoot.   The street battles have paralyzed the city of 10 million,stopping all traffic in many locations and keeping thousands fromtheir jobs.   Soldiers had yet to move into campuses. At the Political Scienceand Law College, a dead student was laid out on a table, withpeople filing by.   ``The Chinese government is already crazy,'' a 24-year-old womansaid.   At Beijing University students put up slogans reading ``rememberour heroes. A blood death will be repaid in blood.''   On Changan Avenue, the main east-west street, bicyclists todaythreaded their way through tangles of road dividers smashed bytanks and gutted buses crowds used in an attempt to stop themilitary advance.   People on the streets universally condemned the government andmilitary. Many had tales of people killed or maimed byindiscriminate firing.   ``It's just repulsive the lengths they went to,'' said onedoctor in a hospital filled with corpses.</TEXT></DOC>
