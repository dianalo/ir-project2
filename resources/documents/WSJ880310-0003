For the third day in a row, most interest rates were flat.    Several investment managers say they are postponing any major moves until the release of a few government economic reports over the next week. Tomorrow, the government will report retail sales and producer prices for February. Analysts are especially edgy about a report to be released a week from today on the nation's merchandise trade deficit for January.    &quot;The economy has been sending out a lot of ambiguous signals lately,&quot; said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. &quot;There are a lot of nervous people out there who don't want to put a lot of money to work&quot; until a clearer picture emerges. All this week, he said, the credit markets &quot;really have been dull.&quot;    But the bond markets were anything but dull last Friday after the Labor Department reported a much larger increase in February employment than most analysts had expected. Bond prices fell sharply as many analysts concluded that they had underestimated the economy's resiliency and thus that the Federal Reserve won't reduce short-term interest rates any further.    &quot;I think interest rates have hit bottom, for all practical purposes,&quot; said Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve Board governor who now is chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington, D.C. &quot;I base that on the judgment that the economy is turning out stronger than market participants had anticipated.&quot; Any hopes for additional credit-easing by the Fed &quot;are turning out to be groundless,&quot; he said.    The monthly trade figures, which are notoriously volatile, have become the most closely watched of all the government's statistics. When they contain major surprises, as they often have during the past several months, they can trigger major mood swings in all the financial markets.    As a result, bond trading activity often slows to a trickle just before the trade figures are released as few traders are bold enough to place sizable bets on the outcome. Next week's report is expected to show the trade gap in January was about the same as December's $12.2 billion deficit. According to the median estimate of 40 analysts surveyed last Friday by MMS International in Redwood City, Calif., the trade gap rose slightly to $13 billion. But individual estimates ranged widely, from $11 billion to $14.7 billion.    In the bond market yesterday, the yield on the most actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds remained unchanged at 8.52%. The yield on the most actively traded 10-year Treasury notes remained unchanged at 8.31%. Many corporate bonds also were unchanged.    Rates on short-term Treasury bills fell slightly. The rate on the latest three-month bills declined to 5.72% bid from 5.74% Tuesday. The latest six-month bill rate slid to 5.83% bid from 5.87%, while one-year bill rates dipped to 6.27% from 6.28%.    The federal funds rate averaged about 6 3/8% yesterday, nearly the same as Tuesday's average of 6.36%. Analysts say the rate on funds, or overnight loans between banks, has been artifically depressed lately because of technical factors and probably will climb back up to the 6 1/2% to 6 5/8% range soon.    In other bond market developments:   --An index of long-term U.S. Government bonds, compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., rose 1.08 points to 1300.16. It ranged between 1295.68 and 1301.57.    --The price of the government's 8 7/8% bonds due in 2017 rose slightly to 103 27/32 from 103 24/32.    --The government's 8 1/8% notes due in 1998 were quoted late in the day at 98 25/32, up only 1/32 from 98 24/32. </TEXT></DOC>
