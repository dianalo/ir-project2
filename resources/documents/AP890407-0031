In 1983, DCI (Director of Central Intelligence) Casey askedSecretary of Defense Weinberger if the Department of Defense couldobtain infantry weapons that Israel had confiscated from PLOforces. Following discussions between Major General Meron of Israeland Retired Major General Richard Secord of the United Statesgovernment, Israel secretly provided several hundred tons ofweapons to the DoD on a grant basis in May 1983. This was known asOperation ``Tipped Kettle.'' In February 1984, the CIA again askedDoD if it could obtain additional PLO weapons from Israel at littleor no cost for CIA operational use. After negotiations betweenMarch 1984 and July 1984, Israel secretly provided the additionalweapons to DoD in Operation ``Tipped Kettle II.'' The DoD thentransferred the weapons to the CIA. Although CIA advised Congressthat the weapons would be used for various purposes, in fact manyof them were provided to the Nicaraguan resistance as appropriatedfunds ran out.   The effort to funnel materiel to the Contras at a time whenthere were limits on the amount of funds the USG could spend tosupport the resistance also found expression in 1984 in Project``Elephant Herd,'' under which the CIA was to stockpile weapons andmateriel provided by DoD at the lowest possible cost under theEconomy Act. ...</TEXT><HEAD>(Search for Support)</HEAD><TEXT>   2. In late March 1984, National Security Adviser Robert C.McFarlane suggested that he pursue funding alternatives for the(Nicaraguan) resistance for use after congressional funding ranout. ...   4. In early 1984, in a discussion with the ambassador from SaudiArabia, McFarlane encouraged that country to support theresistance. A short time later, the ambassador informed McFarlanethat his government would contribute $1 million per month. Themoney became available during the early summer of 1984.   5. On June 25, 1984, the National Security Planning Group(``NSPG'') _ including President Reagan, Vice President Bush,Secretary of State Shultz, Secretary of Defense Weinberger, DCI(Director of Central Intelligence) Casey, U.N. AmbassadorKirkpatrick, CJCS (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) Vessey,Admiral Moreau, Counselor to the President Meese, McFarlane andAdmiral Poindexter (among others) _ discussed third country fundingfor the resistance. ...   7. At a meeting in mid-July 1984 between DCI Casey, Deputy DCIJohn McMahon and Deputy Secretary of State Dam, Casey indicatedthat those present ought to get moving on non-USG (U.S. government)funding for the resistance since Attorney General Smith hadrecently concluded that raising the funds in this manner would notbe an impeachable offense, as had been suggested at the NSPGmeeting on June 25, 1984. ...   16. In early 1985, President Reagan urged the head of state ofSaudi Arabia to continue its support for the resistance. SaudiArabia subsequently made a contribution of more than $25 million....   20. In mid-April 1985, Lt. Col. North advised McFarlane that theresistance had received a total of $24.5 million since appropriatedfunds had run out, of which more than $17 million had gone forarms, munitions, combat operations, and combat support activities....   22. In early August 1985, the White House and various CIAstations learned of reports that, during the visit of David Kimcheto the U.S. in May 1985, he had met with Michael Armacost, the U.S.undersecretary for political affairs, and had negotiated thecontinuation of military aid from Israel to Central America. ...   32. In mid-May 1986, Donald Fortier, the director ofpolitical-military affairs at the NSC, was advised that thesituation for the resistance was bleak. President Reagan needed topursue means of obtaining additional aid promptly, includingtalking personally to heads of state to tell them that he wasdispatching a special emissary with his personal request for theirassistance to the resistance. ...</TEXT><HEAD>(Help from Honduras)</HEAD><TEXT>   42. In early July 1984, a CIA officer reported to CIAheadquarters that Honduras was taking the position that it wouldcontinue to support the resistance following the U.S. fundingcutoff, but resistance operations would have to be covert to avoidpolitical embarrassment to Honduras.   43. In mid-August 1984, Poindexter discussed with PresidentReagan and others a proposal ascribed to Secretary Shultz thatwould permit Congress to ``wink'' at lethal support for theresistance. Under Shultz's plan, the U.S. government would supplynon-lethal aid directly to the resistance. The U.S. governmentwould provide military aid to El Salvador, which in turn wouldprovide lethal aid to the Resistance. ...   53. On February 19, 1985, McFarlane sent a memorandum toPresident Reagan informing him of the recommendation of the CPPG(Crisis Pre-Planning Group) to provide incentives to Honduras sothat it would maintain its aid to the resistance. ... It furtherrecommended a presidential letter to the leader of Honduras, to bedelivered by an emissary who would very privately explain U.S.criteria for the expedited economic support, security assistancedeliveries, and other support. President Reagan personallyauthorized the entire plan.   54. Later in February 1985, President Reagan sent theagreed-upon message to (Honduran President) Suazo via the U.S.ambassador. The letter urged that Honduras do all in its power tosupport ``those who struggle for freedom and democracy.'' Shortlythereafter, McFarlane sent a memorandum to Shultz, Weinberger,Casey, and Vessey informing them that President Reagan's letter hadbeen sent and proposing steps to be taken to implement thepresident's intent. The memorandum requested DoD (Department ofDefense) to commence expedited delivery of military items, aspreviously planned and personally authorized by President Reagan,and it requested necessary documentation to enhance other supportprograms in Honduras. ...   58. When Vice President Bush met with President Suazo, Bush toldSuazo that President Reagan had directed expedited delivery of U.S.military items to Honduras. Vice President Bush also informed Suazothat President Reagan had directed that currently withheld economicassistance for Honduras should be released; that the United Stateswould provide from its own military stocks critical securityassistance items that had been ordered by Honduran armed forces,and that several security programs under way for Honduran securityforces would be enhanced. ...</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
