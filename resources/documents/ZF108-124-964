 19, 1989), three low-cost solutions are now available thatgive dedicated color scanners a run for their money: Microtek Lab Inc.'sMSF-300Z color and gray-scale scanner; Sharp Electronics Corp.'s JX-100 colorhand scanner; and Colorset, software and color filters from StudiotronicsInc. that work with existing flatbed gray-scale scanners.andM;All three of these relatively inexpensive color scanners require a colorMacintosh system with a hard disk and at least 2 Mbytes of RAM (4 Mbytes arerecommended).andP;  A color monitor with a 24- or 32-bit video card will displaythe best-looking images, but all these systems also will work on an eight-bitcolor system running on a 32-bit QuickDraw operating system.andM;Color filter principle.andP;  These products all use the same color filter conceptin the color scanning process.andP;  The Microtek and Sharp units have built-inred, green and blue (RGB) filters that are positioned automatically duringthe scanning process.andP;  Colorset requires that the user position the filtersbefore each scan.andP;  In all three processes, three gray-scale scans are made,one with each of the color filters in place.andP;  The final color image is thenrecombined from the separate scans by adding hue (color) back to the filteredscans.andP;  The quality of the three gray-scale scans and the amount of controlthe user has over brightness and contrast settings have a major effect on thequality of the final color image.andM;Microtek's MSF-300Z.andP;  The MSF-300Z is a stationary flatbed scanner with amaximum scanning area of 8.5 by 14 inches and maximum resolution of 300 dpi.andO;Its light source is a single fluorescent bulb and the scan head uses acharge-coupled device (CCD) sensor.andP;  When scanning in color, the scan headmakes three passes over the original image, one for each RGB component.andP;  Thescan head makes a single pass when scanning in monochrome.andM;The MSF-300Z's Mac interface kit includes the MS-SCSI/G SCSI interface aswell as scanning and editing software.andP;  Bundled software includes theMicrotek Bandamp;W DA, a desk accessory for black-and-white and gray-scalescanning; the Microtek Color DA for color scanning; and scanning modules forDigital Darkroom from Silicon Beach Software Inc. of San Diego andImageStudio from Letraset of Paramus, N.J.andP;  Bundled editing software includesSuperPaint 2.0 from Silicon Beach; Digital Darkroom 1.1; and PhotoMacEdit1.12 from Avalon Development Group of Marlboro, Mass.andM;SCSI cables are not included in the Mac interface kit.andP;  The MS-SCSI/G returnsa SCSI connector, so you can daisychain other devices from the interface.andO;The SCSI interface ships with neither external nor internal SCSI termination.andO;Microtek supplies four resistors so the user can add internal SCSItermination if desired.andP;  Unfortunately, the device's SCSI ID also is setinternally.andP;  Thankfully, the SCSI interface manual contains very clearinstructions.andM;The Microtek Color DA scans only in color mode, at eight bits per RGBcomponent.andP;  Black-and-white or gray-scale scanning is available with theMicrotek Bandamp;W DA or with the scanning modules for Digital Darkroom andImageStudio.andM;Images can be previewed before scanning and the actual scanning area can bepreset, which saves disk space and scanning time.andP;  Color also can becorrected before scanning by adjusting the brightness of each of the RGBcomponents in 3 percent increments.andP;  It is possible to dim the components asmuch as 18 percent or to brighten them as much as 21 percent.andP;  The MicrotekColor DA cannot correct color in an image once it has been scanned.andM;The Microtek Color DA scans images to disk, so image size is limited only byavailable disk space.andP;  Resolution settings range from 75 dpi to 300 dpi, inincrements of about 15 dpi.andP;  Scaling factors can be set from 25 percent to400 percent.andP;  The chosen resolution affects the range of scaling factorsavailable: At 75 dpi, scaling factors of 100 percent to 400 percent arepossible; at 150 dpi, scaling factors range from 50 percent to 200 percent.andM;Images are saved in either PICT (eight-bit color) or TIFF (24-bit color)format.andP;  When saving in PICT format the user has a choice of paint or desktoppublishing formats.andP;  PICT Paint, which maps the image to the screen dot fordot, is most useful for color paint programs.andP;  PICT DTP is suggested for usewith page-layout software, displaying the image with its correct dimensions,regardless of the resolution of the scan.andM;PhotoMacEdit has all the color editing features of PhotoMac, except for itscolor separation capability.andP;  Images scanned with Microtek Color DA can beopened in PhotoMacEdit and edited.andP;  File formats supported are PICT (eight-or 24-bit color) and TIFF (24-bit color).andM;PhotoMacEdit uses a virtual memory system, allowing it to work with verylarge color images.andP;  It requires a minimum of 2 Mbytes of RAM and enough diskspace to store and manipulate a given image.andP;  Up to three temporary copies ofthe image are created during an editing session, so the disk space requireddepends on the size of the original file.andM;PhotoMacEdit works with 24-bit full color information, but displays only 256colors at a time, based on a customized color palette.andP;  During the worksession, the color palette is optimized for the portion of the image beingviewed.andM;Sharp JX-100.andP;  The JX-100 is a portable flatbed scanner with an effectivescan area of 3.93 by 6.29 inches and a maximum resolution of 200 dpi.andP;  TheJX-100's light source is a fluorescent bulb, and it uses a CCD sensor.andP;  Thescan head makes three passes for color scanning and a single pass formonochromatic scanning.andP;  The JX-100 uses an RS-232C high-speed serialinterface, but scans slowly compared with SCSI devices.andM;The JX-100 operates on the same principle as a full-sized flatbed scanner, inthe sense that the original image lies flat on a glass bed and the scan headpasses across it.andP;  However, the original image lies face up and the scanneris laid on top of it, which means that the JX-100 is upside down.andO;Registration is critical during the three passes in color scanning.andP;  Thescanner and original must not move during the scan process.andP;  To scan 3-Dobjects or bound pages, you can flip the JX-100 over and lay the original onthe glass scan window facing down.andM;The original image is aligned by viewing through the scan window and squaringup the scanner.andP;  Markings on the bottom scan window show the limits of theeffective scan area and aid in alignment.andM;ChromaScan 100 scanning software from Imagenesis is bundled with the JX-100.andO;Scanning modes are one-bit black and white; eight-bit gray scale; and eight-,16- and 24-bit color.andP;  The scan resolution can be set in fractional valuesfrom 20 dpi to 200 dpi.andP;  The scaling factor can also be set in fractionalvalues from 10 percent to 100 percent.andP;  ChromaScan only scans to memory, soimage size is limited by available RAM (4 Mbytes of RAM is the minimum).andM;Apple's standard color palette and custom color palettes are supported ineight-bit mode.andP;  Custom palettes allow you to tailor the color look-up tableso that an image's eight-bit color display will be more pleasing.andP;  However,not all applications support custom color palettes, so you may not be able totake advantage of this feature.andP;  ChromaScan's dithering option also smoothsscreen display in eight-bit color mode.andM;ChromaScan's preview function eases scanner setup.andP;  The Tone Control Panelgives you control over contrast, brightness, exponential correction and tintduring the scanning process.andP;  The program's manual includes a good discussionof these functions, but experimentation is still required.andP;  Custom scansettings can be saved for later use.andM;ChromaScan cannot modify an image once it has been scanned, so alladjustments must be made beforehand.andP;  The color images created by ChromaScancan be edited in programs such as PhotoMac or ColorStudio from Letraset.andM;PICT2 is the only file format supported for saving images.andP;  Output size canbe specified in pixels or inches.andP;  Pixel mode, similar to Microtek's PICTPaint format, maps the image to the screen dot for dot.andP;  The other mode,similar to Microtek's PICT DTP format, displays the image with its correctdimensions, regardless of the resolution of the scan.andM;Colorset.andP;  The Colorset package includes a software application and a set ofcolor filters that together allow you to obtain color images from flatbedgray-scale scanners.andP;  You must scan in gray-scale or halftone mode, and yourscanning software must be able to save in TIFF format.andM;The scanning procedure is simple but not automatic.andP;  First, tape the originalimage down to the scanner.andP;  Next, scan the image three times, each time withone of the color filters between the image and the scan head.andP;  Then launchColorset to combine the three gray-scale images into a single color image.andM;For the best image quality, you must compensate for the darkening effect ofthe color filters by adjusting brightness and contrast before the threegray-scale images are created.andP;  Colorset includes suggested settings forcalibrating Hewlett-Packard Co.'s ScanJet Plus, the Abaton Scan 300/S and300/GS, Xerox Datacopy's Grayscale scanner, and the Apple scanner with theirbundled software.andP;  Also included are guidelines for calibrating othergray-scale scanners.andP;  Microtek scanners do not allow brightness and contrastadjustments when scanning in gray-scale mode, so the resulting Colorsetimages are less than satisfactory.andP;  We got the best results with the HPScanJet Plus (see illustrations, Page 33).andM;Colorset allows you to create and modify images in either eight-bit palettemode, or non-palette mode (16- or 24-bit data).andP;  Color editing is much fasterin palette mode than non-palette mode.andM;Editing tools include an eyedropper for picking up and editing individualcolors, a pencil for drawing and a brush for selecting color ranges orportions of the image to edit with the color correction tools.andP;  Brightnessand contrast can be adjusted for each RGB component of the selected colors orimage areas.andP;  Images can be edited after they've been opened in color orafter they've been saved in PICT format (Colorset cannot open color TIFFfiles).andM;The final image can be saved in PICT (eight-, 16- or 24-bit color), colorTIFF, or gray-scale TIFF.andP;  When saving in the gray-scale mode, TIFF turns afour-bit gray-scale scan into an eight-bit image.andP;  An image scanned on afour-bit scanner will only contain 12 bits of color data, even thoughColor-set will save it in a 16-bit data structure.andM;Also included in the Colorset product is an external command, ShowScan, forinstallation in HyperCard stacks.andP;  Once installed, Show-Scan can be invokedfrom a script or message box to display a Colorset PICT image.andM;Conclusions.andP;  If you're in the market for a full-size gray-scale scanner andyou also need to scan color images, the Microtek MSF-300Z is a good, reliablechoice.andP;  For $500 more than Microtek's MSF-300G eight-bit gray-scale scanner,you can have full color capability.andP;  Setup and operation are easy.andP;  Thebundled color scanning software does a good job scanning at its defaultsettings and allows for adjustments before scanning.andP;  With the bundledediting software, images can be manipulated further after they've beenscanned.andP;  We wish that the MSF-300Z allowed brightness and contrastadjustment in the gray-scale scanning mode.andM;If you need to scan color images smaller than 4 by 6.5 inches, and you canlive with the speed of a serial interface, the Sharp JX-100 is a good choice.andO;Setup is even easier than with the Microtek SCSI device, and operation issimple and straightforward.andP;  Its resolution and scaling capabilities don'tmatch the Microtek's, but they are adequate for many applications.andO;ChromaScan also does a reasonable job of scanning at its default settings,and it allows even greater flexibility in color adjustment before scanningthan Microtek's Color DA.andP;  However, scan size is limited by available RAM.andM;If you already own a flatbed gray-scale scanner you might want to considerColorset.andP;  With Colorset, we were not able to produce images of the samequality as those scanned with the Microtek and Sharp scanners at theirdefault settings.andP;  Colorset's editing tools were also not capable ofmanipulating these images to the same quality as the Microtek and Sharp.andM;Studiotronics is working on an upgrade that will include direct scannercontrol and greater control of brightness and contrast settings than mostscanner software now allows.andP;  This new version should improve image quality,but we question the value of this product at its current price.andM;Mary Westland is a graphic artist, trainer and writer working inSouthborough, Mass.andM;The process color reproductions of the Pantone standards shown in thisarticle may not match the solid color standards.andP;  They are for illustrativepurposes only.andM;We reviewed three low-cost color scanning solutions that each use software toextract color from three gray-scale passes of the original material.andP;  TheMicrotek and Sharp are hardware/software solutions; Colorset is asoftware-only product that can be used with a variety of existing scanners.andM;The Microtek MSF-300Z is easy to set up and operate.andP;  It has a standard SCSIinterface, but the ID number can only be set internally.andP;  The full-sizescanner comes bundled with monochrome and color scanning and editingsoftware, including plug-in modules for Silicon Beach's Digital Darkroom andLetraset's ImageStudio.andP;  The software scans to disk, so scan size is notlimited by available memory.andP;  A major drawback is that brightness andcontrast cannot be adjusted before scanning in gray-scale mode.andM;The Sharp JX-100 hand scanner is easy to set up, but because of its serialinterface it takes much more time to complete a scan than does the Microtek.andO;Its image area is limited to about 4 by 6 inches, and scan file size isrestricted to available memory.andP;  To its credit, the Sharp has a sideways scanfeature that allows for image rotation during a scan, and the bundledChromaScan software can be used with full-sized flatbed scanners for largerimages.andM;Results with the Sharp are almost as good as with the Microtek, and itssoftware lets you make tonal adjustments before scanning.andP;  For small imagesor infrequent scanning needs, the Sharp, at less than half the cost of theMicrotek, is a good choice.andM;With the Colorset software, image quality is dependent on the scanner andscanning software used.andP;  We found acceptable results were achieved with theHP ScanJet and very poor results with the Microtek scanner.andP;  The softwarecomes with plastic color filters that are delicate.andP;  Damage to the filterswill adversely affect the quality of the scanned images.andM;In general, we found that Colorset was not a good price or performance valuewhen compared with the other products.andM;Accel Computer Corp.andM;MyScan: $799 with SCSI connector, $590 without SCSI connectorandM;Von Karman Commerce Center, 17145 Von Karman Ave., Suite 110, Irvine, Calif.andO;92714;
