Mr. Buchanan, an America-First throwback,scoffs at the administration's &quot;New World Order.&quot; But this isnot what won him 37% of the Republican vote. Beating up onthe Beltway clearly was a more effective element in hiscampaign than beating up on the Japanese.   Indeed, beating up on the Japanese seemed notablyunsuccessful in New Hampshire. Mr. Bush attempted to play theJapan card on his pre-campaign trip to Tokyo and ended upwith a political fiasco. American voters are too smart tobelieve that Japan is primarily to blame for the problems ofthe U.S. economy. They preferred to blame the CEOs whoaccompanied Mr. Bush and the president himself. Having missedthat signal, Democratic Sens. Tom Harkin and Bob Kerreycontinued to beat the protectionism drum in New Hampshire andended up with zilch. Paul Tsongas, running on a free-trade,pro-business platform, won handily.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. elections usually turn on domestic issues, notforeign affairs, and this one was no exception. Exit pollsshowed, for example, that Mr. Bush's performance in the GulfWar was a significant issue with only 7% of the voters. Toquote Ronald Reagan, all elections are, in essence, localelections. The president and the senators from Iowa andNebraska suffered because they could not dissociatethemselves from the Beltway. Both Mr. Tsongas and Mr.Buchanan, the moral victor on the Republican side even thoughhe came in a distant second to Mr. Bush, exploited publicdissatisfaction with the federal government. Both are hardlystrangers to the nation's capital, but they ran as&quot;outsiders.&quot;   The Buchanan campaign drilled away at the president'sbroken &quot;read-my-lips&quot; pledge not to raise taxes and at theDemocratic Congress's propensity to extend the federalgovernment's tentacles into every nook and cranny of Americansociety. Mr. Tsongas attacked protectionism and theclass-warfare appeals that are the stock in trade ofcongressional Democrats.   But even though it is doubtful that Mr. Buchanan'santi-internationalism had much resonance with New Hampshirevoters, it comes at a time when all of the world's postwarinternational institutions are subject to review, simplybecause the world itself is undergoing dramatic change. Mr.Buchanan is not so much attacking George Bush's &quot;New WorldOrder&quot; -- in part because it is so vaguely defined that thereis nothing much to attack -- as he is confronting the &quot;OldWorld Order,&quot; a set of U.S. foreign policies that have beenlittle altered by either Democratic or Republicanadministrations since World War II.   Now that a formidable enemy -- the Soviet Union -- hascrumbled, Mr. Buchanan is questioning, both explicitly andimplicitly, the worth of the elaborate arrangements made bythe U.S. and its allies after World War II to counter Sovietexpansionism. Those arrangements include NATO and theU.S.-Japan security treaty, of course. But if the terms Mr.Buchanan uses have any meaning, they also encompass suchglobal entities as the International Monetary Fund, the WorldBank and its related regional development banks, the U.S.Agency for International Development and a host of lesserinstitutions.   Mr. Buchanan's fundamental position emerged during the NewHampshire campaign when a foreign journalist asked him toreassure the outside world that he is not an isolationist. Hewas quoted in the Washington Post as responding: &quot;Thiscampaign is not about the outside world. It's about the U.S.of A. And I'll tell you something: The day when you could getincome transfers from the working and middle class people ofthe United States to send foreign regimes that can't balancetheir budgets will be coming to an end when Pat Buchanan iselected President.&quot;   That is a far more profound statement, as it applies toU.S. foreign policy, than it might sound at first glance, ifone assumes that Mr. Buchanan means it seriously. Mr.Buchanan is suggesting that he would dismantle the U.S.&quot;empire&quot; for much the same economic reasons that broughtabout the collapse of the Soviet empire. He is saying, ineffect, that the empire -- or more appropriately the PaxAmericana -- is too expensive for U.S. taxpayers to support.   This argument always has some resonance in U.S. politics,with conservatives who distrust the multilateral banks andaid agencies and with liberals who want to dismantle the U.S.defense establishment and spend the savings on newsocial-welfare schemes. But it is doubtful that either groupis aroused enough to give Mr. Buchanan's campaign an addedboost beyond what he has already achieved in his focus ondomestic issues. Americans are frustrated by Mr. Bush'sincapacity to understand why Reaganomics succeeded, but thatdoesn't mean they are turning isolationist. Quite thecontrary, Americans were elated over the U.S. militarysuccess in the Gulf and now widely support helping the formerSoviet republics join the world political and economic order.   Mr. Buchanan, of course, scores some points when hechallenges the efficacy of the multilateral banks and aidorganizations. Because of natural bureaucratic instincts forempire building, they often have been indiscriminate in theirfinancing, propping up corrupt, incompetent or socialistregimes that in a better world would have been allowed toself-destruct, giving way to more responsible, free-marketleadership. Some U.S. administrations, this one included,have not exercised sufficient control over those tendencies,although they have had the power to do so. These institutionsoften have given even their good &quot;clients&quot; bad economicadvice, although the quality of advice improved significantlyduring the Reagan-Thatcher era.   But the fundamental question is not whether the elaboratepostwar system of Western-supported global institutions andalliances is above reproach. Certainly it has manyimperfections. The real question is whether the politicalfunction of these institutions -- in essence the leveragethey give to the U.S. and its allies in exerting globalinfluence and maintaining global peace -- is worth what theycost. That issue, plus the question of how they should bemodified to cope with the problems of a radically changedworld, is worth debate.   From the readings in New Hampshire, that debate will notbe crucial in deciding who becomes the next U.S. president.But it will play out in the U.S. Congress and other Westernparliaments, in the councils of NATO, the IMF et al., in thediplomacy of foreign ministers, finance ministers and chiefsof state. Mr. Buchanan's barroom-style rhetoric doesn'tcontribute much, but at least he has put the issue on theU.S. political agenda.</TEXT></DOC>
