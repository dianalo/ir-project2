(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The stories of ``Eight Men Out''and of its director and writer John Sayles begin at the same place,with youth and innocence.   The athletes in Sayles' movie about the 1919 World Series,rigged by gamblers, love their work. For them, baseball is play.Sayles, too, has a measure of that boyish pluck; he enjoys makingmovies.   The difference is that the baseball players sold out, throwingthe series for a few thousand dollars, ditching their virtue andtheir futures in the process.   Sayles has stood tall. Surrounded by the same kind ofdeal-making and influence-peddling that proved toxic to the WhiteSox, the 38-year-old Sayles has moved through Hollywood with hisintegrity pretty much intact.   He didn't give ``Eight Men Out'' a happy ending, as others mighthave done.   ``We wanted to make `Eight Men Out,' not `One Man Out' or `TwoMen Out' or whatever the more Hollywood version would be,'' Saylessaid. ``That seemed like taking a dive to us. That was a version ofthrowing the series for us and we held out. It took us seven years,but we got to do it eventually.''   Sayles has had to personally raise the money for most of hismovies; it's the only way to get them made the way he wants them.   But it's not a question of smugness. From 1983's ``Lianna'' (ayoung woman copes with lesbianism) to 1984's ``Brother From AnotherPlanet'' (a black space alien visits Harlem) to last year's``Matewan'' (coal miners strike in West Virginia), Sayles hasexplored subjects that are politically riveting and brazenlyuncommercial.   To support himself, he turned to commercial screenwriting,including scripts for ``The Howling,'' ``Piranha,'' ``Clan of theCave Bear'' and the TV movie ``Unnatural Causes.''   With ``Eight Men Out,'' starring John Cusak and DavidStrathairn, Sayles may have discovered a new mix: opening to bothgood notices and long lines.   The movie may finally introduce the uninitiated to one of thecountry's more independent-thinking directors and his reflectionson common people facing uncommon choices.   Potential producers, however, were skeptical of ``Eight MenOut.''   ``A lot of the turndowns we got were people who said, `This is agreat story. You did a really good job on it. But we don't think wecan make money on this thing.'   ``That's why a lot of good movies don't get made and continuenot to get made. The widest audience that you can go for isprobably the one that doesn't want any waves.''   The major Hollywood studios told Sayles ``Eight Men Out'' was a$15 million movie and didn't have ``the ooomph'' to make back themoney.   ``And we'd say, `We can make it for $6 million or $7 million.And finally they saw enough of the things that we had done thatlooked more expensive than what they cost, they started to believeus,'' he said.   Told in straight-ahead style with authentic period detail, themovie examines how personal and professional pressures seduced agroup of athletes to betray both the national pastime and thenational trust. Unlike ``The Natural,'' with its happy ending, thisis not a saccharine piece.   Some of the players were motivated either by greed or fears ofhard-nosed gamblers who told them to throw the game _ or else.Others were provoked by penny-pinching White Sox owner CharlieComiskey, who was so cheap he charged his players for washing theiruniforms. The team was called ``The Black Sox'' even before the1919 series.   ``The movie is about an exploitative situation,'' Sayles said.``The owners were owners. You belonged to that guy.'' Some of theWhite Sox, Sayles added, were paid half as much as equally talentedplayers on other teams.   ``The day that they (the eight White Sox) were acquitted,Comiskey said, `Well, I'm glad my boys are back.' And the day thatthey were kicked out, which was literally the next day, he said,`Well, good. Good riddance. Baseball doesn't need these guys. We'llbuild from the ashes.'''   Sayles wrote the script for ``Eight Men Out,'' based on EliotAsinof's book, 11 years ago as a screenwriting sample. Like much ofthe work that followed, the script reflected Sayles' interest inlabor and class struggles.   ``Eight Men Out'' was made only when Sayles and producers SarahPillsbury and Midge Sanford (``River's Edge'') demonstrated aremarkable ability for making expensive-looking movies on ashoestring.   Sayles plays journalist Ring Lardner in the movie. ``Every timeI can play a role that's one less person I don't have to worryabout: He's not going to give me any trouble,'' he said.   He'll devote his time now to writing a TV movie about a``low-rent lawyer'' and a feature film on the Spanish Civil War.``And I want to go back and write a book that I've been working onfor a long time, a novel based on the Cuban community in Miami.''   Sayles said his movies carry a variety of messages. ``Rarely isit a message that you can put on a quilt: `Cleanliness is next togodliness, so there,''' he said.   ``With this movie, you should think about how people arecorrupted or lose their dreams without really knowing that'shappening. It should make you think about youth and innocence andwhat's overrated about youth and innocence and what's actuallyvaluable about them _ and what we miss about them when they'regone.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sept. 30-Oct. 2</NOTE></DOC>
