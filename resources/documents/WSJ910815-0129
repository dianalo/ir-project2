He personally proposed a treaty banning chemical weapons,and said it should include what he called a toughverification scheme allowing &quot;on-site inspection on demand&quot;of any facility where shady countries might be makingchemical weapons covertly. This ambitious idea became knownas &quot;anywhere anytime&quot; inspection.</LP><TEXT>   But now that Mr. Bush is president, his administration hasdecided that &quot;anywhere anytime&quot; inspections aren't such agood idea after all -- and he may be walking into a politicalhornet's nest as a result.   Though the president continues to push for a treatybanning chemical weapons by next year, his negotiators atinternational talks in Geneva have quietly dropped thesweeping verification notion. Fearing that hostile nationswould use the scheme to pry open sensitive U.S.national-security installations, the administration hasinstead proposed a less ambitious verification plan thatwouldn't always let inspectors inside suspicious facilities,and could give suspected violators several days' advancenotice before an inspection took place.   Critics within the arms-control community are howling inprotest. They claim the move will undercut the whole treatyand could prompt chemical manufacturers to back away fromtheir willingness to open plants for inspection. And they addthat the administration is at least sending the wrong signalat a time when the U.S. is demanding that Iraq open all itsfacilities to international inspection for chemical,biological and nuclear weapons material.   &quot;It's a very unfortunate and very misguided reversal ofthe previous position,&quot; says Elisa Harris, an analyst at theBrookings Institution. &quot;We are giving countries such as Iraq. . . a legal loophole through which they can deny inspectorsaccess to sites at which they can hide illicit activities.&quot;   What's more, some analysts say, the verification issuecould easily become a bone of contention when the Senate isasked to approve a finished treaty. Conservatives who alreadyare leery of giving up America's chemical arsenal anyway maywell question whether the U.S. can have much confidence thatothers are doing the same.   The new verification proposal &quot;is going to make it thatmuch more difficult to ratify&quot; the treaty, says FrankGaffney, a treaty opponent who is head of the Center forSecurity Policy.   Administration officials assert that their new approach isthe best method they could devise to reconcile two directlyconflicting goals: constructing a tough verification regimewhile also ensuring that the U.S. can protect its ownnational-security facilities from prying eyes.   The U.S. faced &quot;a real issue of balancing therequirements,&quot; says Col. Donald Mahley, an official of theArms Control and Disarmament Agency who overseeschemical-arms talks. &quot;We've tried to strike the best balancewe can between those national security requirements.&quot;   Col. Mahley maintains that under the new proposal, &quot;theconcept of anywhere anytime is still alive and well&quot; becausea suspect facility can still be challenged, and the countrywhere it is located will have an obligation under the treatyto somehow address the world's concerns. If the suspectcountry uses the treaty's provisions to dodge inspections, heargues, it could risk punishment in such places as the UnitedNations.   Privately, other administration officials say theyconcluded long ago that the sweeping inspection idea wasundesirable. They had visions of a country such as Iraq orLibya forcing the U.S. to open its most sensitivedefense-research laboratories or top-secret communicationsfacilities on the pretext of a chemical-arms inspection. As aresult, administration aides have been locked in a heatedinternal debate for months over how to finesse theverification issue, generally regarded as the toughestremaining issue in the chemical-arms talks.   Col. Mahley argues that the new verification plan also wasneeded to help convince Third World nations to sign thetreaty and thereby accept its ban on chemical weapons. Somesmaller nations were troubled by the &quot;anywhere anytime&quot;concept because they feared big powers would use it simply tosuppress small nations' military programs.   The new verification plan was officially proposed lastmonth at chemical-arms negotiations in Geneva in which 39countries are participating. Mr. Bush has made it clear thathe attaches great personal importance to closing a deal atthe talks.   &quot;If I'm elected president, if I'm remembered for anything,it would be this: a complete and total ban on chemicalweapons . . . their destruction forever,&quot; Mr. Bush oncedeclared during his 1988 campaign. &quot;That's my solemnmission.&quot;   The new verification plan was crafted by the U.S., thoughit was officially co-sponsored in the Geneva negotiations byBritain, Japan and Australia. But other industrializednations, notably France and Germany, are unhappy and arelikely to try to toughen it.   The plan applies only to &quot;challenge&quot; inspections offacilities that are suspected of being used to makechemical-arms materials. There is a separate, more intrusiveverification procedure for facilities that are known to becapable of producing chemicals for arms.   The plan says that when an international inspection teamis dispatched to do a challenge inspection, it should use&quot;the least intrusive manner possible, consistent with theeffective and timely accomplishment of its mission.&quot; Achallenged country, it says, &quot;has the right to take measuresto protect sensitive installations.&quot;   And though the country that is calling for an inspectionwould initially declare the boundaries, or &quot;perimeter,&quot; ofthe area it wants inspected, the suspect country couldcounter by proposing its own definition of the areainspectors could cover. If there is a dispute over theperimeter that can't be resolved by negotiations in 60 hours,the area designated by the country suspected of the violationwould be the one inspectors have to follow.   Col. Mahley acknowledges that &quot;the challenged country getsto determine the perimeter&quot; and that &quot;exactly what you get todo within that perimeter is a matter of negotiations.&quot; But,he argues, if a challenged country seems to be obstructing ameaningful inspection, &quot;you simply bring that to theinternational political system and seek redress.&quot;   Some analysts, though, worry about a more subtle problem.They suspect that chemical firms will seek less stringentinspections for their publicly known plants if they sensethat suspected covert sites aren't subject to equallyrigorous inspections.   &quot;Industry has been willing to have very intrusiveinspection,&quot; says Barbara Rosenberg, a biochemist who is onthe advisory council of the Committee for National Security'sProject on Chemical and Biological Weapons. &quot;If they thinkit's going to be meaningless . . . I'm sure there's going tobe a pulling out on that, too.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
