(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After two years of revelations _ and alast-minute prosecution surprise _ PTL founder Jim Bakker facestrial on charges of using TV, telephones and the mail to defraudsupporters out of millions of dollars.   Jury selection in his fraud and conspiracy trial is set forMonday. Opening arguments are to begin one week later and the trialis expected to last at least six weeks, with dozens of witnesses andthousands of documents.   Bakker, whose multimillion-dollar evangelical empire crumbledafter word leaked about his sexual tryst with a church secretary, ischarged in a 24-count indictment with diverting millions in PTLmoney to support a lavish lifestyle.   If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to 120 years inprison and ordered to pay more than $5 million in fines.   The case against Bakker resulted from a 16-month federal grandjury investigation into PTL, which once boasted $129 million inrevenue under his leadership.   Richard Dortch, Bakker's former top aide at the now-bankrupttelevision ministry and former co-defendant, agreed on Aug. 8 toplead guilty to four counts and to testify against Bakker.   Dortch pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud, one count ofwire fraud by telephone, one count of wire fraud by television andone count of conspiracy.   ``It's got to have some effect (on the approach taken attrial),'' one of Bakker's attorneys, George T. Davis, said ofDortch's testimony. ``But these kind of people who make these kindsof pleas are not always considered as credible as they might be.''   The Bakker trial follows the tax evasion convictions of twoformer PTL aides, brothers David and James Taggart, in the samefederal courtroom.   The Taggarts' attorney, Ben Cotten, said his clients wouldconsider testifying against Bakker.   David Taggart, who was Bakker's personal aide, and James Taggart,his former interior designer, are scheduled to be sentenced on Aug.25 _ three days opening arguments in Bakker's trial.   The Taggarts each face 25 years in prison and more than $1million in fines when they are sentenced by U.S. District JudgeRobert Potter, who also will preside over the upcoming Bakker trial.They were convicted July 25.   It's been more than two years since Bakker stepped down aschairman of PTL, following revelations about his sexual encounterwith secretary Jessica Hahn and hush money paid to her by PTL.   The story broke in March 1987. Disclosures about Jim and TammyBakker's extravagant spending habits on homes, cards and jewelry,PTL's bankruptcy proceedings, and charges of homosexuality by formerBakker associates touched off an unprecedented ``holy war'' amongsome of America's most prominent televangelists, including JerryFalwell and Jimmy Swaggart.   The federal grand jury heard testimony from more than 100witnesses, reviewed thousands of documents and watched tapes of old``PTL Club'' shows.   Its Dec. 5 indictment came almost eight years to the day afterBakker and Ms. Hahn had sex in a Clearwater Beach, Fla., hotel room_ Dec. 6, 1980. Dortch was accused of giving her $265,000 in PTLmoney in exchange for her silence.   Bakker is charged with eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts ofwire fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.   Specifically, he is accused of pocketing some of the $158 millionthat poured into PTL from 1984 to 1987 under various ``lifetimepartnership'' programs.   In eight of the 11 programs, contributors were promised freelodging at the ministry's Heritage USA Christian retreat nearCharlotte in exchange for a one-time donation of $1,000 or more.   Instead of using all of the money to build hotels and otherfacilities at Heritage USA, the indictment said, PTL executivesspent more than $4 million on themselves and used some of it foroperating expenses.   All the while, PTL was suffering from severe cash-flow problemsas Jim and Tammy Bakker received nearly $3.5 million in bonuses from1984 through 1987 and Dortch got $550,000 in bonuses. At the sametime, they withheld informaton about PTL's worsening financialproblems from its board of directors, the indictment charged.   Tammy Bakker was not charged.   Prosecutors Deborah Smith, who works in the fraud section of theU.S. Department of Justice, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Millerhave declined to discuss details of the upcoming trial.   Bakker and his defense attorneys also are mum, saying theybelieve it will be impossible to get a fair trial in Charlottebecause of extensive pretrial publicity, particularly in TheCharlotte Observer.   The newspaper won a Pulitizer Prize last year for itsinvestigative stories about PTL under Bakker's leadership. Heresigned when the Observer's editors told him they were prepared togo to print with a story spelling out the details of thesex-and-money scandal.   Defense attorneys failed in their attempts to move the trial outof Charlotte.   Davis, Bakker's lawyer, said the judge has said he believes it'spossible to select a fair jury. ``And if that's true, I can't thinkof anything we're more anxious to do than to go to trial,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
