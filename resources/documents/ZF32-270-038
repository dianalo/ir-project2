 This year's conference, the 37th ISSCC, waswell attended and covered the usual breadth of topics, includingmicroprocessors, memories, peripheral chips, analog circuits, and ASICs.andM;While the conference is heavily oriented toward device and circuit topics,microprocessor and computer system designers can benefit from the exposure toleading edge trends that ISSCC provides.andP;  For example, ISSCC is one of thebest places to find out where generic RAMs will be in one or two years.andM;Everything Old Is New AgainandM;Perhaps the most humorous event of the proceedings occurred in the &quot;EmergingCircuit Technologies&quot; session on Thursday.andP;  A paper by consultant John Price,titled &quot;Enhanced Emitter-Coupled Logic,&quot; described a way to make an ECL gateimplement more functions by replacing the reference voltage input to one ofthe transistors in an ECL pair with a useful input signal.andP;  (The trick is toplace a Schottky diode between the emitter of one of the transistors and thecurrent source.)andP;  The result is an ECL gate that can perform sophisticatedfunctions with far fewer transistors and a smaller supply voltage.andP;  Thisleads to higher density and lower power consumption, thus addressing the twomain complaints about ECL.andM;After the talk, Dr. Herbert Stopper stood up to ask two questions.andP;  His firstquestion was about a possible noise glitch under certain conditions, and thesecond was merely a suggestion that an example circuit, shown in a figure,could actually be significantly improved.andM;Dr.andP;  Stopper then explained his inexplicable grasp of the details of thisnovel circuit topology by mentioning that he had patented this idea in 1967while with Telefunken.andP;  In addition, he had submitted a paper to ISSCC at thetime but was rejected!andP;  Of course, the author of the 1990 paper and hisco-inventor had also patented the idea.andM;MicroprocessorsandM;At last year's ISSCC, the first details about Intel's i860 were given, andthe lack of an equally important first-time disclosure made themicroprocessor session a little less exciting.andP;  The biggest disappointmentwas the absence of the MIPS R6000 ECL paper (see side-bar).andP;  Even so, onecompletely new architecture (Philips' VLIW &quot;LIFE&quot;) was announced, and HewlettPackard described an impressive 90-MHz CMOS implementation of their PrecisionArchitecture.andM;The Japanese side of the Solbourne Computer development team, fromMatsushita, presented details about Solbourne's highly integrated SPARCimplementation, KAP.andP;  Those of you who attended the fall Microprocessor Forumin San Jose (see [mu]PR 10/89 p. 24) will remember that Mike Shumacher ofSolbourne provided an early glimpse of the KAP.andP;  The KAP paper claimed anoperating frequency of 40 MHz, the same frequency that Schumacher estimatedfor production devices at the fall Forum.andP;  Thus, we can hope that the KAP isthe exception to the unwritten ISSCC rule: &quot;all parameters are typical andmeasured at room temperature.&quot;andM;The million-transistor KAP has a 2 KB, two-way set associative, write-back,physical data cache, a 6 KB, three-way set associative instruction cache, andan on-chip floating point unit.andP;  In addition, the on-chip MMU consists of aninstruction translation look-aside buffer (ITLB) for translating instructionaddresses only, and a larger general-purpose TLB (GTLB) for instruction anddata addresses.andM;The efficient 4-stage pipeline is arranged to execute loads and stores in asingle cycle by reading the register file early and performing addresscomputation late in the decode stage.andP;  The on-chip data cache can then beaccessed in the execute stage and in parallel with the GTLB.andM;The caches are physically addressed to facilitate cache coherency and quickcontext switching in multiprocessor configurations.andP;  So far, Solbourne hasdifferentiated itself from Sun by offering multiprocessor servers andworkstations, and it seems likely that they will also have a desktopmultiprocessor system before Sun.andM;Junien Labrousse and Gerrit Slavenburg from Philips' Sunnyvale research labdescribed an interesting single-chip, very long instruction word (VLIW)microprocessor.andP;  (The ISSCC paper did not name the architecture, but Philipsis calling it LIFE, for Long Instruction Format Engine.)andP;  Each 200-bitinstruction can initiate up to one operation per cycle in each of the sixfunctional units.andP;  The functional units are two identical 32-bit ALUs, a datamemory interface, a register file, a constant-generation unit, and a branchunit.andP;  All units are fed by &quot;funnel file&quot; memories, which are memories with amultiplexer on the write port.andP;  Each funnel file has one read and one writeport.andP;  This organization requires compile-time resolution of datadependencies, including write-collisions.andP;  (We'll have more details on thePhilips chip in a future article.)andM;This integer-only chip is reported to run at 50 MHz and achieve a performancein the range of 60 to 100 VAX MIPS for scalar integer applications.andP;  Thepaper quotes 75K Dhrystones (version 2.0).andP;  This is well beyond theperformance achieved by today's RISC systems, but a 50-MHz version of nearlyany of today's RISC processors would achieve an equally high number.andP;  Philipsclaims that other, real-world applications provide more fine-grainparallelism and therefore show much more benefit from the VLIW architecture.andM;Hewlett-Packard talked about a CMOS implementation of their PrecisionArchitecture.andP;  This chip has been successfully operated under typicalconditions at 90 MHz (that's an 11.1 ns cycle time) and is used in the latestHP workstations, including a 65-MHz model.andP;  This is the kind of speedpreviously thought by some to be achievable only with ECL, or at leastBiCMOS.andP;  The chip is fabricated in a 0.8-micron technology and runs at 3.3volts.andP;  It has no on-chip cache memory but does have on-chip cache supportlogic.andP;  The speaker claimed that the chip's impressive cycle time isdetermined by the access time of the external cache SRAM plus only 2 ns.andO;That is almost unbelievable, since this path involves four chip crossings.andM;The fastest microprocessor was described by Fujitsu in the emerging circuittechnologies session.andP;  This Josephson-Junction (JJ) processor implements an8-bit digital signal processor, complete with a parallel multiplier and a13-bit ALU.andP;  The internal clock cycle time is 1 ns for a clock rate of 1 GHz.andO;This allows the chip to perform a second-order IIR filter in 7 ns!andP;  It canmultiply in 240 ps, using only one-fourth of a clock cycle.andP;  This is fasterthan a single gate delay in most ECL and GaAs technologies.andM;This JJ processor is much more useful than the 4-bit JJ processor describedat last year's ISSCC, but is still little more than a laboratory curiosity.andO;In particular, the program is fixed, and is limited by the on-chip 64-word by24-bit instruction memory.andP;  However, the rumor is that next year Fujitsu willbe ready to describe a 16- or 24-bit JJ DSP that can be reprogrammed.andO;Despite these developments, it seems unlikely that JJ processors will havemuch of a mainstream impact unless high-temperature superconductors becomepractical.andM;Other processor disclosures included an IBM 370 implementation on five chips,a DEC processor chipset, a multiply-accumulate functional block from IBM, andvarious specialized DSP functions.andP;  Many of the processors stressedlow-voltage operation, including the IBM 370 and the DEC processor.andP;  The DECchip set claimed a worst-case operating frequency of 62.5 MHz.andM;RAMsandM;As expected, many RAM developments were presented.andP;  In the main, however, themajor characteristics of the RAMs were roughly the same as those presentedlast year.andP;  In fact, three 16-Mbit DRAM papers were given last year whileonly one was given this year.andP;  The other two significant DRAMs were 4-Mbitdevices, and stressed faster access time or unique organization.andP;  Presumably,developments in the 16-Mbit arena have moved from research labs to theproduction lines where they are being tweaked for high-volume production.andM;SRAM developments were more impressive.andP;  Four 4-Mbit SRAMs were described.andO;All have very fast access times, with the fastest at 15 ns and the slowest at23 ns.andP;  Two of the 4-Mbit RAMs were optimized for low standby (retention)current; the Toshiba part requires 1 [mu]A while the Hitachi part retainsdata with only 0.5 andlsqb;mu]A.andP;  Once in production, these SRAMs will be one of theenabling technologies for a new generation of hand-held and laptop computers.andM;Motorola described the fastest 256-Kbit CMOS SRAMs with TTL I/O.andP;  Twoorganizations of this SRAM were fabricated, 256K X 1 and 64K X 4, and bothhave an access time of 8 ns.andP;  Thus, SRAMs seem to be keeping pace withincreases in processor cycle time.andP;  The major bottleneck will probably be thesignal propagation time between a processor and its external caches.andM;Two 1-Mbit, BiCMOS SRAMs with ECL I/O were described by Fujitsu and NEC, withaccess times of 6.5 ns and 5 ns respectively.andP;  While these parts are fast,they are not fast enough for the first-level caches of the next generation ofECL microprocessors and the first generation of GaAs RISC microprocessors;access times of 2 ns to 3 ns will be required.andP;  They are, however, ideal forthe large, second-level caches these high-clock-rate processors will demand.andM;The most interesting RAM developments were in non-volatile devices.andP;  Fourvery large EPROMs were described, including a 16-ns 1-Mbit chip, a 55-ns4-Mbit chip, and an 85-ns 16-Mbit chip.andP;  At 16 ns, the 1-Mbit part can keepup with most of today's RISC processors, which is quite an accomplishment foran EPROM.andM;TrendsandM;At last year's ISSCC, we noted some industry trends, including:andM;* The move toward very large chipsandM;* Equal pacing between processor speed and SRAM access timesandM;* Widespread use of sub-micron process technologyandM;* Large numbers of pinsandM;* Japanese dominance in RAMsandM;* US dominance in processorsandM;These trends seem to be continuing.andM;As for the future, we expect that much more research and development effortwill be focused on packaging technology and lower power-supply voltages.andO;Many of the high-speed, high-density chips described this year use 3.3-voltpower supplies.andM;This year's ISSCC had only one paper on packaging, and it was simplydescribing an improved pin grid array (PGA).andP;  While it is important that RAMand logic speeds keep increasing, it is also important to keep reducinginterchip delays to avoid wasting cycles propagating signals.andP;  Technologiesthat allow bare dice to be packaged together on a single substrate will bekey to future high-performance system designs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
