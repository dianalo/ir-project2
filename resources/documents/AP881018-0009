Teresa Carpenter's book is about a professor who batteredhis prostitute-mistress.   When this husband and wife dine at night, does mayhem minglewith the meatloaf? Not necessarily, they say.   ``It would be wrong to suggest (our conversations) wereexcessively morbid. They don't tend to be morose,'' says Levy.   But Carpenter quickly adds, ``We could swap forensic stories andI could tell him who he should talk to in the FBI.''   For three years, Levy, 37, and Carpenter, 40, worked separatelybut simultaneously on these two accounts of similarly repulsivecrimes.   The experience of both writing at the same time turned out quitewell, Carpenter said during a recent interview at the couple'sFifth Avenue apartment, a well-lighted, book-filled home.   In his book _ ``The Unicorn's Secret: Murder in the Age ofAquarius,'' to be published this month by Prentice Hall Press _Levy examined the bizarre case of Ira Einhorn, Philadelphia'senigmatic peace-and-love freak and parapsychology crusader who wascharged in 1979 with killing his girlfriend, Holly Maddux. Eighteenmonths after Maddux was last seen alive, her decomposed, mummifiedbody was found in a locked trunk in their apartment.   Einhorn, known about town as ``The Unicorn,'' shrugged off theallegations and accused the CIA and others of planting evidence inhis home, but he skipped bail before trial. He remains a fugitive,likely living in Europe.   Carpenter's book, ``Missing Beauty,'' published in June by W.W.Norton, is the story of what led Tufts University medicalresearcher William Douglas in 1983 to smash the skull of RobinBenedict, the high-priced Boston prostitute with whom he'd falleninsanely in love.   Even though the essentials of the stories are similar _ bothvictims were women trying to extract themselves from relationshipswith obsessively possessive men _ the two men could not be moreunalike.   The Unicorn was a brilliant and charismatic bear of a figure, aladies' man extraordinaire and counterculture oddball given to suchbenign weirdness as answering his door stark naked. Though hedressed in a dashiki and dirty jeans, sported a full beard andshoulder-length hair and frequently smelled bad, Einhornestablished an incredible global network of scientists, corporatesponsors and wealthy benefactors.   ``Ira was the epitome of the guy who worked in fringe circles,was antiestablishment and still looked like a hippie when he wasalmost 40,'' says Levy. ``Douglas was this traditional, respectedman.''   Superficially, Douglas did appear to lead a normal life: He wasa solidly middle-class family man with three children, an eminentmedical school professor and acknowledged expert in cell culture.   ``Everything about him was so normal, so stultifyingly normal.... He was a man who one would never imagine could have gottenhimself into a situation like this,'' Carpenter said.   But then there was that other side, sufficiently dark, privateand perverse to fascinate the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter forfour years. Carpenter received the award in 1981 for her crimecoverage for The Village Voice.   Here was ``a scientist who had been embezzling research funds tosupport a mistress _ who happened to be a hooker. He was living adouble life ... That's what hooked me,'' she said.   Researching her book, Carpenter spent weeks walking the streetsand hanging out in the bars and strip joints of the Combat Zone,the netherworld that is Boston's red-light district, talking tobartenders, pimps, whores and strippers who knew Douglas' youngvictim.   ``That was very difficult for me. I'm not a street person andnever dared pose as one,'' she said.   While Carpenter was exploring the gamy depths, Levy was havinganxieties of his own as he waited for her nightly call from Boston,assuring him that she was safe.   ``I wasn't happy about it, but this is what Teresa does. It'simportant for her to do the story right,'' Levy said.   ``Missing Beauty'' is Carpenter's first book, but she wasalready a respected master of crime stories: She had reported onthe killings of Playmate Dorothy Stratton and politician AllardLowenstein.   ``The Unicorn's Secret'' is Levy's first major excursion intothe genre; his other book, ``Hackers,'' is about the personalcomputer revolution. Levy is a free-lance writer and contributingeditor for Rolling Stone.   So, what is the allure of the macabre?   Says Levy: ``When something happens it gives you a window intothe way people live, the way people are. ... It's like anarchaeological dig. Like if someone unearths a civilization frozenby a volcano or something. That's what a murder does _ it freezesdetails of our lives.''</TEXT></DOC>
