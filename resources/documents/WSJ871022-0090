Harris Jr.Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BA EUROP MDAEROSPACE (ARO)AIRLINES (AIR) </IN><TEXT>   Boeing Co. is considering another delay in the proposed schedule for introducing its 7J7 &quot;propfan&quot; jetliner, and will reassign some of the 900 people now working directly on the $4 billion project.    Phillip Condit, an executive vice president of the Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. unit, said it would be &quot;premature&quot; to predict how many employees would be reassigned. He also said the current 1993 tentative delivery date for the first aircraft &quot;hasn't been eliminated,&quot; although the latest review could lead to further slippage of the timeframe.    In August, Boeing postponed starting full-scale development of the 7J7 aircraft, saying airlines weren't receptive to the project under the timetable that had been set. Because of that postponement, the Seattle-based aerospace giant's proposed delivery date slipped a year from 1992, and the company said it would launch the 7J7 development program only &quot;when we have customers.&quot;    Boeing hasn't taken any orders for the 7J7, designed to be powered by new-technology engines with fuel-saving propellers mounted at the rear. Such interested carriers as American Airlines and Scandanavian Airlines have differed on the size aircraft they want, among other specifications.    &quot;You can't just sort of go blindly ahead,&quot; Mr. Condit said yesterday. &quot;We are looking very carefully at market requirements,&quot; and how the airline industry's need for new aircraft of various types has been changing in recent months.    Japanese industry, which has a 25% equity share in the 7J7 program in a venture that is unusual for Boeing, is &quot;on board&quot; in the latest decision to review the program timing and reassign employees to other programs, Mr. Condit said.    Japanese employees, who have been working with Boeing people on the project in Seattle, &quot;are being apprised daily&quot; about 7J7-related decisions, he added. Companies working with Boeing are Japan Aircraft Development Corp., Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.    Separately, Boeing said it received about $210 million of aircraft orders from two European airlines. The orders are for eight of its 737-300 planes. The company said Lufthansa German Airlines ordered five of the planes for delivery in the first quarter of 1989, with Maersk Air of Denmark ordering three for delivery next September and October. Lufthansa's planes, which will bring to 20 that airline's fleet of 737-300s, seat 110 in a two-class configuration. The Maersk planes will seat 146.    Boeing's commercial aircraft subsidiary has about 48,000 U.S. employees. Of the 900 currently working on the 7J7, a large number are engineers outlining preliminary designs for the all-new plane, originally envisioned as a 150-passenger plane that would be the first of a propfan family of airliners.    Mr. Condit said the airline industry's fleet-planning mood lately has been confused, in part because airport congestion is creating a need for larger planes. The latest 7J7 review, he added, reflects such unresolved questions as whether the 7J7 might be designed as a bigger aircraft, and whether Boeing might put more emphasis on marketing its existing Boeing jetliners or developing new derivative models of them.    Other Boeing aircraft programs drawing heavy airline interest -- including longer 737-400 and shorter 737-500 models of the 737, and a new wide-bodied 747-400 model -- have reached developmental stages that require additional engineering work. Assigning current 7J7 engineers to those programs may be found to have higher priority, Mr. Condit said.    Another 7J7 delay could lead to a spurt in orders for the competing A-320 planes marketed by the European Airbus Industrie consortium. The Airbus jetliner, a 150-seater powered by conventional engines, has been heavily ordered by the world's airlines, although some carriers have held off buying aircraft of that size while Boeing was making its 7J7 plans. Boeing has said the prop-fan engine, still being developed by General Electric Co., would be so fuel-efficient that the 7J7 could make the A-320 obsolete.    Meanwhile, McDonnell Douglas Corp. is conducting its own propfan aircraft development program. The St. Louis-based company believes the program could bring propfan-powered derivatives of its current MD-80 line onto the market in early 1991. A McDonnell spokesman said his company still believes airline orders for its proposed planes could stream in starting early next year. </TEXT></DOC>
