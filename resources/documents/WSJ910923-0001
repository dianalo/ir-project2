The Charlotte, N.C., bank holding company predicts thegovernment-assisted bailout will add $60 million to its ownearnings in 1992; $100 million in 1993, and $115 million to$150 million a year from 1994 to 1996.</LP><TEXT>   To First Union, which has been growing steadily in Floridathrough a series of acquisitions since 1985, Southeast lookslike a model for so-called &quot;in-market&quot; bank mergers. It plansto save more than $260 million a year, or 45% of Southeast'soperating expenses. Much of that will come through 2,800layoffs among Florida employees over the next year and theclosing of 119 overlapping branches.   The acquisition will push First Union from a distant thirdplace in Florida deposits -- one of the nation's mostattractive banking markets -- to a strong second, behindBarnett Banks Inc. In addition to Southeast's $10.3 billionin deposits, First Union will also get a big credit-cardportfolio, significant corporate and international business,and a Palm Beach-based trust operation that, among otherthings, stores furs and fine wine for well-heeled clients.   &quot;It's a financial home run,&quot; crows John R. Georgius, FirstUnion's president. Because regulators moved relatively earlyto resolve Southeast's plight, he says, Southeast's &quot;crownjewels are as intact as any we'd see of an FDIC-assistednature.&quot;   Just how intact is open to question, however. While theFDIC, or Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., interceded farearlier to resolve Southeast's plight than in other bailouts,Southeast still experienced a long downward slide over thepast two years during which some premier customers switchedto more stable banks.   The acquisition comes as First Union, like most of itsregional peers, is itself struggling with a rising pile ofbad loans. At the end of the second quarter, nonperformingassets were $1.17 billion, or 4.4% of net loans andforeclosed properties. In a statement filed Friday with theSecurities and Exchange Commission for the sale of 7.5million common shares in connection with the Southeastacquisition, First Union said its loan-loss provision for thethird quarter will be about $140 million instead of anearlier estimate of $114 million. It still expects, however,to report earnings in the range of 60 cents to 68 cents ashare in the quarter, compared with 70 cents a year earlier.   Much of the loan problem comes from earlier acquisitionsby First Union, which has been criticized on Wall Street formissing the target on some past acquisitions by overpaying oroverlooking loan problems.   Still, Wall Street clearly is cheered by the Southeasttransaction. First Union's shares have risen more than 14%since last Tuesday, when the FDIC selected it over Barnett,based in Jacksonville, Fla., and SunTrust Banks Inc., basedin Atlanta, to take over the two banking units of SoutheastBanking Corp. In composite trading Friday on the New YorkStock Exchange, First Union stock closed at $27.125 a share,up $1.375 a share, in heavy trading, just shy of a 52-weekhigh of $27.50.   The FDIC's safety net, which covers 85% of Southeast's badloans over the unusually long period of five years, isexpected to minimize the downside risk of the venture. FirstUnion, assuming 15% of the risk, will also have unusuallatitude in handling Southeast's troubled portfolio, allowingit to be more of a banker and less of a liquidator, with thehope of reducing losses.   With a bit of accounting wizardry, First Union evenmanaged to elude what could have been a vulnerable point inthe acquisition -- the addition of substantial intangibleassets to a balance sheet that already has a higher level ofsuch assets than those of most of its peers, with theresulting drag on earnings. In a complicated move based ondiscounting by $125 million a nominal-interest FDIC noteissued in connection with the Southeast bailout, First Unionwas able to slash $227 million in intangibles from theSoutheast deal to about $102 million.   Under the accounting treatment, the FDIC note -- becauseit carries only one-eighth of one percent interest annually-- was marked down $125 million, based on a five-yearborrowing rate of 8.75%, thus offsetting some of theintangibles from the Southeast deal.   As an encore, First Union late Friday acquired $345million in deposits and 21 branches of American Pioneer FSB,a failed Orlando thrift, from the government, bolstering itsDaytona Beach presence. Also on Friday, Miami-based SoutheastBanking Corp., which wasn't part of the FDIC bailout, filed aChapter 7 bankruptcy petition, for the liquidation of itsremaining assets for distribution to creditors, includingbondholders.   The upshot is that First Union is becoming much more of aFlorida bank. More than half of its $45.77 billion in assetsare in Florida -- about $25 billion -- compared with only $11billion in its home state of North Carolina.   First Union's Florida expansion comes as the state isgripped by a nasty recession coupled with a severe commercialreal estate slump that shows no signs of letting up soon. Thedemise of Southeast, once Florida's premier corporate bank,will spell only more gloom for Miami in the short term asnumerous job posts are cut and First Union likely abrogatesits leases and checks out of Southeast's landmark 55storytower in downtown Miami. The move would dump up to 585,000square feet of commercial space onto a glutted market with a21% vacancy rate.   But First Union, along with many bankers and economists,is bullish about the long-term outlook for Florida.&quot;Obviously we're high on Florida,&quot; says Edward E. CrutchfieldJr., First Union's chairman and chief executive officer, whocalls it &quot;the best bank market in the country.&quot; Indeed,Florida continues to be the fastest-growing large state. Itis rich in deposits from wealthy retirees and a constantstream of new residents and holds a strong lure forbusinesses.   While Florida has been one of the most competitive bankingmarkets for more than a decade, some believe that may bechanging. Most of the high-flying thrifts that bid up depositrates in the 1980s have collapsed in failure. With the comingmerger of NCNB Corp. and Candamp;S/Sovran Corp., the number oflarge players in Florida will have shrunk to four from seven.Spreads and profitability are on the rise, bankers say. JohnW. Spiegel, SunTrust's chief financial officer, predicts&quot;more rational markets where people don't have to payparticularly high rates.&quot;   First Union's acquisition of Southeast is expected to makethings tougher for Barnett, the largest bank in Florida.Barnett, which has almost all of its operations in Floridaexcept for a small Georgia operation, had lusted afterSoutheast for six years. &quot;Barnett is under pressure becauseits competitors are getting closer and bigger,&quot; says RichardStillinger, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc.   Barnett, whose bid for Southeast was substantially lessthan First Union's, shrugs off the loss, citing &quot;AlternativePlan B.&quot; Building on its long-time slogan as &quot;Florida'sBank,&quot; Barnett is launching a major advertising campaign thatwill emphasize its Florida roots and the stability andcontinuity of its service as other outfits come and go.   Indeed, as First Union scrambles to impose order on thechaos that goes with a major takeover, most competitors hopeto eat its lunch -- or try to. &quot;Where there is disruptionthere is opportunity,&quot; says Mr. Spiegel of SunTrust.</TEXT></DOC>
