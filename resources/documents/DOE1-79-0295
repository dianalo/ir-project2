To achievethese goals, a Real-Time Software Adaptation System (RESAS) was designedand implemented. It includes: (1) an Object-Based Programming Model whichallows the application programmer to create and manipulate adaptablesoftware, (2) an Entity/Relationship Representation Framework which isused to represent important attributes of the software, the computerhardware, and their interactions, and (3) an Adaptation Control Systemconsisting of: (a) a Monitoring Mechanism that observes and reports runtimeinformation, (b) a Data Management System that stores and presents informationused by other RESAS components, (c) an Adaptation Controller which makesdecisions on the appropriate choices of software configurations necessaryto meet the stated real-time and reliability goals, and (d) an AdaptationEnactment Mechanism which performs the adaptations chosen by the adaptationcontroller. In this dissertation, the theoretical and practical issuesassociated with soft-ware adaptation are discussed, the design and implementationof the RESAS prototype are described, and the results of several testsare given.</TEXT></DOC>
