U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer made her ruling afterKevin David Mitnick, 25, pleaded innocent to computer fraud chargesand his attorney urged the judge to release him on bail.   Attorney Alan Rubin argued that Mitnick is ``being heldincommunicado'' and is being treated more harshly than men chargedwith violent crimes.   ``My client is being portrayed as some sort of Machiavellianfigure _ either out of government paranoia ... or some othergovernment agenda I'm not aware of,'' said attorney Alan Rubin.   Rubin accused the government of exaggerating the seriousness ofthe case and suggested that Mitnick be released to his family with atap placed on his telephone.   But the judge, citing Mitnick's previous misdemeanor convictionon a similar computer related crime, rejected that suggestion.``Isn't it highly likely he'll do it again?'' she asked.   Rubin insisted he wouldn't repeat the action. A Mitnick associatewho turned him in has told of the young man's genius with computersand his alleged ability to tap into computers operated by theNational Security Agency, among others.   The super-secret NSA is responsible for electronic eavesdropping,gathering data from U.S. spy satellites and conducting sophisticatedsignals intelligence.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Leon Weidman, said he will file furthercharges against Mitnick next week. ``We believe he's extremelydangerous and should not be allowed any access to a computer ortelephone,'' Weidman said.   Mitnick is being held in a maximum-security cell at the federalMetropolitan Detention Center, where he is not allowed to make phonecalls unless he is monitored by an administrator.   A federal grand jury indicted him Dec. 20 on computer fraudcharges. He is accused of unauthorized use of MCI long-distancecodes to tap into computers at Leeds University in England and theUniversity of Southern California, and of causing $4 million damageto a Digital Equipment Corp. computer system.   Leonard DiCicco, 23, an associate who reported Mitnick toauthorities, has described the defendant as ``a big fat slob of aguy who couldn't get through a day without breaking into a computersomewhere.''   ``It's scary to think of the things he's capable of,'' saidDiCicco.   The 5-11, 240-pound Mitnick, clad in a khaki prison uniform,answered, ``Not guilty,'' twice when asked for his plea to thecharges against him.   His trial was tentatively set for Feb. 21 but Judge Pfaelzer saidthat would be changed if a new indictment is filed.   ``I have no doubt that he is a very, very great danger to thecommunity,'' she said. ``I also believe he is a flight risk.''   She ordered restrictions on his telephone use to remain in effect.   When Rubin objected to Mitnick being housed in a high securityarea of the prison, Ms. Pfaelzer declared: ``The court thinks highsecurity is entirely appropriate with this defendant.''   Rubin said he believed authorities were reacting to ``technologyfear and other reports of computer viruses'' elsewhere in the nation.   Mitnick reportedly used the code name ``Condor'' in hiselectronic activities, taking the name from the 1975 film ``ThreeDays of the Condor,'' in which Robert Redford played a CIAresearcher and telephone expert.   DiCicco contends that Mitnick is obsessed with two things _ fastfood and computers. ``All he did was eat Fat Burgers, drink Slurpeesand work on computers,'' DiCicco said.</TEXT></DOC>
