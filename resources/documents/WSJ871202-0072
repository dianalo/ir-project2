The country's chief investigation agency named Warren Anderson, who retired as chairman in November 1986, and eight other former Carbide officials and two Carbide affiliates as defendants. In a petition filed with the judicial magistrate's office in Bhopal, India, the Central Bureau of Investigation held them responsible for the gas leak in December 1984 at Carbide's pesticide plant in Bhopal. More than 2,800 people were killed and as many as 40,000 people were injured in what has been called the world's worst industrial disaster.    Responding to the government's action, a Carbide spokesman at the company's headquarters in Danbury, Conn., said, &quot;The criminal charges were completely unfounded.&quot; He said the charges &quot;appear to be motivated&quot; by the Indian government's &quot;inability to accept the fact of employee sabotage.&quot; The spokesman also said the government &quot;may be using this to deflect&quot; public criticism over the lack of any relief so far for the victims.    The Indian government's criminal charges come on the heels of the Bhopal District Court's decision last Friday that it would resume preliminary hearings, starting Jan. 11, as the first step toward a possible trial of the case. The district court judge, M.W. Deo, had suspended the pretrial hearings to allow both sides to reach a settlement on their own. But the two sides failed to reach a settlement by the court-imposed Friday deadline, the last of several deadlines the judge had set.    As previously reported, although Judge Deo has set preliminary hearing dates, the two sides continue to negotiate for a settlement on their own.    Those close to the Bhopal case said that even though the criminal and the civil cases involve separate issues and government agencies, India may be attempting to use the criminal charges -- which come nearly three years after the disaster -- to influence the settlement of the $3.3 billion lawsuit. It may be an effective political weapon, especially because Carbide is likely to concentrate in the preliminary hearings on the issue of employee sabotage, which it alleges was responsible for the gas leak.    A year after the disaster, Carbide filed a brief with the Bhopal District Court, claiming that it had ample evidence to prove that a disgruntled employee poured water in a chemical storage plant, causing the disaster.    The Indian government, which denies the charge, filed its own response to those allegations, and since then the issue has &quot;come up only indirectly&quot; in the settlement talks between two sides, said a lawyer involved in the case. But it may become the subject of close scrutiny in preliminary hearings.    A litigation analyst said the Indian government may be responding to the sabotage issue by launching its own criminal investigation against Carbide officials. &quot;Both sides are trying to push the other around,&quot; the analyst said, adding that the filing of the criminal charges may also be an attempt to appease Indian public sentiment. </TEXT></DOC>
