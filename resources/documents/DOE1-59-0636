However, sequences usedto date employ echo time (TE) values of about 15 ms +- 5 and, becauseof in vivo field inhomogeneities (short T2), they suffer badly from signalloss near sinuses and tissue boundaries. The authors implemented sequenceswith TE = 4-6 ms and found significant improvement in image quality,especially at high fields. Examples with long TEs vs. short TEs are givenin the knee, spine, head, and orbits. Further advantages include (1)faster repetition times (15 ms), (2) higher-quality spin-density or T1-weightedimages, and (3) reduction of blood motion artifacts.</TEXT></DOC>
