Manuel Antonio Noriega saidtoday that he urged rebel troops to release him and abandon theircoup, telling them to surrender ``or we're all going to die righthere.''   Loyalist troops killed 10 rebels and arrested dozens of topofficers and soldiers while crushing the attempt to topple Noriega,who was help prisoner for several hours on Tuesday, the militarysaid.   An overnight curfew kept the streets of Panama City quiet forthe second day in a row today.   A ``war communique'' said all but one of those killed wereofficers and that 25 people were wounded. The casualty listreleased Wednesday night was the first issued by the governmentsince the attempted coup.   The communique said security forces arrested three members ofthe High Command and about 35 other officers and soldiers. Thearrests of men supposedly among Noriega's most trusted aidessuggested the revolt may have had wider support than originallythought.   There were indications the coup attempt also came closer totoppling the Defense Forces chief and Panama's de facto leader thanfirst believed.   A Defense Forces officer said the plotters succeeded incapturing Noriega and holding him for four or five hours at DefenseForces headquarters. A lawyer for Noriega initially had denied thatthe general was taken captive.   ``The surrender came when loyal officers took command of thecombat units and gave the rebels a last chance to release thecommander and members of his staff or face the consequences,'' saidLt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon, director of the Defense Forces Securityand Defense Committee.   One Defense Forces source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said the rebels had wanted to take Noriega alive, which gave himtime to take shelter in a bunker inside the compound and call forhelp by radio.   Noriega said today on state television that he initiallyresisted the rebels, but finally came out unarmed to talk with them.   ``I told them that either they surrendered `or we're all goingto die right here,''' Noriega said. ``Their strategy was to takecontrol and turn over all power to the rebels (opposition).''   ``I was unarmed during this time... I'm a man of peace. I fireon my enemies, not against my brothers.''   Castrejon said Noriega was held for four or five hours. It wasunclear if Noriega gained freedom before or after troops loyal tohim counterattacked the headquarters and forced the rebel surrender.   Noriega ``had tried to calm his captors during the time he washeld, trying to avoid a bloodshed,'' Castrejon said.   The rebels rejected a U.S. offer to take Noriega out of thecountry, saying they wanted to retire him, Defense Secretary DickCheney said today on ``CBS This Morning.''   ``We were not given the opportunity to take him off their hands.We would have been happy to do so had that been an option, but theyclearly were not of a mind to have that happen,'' Cheney said.   In Washington, President Bush came under mounting criticismabout the passive role played by U.S. troops, who stood fully armeda few hundred yards away and watched the rebellion fail.   The United States has been trying to topple Noriega since he wasindicted on U.S. drug trafficking charges in February 1988, but theBush administration said it had no role in the coup attempt.   ``I'm afraid it's a matter of cold feet. It was a consciousdecision not to assist,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo. ``I'mfurious about it.''   ``It raises questions whether people down there can ever haveconfidence in the United States,'' said Rep. William Broomfield,R-Mich., the senior minority member of the House Foreign RelationsCommittee.   Members of the civilian opposition in Panama noted that thegroup that staged the coup attempt did not back democratic reform.   ``Their communique indicated they wanted Noriega out andsupported the provisional government that Noriega set up,'' saidRicardo Arias Calderon, an opposition vice presidential candidatein May 7 elections that Noriega annulled after internationalobservers said his candidates had lost by a landslide.   Despite that, Noriega continued to blame the United States forhis troubles. Noriega says it is all part of a U.S. plot to holdonto the Panama Canal, due to become Panama's at the end of thecentury.   ``The gringo piranhas want to do away with me,'' the generalsaid Wednesday during a brief tour of the street outside hisheadquarters.   The ``war communique'' only listed those arrested, wounded orkilled during the coup. It did not give any specific reason for thearrests of Col. Guillermo Wong, the head of state security, and twoother members of the 20-member High Command, the Panamanianequivalent of a general staff.   Defense Forces spokesmen were not available for comment on thearrests, according to people who answered phones at headquarters.   Among those killed was Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, leader of theUrraca battalion that launched the uprising, the ``war communique''said. No dead were listed as belonging to loyalist forces.   Of the wounded, 18 were from forces loyal to Noriega, three fromthe rebel forces and five civilians, the communique said.   The communique also said five coup leaders had taken refuge atFort Clayton, a U.S. base a few miles from Panama City. U.S.officials refused comment on that report.   As reports of Noriega's narrow escape circulated, the generalappeared to be enjoying himself when he appeared at a window in hisheadquarters to receive the cheers of several thousand supporters,most of them government workers.   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity inWashington, said they were mystified by the rebels' apparentdecision to let Noriega go.   ``It's crazy. I don't understand it,'' said one U.S. official.</TEXT></DOC>
