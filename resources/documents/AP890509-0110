Wright also charged that the ethics panel had permitted itselfto be misled by counsel Richard Phelan's selective use of evidence.   Wright said his own lawyers had been ``profoundly shocked by thelack of professionalism and prevalence of distortion and inaccuracycontained in the Phelan report'' and called the committee'sinvestigation ``one sided.''   But committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., defended thepanel's process and said its 12 members, six Democrats and sixRepublicans, had studied original transcripts and not relied solelyon Phelan's report.   Asked whether he was disturbed by Wright's strategy of attackingPhelan, Dixon said he was not, but added: ``I'm glad you recognizethat that is the strategy.''   At the same time, Wright's new legal defense team today preparedmotions asking that the two primary charges against him bedismissed on grounds that the ethics committee's special counselhas misread House rules.   A source familiar with the defense said Wright's lawyers believethey have a good chance of thinning the 69 formal counts of allegedrules violations before Wright faces a trial-like disciplinaryhearing before the ethics panel.   But the legal maneuvering appeared likely to further delay thathearing, pushing it into June rather than late this month.   Wright is charged with evading House limits on outside earnedincome through bulk sales of a book he wrote, and with improperlyaccepting some $145,000 in gifts from Fort Worth real estatedeveloper George Mallick, who has been deemed by the committee ashaving a direct interest in legislation before Congress.   But Wright's lawyers will argue that a strict reading of therules permits unlimited book royalties to be collected by a Housemember. They also will try to make the case that Mallick helpedWright not because of any interest in legislation, but because ofthe longtime friendship between the two, and that suchrelationships are protected by the rules.   They will argue that the special counsel, Richard J. Phelan,misread the history behind the rules and brought charges when nonewere warranted. Phelan's charges amount to a rewriting of therules, the defense lawyers contend.   In addition, the attorneys will seek to formally isolate Phelanfrom the ethics panel that employed him by arguing he now takes onthe role of prosecutor and the committee should limit its privatecontact with him to maintain objectivity.   The hard-line approach reflects the toughness of Wright's newlegal team, which now includes Houston trial lawyer Stephen Susman;former defense secretary and Democratic patriarch Clark Clifford;Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.; Robert Altman, a Washingtonattorney and associate of Clifford; and Neal S. Manne, a formercounsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee who is a member ofSusman's firm.   William C. Oldaker, who has handled the case for Wright thusfar, will continue to map out Wright's overall legal strategy,along with co-counsels Lyn Utrecht and Eric Kleinfeld.   Wright's campaign funds are paying the legal team's bill, apermitted practice, said spokesman Mark Johnson.   While the legal wrangling in Washington protracted, reports ofquestionable financial dealings by Wright proliferated.   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported today that Wright's wife,Betty, did little or nothing to earn her $36,000 yearly salary atthe Seattle-based Pacific Institute, a firm which sellsmotivational programs, primarily to corporate clients.   ``As far as I'm concerned, Betty Wright, during my tenure here,did nothing,'' said U.S. ``Tony'' French, a retired Army generalwho was the institute's chief operating officer from November 1987to May 1988.   ``I am not comfortable with anybody in Pacific Institute tellingme they think she did a fair day's work. I'm not buying that.''   An institute spokesman earlier had said Mrs. Wright did``follow-up'' work with corporate clients, but was unable to offerspecific examples of her work.   Some of the ethics counts against Wright are based on Mrs.Wright's earlier receipt of an $18,000-a-year salary from Mallickfor which the special counsel could find little evidence that anywork was done.</TEXT></DOC>
