Seven U.S. chip makers announced Wednesday they intend to recruitother companies and raise $1 billion for a company, U.S. MemoriesInc., that would produce dynamic random access memory chips, orDRAMs.   International Business Machines Corp., which makes DRAMs for itsown use, has agreed to provide the design and manufacturingtechnology for the new chips.   Japanese companies such as Toshiba, NEC Corp., Mitsubishi Ltd.and Hitachi Ltd. dominate the world market for DRAMs, which are usedin products ranging from computers to military gear and consumerelectronics.   ``DRAMs are the largest and an ever-growing sector of thesemiconductor business and play the role of technology driver forall other categories of microchips,'' read a statement from Toshibaheadquarters that was released by Toshiba America Inc. in New York.   ``It is fully expected therefore that major U.S. companies wouldre-enter this market. If IBM, a powerful producer of DRAMs, will beproviding key support for the venture, the new venture could becomea major manufacturing base in the future,'' Toshiba said.</TEXT></DOC>
