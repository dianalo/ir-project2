Equally disturbing even to leaders of the CentralIntelligence Agency, the new debate about the integrity ofthe agency is hurting morale. That is particularly damagingbecause the CIA has spent much of the past four yearsreversing an image of lawlessness that grew out of theIran-Contra affair.</LP><TEXT>   Deputy CIA Director Richard J. Kerr, a career official whowill run the intelligence community after Director WilliamWebster leaves, as early as this week, insists that normalfunctions are continuing and that he will feel free to makesome organizational changes. But, in an interview yesterday,he conceded that the nomination controversy &quot;has an impact&quot;on the CIA. &quot;It makes people spend time worrying about thingsother than their jobs,&quot; he said. &quot;It's very disruptive.&quot;   Hearings on Mr. Gates's nomination, annnounced byPresident Bush in mid-May, have been delayed until Sept. 16while the Senate Intelligence Committee looks into Mr.Gates's actions during the Iran-Contra scandal and into otheralleged CIA misdeeds while he was a top agency official.Because of that, senior members of the congressionalintelligence committees are worried that the agency -- whichthey already privately criticize as being too complacent --will just drift until late this year at best.   &quot;That will be a perception, and there will be some realityassociated with it,&quot; Mr. Kerr concedes. Mr. Webster &quot;islargely disconnected right now,&quot; he says. But he adds: &quot;Iwill spend my time doing what I have to do to run a verycomplex organization. I know how to do that.&quot; He says heconsults daily with Mr. Gates -- in the latter's role asPresident Bush's deputy national security adviser -- aboutintelligence decisions.   The delay and distraction couldn't come at a worse timefor the vast U.S. intelligence apparatus, which sprawls wellbeyond the CIA itself to take in a dozen or more agencies,commanding a secret budget in excess of $30 billion and morethan 100,000 employees scattered around the globe. If he getsthe job, Mr. Gates will not only run the CIA but by lawcoordinate all the other agencies, many of which actually arepart of the Pentagon.   Over the past year, a strong consensus has emerged,particularly in Congress, that this cumbersome intelligencebureaucracy needs to be reorganized and refocused to copewith a world in which the Soviet threat has been succeeded bymore numerous and diffuse dangers. Intelligence lapses andbureaucratic snafus during the Gulf War only intensified theconcerns.   Mr. Webster, a genteel outsider, took some modest steps toreshape the community, but his main role was to restore itsintegrity in the eyes of the public and the Congress. Bycontrast, Mr. Gates is seen, even by critics, as a personkeenly interested in such a shake-up and qualified by longexperience to carry it out.   &quot;The next director will have an incredible amount ofinfluence and power to shift direction,&quot; says HouseIntelligence Committee Chairman David McCurdy, Democrat ofOklahoma. &quot;The time is right for major changes, and hisability to do that is a major strength for Mr. Gates.&quot;   But Rep. McCurdy warns that, unless the administrationmoves soon, &quot;we will take legislative action on the wholenonmilitary intelligence community.&quot;   The issue of the need to revamp the community could becomea political football in the debate over Mr. Gates'scandidacy. His critics could well urge him to withdraw toavoid further delay if the hearings drag on. But the WhiteHouse could also use the need to get on with changes as atool for attacking congressional delay on the nomination.   Among the major tasks facing the agency's next directorare:   -- Improving lines of authority. While the CIA chief isthe nation's top intelligence official, his budget and mostof his assets -- including spy satellites -- come from thePentagon. The Gulf War showed serious coordination problemsbetween civilian and military spy services. Some in Congresspropose to remedy such problems by giving the CIA chief newpowers. &quot;We just have to have a closer relationship betweenmilitary and civilian intelligence,&quot; says Oklahoma DemocraticSen. David Boren, chairman of the Senate IntelligenceCommittee.   -- Focusing on new problems. In the 1990s, the issues U.S.policy makers will be worried about most are likely to beproliferation of nuclear and chemical arms, crises in theThird World and escalating economic competition. The CIAalready has formed internal centers on weapons proliferationand economic and technological intelligence, and Mr. Kerrsays the agency devotes just 12% of its resources to theSoviet Union. But the broader U.S. intelligence communitystill devotes a much higher percentage of its people andmachines to tracking Soviet-related issues.   -- Expanding the spy corps. Over the years, the U.S. hasbecome superb at spying from space. But the Gulf War madeclear that those methods mainly yield information on a foe'scapabilities, not its plans and intentions. That requiresmore spies on the ground-human intelligence, or &quot;humint&quot; inCIA parlance. A top administration official says that evennow, &quot;we still don't have a true feel for the politicalsituation in Baghdad.&quot; Deputy CIA Director Kerr insists that&quot;on Iraq, we're in pretty good shape.&quot; But he concedes: &quot;Dowe know what Saddam personally is thinking? Do we have directaccess to him? The answer is no.&quot; Sen. Boren says the latestCIA budget falls &quot;far short&quot; of congressional demands formore spies, and Congress and the White House are &quot;again thisyear embroiled in a major fight&quot; behind the scenes.   -- And making analyses sharper. Gen. Norman Schwarzkopfcomplained that during the war the intelligence assessmentshe got were so qualified and hedged as to be unusable. Thatcomplaint is almost universally echoed by the community's&quot;customers&quot; -- high officials in the White House, StateDepartment and Pentagon. The CIA has many hard-headedexperts, but their views are watered down into consensuspositions before being passed on to policy makers. &quot;There's amiddle layer of management that inhibits opinions,&quot; says Rep.McCurdy.</TEXT></DOC>
