AHN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South Korea announced Tuesday it waslifting a three-year-old ban on imports of foreign beef, but saidit would maintain an import quota system that has been opposed bythe United States.   Agriculture Minister Yun Kun-hwan said imports for 1988 would belimited to 14,500 tons. Yun did not say how much beef would beimported after this year, but indicated imports would be limited inorder to protect the local beef industry.   The end to the import ban was designed to avoid trade frictionwith foreign countries while at the same time alleviating domesticbeef shortages, Yun said.   The United States has been pressing South Korea to drop the banon beef imports to help correct Seoul's $10 billion trade imbalancewith Washington. The United States is also pressing South Korea todrop restrictions or bans on many other imports and opposes thebeef quota system.   There was no immediate reaction from local farmers who havestrongly opposed imports of beef unless the government guaranteed adefinite price support system before lifting the import ban.   Many Korean farmers went bankrupt due to an excessive import offoreign beef cattle before the last ban was imposed in 1985.Farmers have staged demonstrations to demand retention of theimport ban.   As reported previously, Yun said the proposed tonnage wouldinclude 3,000 tons of high quality beef for use at tourist hotelsto be imported from the United States. Officials said high qualitybeef could start arriving next month.   The remaining 11,500 tons of both high quality and ordinaryquality beef would be for general public consumption with salesopen to the United States, Australia and other bidders.   Yun said imported beef will be stockpiled for sales in casedomestic sales prices exceed designated levels to seek pricestabilization.</TEXT></DOC>
