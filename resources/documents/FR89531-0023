Background</ITAG>Section 523(a) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977(SMCRA) requires the Secretary to promulgate and implement a Federal landsprogram applicable to all surface coal mining and reclamation operationstaking place pursuant to any Federal law on Federal lands. Under section523(c) of SMCRA, a State with an approved State program may enter intoa cooperative agreement with the Secretary of the Interior (hereinafterreferred to as the Secretary) to provide for State regulation of surfacecoal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands within the State.Section 523(c) provides, however, that the Secretary may not delegate tothe State his responsibilities (1) to approve mining plans on Federal landsunder the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended, (2) to designate Federal landsas unsuitable for surface coal mining pursuant to section 522 of SMCRA,or (3) to regulate other activities taking place on Federal lands. On March 13, 1979, the Secretary promulgated the Federal lands program,30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter D (44 FR 15332-15341). That program wasamended on February 16, 1983 (48 FR 6912-6941). A notice correcting certaineditorial errors and omissions in the February 16, 1983, rule was publishedon April 1, 1983 (48 FR 13984). The February 16, 1983, rule was designed to allow States to assume greaterresponsibility for administering the requirements of SMCRA on Federal lands.That rule established provisions limiting the applicability of the Federallands program to exclude lands containing unleased Federal coal beneathprivately owned surface. The February 16, 1983, rule was challenged in Round I of <T3>In re</T3>: <T3>Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation (II)</T3>, Civil ActionNo. 79-1144 (D.D.C. 1984). The court ruled on the challenge on July 6,1984, and in an amended order on August 30, 1984. Among other things, the court ruled, with respect to the applicabilityof the Federal lands program, that the February 16, 1983, regulations inappropriatelylimited the applicability of the Federal lands program by excluding landscontaining unleased Federal coal beneath State or private surface. Therefore,OSMRE is proposing to revise its rule to implement the District Court's1984 order. Since the Court decision, OSMRE has been acting in accordancewith the ruling. In addition, OSMRE is proposing certain other changes for clarity and consistencywith existing requirements concerning responsibilities of the Bureau ofLand Management (BLM). <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion of Proposed Rule</ITAG>30 CFR Part 740 In 30 CFR Part 740, references to BLM regulations at 43 CFR Parts 3480-3487would be changed to 43 CFR Group 3400 to conform with BLM terminology.Section 740.4 Responsibilities Section 740.4(d) lists the responsibilities of BLM. OSMRE is proposingto revise this section to reflect more accurately applicable BLM requirements.Section 740.4(d) (2) and (3) refer to inspection, enforcement and civilpenalties with respect to exploration licenses and exploration operationssubject to applicable BLM regulations. However, the BLM regulations donot provide for civil penalties with respect to exploration activities.This proposed rule would delete references to civil penalties under BLMrules cited in andSection; 740.4(d). Proposed paragraph 740.4(d)(2), which would replace existing paragraphs740.4 (d)(2) and (d)(3), would state that BLM would be responsible forinspection and enforcement of the terms and conditions of coal explorationlicenses and exploration operations issued and approved pursuant to 43CFR Group 3400. Existing paragraph (d)(3) would be removed. Existing paragraph(d)(4) would be renumbered as new paragraph (d)(3).Existing paragraph 740.4(d)(5), which concerns inspection and enforcementwith respect to the recovery and protection of the coal resource, wouldbe replaced by proposed paragraph (d)(4) and revised to refer only to termsand conditions of recovery and protection of the coal resource. This proposedrevision would delete reference to civil penalties for the same reasonas discussed under proposed paragraph (d)(2).    Existing paragraphs at 30 CFR 740.4(d)(6), (7), (8) and (9) would be renumberedas paragraphs (d)(5), (6), (7) and (8).Section 740.11 Applicability    Section 740.11 of the existing regulations sets forth the applicabilityof the Federal lands program. Existing paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) limitthe applicability of the Federal lands program to surface coal mining andreclamation operations on lands containing leased Federal coal and on landswhere either the coal to be mined or the surface is owned by the UnitedStates. The District Court in <T3>re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation (II), </T3>CivilAction No. 79-1144 (D.D.C. 1984), ruled that the general exclusion fromthe Federal lands program of surface coal mining operations on privateor state owned surface overlying unleased Federal coal was inconsistentwith SMCRA. Therefore, OSMRE proposes to modify the Applicability sectionof the Federal lands program by revising paragraph (a)(2) and removingparagraph (a)(3), to provide that upon approval or promulgation of a regulatoryprogram for a State, that program and 30 CFR Subchapter D shall apply tosurface coal mining and reclamation operations taking place on any Federallands; that is, any lands containing Federal surface or Federal coal orboth. This means that where surface coal mining operations occur on landswhere the surface, the minerals, or both, are federally owned, the Federallands program will apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Procedural Matters</ITAG>Federal Paperwork Reduction Act    This proposed rule does not contain information collection requirementswhich require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act    The DOI has determined that this document is not a major rule under thecriteria of Executive Order 12291 (February 17, 1981) and certifies thatit would not have a significant economic effect on a substantial numberof small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq. </T3>The rule does not distinguish between small and largeentities. These determinations are based on the findings that the regulatoryadditions in the rule would not change costs to industry or to the Federal,State, or local governments. Furthermore, the rule produces no adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or the ability of United States enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.National Environmental Policy Act    The proposed rule is part of the Federal lands program, the promulgationof which is exempt under section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)), fromcompliance with section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).<ITAG tagnum="84">Author    </ITAG>The principal author of this proposed rule is Dr. Fred Block, Branch ofFederal and Indian Programs, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement,1951 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20240; Telephone: 202-343-1864(Commercial or FTS).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 740</ITAG>Coal mining, Public lands, Mineral resources, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Surface mining, Underground mining.Accordingly, it is proposed to amend 30 CFR Part 740 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: April 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Michael A.
