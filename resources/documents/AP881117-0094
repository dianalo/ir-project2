(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 10-foot rocket bearing fourexperiments made a five-minute flight today in what was touted asthe first truly private, commercial space flight.   The rocket, dwarfed by larger space rockets launched here, burnedits motor for only 4.4 seconds as it pushed the payload container toan altitude of about 14,000 feet, or less than three miles. Thelaunch took place at 7:30 a.m.   The payload was later recovered from the Atlantic Ocean eventhough the main parachute on the rocket failed to open.   E'Prime Aerospace Co. of Titusville hopes the rocket, LOFT-1,will lead to investor interest in the company so that it eventuallycan buy bigger rockets and establish a commercial launch service.   Stockholders and potential investors were among the 200 peoplewho watched the liftoff.   Company officials admit they have a long way to go. They had todelay the maiden launch a year to meet financial, safety, technicaland government requirements.   The so-called ``commercialization of space,'' to bring theprivate sector into the launching of satellites and other spaceactivity, has been a major goal of the Reagan admininstration.   E'Prime paid the Air Force $24,000 for use of an old weatherrocket launch pad and some support services. The company also had tobuy $1 million in liability insurance to cover any damage to AirForce property.   It was the first time a privately owned rocket had been launchedfrom either Air Force or NASA facilities here.   E'Prime operations director Jim Mizell said the experiments onboard the flight were from paying customers. He declined to say howmuch they had paid except to say that it was not enough to make theflight profitable. He estimated the total the fledgling company hasspent up to this point at $200,000.   In trying to attract investors, E'Prime billed the flight as the``first truly commercial space flight.'' But by E'Prime's owndefinition, space starts 75 miles up. And Space Services Inc., acommercial launch company in Houston, sent up a rocket six yearsago, although it did not carry commercial cargo.   Though the main chute did not open during the flight, Mizellreported that the smaller parachute broke the fall and diversrecovered the floating 30-pound package about two miles offshore.They reported it appeared to be undamaged.   LOFT-1, which stands for Launch Operations Flight Test, carried abiology experiment from a Huntsville, Ala., high school; a thin-filmpolymer experiment from Morton Thiokol Inc. and Utah StateUniversity; a flight monitoring system for measuring accelerationand temperature from QSI Corp. and Weber State College in Utah, anda data collection and telemetry system from the University ofAlabama at Huntsville.</TEXT></DOC>
