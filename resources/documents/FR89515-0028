Introduction1. The purpose of this proceeding is to implement the Final Acts of the1987 World Administrative Radio Conference for Mobile Services (1987 MobileWARC) into the Commission's Rules. The 1987 Mobile WARC was broad in scope,covering two-thirds of the International Radio Regulations reserved exclusivelyto the mobile services. It revised many portions of the international frequencyallocations as well as the technical regulations regarding the mobile services,mobile satellite services (MSS), radionavigation, and radiodeterminationsatellite services (RDSS). The revisions are scheduled to come into forceon two different dates, October 3, 1989, and July 1, 1991.2. This proceeding proposes to modify Parts 2, 25, 80, and 87 to reflectthe revisions of the Radio Regulations that become effective on October3, 1989. It also includes changes to the Radio Regulations from earlierconferences, particularly the 1983 World Administrative Radio Conferencefor Mobile Services (1983 Mobile WARC), that have not been implementedin the Commission's Rules to date.\1\<NOTE/> The 1987 Mobile WARC revisions scheduled to come into effecton July 1, 1991, will be treated in separate rule making proceedings.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Generally, the revisions of the 1987 Mobile WARC supersededthose changes called for by the 1983 Mobile WARC. However, a few changesremaining from the 1983 Mobile WARC are still relevant and those are includedherein.II. Background3. Actions taken by the 1967 and 1974 Maritime Conferences paved the wayfor introducing modern telecommunication technology into the maritime services.By the time of the 1979 World Administrative Radio Conference (1979 WARC)of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), further revisionsto the Radio Regulations were needed to keep up with the requirements ofthe mobile services. The 1979 WARC, however, did not have the time or resourcesto cope with the requirements of the mobile services and deferred actionto later specialized conference, pursuant to its Resolution No. 202. Thefirst of these conferences, the 1983 Mobile WARC held in Geneva from February28 to March 18, 1983, dealt primarily with distress and safety matters;specifically, the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS).\2\<NOTE/> The next conference, the 1987 Mobile WARC held in Genevafrom September 14 to October 17, 1987, covered a much broader range ofmobile telecommunications matters, including provisions for implementingthe GMDSS. The purpose of the 1987 Mobile WARC was to review and revisethe Radio Regulations concerning the mobile services, the mobile satelliteservices, and the radionavigation and radiodetermination satellite services.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The GMDSS will replace the present maritime distress andsafety system which relies on ship-to-ship distress alerting using manualMorse code. The GMDSS will rely primarily on ship-to-shore distress alertingusing satellites and high frequency (HF) terrestrial systems employingdigital selective calling (DSC) techniques. This system is expected tobe phased in from 1992 to 1999.4. In preparation for the 1987 Mobile WARC, the Commission instituted aproceeding in 1984 to obtain public comments and recommendations regardingthe proposals that the United States (U.S.) would make to the conference.\3\<NOTE/> As part of the proceeding, a Federal Advisory Committee wasestablished to serve as a focal point for developing a comprehensive recommendationfor the private sector.\4\<NOTE/> At the same time, the National Telecommunications and InformationAdministration (NTIA), which has responsibility for administering federalgovernment use of the spectrum, developed a similar set of proposals throughthe auspices of the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC). TheDepartment of State used both recommended sets of proposals to developthe formal U.S. proposals that were submitted to the ITU for considerationat the 1987 Mobile WARC.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ See Report and Order in General Docket No. 84-607, 2 FCCRcd 821 (1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ See Memorandum Opinion and Order in General Docket No.84-607, FCC 85-88, 50 FR 14451 (1985), adopted February 22, 1985, releasedMarch 29, 1985.5. The U.S. had four main priorities at the 1987 Mobile WARC:(1) Implementing the GMDSS system; (2) allocating sufficient frequencyspectrum worldwide to ensure the economic viability of MSS; (3) allocatingsufficient spectrum to permit establishment of the new RDSS; and (4) rearrangingthe high frequency (HF) maritime spectrum to meet our national needs.6. Most of the U.S. objectives were attained either in whole or in part.In the areas of mobile satellite allocations and radio operator requirements,however, the U.S. had serious concerns about the actions taken. Consequently,the delegation made protocol statements that said the U.S. would not acceptcertain decisions of the conference. Taking these reservations enablesthe U.S. to enact domestic provisions different from the internationalprovisions.7. The Final Acts of the 1987 Mobile WARC provided that the revisions enterinto force in two stages. Those changes that pertain to the HF maritimemobile bands (4000-27500 kHz) and the GMDSS, become effective on July 1,1991. The other allocations, including those pertaining to RDSS and MSS,and general requirements regarding the maritime and aviation services enterinto force on October 3, 1989. Those revisions, which become effectiveon the earlier date, are the subject of this rule making proceeding. TheHF band and GMDSS matters, which become effective in 1991, will be addressedin subsequent rule making proceedings.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Because of the magnitude of the revisions to the RadioRegulations, three rule making proceedings are planned to incorporate thechanges into the Commission's Rules: (1) The instant proceeding containingthose provisions that enter into force in 1989; (2) a second proceedingincorporating the HF band (4000-27500 kHz) revisions that become effectivein 1991; and (3) a final Docket implementing the GMDSS in the maritimeservice. See Public Notice, 3 FCC Rcd 6780 (1988) (hereafter cited as Implementationof the 1987 Mobile WARC).III. Discussion8. In reviewing the Final Acts with reference to the Commission's rules,the following issues are relevant:(a) What Changes should be made to andSection; 2.106, Table of FrequencyAllocations (47 CFR 2.106)? (b) What provisions should be adopted for the RDSS?(c) How was the MSS affected? (d) What changes to the maritime mobile and aviation services are necessaryat this time?9. <T3>Table of Frequency Allocations. </T3>Generally, the revisions to theinternational frequency allocations in the Radio Regulations were in agreementwith U.S. proposals\6\<NOTE/> Except for modifications for RDSS (1610-1626.5 MHz and 2483.5-2500HMz) and MSS (1530-1559 MHz and 1626.5-1660.5 MHz) both of which will bediscussed subsequently, most of the revisions address the terrestrial radioservices. In Appendix B, is a summary of international footnotes affectedby the 1987 Mobile WARC and their status relative to the proposed revisionof the Table of Frequency Allocations contained in Appendix C.\7\<NOTE/> A discussion of the key allocation matters follows. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The notable exception was the revisions to the 1530-1559MHz and the 1626.5-1660.5 MHz bands where the U.S. took a reservation.See Appendix A and separate discussion regarding the MSS. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Because revisions to the 4000-27500 kHz band (HF band)are not effective until July 1, 1991, changes to the 4000-27500 kHz portionof the Table of Frequency Allocations are not included in Appendix C butwill be addressed in a subsequent proceeding. See Implementation of the1987 Mobile WARC, supra. 10. The allocation changes involving radionavigation and radiobeacon systemsadopted at the 1987 Mobile WARC were in accord with U.S. proposals. At70-90 kHz and 110-130 kHz, we obtained an allocation for pulsed radionavigationsystem, albeit on a secondary basis (pursuant to modification of footnote451). At 415-495 kHz, although the aeronautical radionavigation service(essentially radiobeacons) also are allocated on a secondary basis in Region2, such beacons were accorded primary status in Cuba the U.S., and Mexicofor the 415-435 kHz band (footnote 469A). We propose to reflect these changesin the Table of Frequency Allocations. 11. A number of regulations affecting the radiodetermination service inthe 2900-3300 MHz, 5470-5650 MHz, and 9200-9500 MHz bands wered also adoptedat the 1987 Mobile WARC. The new regulations, in accordance with U.S. proposals:Confined the shipborne interrogator transponder (SIT) system to the 2930-2950MHz band (footnote 772); removed restrictions on ship radars in the 2900-2920MHz band (footnote 774 deleted) but retained them in the 9300-9320 MHzband until the year 2001 (footnote 825A); required that responses fromradar transponders in 2900-3100 MHz and 9300-9500 MHz bands not be confusedwith the responses from radar beacons and not cause interference to shipor aeronautical radars (footnote 775A); removed radar beacons and shipborneradars from the 3100-3266 MHz band (footnote 776 deleted); and permittedsearch and rescue transponders (SARTs) in the 9200-9500 MHz band (footnote824A). These changes are reflected in the proposed revisions of the Tableof Frequency Allocations.12. On the matter of aeronautical public correspondence, the 1987 MobileWARC allocated 2 megahertz (1593-1594 MHz and 1625.5-1626.5 MHz, secondarilyin the U.S.) for terrestrial public correspondence with aircraft as anintial allocation for pre-operational and experimental purposes. The U.S.position was that aeronautical public correspondence needs should be metthrough the MSS allocation. After intensive negotiations, the U.S. reluctantlyagreed to the 2 megahertz secondary allocation but stated that the U.S.had no intention of implementing these bands for aeronautical public correspondence.We continue to believe that aeronautical public correspondence communicationsshould be met through the MSS or by the proposed U.S. allocation at 900MHz.\8\<NOTE/> Therefore, no change to the Commission's Rules to accommodatethis type of communication at the 1.5/1.6 GHz bands is being proposed herein.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ See Notice of Proposed Rule Making in General Docket No.88-96, 3 FCC Rcd 2436 (1988).13. <T3>Radiodetermination Satellite Service (RDSS). </T3>Sufficient spectrumwas allocated by the 1987 Mobile WARC to permit the RDSS to begin operatinginitially in North America, while ensuring for most areas of the worldan international status for RDSS in the Radio Regulations. Thus, the U.S.was successful in establishing international recognition and protectionto enable this service to expand globally. After extensive debate and informalcoordination, the allocations that finally emerged were the same as thosespecified in the U.S. domestic table at 1610-1626.5 and 2483.5-2500 MHz.Thus, we propose no domestic change to the Table of Frequency Allocationsfor the 1.6 and 2.4 GHz bands. The RDSS feeder links, however, currentlylocated in the U.S. at 5117.5183 MHz were allocated internationally at5150-5216 MHz. Hence, we propose to re-allocate the feeder links (footnoteUS307) to the 5150-5216 MHz band in accordance with the Radio Regulations(footnote 797A). We expect this change in the feeder links allocation tohave only minimal impact because there is only one licensee at presentand its system is not due to become operational until 1992. 14. <T3>Mobile Satellite Service (MSS). </T3>Because there is a strong interestin the U.S. for providing domestic mobile satellite communications, particularlyfor land mobile purposes, the U.S. sought additional frequency spectrumfor the MSS. The goal was to provide for introduction of MSS systems worldwideand to ensure international protection from interference for domestic systems.The U.S. proposed to reallocate spectrum in the 1.5 and 1.6 GHz bands (L-band)for MSS from the maritime mobile satelite service (MMSS) and the aeronauticalmobile satellite (route) service (AMSS(R)). Simply put, we proposed tore-allocate 57.5 megahertz of spectrum for the MSS in the 1530-1559 MHz(downlink) and 1631.5-1660 MHz (uplink) bands. Further, the allocationswould stipulate that priority access for safety and distress communicationsbe given to the MMSS in the 1530-1544 MHz and 1631.5-1645.5 bands, andthe AMSS(R) in the 1545-1559 MHz and 1646.5-1660 MHz bands. 15. The 1987 Mobile WARC, however, did not allocate spectrum to a genericMSS service as we proposed. Instead, spectrum in the 1530-1559 MHz and1626.5-1660.5 MHz bands was re-allocated to be shared both primarily andsecondarily among the land, aeronautical, and maritime mobile satelliteservices. The international allocation adopted at the 1987 Mobile WARCis summarized as follows: 6 megahertz were allocated to the land mobilesatellite service (LMSS) on a shared co-primary basis with the MMSS at1530-1533 MHz and 1631.5-1634.5 MHz; 27 megahertz were allocated to theLMSS on a secondary basis to MMSS for non-speech, low-bit rate data systemsat 1533-1544 MHz, 1626.5-1631.5, and 1634.5-1645.5 MHz; 2 megahertz (nochange) continued to be allocated to the general MSS for distress and safetycommunications at 1544-1545 MHz and 1645.5-1646.5 MHz; 20 megahertz (decreasedfrom 28 megahertz) continued to be allocated to the AMSS(R) at 1545-1555MHz and 1646.5-1656.5 MHz and may be authorized by administrations forpublic correspondence with aircraft earth stations; and 8 megahertz wasre-allocated from the AMSS(R) to the LMSS on a primary basis at 1555-1559MHz and 1656.5-1600.5 MHz and may be authorized by administrations foraircraft and ship earth stations to communicate with space stations inthe LMSS.16. Thus, the U.S. was partially successful in establishing additionalspectrum for sharing between the mobile satellite services generally. Theallocations, however, are not available for all three services in as generala nature as we had proposed. Only 8 megahertz (1555-1559 MHz and 1656.5-1660.5MHz) may be authorized for all three mobile satellite services (i.e., sharedamong the land, aeronautical, and maritime mobile satellite services).An additional 33 megahertz (1530-1544 MHz and 1626.5-1645.5 MHz) was allocatedfor LMSS both co-primarily and secondarily with the MMSS. Because the allocationswere less than sought, the U.S. took a formal reservation to use the L-bandspectrum in the way most appropriate to satisfy its particular MSS requirementswhile recognizing the priority of AMSS(R) and MMSS safety communications.17. The Commission's current Rules provide for the L-band to be sharedbetween the MSS and AMSS(R) as follows: 9 megahertz are allocated for MSSon a secondary basis to AMSS(R) at 1545-1549.5 MHz and 1646.5-1651 MHz;and 18 megahertz are allocated to MSS on a co-primary basis with AMSS(R)for the 1549.5-1558.5 MHz and 1651-1660 MHz bands pursuant to footnoteUS308 which stipulates that AMSS(R) requirements that cannot be satisfiedin the previous primary AMSS(R) bands shall have priority access with realtime preemptive capability for communications in the MSS. 18. Although the domestic allocation differs from that adopted by the 1987Mobile WARC, the U.S. maintained its flexibility with regard to the L-bandspectrum by its reservation on this matter. The Commission's decision concerningthe reallocation of the L-band spectrum shared between the MSS and AMSS(R)is currently pending further reconsideration.\9\<NOTE/> In addition, the Commission has received a petition requestingU.S. implementation of the LMSS allocations in the MMSS spectrum.\10\<NOTE/> These matters concerning the L-band spectrum will be addressedin separate proceedings. Therefore, we propose only to reflect the internationalchanges to the Table of Frequency Allocations (columns 1-3) at this time.No changes to the MSS domestic allocations in the Table of Frequency Allocation(columns 4-7) are proposed herein. We wish to note, however, that throughthe U.S. protocol statement the Commission has the flexibility to use thisspectrum in the manner appropriate to its particular needs, that is, tomaintain or modify the U.S. allocation in accordance with our domesticsatellite radio communications requirements. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ See Report and Order in General Docket Nos. 84-1231, 84-1233,and 84-1234, 2 FCC Rcd 1825 (1986); and Memorandum Opinion and Order inGeneral Docket Nos. 84-1231, 84-1233, and 84-1234, 2 FCC Rcd 6830 (1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ See Petition for Rule Making, RM-6459, filed by GeostarMessaging Corporation, June 1998, requesting the Commission to amend theTable of Frequency Allocations (46 CFR 2.106) and make other rule provisionsfor a digital LMSS.19. <T3>Maritime Mobile and Aviation Services. </T3>All of the technical andoperational revisions to the Radio Regulations need not be reflected inthe Commission's Rules. Several revisions were merely editorial in nature.Others were not relevant to domestic regulations or are unnecessary dueto existing equipment design. Some revisions, such as those to accommodatethe GMDSS, are premature with respect to domestic implementation plansand are best addressed in separate proceedings at a later date.\11\<NOTE/> A few provisions affecting the maritime mobile and aviationservices that become effective on October 3, 1989, are discussed here.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ See Implementation of the 1987 Mobile WARC, supra.20. In anticipation of implementation of the GMDSS, the 1987 Mobile WARCadopted more stringent frequency tolerances for maritime transmitters toimprove the operational reliability of the automated digital communicationsystems at an early stage. Therefore, some of the frequency tolerancesapplicable to transmitters in the maritime services, contained in andSection;80.209 (47 CFR 80.209), need to be revised. For narrow-band direct-printing(NBDP) and data station transmitters in the bands 100-27500 kHz, a toleranceof 10 Hz was specified in the Radio Regulations for all coast and shipstation transmitters installed after January 1, 1992. Previously, the tolerancewas 15 Hz for coast station and 20 Hz for ship station transmitters. Therefore,we propose to require all coast and ship stations in the band 100-27500kHz to have a 10 Hz frequency tolerance for any NBDP and data station transmittersinstalled after January 1, 1992. Similarly, for digital selective calling(DSC), the 1987 Mobile WARC adopted a frequency tolerance of 10 Hz forall coast and ship station transmitters installed after January 1, 1992.Current Commission Rules, require DSC coast station transmitters to havea tolerance of 10 Hz after January 1, 1990, but DSC ship station transmittersare not required to comply until January 1, 1995. Thus, we propose leavingthe January 1, 1990, date for coast stations but changing the ship stationdate from January 1, 1995, to January 1, 1992. 21. Similarly, the Radio Regulations specify more stringent emission limitsfor single-sideband radiotelephony transmitters operating in the bandsbetween 1605 and 27500 kHz in Region 2 (Region 2 includes the U.S.). Thenew emission limit is 28 decibels (dB) below the mean power (i.e., 31 dBbelow the peak envelope power) on frequencies removed from the assignedfrequency by more than 50 percent and up to 150 percent of the authorizedbandwidth. The Commission's rules in andSection; 80.211 (47 CFR 80.211),however, only requires 25 dB under the same conditions. Thus, we are proposingto change the Commission's rules to require emissions to be attenuated28 dB relative to the mean power to comply with the requirements of theRadio Regulations. To minimize any possible burden, however, we are proposingthat only transmitters installed after February 1, 1992, meet this requirement.Because the new standards are only slightly more stringent than the presentlimitations, existing installations would continue to be acceptable. Areview of our type acceptance data indicates that most equipment beingproduced today complies with the new specifications. The proposed change,however, will ensure that future equipment meets or exceeds internationalstandards. 22. Several other changes are also proposed to incorporate various operationalprocedures adopted by the 1987 Mobile WARC or to update and clarify existingrules. To reflect the new frequencies adopted by 1987 Mobile WARC below4 MHz (455.5, 458.5, 2177, and 2189.5 kHz for DSC and 2191 kHz for radiotelephonycalling), we propose amending andSection;andSection;80.359 and 80.369 (47 CFR80.359 and 80.369), respectively.\12\<NOTE/> We further propose to replace the details regarding the NBDPtechnical and operating requirements contained in andSection;andSection;80.142and 80.219 (47 CFR 80.142 and 80.219) with references to the appropriateCCIR recommendations that contain the relevant information. Section 80.379(47 CFR 80.379) is proposed to be modified to clarify that aircraft mayuse frequency 156.800 MHz (channel 16) at any altitude for VHF distressand safety purposes and, in accordance with current Commission provisions,may continue to use it for general calling purposes below 1,000 feet. Similarly,andSection;87.187 (47 CFR 87.187) would also be amended to clarify the permitteduse by aircraft of the maritime distress frequency 156.800 MHz. We proposeto amend andSection;87.187(o) by adding a reference to andSection;87.303(d)to focus attention that the band 1530-1535 MHz will be re-allocated tothe MMSS on a primary basis effective January 1, 1990.\13\<NOTE/> We also propose to editorially amend andSection;87.187(x) tobring it into conformity with the definitions of stations in the terrestrialand satellite radio services. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\New frequencies and requirements for the maritime mobileservice operating in the 4000-27500 kHz bands are not effective until July1, 1991. They will be addressed in a subsequent proceeding. See Implementationof the 1987 Mobile WARC, supra. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\Aeronautical telemetry users in the band may continuetheir operations on a secondary non-interference basis until mobile satellitesystems are implemented but should be aware that they may have to relocateat some future date. We are not proposing to revise the U.S. Table of FrequencyAllocations with respect to 1530-1535 MHz band at this time. IV. Miscellaneous23. New definitions are proposed to be consistent with those adopted bythe 1987 Mobile WARC for aeronautical route (R) and off-route (OR) services,aeronautical mobile satellite (R) and (OR) services, land earth station,base earth stations, and land mobile earth station. We also propose toreflect the revision of the RDSS definition by adding the sentence ``Thisservice may also include feeder links necessary for its own operation.''24. The revision of Articles 55 and 56 of the Radio Regulations concerningradio operators, radio equipment maintainers, and their certification,was one of the most contentious issues at the 1987 Mobile WARC. In ourview, mandatory requirements for full-time radio equipment maintainersto be on board vessels were adopted unnecessarily by the conference. Theissue of providing maintenance personnel on board ships was the singlemost controversial issue between the developing and developed countries.Ultimately, the issue could not be resolved and the U.S. was joined by22 other countries in a reservation (with 2 other countries submittingseparate reservations, for a total of 24) against the new maintenance provisionsin Articles 55 and 56. Because these 24 countries represent much of theworld's shipping fleet, the weight of the reservation is significant. Underthe reservation, the U.S. maintains the flexibility with regard to theGMDSS requirements. No changes to the Commission's Rules are suggestedat this time. This matter will be addressed in the future GMDSS proceeding,as necessary.\14\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\<T3>See </T3>Implementation of the 1987 Mobile WARC, <T3>supra.</T3> V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 25. In accordance with section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Actof 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that these rules wouldnot, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. For the most part, the changes proposed hereinmerely reflect an update of international requirements that comport withexisting U.S. requirements. In those instances where more stringent frequencytolerances are specified for maritime transmitters, we propose an effectivedate of sufficient length to minimize any possible burden to equipmentmanufacturers or users. Likewise, where new emission limits are specified,we also propose to minimize the impact by permitting the continuation ofexisting equipment currently in use. The proposed changes will ensure thatfuture equipment meet or exceed the international standards without causinga significant economic impact on any entity. VI. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement26. The proposals contained herein have been analyzed with respect to thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and found to contain no new or modifiedform, information collection, or recordkeeping, labeling, disclosure, orrecord retention requirements, and will not increase or decrease burdenhours imposed on the public.VII. Procedural Matters27. For purposes of this non-restricted notice and comment rule makingproceeding, members of the public are advised that ex parte presentationsare permitted except during the Sunshine Agenda period. See generally 47CFR 1.1206(a). The Sunshine Agenda period is the period of time which commenceswith the release of a public notice that a matter has been placed on theSunshine Agenda and terminates when the Commission (1) releases the textof a decision or order in the matter; (2) issues a public notice statingthat the matter has been deleted from the Sunshine Agenda; or (3) issuesa public notice stating that the matter has been returned to the stafffor further consideration, whichever occurs first. 47 CFR 1.1202(f). Duringthe Sunshine Agenda period, no presentations, ex parte or otherwise, arepermitted unless specifically requested by the Commission or staff forthe clarification or adduction of evidence or the resolution of issuesin the proceeding. 47 CFR 1.1203.28. In general, an ex parte presentation is any presentation directed tothe merits or outcome of the proceeding made to decision-making personnelwhich (1) if written, is not served on the parties to the proceeding, or(2) if oral, is made without advance notice to the parties to the proceedingand without opportunity for them to be present. 47 CFR 1.1202(b). Any personwho submits a written ex parte presentation must provide on the same dayit is submitted a copy of same to the Commission's secretary for inclusionin the public record.
