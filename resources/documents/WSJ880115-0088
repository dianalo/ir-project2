Excluding auto purchases, which were fueled by dealer and manufacturer incentives, sales rose just 0.2% after a 0.3% increase in November. Volume fell last month at furniture and department stores. Spending &quot;isn't a disaster, but it's fairly anemic,&quot; said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group here.    The overall December gain, the biggest since a 1.4% jump in August, followed a 0.1% rise in November and a 0.9% plunge in October.    The report suggests that consumers haven't drastically curbed spending in response to the Oct. 19 stock market plunge, as many analysts feared they would. &quot;Spending is sluggish, but it didn't fall apart after the market crash,&quot; said Evelina Tainer, senior domestic economist at First National Bank of Chicago.    Both economists attributed the softness in outlays to weak growth in personal income, a trend that was apparent before Oct. 19 and that is widely expected to continue. In addition, individuals' savings remain low and consumer-debt burdens are heavy.    While slower spending would curb the growth of the overall economy, it could also help narrow the nation's trade deficit by reducing imports. The Commerce Department will release its November merchandise-trade figures today.    Auto sales rose 2.4% in December after declining 0.7% in November. Furniture sales fell 0.5% after rising 0.2%. Sales of building materials increased 1.3% after a 1.1% drop. Overall, sales of durable goods, intended to last three years or more, climbed 1.7% after a 0.2% rise in November.    Sales of nondurable goods edged up 0.1% in each month. Within this category, sales of general-merchandise stores, including department stores, fell 0.4% in December after being unchanged in November. Sales at apparel stores rose 0.3% after a 1.6% drop.    The overall December rise brought total sales to $126.68 billion from $125.77 billion in November. December sales were 0.6% below a year earlier.    The figures are adjusted for seasonal variation. The estimates are based on a relatively small sample of reports, however, and frequently are revised substantially as more data are collected. The numbers exclude spending on services, which accounts for a large portion of consumer outlays. </TEXT></DOC>
