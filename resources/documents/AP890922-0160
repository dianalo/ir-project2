But many private economists expressed criticism about the currentstate of international economic coordination and said they wereexpecting little more than vague rhetoric at the end of day-longdiscussions on Saturday.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Federal Reserve ChairmanAlan Greenspan will host the talks with their counterparts fromJapan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.   It will be the first meeting of finance ministers and centralbank presidents from the seven nations since last April. Since thattime, the so-called Group of Seven has seemingly lost its controlover international currency markets.   The dollar is currently trading above the ceilings set by theGroup of Seven despite numerous rounds of coordinated intervention,the process by which countries buy and sell currencies on the openmarket in an effort to influence the price.   Some analysts blame the Bush administration for the failure toget the dollar under control, saying that Brady, unlike formerTreasury Secretary James A. Baker III, has been too complacent aboutthe dangers a high dollar poses to the U.S. economy.   Baker in 1985 launched an effort with other G-7 countries to pushthe dollar lower in order to curb record-high U.S. trade deficits. Aweaker dollar makes U.S. goods more competitive on overseas marketswhile making imports more expensive for American consumers.   But Brady has been much less of an activist in this area,generally choosing to play down concerns that the dollar's strengthwas threatening to abort improvements in the U.S. trade deficit.   A senior Treasury official, briefing reporters on Friday,disputed contentions that the economic coordination effort hadbroken down, saying that it was the administration's view that``economic coordination is working well.''   ``We think we have had a considerable measure of success in termsof improving the performance of the world economy,'' said theofficial, who spoke on the condition that his name not be revealed.   He noted that the U.S. trade deficit, which fell by a sharp 22percent in 1988, has declined 11 percent further so far this year,providing evidence that while the improvement has slowed it has notcome to a halt.   The official said that if the dollar were to continuestrengthening ``for a lengthy period of time, this obviously, is amatter of concern ... because obviously we have more (tradeadjustments) to accomplish.''   Many private economists were looking for a communique to beissued at the end of Saturday's closed-door talks stating in generalterms the group's continued commitment to stabilize the dollar.   David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill said he was notlooking for anything stronger than vague expressions of concernabout the dollar's strength and the need to see the value of thegreenback stabilized.   ``They should be doing something to bring the dollar down. Ithink they would like to, but I don't think they know what to do,''Wyss said.   Many analysts said that controlling the dollar is virtuallyimposible without commitments on the part of the Japanese and theWest Germans to boost interest rates. Higher interest rates in thosecountries would make dollar-denominated investments less attractiveand thus help to push the dollar lower.   David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., agovernment securities dealer, said that he was looking forstepped-up intervention and more public comments in coming weeks inan effort to push the dollar lower even if the new determination isnot reflected in Saturday's communique.   He said the Bush administration is coming to the realization thatwithout some action, a growing trade deficit could weaken theeconomy around the time of next year's mid-term congressionalelections, thus hurting Republican chances.   The Group of Seven discussions were being held before the startof the annual meetings of the 152-nation International Monetary Fundand its sister lending organization, the World Bank.   IMF officials have been pushing for a doubling of the fund'sresources to allow it to better handle the crushing $1.3 trillionThird World debt burden, but the senior Treasury official saidFriday that the United States still has not reached a conclusionthat such an increase is needed.   However, Dutch Finance Minister H. O. Ruding, chairman of theIMF's policy-setting Interim Committee, told reporters Friday thathe expected the eventual outcome of the debate would result in theIMF seeing its resources boosted by between 50 percent and 67percent.</TEXT></DOC>
