In the nearly two months since Communist authorities suppressedthe pro-democracy movement, the number of reported arrests forembezzlement, bribe-taking, smuggling, armed robbery and othercommon crimes has multiplied.   The government is apparently trying to satisfy populardiscontent over official corruption _ a chief target ofpro-democracy protesters.   Reports of arrests of protesters, by contrast, have tricklednearly to a halt, perhaps to avoid further internationalcondemnation.   Although China's crime rate still is one of the lowest in theworld, in recent years the leadership has noted its rapid rise withalarm.   The government said early this year that the number of peoplesentenced for crimes in 1988 was up 13 percent from the previousyear, at nearly 368,800.   Rarely have the media devoted so much space and energy to crimereports.   In recent weeks, it has not been unusual to find three or fourreports of crime and corruption at all levels of government and inall sectors of society in each of the nation's leading newspapers,sometimes all on the front page.   The number of cases and range of people involved _ from privateentrepreneurs to factory managers to high-ranking officials _ hintsat how pervasive crime and corruption is in Chinese society.   On Thursday, the front-page of the People's Daily, the CommunistParty newspaper, carried two such reports.   One said Shanghai authorities have in the year's first halfinvestigated 134 cases of economic crime involving more than 10,000yuan ($2,700) each, an amount 100 times the average monthly salary.   Sixty-four people have been arrested and 62 ounces of gold and$682,300 in yuan and various foreign currencies confiscated, thepaper said.   The other, much briefer report said that Guizhou provincialauthorities had uncovered a batch of large, important criminalcases. It called for a thorough investigation but gave no details.   On an inside page, the newspaper reported that two judicialdepartment workers were sentenced, one to eight and the other tonine years, for seeking and accepting bribes totaling about $7,200in cash and appliances.   Many reports are careful to point out that investigations beganmonths before the student-led pro-democracy movement, whichauthorities crushed June 4 when the army killed hundreds of unarmedcivilians in running protesters out of central Beijing.</TEXT></DOC>
