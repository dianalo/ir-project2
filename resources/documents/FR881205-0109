This procedureis similar to the one adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency lastyear with respect to Federal emissions standards. The new NHTSA procedurecontrasts with its present one allowing importation by any person, uponthe furnishing of a bond for the production of a compliance statement within120 days after entry. The new law provides a number of exemptions fromthe general requirement for importation by importers. For example, thenew procedures retain the current exemptions for foreign military and diplomaticpersonnel. The new law also gives the Secretary authority to exempt vehiclesimported solely for research, training, competitive racing events or similarpurposes. Similar exemptions are permitted under the existing import procedures.Other changes are also discussed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>As provided in section 2(e)(1) of the Imported VehicleSafety Compliance Act, the amendments made by the Act to the National Trafficand Motor Vehicle Safety Act are effective January 31, 1990, if regulationsimpementing the Imported Vehicle Safety Act have been proposed not laterthan April 30, 1989.

L. 100-562, the Imported Vehicle Safety ComplianceAct of 1988 (``the 1988 Act''). The 1988 Act amends those provisions ofthe National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (``the VehicleSafety Act'') that relate to the importation of motor vehicles subjectto the Federal motor vehicle safety stanards (section 108(b), 15 U.S.C.1397(b)). Section 2(e)(2) of the 1988 Act requires NHTSA, as soon as possibleafter enactment, to ``take reasonable steps designed to encourage notificationto the extent feasible'' regarding its provisions ``to individuals whomay be affected by such amendments.'' The purpose of this notice is toapprise the public at large of the 1988 Act and the changes that it makesin motor vehicle importation procedures that have been in effect, relativelyunchanged, since January 1, 1968.The current importation regulations, which are set forth in 19 CFR 12.80,were jointly issued by the Departments of Transportation and Treasury pursuantto the authority of sections 108(b)(3) and (b)(4) of the Vehicle SafetyAct. Administered by NHTSA and the Customs Service, these regulations,with minor amendments, have governed the importation of motor vehicle andmotor vehicle equipment subject to the Federal motor vehicle safety standardssince the effective date of the first standards in January 1968. Thoseregulations will continue to govern the importation of nonconforming vehiclesand equipment until the effective date of the amendments made by the 1988Act.One effect of the amendments made by the 1988 Act is to delete the authorityfor the existing joint regulations and to vest in NHTSA authority to regulatethe importation of motor vehicles subject to the Vehicle Safety Act. Thecategory of importer primarily affected by the amendments is the importerof a motor vehicle that does not conform, at the time of importation, tothe Federal motor vehicle safety standards that applied at the time ofits original manufacture. Under the current regulation, 19 CFR 12.80(b)(1)(iii),a nonconforming vehicle may be imported if the importer provides a bondfor the production of a statement within 120 days of entry that the vehiclehas been brought into compliance with the Federal motor vehicle safetystandards, and if the importer declares that the vehicle will not be sold,or offered for sale, until the bond has been released.The 1988 Act imposes restrictions upon both motor vehicles and importers.The principal restriction upon a motor vehicle is that it cannot be importedat all unless NHTSA determines that it is suitable for modification tomeet the Federal safety standards. Determinations will be made on NHTSA'sown initiative, or upon petition of any registered importer (see discussionbelow) or any motor vehicle manufactuer, and will be subject to publiccomment.A nonconforming vehicle may be imported under either of the following twoscenarios. The first scenario will involve the making of two determinations:That the nonconforming vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicleof the same model year originally manufactured for importation into andsold in the U.S., and that the vehicle is capable of being readily modifiedto conform.The second scenario will arise if the agency does not make a substantialsimilarity determination regarding a vehicle. In that case, it will stillbe permissible to import the vehicle if the agency determines that it hassafety features that comply with the U.S. standards, or are capable ofbeing modified to comply with those standards, ``based on destructive crashdata or such other evidence'' as NHTSA determines is adequate.Under either scenario, a positive determination regarding a vehicle willpermit <T3>any </T3>registered importer to modify vehicles of the same model andmodel year. If the agency makes a negative determination regarding a model's substantialsimilarity or ability to be modified, the agency will be temporarily prohibitedfrom taking up the issue again. If the decision was made in response toa petition, the 1988 Act prohibits the agency from considering a petitionregarding the same model of vehicle until at least 3 months after thatdecision. If the negative determination was made in a proceeding begunat the agency's own initiative, the agency will not be able to make anotherdetermination regarding the same model of motor vehicle until at least3 months after the negative one. The primary restriction placed on persons importing nonconforming vehiclesis that they will have to be, subject to certain exceptions, registeredimporters, or those who have conformance contracts with registered importers.The purpose of this requirement is to increase the likelihood that thenonconforming vehicles will be properly modified and actually brought intocompliance with the safety standards. In order to become and remain registered, a registered importer will haveto keep records, allow inspection of its records and facilities, and demonstratethat it will be able technically and financially to carry out notificationand remedy responsibilities in the event a noncompliance or safety relateddefect is determined to exist in any of the vehicles that it imports. Tocover the expenses of the registration program and certain other activities,each registered importer will have to pay annual fees. Registration maybe revoked or suspended for failure to comply with any requirement or regulation,and is automatically suspended for failure to pay a required fee in a timelymanner, or for knowingly filing a false or misleading certification. Importers will continue to provide a bond for each vehicle imported toensure that the vehicle is brought into conformity with the safety standards.When a registered importer has finished its modifications of an importedvehicle, it will have to attach a label to the vehicle stating that itcomplies with the safety standards, and certify to NHTSA that the vehicleconforms to the safety standards. The registered importer will be ableto release the vehicle from its custody for licensing or registration 30days after its submission of the certification to NHTSA. NHTSA, however,may demand an inspection of the vehicle within the 30-day period. In thatevent, the vehicle may be released only upon the agency's written finding,on completing the inspection, that the vehicle complies. This finding maybe made within the 30-day period, but need not be made within that period.If the agency gives a written notice of compliance, the vehicle may bereleased immediately. The 30-day release provisions also do not apply if,within that period NHTSA has reason to believe a certification is falseor contains a material misrepresentation. The 1988 Act provides a variety of exemptions from the requirements thatnonconforming imported vehicles be determined by the agency to be suitablefor modification and imported and modified by Registered Importers. Therequirements do not apply to:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Vehicles needing further manufacturing in order to perform theirintended functions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Any individual who wishes to import a vehicle for his or her ownpersonal use if the person provides a bond to assure proper modificationof the vehicle, provides a copy of any agreement with a registered importercommitting the importer to modify the vehicle to bring it into conformitywith the safety standards and certifies that the vehicle is of the samemodel and model year as a vehicle which the agency has previously determinedto be suitable for modification. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Any individual, including U.S. military personnel, whose assignedplace of employment was outside the United States on October 31, 1988,who wishes to import a vehicle, purchased or ordered before that date,for his or her own personal use, who imports the vehicle not later thanOctober 31, 1992, and who meets the requirements of the current importationprocedures. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Any individual who works for a foreign government on assignment inthis country or for the Secretariat of a public international organizationand is within the class of person for whom free entry of vehicles has beenauthorized by the Secretary of State and any individual who is a memberof the armed forces of a foreign country and is on assignment in this country.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Any vehicle that is 25 years or more old. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Any vehicle imported solely for research, investigations, studies,demonstrations or training, or competitive racing events.
