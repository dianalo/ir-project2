(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>With the recet introduction of LANstep, Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc.andO;became the latest player to enter the network operating system market, amarket that has seen more than a dozen new entrants in the past two years.andO;Other companies, such as Compex Inc., Northnet Research Inc., and MosesComputers Inc., have announced network OSes within the past six months.andM;Why all this activity?andP;  On a node-by-node accounting, 94 percent of thenetwork OS market is sewn up by six vendors, so Hayes and some two dozenother vendors are left to vie for the remaining six percent (see Figure).andO;Analysts question the profitability of entering a market dominated by thelikes of Novell Inc., 3Com Corp., IBM, Digital Equipment Corp., BanyanSystems Inc., and Sitka Corp.andP;  Moreover, by focusing on entry-level products,these newcomers leave little room for users to expand their networks.andM;Other industry observers, however, believe that the entry-level network OSmarket is taking off and the newcomers to the market are addressing userneeds unmet by the larger network OS vendors.andP;  An entry-level LAN allowssimple peripheral and software sharing at a lower cost than networks withmore features.andM;Hayes' entry into the network OS market is a natural evoluation of itscommunications business, says Joe Fuller, Hayes' business developmentmanager.andP;  The company has diversified from modems to communications softwareto bridges and Ethernet NICs to an ISDN terminal adapter, so developing anetwork OS seemed the appropriate next step.andM;Fuller says LANstep addresses a segment of the market whose needs are notcurrently met -- small to mid-size businesses.andP;  These companies, he says,have &quot;entry-level users in terms of LAN knowledge but high-level needs,&quot; suchas network security, connections to other LANs and host computers, and theability to expand the network to accommodate dozens of users.andM;Fuller believes Hayes can distinguish itself from its competition byproviding more capability in a simple-to-use, easy-to-manage, low-pricepackage.andP;  Hayes is attempting to compete against the high-end vendors, suchas Novell, on price and against the low-end vendors on performance, Fullermaintains.andM;LANstep is a multitasking network OS that includes file and print services,DOS and Windows 3.0 application-sharing capabilities, an electronic mailfacility, and a NetBIOS emulator.andP;  It can be configured to operate in bothpeer-to-peer and server modes.andP;  For example, users can publish directoriesand control access to the files in them; shared files can also be stored on adedicated server.andP;  In addition, any workstation can support up to threeshared printers and users can cancel and monitor their own print jobs.andO;LANstep supports Ethernet, token ring, and Arcnet NICs compatible withMicrosoft Corp.'s Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS).andP;  Disklessworkstations as well as all Intel microprocessor-based personal computers aresupported.andM;Hayes based LANstep's user interface on symbols and menus to help noviceusers get up to speed quickly.andP;  To help the network administrator, LANstepincludes utilities for monitoring utilization of any shared disk drive,memory usage statistics for any workstation, and network traffic statistics.andO;LANstep Mail, which is bundled with the network OS, includes a text editorand has such features as E-mail forwarding, distribution lists, andregistered mail support.andM;Priced at $595, LANstep supports up to five simultaneous users.andP;  Five moreusers can be added with the $395 LANstep 5-Step Expander, and the network cansupport up to 128 simultaneous users and 255 workstations.andM;Compex, Northnet, and other low-end vendors have targeted a segment of themarket that consists primarily of small businesses with 20 employees or less.andO;Most of these businesses ar new to networking and have only a few basicneeds: accounting, word processing, printing, and database management,according to Moses Computer president Dean Mack.andM;Northnet vice president Gary Dryden echoes these observations: &quot;File sharing,printing sharing, and E-mail seem to be the most common customer needs --especially printer sharing.&quot;andP;  Larger companies that organize their employeesinto small work-groups of five to 15 people are also candidates forentry-level LANs, Dryden said.andM;Many vendors believe that the small-business segment of the network market isgrowing rapidly.andP;  There are 60 to 80 million personal computers in smallbusinesses, but the LANs in those businesses are few and far between, notesMoses Computers' Mack.andM;Small, DOS-based networks are often the way for these customers to go,according to Tom Henderson, principal of Corporate Networks, an integrationfirm.andP;  &quot;These networks are easy to install and easy to scale.andP;  While they maynot be as rich in network usability, they are easy to manage and have lessprotocol overhead, which means more speed without necessarily sacrificingdata integrity or reliability.andP;  Their job is to manage network resources andshare them among DOS clients.&quot;andM;By design, most of the entry-level network OS vendors are not competing withhigh-end vendors such as Novell and Microsoft.andP;  However, some companies,including Compex, support industry-standard NICs to provide a migration pathto NetWare.andP;  Other companies, such as Moses, use a proprietary card and betthat most of their users won't need to upgrade to another network OS.andM;Even if the market for entry-level network OSes is growing, some of thevendors competing for a piece of that market may not survive because they aresmall companies, points out Michael Howard, president of Infonetics ResearchInstitute Inc.andP;  Hayes may have an advantage because of its size, reputation,and established distribution channels.andM;These and other attributes, such as how well established a company is, itsability to weather industry fluctuations, and the ability of the product touse DOS software out of the box, will be critical to LANstep and any networkOS's success, says Corporate Networks' Henderson.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
