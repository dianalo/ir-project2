The dollar's upturn triggered a rally in bond prices, which also prompted stock prices to rise on U.S. exchanges. Some Treasury bonds rose a full point, and the Dow Jones industrials gained 29.97.    At a Tokyo news conference, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita indicated that central bankers from the major industrial nations agreed in Washington last week on measures to strengthen their foreign exchange market intervention in support of the dollar.    The dollar's recovery wiped out much of the loss it suffered Tuesday on news that the U.S. trade deficit widened in February. Negative sentiment on the dollar remained widespread yesterday, however.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 141.70 yen, up 0.6% from 140.80 Tuesday. The dollar climbed 0.8% to 1.8100 West German marks from 1.7963.    The dollar continued to rise and in early Tokyo trading Thursday stood at 142.90 yen.    The U.S. currency also was benefiting from position-squaring ahead of what will be a four-day weekend in some European trading centers and a three-day weekend in some Asian markets because of the Good Friday and Easter holidays.    Trading volume dwindled and was expected to get still thinner in the next few days. &quot;The market doesn't want to get overextended with the long holiday weekend,&quot; Martin L. McNulty, vice president, corporate foreign exchange, at Lloyds Bank in New York, said. Trading will &quot;resume on the downside Tuesday,&quot; he predicted.    Yesterday's dollar rally began in Asia, aided by sporadic buying by the Bank of Japan and the statements by the central bank governor.    Mr. Sumita said the major industrial countries had held &quot;concrete&quot; talks about how to fund their intervention in the currency market and that their discussions have already been translated into action.    His remarks were seen as an indication that the Bank of Japan has strengthened its currency swap agreements with other major nations to try to keep the yen's exchange rate stable.    Through such agreements, the Japanese central bank supplies yen to its U.S. and European counterparts, allowing them to continue supporting the dollar without depleting their own foreign currency reserves. The intervention, in which central banks sell yen and buy dollars to prop up demand for the U.S. currency, is understood to have totaled more than $10 billion in the past few weeks.    Mr. Sumita's remarks &quot;became a trigger point for profit-taking,&quot; Yani Budiman, a foreign exchange vice president at Chemical Bank, New York, said. &quot;As the dollar was bought in the Far East, that triggered a lot of stop-loss orders&quot; to buy more dollars, he said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $7.80 an ounce to $443.10 in brisk trading. Estimated volume was 4.5 million ounces.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                 Wednesday, April 15, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
