The official Tass news agency, the Communist Party daily Pravdaand Radio Moscow today heralded the Soviet fulfillment of anagreement signed in Geneva in April that required the Kremlin topull out half of its more than 100,000 soldiers by Aug. 15.   Afghanistan's Radio Kabul reported Sunday that halfway point wasreached over the weekend when a motorized rifle regiment of 200vehicles and 3,000 troops left for the Soviet Union from thewestern city of Herat.   Those Soviets still in Afghanistan must leave the war-torncountry within six months, according to the Geneva agreements.   Pravda carried an article by Afghan leader Najib in which hethanks the Kremlin for its support during the war that has dividedAfghanistan since the April 1978 revolution.   Soviet troops intervened in December 1979 to support apro-Moscow regime.   The article was accompanied by a graphic showing where theremaining Soviet soldiers are deployed. It indicates Kremlin troopsare located only along two evacuation routes to the Soviet border,from Kabul in the northeast and from Shindand via Herat in the west.   Soviet military officials have said the pullout cleared Sovietsfrom 25 of Afghanistan's 30 provinces, and the graphic accompanyingNajib's article showed soldiers are deployed in only a narrowribbon through the remaining five provinces.   Tass said in the dispatch from Kabul that guerrilla activity isthe rise:   ``In the first 10 days of August, extremists carried out 142bombardments and attacks on populated areas around the country. Asa result, 31 peaceful residents were killed and 113 wounded.''   Tass said two guerrilla groups, the Islamic Party of Afghanistanand the Islamic Society of Afghanistan, had captured the Skakardardistrict about 20 miles north of Kabul. It said the groups had asupply of 1,500 rockets they planned to fire at the Afghan capital.   The news agency said rebels were planning to send other forcesto districts of the Kabul province to put further pressure on thecapital.   Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, commander of Soviet forces inAfghanistan, on Sunday confirmed Western reports that the northernprovincial capital of Kunduz had fallen to the rebels.   He contended he had ``no doubt that in the very near future''the Soviet-backed government would retake the strategic northerncity.   Kunduz, which lies beyond the Hindu Kush mountains north ofKabul, was a government stronghold until late 1986, whenU.S.-supplied Stinger missiles were brought to the mountainous areaby the rebels and used to down numerous Soviet and Afghan planes.   It is located near a five-province northern zone created earlierthis year in which Afghan officials appear to be establishing aneconomic buffer zone between the rebel-controlled southernprovinces and the Soviet border.   The mountainous region north of Kabul and east of the strategiceconomic area, where Afghanistan's best natural resources areconcentrated, has been repeatedly harassed by guerrillas over thepast year. Rebels hiding in the hills and mountains through whichthe Kabul evacuation route traverses have used their higher vantagepoints to fire on the departing Soviet convoys.   Soviet media have not disclosed the number of troops killed orwounded during the pullout, which began May 15.   Officials of the Afghan government say their armed forces werecapable of defending the country without Soviet troops. But someWestern, Pakistani and guerrilla sources have predicted Kabul'scommunist government will fall soon after the Soviet soldiers aregone.   Reports reaching Islamabad, Pakistan, said almost all provincialcapitals remain in the Afghan government's control. However,guerrillas control most of the rural countryside and have maderepeated seizures of the cities.   They have been forced out of the provincial capitals by heavySoviet aerial bombardment.</TEXT></DOC>
