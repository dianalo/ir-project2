ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oliver North firmly defended his Iran-Contrarole Thursday from the witness stand at his criminal trial,declaring he was merely a Marine following White House orders. ``Iwas not stepping in, I was brought in,'' he said.   North was stopped before he could respond to his lawyer'ssuggestion that then-President Reagan had designated him for therole. Asked directly who told him to secretly help the Nicaraguanrebels, North named former National Security Adviser RobertMcFarlane, McFarlane's then-deputy, John Poindexter, and the lateCIA Director William Casey.   North's testimony came shortly after his lawyers read the jury alengthy statement _ agreed to by prosecutors _ that said GeorgeBush had played a role as intermediary in Reagan's secret effort toaid the Nicaraguan rebels after Congress banned official U.S. help.   As rapid-fire developments replaced the sometimes-languid paceof the trial, now in in its seventh week, the jury heard that Bushpersonally told the president of Honduras in 1985 that extra aidwas being funneled to his country. In earlier testimony, McFarlanehad said that the aid was part of a secret agreement calling forHonduras to help the Contras.   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Wecan't say anything. It would become a part of the case.''   North, who faces 12 felony charges including lying or misleadingCongress and then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III about hisefforts to help the Contras, testified that he had been ordered byhis superiors to keep silent about his role in keeping the rebelsgoing after the cutoff of official aid.   ``I was told not to tell anybody,'' North said. ``I wasparticularly admonished'' to keep secret ``that another country wasproviding millions of dollars to help the Contras.''   That was an apparent reference to Saudi Arabia, which suppliedsome $32 million in aid to the Contras, beginning in mid-1984.   North described himself as an orders-obeying Marine who hadplanned to return to Camp Lejeune to command a battalion when topofficials in the Reagan administration enlisted him to run thesecret Contra operation in 1984.   ``Was there a time when you were stepping in'' to help theContras? asked North lawyer Brendan Sullivan.   ``I was not stepping in; I was brought in,'' North replied.   Sullivan asked whether North ``understood'' that Reagan haddesignated him as the Contras' new provider. Prosecutor John Kekerobjected; U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell sustained theobjection and North didn't answer.   On point after point, North said he had permission of superiors.For Project Democracy, as the help to the Contras was known, hesaid he had the approval of McFarlane, Poindexter and Casey. Theorders to keep secret the contributions from other countries camefrom the president, Casey and McFarlane, he said.   ``I never made a single trip down there or a single contact,''North said of his frequent visits to Central America, ``without thepermission, the express permission, of Admiral Poindexter orMcFarlane or usually without the concurrence of Director Casey.''   McFarlane had testified that he told his staff members thecongressional ban on helping the Contras did apply to them, butNorth said ``I never heard'' that.   As for raising money, he said, referring to himself andpotential contributors, ``I knew Colonel North could not ask themfor money.''   After the congressional ban cut off official U.S. aid, Northsaid he told Casey that ``all the money in the world'' wouldn'treplace the former CIA assistance. He said Casey gave him the nameof retired Army Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, who ``basically created amirror image outside the CIA'' to keep provisions coming.   Secord, a co-defendant, is to be tried later.   North testified for about 2{ hours, including recreation of thehalf-hour slide show which he gave 75 to 100 times to potentialcontributors to the Contras while he was working at the WhiteHouse. He will return to the stand Friday morning.   The retired Marine lieutenant colonel, dressed in a dark suit,sat down in the witness box nearly two months after the trial beganand nearly two years after he told his story in televisedcongressional hearings that made him a national figure. Thecongressional testimony was given under a grant of immunity fromprosecution, and prosecutors in the current case have had to avoidseeing or hearing anything about that appearance.   ``So you're Colonel North,'' Sullivan began as the former WhiteHouse aide took the stand. ``Yes sir, I am,'' North replied with asmile.   Earlier, his lawyers spent nearly an hour reading into therecord the ``admission of facts'' concerning the Reaganadministration's efforts supporting the Contra struggle against theleftist government of Nicaragua.   In addition to the statements about Bush's involvement, thedocument also said that a representative of Panamanian leaderManuel Noriega offered in a meeting with North to assassinateSandinista leaders in Nicaragua, but that North replied the UnitedStates wanted no part of that.   In Panama City late Thursday, Panamanian Maj. Edgardo Lopezdenounced the allegations in a written statement that called it``another cock-and-bull story of the United States to continuestrangling the Panamanian people and intensify its defamationcampaign against the chief of our Defense Forces.''   The statement's summary format allowed the trial to proceedwithout disclosure of the classified documents that much of thestatement was based upon.   The document said Bush, who has repeatedly said he had little ornothing to do with the Iran-Contra affair, relayed a March 1985Reagan offer of expedited military aid to Honduran presidentRoberto Suazo.   Earlier in the trial, McFarlane testified that Reagan personallyapproved the secret deal to slip $110 million in extra aid toHonduras as one of several ``quid pro quo'' arrangements with othercountries in exchange for support for the Contras.   The statement on Thursday said, ``Vice President Bush alsoinformed Suazo that President Reagan had directed that currentlywithheld economic assistance for Honduras should be released, thatthe United States would provide from its own military stockscritical security assistance items that had been ordered byHonduran armed forces, and that several security programs under wayfor Honduran security forces would be enhanced.''   Earlier Thursday, prosecutors asked the judge to order North toproduce his notebooks and ledgers if the former Marine decided totestify ``and thereby waive his privilege againstself-incrimination.''   Also on Thursday, former hostage David Jacobsen testified thatwhen he and North met after Jacobsen's release from Lebanon,North's eyes filled with tears because other Americans were stillheld.</TEXT></DOC>
