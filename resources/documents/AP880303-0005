Meese's endorsement of legislation sponsored by Sen. JamesMcClure, R-Idaho, is the latest development in a growing disputeover plastic guns.   Supporters of rival legislation say that McClure's bill wouldstill permit guns to slip by metal detectors and X-ray machines attheir current settings.   McClure on Wednesday released a letter by Meese, saying: ``Basedon our review, we believe that your bill ... is an excellentlegislative proposal to deal with the threat posed by criminals andterrorists armed with such weapons.''   The National Rifle Association also backs McClure's bill.   The McClure proposal would make it illegal to manufacture orimport a plastic firearm unless one of these conditions exists:   _The barrel is made in whole or in part of a metallic substancethat can be detected by a magnetometer.   _The serial number required by law is engraved on a metallicsubstance capable of detection.   The measure also would require plastic portions of any suchfirearm to be infused with substances that would register on aX-ray machine.   Handgun Control Inc. and a coalition of law enforcement groupshave joined to oppose McClure's bill and support legislationsponsored by Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio. Metzenbaum hassupport from Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.   Metzenbaum and his supporters say their legislation has theingredient that McClure's measure lacks: a requirement that theguns have enough metal to be detected at currently used settings ofsecurity machines.   They contend that guns meeting the guidelines in McClure'sproposal would only set off alarms if detectors were operated atsettings so low they would stop everyone with a key chain.   Plastic guns are not yet in production, but Handgun Control Inc.said a Florida manufacturer will be ready to produce them in a year.</TEXT></DOC>
