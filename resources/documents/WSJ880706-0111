Scott (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LABOR CNW </CO><IN> TRA </IN><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   CNW Corp.'s railroad unit said it won't go along with a presidential emergency board's recommendation that it keep brakemen on some freight trains.    CNW said it expects to meet with the United Transportation Union to discuss the matter within the next few days. But it said that unless the union agrees to bigger concessions than were recommended by the emergency board, the railroad will implement its right to unilaterally change crew size when the cooling-off period expires Aug. 4 and will eliminate the jobs.    Donald Markgraf, head of the union's Chicago andamp; North Western chapters, wouldn't say whether he would negotiate further concessions. He said he thinks CNW is pleased with the board's recommendation and is using the recommendations &quot;as a ploy to get some more concessions.&quot;    CNW wants to cut the size of the crews on its freight trains to two from four, claiming that technological advances have made the jobs of two brakemen obsolete. By eliminating the jobs of 1,200 brakemen, the company said it can save about $53 million annually.    The emergency board, created in April by President Reagan to avert a strike, recommended that the crew size on the Chicago andamp; North Western freight trains be immediately reduced to three from four. The board also suggested that on certain non-stop freight trains crew size be reduced to two from four through an arbitration procedure.    The company said if the board's recommendation were accepted it would still be required to retain about 500 brakeman jobs that no longer have any function and would spend $25 million annually for unproductive labor costs.    Under federal railway-labor law, if either party rejects arbitration, that would trigger a 30-day standstill period after which CNW could cut crew size on its own and the union could strike in retaliation.    The dispute has far-reaching implications for the railroad industry, which seeks to eliminate thousands of jobs to lower its costs and become more competitive with the trucking industry. </TEXT></DOC>
