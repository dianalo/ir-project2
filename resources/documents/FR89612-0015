L. 94-295, hereinafter called the amendments) establish a comprehensivesystem for the regulation of medical devices intended for human use. Oneprovision of the amendments, section 513 of the Federal Food, Drug, andCosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360c), establishes three classes of devices.Each class prescribes the regulatory controls needed to provide reasonableassurance of a device's safety and effectiveness. Class I (general controls),class II (performance standards), and class III (premarket approval) identifythe classes set forth in section 513 of the act. Section 513(d)(2)(A) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360c(d)(2)(A)) authorizes FDAto exempt, by regulation, a generic type of class I device from the requirementof, among other things, premarket notification in section 510(k) of theact (21 U.S.C. 360(k)) and Subpart E of 21 CFR Part 807. Such an exemptionpermits manufacturers to introduce into commercial distribution generictypes of devices without first submitting to FDA a premarket notification.When FDA was publishing its proposed classification regulations for preamendmentsdevices, the agency did not routinely evaluate whether it should grantto manufacturers of devices placed in class I an exemption from the requirementof premarket notification. Generally, FDA considered such exemptions onlywhen the advisory panels included them in recommendations to the agency.Recently, FDA developed criteria for exempting certain class I devicesfrom the requirement of premarket notification to reduce the number ofunnecessary premarket notifications, thereby freeing agency resources forthe review of more complex notifications. FDA believes that exempting certain devices from premarket notificationwill allow the agency to make better use of its resources and thus betterserve the public. In other words, the process of exempting devices fromthe premarket notification program of section 510(k) of the act (21 U.S.C.360(k)), where premarket notification will not advance FDA's public healthmission, will free additional resources to address more pressing regulatoryconcerns and will make the agency more efficient. The development of thesecriteria and the issuance of final rules exempting appropriate devicesfrom the requirement of premarket notification will help implement a goalof FDA's May 1987 ``A Plan for Action Phase II'' (Ref. 1). On January 20, 1988 (53 FR 1574), FDA proposed to exempt from premarketnotification 110 generic types of class I devices. Interested persons weregiven until March 21, 1988 to comment. Two letters of comment were received. Both letters agreed that the devicesshould be exempt from the premarket notification procedures as proposed.One of the comments suggested that the preamble to the final rule specifyexactly the requirements of Subpart E of Part 807 from which the devicesare to be exempt. A comment also suggested that Subpart E of Part 807 beamended cross-reference these exemptions. FDA believes that the preamble to the proposed rule clearly identifiesthe scope of exemptions for exempt devices. Specifically, the limitationsdescribed in the proposed new section, ``Limitations of exemptions fromsection 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act),''Subpart A of each of the nine parts of the Code of Federal Regulationsinvolved, and the limitations set forth in the codified language of eachgeneric type of device, fully describe the nature of the exemption fromSubpart E of Part 807 for each affected device. FDA believes that it isunnecessary and impractical to cross-reference these exemptions in SubpartE of Part 807. Accordingly, FDA is adopting 104 of the 110 proposed regulations with minorclarifying changes. However, upon reconsideration, FDA has determined notto grant the proposed exemptions for the following six devices:<ITAG tagnum="84">Section No. and Device </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">866.2660 Microorganism and differentiation and identification device.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">868.1910 Esophageal stethoscope. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">868.5340 Nasal oxygen cannula. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">868.5620 Breathing mouthpiece. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">868.5640 Medicinal nonventilatory nebulizer (atomizer). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">868.6810 andCx.20;Tracheobronchial suction catheter. </ITAG>Elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, FDA is publishing a withdrawal of it's proposedrules proposing to grant an exemption from the premarket notification proceduresfor the six devices listed above. FDA's reasons for withdrawing its sixproposals are given in that withdrawal document. Criteria for 510(k) exemptions: FDA is exempting a generic type of classI device from the requirement of premarket notification, with the limitationsdescribed below, if FDA determines that premarket notification is unnecessaryfor the protection of the public health. FDA is granting an exemption ifboth of the following criteria are met:1. FDA has determined that the device does not have a significant historyof false or misleading claims or of risks associated with inherent characteristicsof the device, such as device design or materials. When making these determinations,FDA may consider the frequency, persistence, cause, or seriousness of suchclaims or risks, or other factors. 2. FDA has determined that: (a) Characteristics of the device necessaryfor its safe and effective performance are well established; (b) anticipatedchanges in the device that are of the type that could affect safety andeffectiveness will (i) be readily detectable by users by visual examinationor other means, such as routine testing, e.g., testing of a clinical laboratoryreagent with positive and negative controls, before causing harm; or (ii)not materially increase the risk of injury, incorrect diagnosis, or ineffectivetreatment; and (c) that any changes in the device will not be likely toresult in a change in the device's classification. FDA will make the determinations above based on its knowledge of the device,including past experience and relevant reports or studies on device performance.FDA may, if it has concerns only about certain types of changes in a classI device, grant a limited exemption from premarket notification for thegeneric type of device. A limited exemption will specify what types ofchanges manufacturers must continue to report to FDA in the context ofpremarket notification. For example, FDA may exempt a device except whena manufacturer intends to use a different material. FDA's decision to grant an exemption from the requirement of premarketnotification for a generic type of class I device is based upon the existingand reasonably foreseeable characteristics of commercially distributeddevices within that generic type. Because FDA cannot anticipate every changein intended use or characteristic of a device that could significantlyaffect a device's safety or effectiveness, manufacturers of any commerciallydistributed class I device for which FDA has granted an exemption fromthe requirement of premarket notification must still submit a premarketnotification to FDA before introducing or delivering for introduction intointerstate commerce for commercial distribution the device when: (a) The device is intended for a use different from its intended use beforeMay 28, 1976, or the device is intended for a use different from the intendeduse of a preamendments device to which it had been determined to be substantiallyequivalent; e.g., the device is intended for a different medical purpose,or the device is intended for lay use where the former intended use wasby health care professionals only; or (b) The modified device operates using a different fundamental scientifictechnology than that in use in the device before May 28, 1976; e.g., asurgical instrument cuts tissue with a laser beam rather than with a sharpenedmetal blade, or an in vitro diagnostic device detects or identifies infectiousagents by using a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe or nucleic acid hybridizationtechnology rather than culture or immunoassay technology.
