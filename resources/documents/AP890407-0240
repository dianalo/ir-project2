The crooks aren't after money _ their target is computerchips.   Five such robberies at Orange County, Calif., firms in sixmonths have authorities concerned about a new breed of bandit asbold and brazen as jewel thieves, yet interested only in the tinycomponents that give computers their smarts.   ``When you think about the size of the chip and the value, theloss can be pretty significant to a company. A person can walk offwith a bag of chips that can have more value than diamonds or othergems,'' said Bruce Baker of Stanford Research Institute, a thinktank that keeps tabs on computer crimes.   So far, the attacks have been limited to Orange County.Authorities in other high-tech areas like Boston, Dallas, San Diegoand San Francisco report no similar thefts, though all have hademployees stealing chips from employers.   Yet some authorities fear the high-tech crime wave is bound togrow.   ``This is the crime of the 1990s,'' said Los Angeles CountyDeputy District Attorney Tony Castaneda, who is prosecuting threemen for reprogramming $1 chips for use in cellular telephones andreselling them for $100 each.   ``This is high-technology stuff. It's the type of crime that'sgoing to be prevalent in the 1990s, more sophisticated, moretechnological.''   In the most recent Orange County incident, four men in darkclothing and toting machine guns, an assault rifle and a.45-caliber pistol struck Advanced Logic Research at 10:30 p.m. onMarch 3. Sticking a gun to a guard's head, the masked intrudersdemanded entry to the Irvine computer firm just days after the firmwas in the news for developing a new computer.   Nothing was stolen in the attack. ``Two cleaning women ranupstairs and locked themselves in a room and screamed,'' said DavidKirkey, vice president of sales and marketing. ``The gunmen ranout.''   On Jan. 30, two armed bandits took $105,000 worth of dynamicrandom-access memory chips from Western Digital Corp. after theybound a guard. D-RAMs are the most common kind of computer memorychip; they store information as an electrical charge and lose itwhen the power supply is turned off.   One week earlier, three men wearing combat fatigues andbrandishing rifles bound and blindfolded two guards at ASTResearch. Police believe the bandits were after chips, but theyonly made off with $9,000 worth of equipment.   And on Nov. 24, two robbers armed with revolvers tied up a guardat Holt Inc. and escaped with $100,000 in computer chips.   Although the heists are similar, authorities believe two orthree groups of look-alike bandits are responsible, said Irvinepolice Lt. Michael White.   Ken Rosenblatt, a Santa Clara County deputy district attorneyspecializing in high-tech crimes, said it's no surprise the thievesare getting bolder.   ``It's a sign of the times. People now have better access toassault rifles. But it's a stupid way to steal them. It's sloppy. Iknow of much better ways, but I'm not going to tell you,''Rosenblatt said.   The crooks are targeting two kinds of chips _ those used fordata processing and those with greater memory. As chips become moresophisticated, with greater capacity in less space, they becomemore valuable. They also are easier to steal, being the approximatesize of a dime.   ``A megabyte chip costs about $10. A shopping bag full of 1,500is worth $15,000. That's a lot of money,'' said John King, chairmanof the University of California, Irvine's Computer ScienceDepartment. A megabyte is a million characters.   ``A new chip with tremendous amount of capacity can be worthmulti-thousands of dollars,'' agreed Stanford's Baker.   What makes the crimes frustrating is that the chips are hard totrace. They all look about the same and don't have serial numbers,only a stamped date of manufacture. That also leaves legitimatebusinesses open to buying the stolen chips back without theirknowledge.   ``If you pulled a person over who had a grocery bag of chips,you couldn't tell where they got them from,'' said King.   Law enforcement and computer experts suggest that the thievescould be hired by smaller firms to cripple a competitor; theaverage robber trying out a new market; or electronics experts whowill either steal an expensive chip's design and sell it cheaper orbuild a cheap imitation.   California's largest chip theft to date was in 1985. Larry E.Lowery was sentenced to six years in prison for stealing $3.2million in components from Silicon Valley's Monolithic Memories Inc.   Baker believes the new crimes will continue. ``Whenever you havea high-tech market, you have a big market, either legitimate orblack market.''   King, however, says they are a ``flash in the pan'' because oncebusinesses hear of the thefts, they will make their chips harder tosteal. Generally, they have been stored behind priable mesh doors.   ``I personally think it's a bizarre thing to steal. But it'seasier to conceal than an automobile and worth the same,'' Kingsaid. ``It doesn't have anything traceable on it. And the firstcouple of times you do it, no one is expecting it. No one wouldexpect a strong-armed robbery of a computer chip.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, April 10</NOTE></DOC>
