A controversial issue with these proposal is whetherto allow utilities to choose the method of emission reduction (includingswitching the low-sulfur coal) or the force utilities to apply technologicalmeans of compliance. Increased use of low-sulfur eastern bituminous coalplays a major role in achieving reductions in sulfur-dioxide emissionsunder proposals which allow utilities to choose the most economical compliancestrategy. The effects of such increases in demand on price premiums foreastern low-sulfur coal are subject of major disagreements. Some industryanalysts contend that greatly increased demand will cause large new pricepremiums. Others disagree, asserting that large new price premiums areunlikely. Coal markets in the East use the broadest diversity of coaltypes, have the longest history of coal use, and are the central focusof acid rain concerns. By understanding how premiums occurred in thesemarkets and by identifying those causes which might continue or end,a framework for analyzing the potential for future premiums can be developed.Methods for analyzing the potential for future coal price premiums arediscussed.</TEXT></DOC>
