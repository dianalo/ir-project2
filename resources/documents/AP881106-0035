The Israeli army said its warplanes destroyed a Palestinianguerrilla base in south Lebanon. It did not mention casualties.   Lebanese police said four Israeli Cobra helicopter gunshipsblasted the shop and a nearby citrus grove with eight rockets in twosorties. The shop in the southern port of Sidon was closed at thetime.   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standingregulations, said the shop owner, Mahmoud Hijazi, was suspected ofrenting two motorboats to PLO guerrillas and selling the guerrillasspare parts.   It was the sixth Israeli air strike against guerrilla targets insouth Lebanon in three weeks and the 21st this year. By policecount, 108 people were killed and 204 wounded in raids since Jan. 3.   Hijazi's motorboats, anchored off the beach about 600 yards fromhis shop, were not hit in the raid, police said.   Earlier police reports said aircraft attacked guerrilla bases inthe teeming Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp on Sidon's southernoutskirts. Police said the guerrillas in the camp opened up withanti-aircraft fire but were not targeted by the Israeli aircraft.   Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen also killed three guerrillaswho apparently landed in a boat on the Meditteranean coast justnorth of Israel, the army command said.   An Israeli army announcement said the base attacked Sunday wasused for launching attacks and ammunition storage. It said allplanes that took part in the raid returned safely.   The brief announcement gave no further details.   The attack followed mock raids by six Israeli jets against thePalestinian guerrilla strongholds at midmorning.   Palestinian camps south of Sidon have taken the brunt of thestepped-up Israeli raids, which have by police count have killed 40people and wounded 91 in the past three weeks.   The blitz is in apparent retaliation for a suicide car-bombingthat killed eight Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon on Oct. 19 and afirebomb attack that killed an Israeli mother and her three childrenin the Israeli-occupied West Bank Oct. 30.   Also Sunday, Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militiamen killedthree guerrillas in a firefight near Naqoura, about two miles northof the border with Israel. There were no SLA casualties, themilitary command said.   The army said the guerrillas apparently landed from a boat andwere hiding in the area. One of the guerrillas fired arocket-propelled grenade at the patrol before being killed, it said.   Two other guerrillas were found shortly afterward and were killedin a firefight, the army said. It did not identify the group towhich the guerrillas belonged.   The clash was in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in southLebanon, a six- to 10-mile zone carved out when Israel withdrew thebulk of its occupation troops from Lebanon in June 1985.   The zone is patrolled by about 2,000 Lebanese militiamen trainedand financed by Israel. Foreign reports say about 1,000 Israelisoldiers also are stationed in the zone.   In Beirut, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, accusedthe Amal militia of violating a Syrian-sponsored no-kidnapping pact.The accord was signed Friday by the two sides, the country's mainShiite militias.   A Hezbollah statement charged that Amal militiamen had kidnappedfour Hezbollah militiamen in south Beirut's Chiyah district Saturdaynight. There was no comment from Amal.   Amal, Arabic for hope, and Hezbollah have been locked in a bloodystruggle for dominance of Lebanon's 1 million Shiite Moslems, thenation's largest single sect.</TEXT></DOC>
