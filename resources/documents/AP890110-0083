Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said for the first time that hewould accept a U.N. role in peace talks with Palestinians, but heinsisted only direct talks between Israel and its Arab enemies couldbring peace.   Speaking to visiting European Parliament officials, Shamir alsodenied reports that a new Israeli peace plan had been submitted toU.S. officials in Paris this week.   Arab reports said Palestinians collaborating with Israeliauthorities killed 27-year-old Kayed Muhammad Tmaizi on Monday inthe village of Idna because he had stopped collaborating.   Tmaizi suffered three gunshot wounds and died en route to ahospital in nearby Hebron, Arab reports said.   Family members told an Arab reporter that Tmaizi was underincreasing pressure from security forces to renew his role as aninformant. They said he stopped cooperating with Israeli officialswhen the Arab uprising started 13 months ago.   Tmaizi's relatives saw the assailants flee and take refuge in thehome of another Idna man who is known as a collaborator, the Arabreporter said. They said the attackers were later picked up by carswith Israeli license plates.   The army clamped a curfew on Idna and took Tmaizi's body from ahospital in nearby Hebron to determine the cause of death, amilitary official said.   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed ashooting death occurred and said security forces had nothing to dowith it.   ``It was apparently an argument between families in thevillage,'' said the official. ``The army denies any connectionbetweeen the military and the shooting of this man.''   The slaying followed a series of attacks on suspectedcollaborators after a new leaflet issued by PLO-backed undergroundleaders called for attacks on Palestinians who work for Israeliauthorities.   Two alleged collaborators were killed and two others wounded inthe past week.   Tmaizi's death raised to 349 the number of Palestinians killedsince the start of the uprising against Israel's occupation of theWest Bank and Gaza Strip. Fifteen Israelis have been killed.   The army lifted curfews today from four refugee camps in the GazaStrip as Palestinian merchants opened stores following generalstrikes that paralyzed the occupied lands Sunday and Monday. Thestrikes have been a constant feature of the uprising.   Three Palestinians were shot and wounded in the Gaza Strip andone was wounded in a clash with troops in the West Bank town ofRamallah, Arab reports and hospital officials said.   Shamir told the European deputies today he would accept a role inthe peace process for the United Nations or the superpowers``providing they refrain from any involvement in the substance ofthe talks.''   The right-wing prime minister previously had rejected any U.N.involvement, claiming the world body was biased against Israel.   Shamir denied a report in the new English-language daily TheNation that Foreign Minister Moshe Arens submitted a new Israelipeace plan to U.S. officials in Paris. He said Israel has not yetformulated its peace proposals.   ``There are some ideas, but nobody should speak now of a formalpeace plan laid down by the Israeli government,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
