On Friday, the Nature Conservancy, an environmental group,bought more than 10,000 acres of land in the wooded hillssurrounding Austin, Texas, from the Resolution Trust Corp.for $15.5 million. The land once belonged to six now-defunctthrifts, including Mr. Keating's Lincoln Savings andamp; LoanAssociation, whose failure is expected to cost taxpayers $2.6billion. Mr. Keating is currently on trial in Californiastate court on fraud charges.</LP><TEXT>   The Nature Conservancy intends to set aside the land as apreserve for warblers, Tooth Cave pseudoscorpions and a halfdozen other birds, bugs and plants that live in the hills.The creatures are all on the federal endangered-species list.   The deal is far and away the largest of the handful ofacquisitions of former thrift properties by environmentalgroups, who have discovered that the government owns a lot ofhabitat in remote places that can be picked up cheap andspared forever from developers' bulldozers. &quot;It's ironic thatsome very troubled species are benefiting from the thriftdisaster,&quot; said Karen Berky, a Nature Conservancy official.&quot;It may be the only ray of good news to come out of the wholesorry episode.&quot;   Ms. Berky said the Nature Conservancy is already pursuingseveral other possible acquisitions of other tracts now ingovernment hands as a result of thrift blowouts. &quot;Thepotential is tremendous,&quot; she said. &quot;I mean, the governmentowns a mindboggling amount of land.&quot;   The Texas property has a storied past. In addition to Mr.Keating's Lincoln Savings, chunks of the acreage the NatureConservancy bought were once owned by Sunbelt Savings,Southwest Federal Savings and University Federal Savings; allare among the largest of thrift failures, and some stand outin the lore of the thrift debacle for the depth of fraud andfinancial folly that brought them down. &quot;It's quite a list,&quot;said a spokesman for the RTC. &quot;It includes some of ourfavorites.&quot;   Moreover, the fate of the properties shows that thegreening of the thrift crisis can cost a lot of governmentgreenbacks. The RTC said the book value on the properties was$190 million, meaning that the Nature Conservancy paid ashade more than eight cents on the dollar, and the governmentlost a startling $174.5 million on the deal. The big hitprimarly reflects the presence of the warbler and otherendangered species; because anyone trying to build anythingon the land would have to contend with laws requiringprotecting the creatures, none of the RTC's usual customersshowed much interest in bidding on it.</TEXT></DOC>
