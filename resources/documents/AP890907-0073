DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The overwhelming majority of Latino immigrantssay they intend to stay in the United States, but many say they'vedelayed applying for citizenship because the exam is too difficult,a survey released today said.   ``These findings suggest that one effective method to increaseU.S. citizenship among Latino immigrants would be education andoutreach activities to demystify the naturalization process,'' theNational Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials said.   In a release announcing results of the telephone survey of 1,635immigrants in eight states, the association said such activitiesshould also be designed to ``allay fears about the difficulty of thecitizenship examination.''   The average European and Asian immigrant waits seven to eightyears before naturalizing, but Hispanic immigrants wait an averageof 14 to 15 years, the association said.   However, once Latino immigrants take the exam, the survey said,most pass and don't find it difficult.   Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., president of the association'seducational fund, told a news conference the survey results areespecially important ``because this is a group that many believewill not be fully counted in the next census.''   The Latino group said its survey also showed that Hispanicimmigrants are more politically active than previously believed.   ``In light of the survey's findings, many of our society'sassumptions about Latino immigrants will need to be re-examined,''the group said. ``Foremost among these assumptions is the perceptionthat Latino immigrants are here temporarily and are planning toreturn to their homelands upon accumulation of savings or uponretirement.''   Ninety-eight percent of those interviewed said they wanted tomake the United States their permanent home, and 79 percent saidlife in the United States is better than in their native country.   Ninety-five percent said that an important reason for wanting tobecome a U.S. citizen is that it allows you to vote.   Sixty-three percent of the Cubans interviewed identifiedthemselves as Republicans, while 42 percent of Mexicans and 34percent of other Latin Americans said they were Democrats.   The study said 81 percent of the naturalized Latinos surveyedwere registered to vote, compared with 70 percent of the generalU.S. voting age population.   Paradoxically, however, 46 percent said they saw no real benefitsof becoming a U.S. citizen.   Difficulty of the Immigration and Naturalization Serviceexamination was cited as an important reason by 39 percent anddiscrimination against Latinos by 35 percent.   Forty-four percent of those interviewed were naturalized citizensand the remaining 66 percent were permanent legal residents.   Despite their overwhelming desire to remain in the United States,17 percent of the non-naturalized Latinos said an important reasonfor not becoming a citizen was that they planned to return to theirhomeland some day.   Rosalind Gold, a research associate with the Latino group, saidthe respondents ``may have thought about whether it was an importantreason for a person not becoming a citizen, rather than reallyanswering in the personal sense about what their personal planswere.''   The survey was conducted in California, Texas, Florida, New York,New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona and Maryland. Nearly half of thoseinterviewed were from Mexico and one-fourth from Cuba. The principalother countries of origin included the Dominican Republic, Colombia,El Salvador and Ecuador.   The survey was conducted by the educational fund of theassociation, which claims a membership of more than 3,300 Hispanicelected officials, appointed officials and community and businessleaders. It did not give a margin of error.</TEXT></DOC>
