For this, the surfaceof the ceramic material is coated with Ni and Cu, and baked to form aperforated plate; as this is an electrical insulator, conductivity isnot sufficient if not completely coated, thus increasing the internalresistance of the cell. In this invention, an active metal powder isadded on the surface of the electroconductive ceramic material and isbaked; active metal is impregnated onto the surface of the perforatedbody. Electroconductive ceramic is a compound which contains at leastone element of nitrogen, boron, silicon, and carbon, example being TiN,VN, TaN, TiB{sub 2}, NbB{sub 2}, TiSi{sub 2}, ZrSi{sub 2}, TiC, HfC,etc..
