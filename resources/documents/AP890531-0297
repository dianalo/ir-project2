On other markets, precious metals slid lower; grains andsoybeans were mostly lower; energy futures were mixed; cattlefutures were mixed and pork futures advanced.   Coffee settled 2 cents to 4.08 cents lower with the contract fordelivery in July at $1.3068 a pound.   The sell-off was prompted by a report that John Rosenbaum, theU.S. chief delegate to the International Coffee Organization,remained determined not to attend the talks in London unless coffeeproducers first offer a proposal acceptable to the United States.   The five-day meeting of most of the world's largestcoffee-producing and coffee-consuming nations is aimed at producinga new International Coffee Agreement to replace the six-year pactthat expires on Sept. 30.   The United States, the organization's largest consumer member,is resisting a push to simply extend the existing agreement,calling instead for tighter restrictions on sales of coffee atdiscount prices to countries that are not members of theInternational Coffee Organization.   Wednesday's sharp decline in prices suggests an abrupt change ofattitude among traders who had grown optimistic about a newagreement following a meeting last week in Florida betweenRosenbaum and coffee-producer representatives from Brazil, Colombiaand Central America.   ``I'd say the odds for an agreement are 50-50, and it's unlikelythat anything will be hammered out until it comes down to the wirein September,'' said Sandra Kaul, a market analyst in New York withShearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   Analyst Arthur Stevenson of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. inNew York said the selling was also a reflection of the mild weatherin Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, at the beginning ofthe South American winter season.   ``The market will be increasingly trading off the weather inBrazil,'' Stevenson said.   Silver fell to a 33-month low and gold prices also slipped onNew York's Commodity Exchange despite some weakening of thedollar's value against other major currencies.   The decline indicated a continuing lack of investor interest inprecious metals as an inflation hedge.   Gold settled $2.40 to $3.20 lower with June at $363.30 a troyounce; silver was 7 cents to 7.7 cents lower with June at $5.16 atroy ounce, the lowest spot silver price since Aug. 29, 1986.   Most grain and soybean futures prices retreated on the ChicagoBoard of Trade as forecasts for more rain in the Corn Belt quietedfears of a second year of drought.   After the close, the National Weather Service issued asix-to-10-day forecast calling for normal rainfall in most of theMidwest during the middle of next week.   Wheat settled unchanged to 5\ cents lower with July at $3.87{ abushel; corn was unchanged to 1\ cents lower with July at $2.60} abushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2\ cents higher with July at $1.66} abushel; soybeans were 4 cents lower to \ cent higher with July at$7.14 a bushel.   Crude-oil futures prices notched lower while futures prices forrefined products ended mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange inchoppy activity fueled by conflicting statements from various OPECministers regarding oil production and demand.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 10 centslower with July at $19.90 a barrel; heating oil was .44 cent lowerto .08 cent higher with June at 48.71 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .28 cent lower to .83 cent higher with June at 67.44cents a gallon.
