The agreement comes shortly after J.P. Industries Inc. withdrew its $91.8 million unsolicited bid for Clevite because of what it called &quot;unattractive&quot; operating and financial considerations. The offer by Princeton, N.J.-based Pullman also topped a $78.7 million buyout proposal for Clevite from a management-led group.    Commenting on the wide disparity of the offers, a source close to Pullman said the company's bid was based on information that the management-led group had financing in place to pay as much as $16 a share for Clevite.    Terms of the agreement call for Pullman to pay $17.50 for each of Clevite's 5.3 million voting common shares outstanding and for each of its about 1.5 million nonvoting shares. In over-the-counter trading Friday, Clevite common was quoted at $12.50 bid, unchanged.    Clevite's preferred holders would receive $100 a share, plus accrued dividends, Pullman said. In addition, Pullman will offer to buy Clevite's warrants outstanding for $1.55 each.    Thomas M. Begel, Pullman's chairman and chief executive officer, said Prudential Insurance Co. of America, which owns 78% of Clevite's nonvoting common, has given Pullman an option to buy its shares. Because Clevite's nonvoting shareholders also must approve the acquisition, Prudential also gave Pullman the option to vote its shares.    Reading Co., owner of a 10% Clevite stake, has agreed to tender all of its shares to Pullman, Mr. Begel added.    Clevite, Glenview, Ill., makes fluid power products and transportation engine parts. The products are sold as original component parts to equipment manufacturers. Mr. Begel said a sizable portion of Clevite's products also are sold as replacement parts, for which profit margins are higher.    Mr. Begel said he likes the cash-generating potential of Clevite's industrial-products manufacturing business. He said the company's operations will fit nicely with Pullman's industrial and engineered-components products business.    Mr. Begel, who has said he wants to build Pullman's assets and earnings through the acquisition of industrial manufacturing businesses, also was attracted by Clevite's assets, which total $335 million. He also said that Clevite &quot;historically (has) produced operating earnings in the range of $45 million to $50 million.&quot;    For 1986, Clevite had a net loss of $11.3 million on sales of $300 million. In addition, it's saddled with about $158 million in long-term debt and has about $80 million in cash. The company said it is owed $9 million from the sale of its engine-parts business to J.P. Industries last February.    Mr. Begel said Pullman will finance the purchase through its existing credit lines. Also, Pullman has about $45 million in cash, he said. Pullman earned $16.2 million on revenue of $534 million for the year ended Sept. 30, 1986.    Pullman, formerly known as Pullman-Peabody Co., has been shopping for an acquisition since being rebuffed by Joy Manufacturing Co. last year.    Clevite, which went public in June 1986, has been on the block since April, when a group led by several Clevite executives and First Chicago Corp. announced its intention to take the company private in a leveraged buyout. In such a transaction, a company is acquired largely with borrowings. The debt ultimately is paid with funds generated by the target company's operations or by sale of assets. But after J.P. Industries made a hostile, $13.50-a-share offer for the company, Clevite invited Pullman to make a competing bid.    Subsequently, J.P. Industries withdrew its bid, but the buyout group &quot;ran out of time&quot; to arrange financing to top the Pullman offer, according to John W. Puth, Clevite's chairman and chief executive officer.    (See: &quot;Corrections andamp; Amplifications: Pullman Co.&quot; -- WSJ May 27, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
