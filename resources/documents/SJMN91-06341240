What's with him?; --Too Close To Call  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TAKE MY BREATH AWAY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  GANGSTER OF LOVE  </MEMO><TEXT>     DEAR TOO CLOSE: Men have this thing about a woman's breath. It boils downto the fact that it's the most personal thing they can violate without gettingarrested. This one guy I knew constantly got off on women's exhalings. It waslike a fetish the way he'd corner a girl, ask her a million questions, inhaleevery word she'd say and then come around and brag about it. &quot;You see thatgirl over there,&quot; he'd gasp. &quot;I got so much of her inside of me I'm gonnabust.&quot; I'll never forget the time we were carpooling into the city and therewas this girl we saw jogging every day. We always called her the mostbeautiful girl in the city. Anyway, it was cold so she had white breathpouring out of her and this guy couldn't help himself. He jumped out of thecar and just started swimming in it. He stopped her and she was huffing andpuffing on him and he was just in a cloud of ecstasy. The next day he does thesame thing only this time he takes a handful of balloons out of his pocketsand she starts blowing them up for him right there on the street. He hands hersome money and jumps back in the car. We said, &quot;What the hell?&quot; He said, &quot;I'mgonna sell balloons filled with 'the breath of the most beautiful girl in thecity' to guys at the office.&quot; We said, &quot;How much?&quot; He said, &quot;Five bucks.&quot;Anyway, you wouldn't believe what a hit they were, bigger than rock gardens.Everybody had one, and the air in them was considered sacred, not to bereleased unless something really bad happened, like getting fired. That's whenyou'd need the sweet breath of a woman to revive your spirits. It got so wedidn't even have to use the word &quot;fired&quot; anymore. It would be like, &quot;Is MartyOK? I hear they're reworking his whole department?&quot; and all we'd have to dowould be shake our heads and say, &quot;He's in there right now, sucking down thebreath of the most beautiful girl in the city.&quot;;   DEAR GANGSTER: I seem tohave hooked up with Mr. Procrastinator. Every time I talk about marriage healways says he just has one more thing he wants to do before he ties the bigknot around his throat.; -- Gettin' the Lasso Out;   DEAR LASSO: Many stillbelieve life ends with marriage. I knew these two brothers who kept anextensive list of things they had to do before either one could get married.And they just kept adding to it so they'd never ever get married. One wouldsay, &quot;That's it, I'm gonna ask her to marry me,&quot; and it was the other's job torun for the list and say, &quot;But, but . . . you've never instigated a pianosing-along.&quot; Yes, you're right, brother, I must get that out of my system, andwhat do we have after that? &quot;You've never been to the Stone Pony. And you'veprobably seen films of Russians lining up at McDonald's but have you everactually seen one sink teeth into a Big Mac and have you ever had your ownbookie? I mean, ever been able to say to someone, 'Excuse me, I have to callmy bookie'?&quot; No, I'll have to get that out of my system before I can givemyself totally to the woman I love. Now, what else was there? &quot;Have you everworked a parcel of land? You know there are still places in this country wherethey'll give you a piece of land to work if you agree to grow Pixie Stix orsome pre-ordained crop and didn't you say just the other day that you've neverhad a personal pan pizza, that you've always had to share pizzas?&quot;;   DEARGANGSTER: Looking for a holiday gift for a fella that works in my office. Idon't want him to think I'm swooning but I'd like to send the subtle messagethat I'm interested.; -- One Lusty Elf;   DEAR LUSTY: How 'bout the everydayballoon with a simple card that says, &quot;Don't suck on this until you get fired.&quot;  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911206  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  65  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  742  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, December 6, 199100341240,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
