In a suit filed in federal court in Chicago, the SEC alleged that Alfred Elliott, a prominent takeover lawyer, made $271,312 in illegal profits by trading on confidential information about mergers and other transactions involving several corporate clients of the law firm, Schiff, Hardin andamp; Waite.    Under the settlement, Mr. Elliott, 42 years old, of Melbourne Beach, Fla., agreed to give up his trading profits and pay a civil penalty of $228,688, without admitting or denying that he had violated the anti-fraud and tender-offer provisions of the securities laws. He also consented to a court order enjoining him from such violations in the future.    In a separate suit filed in federal court here, the SEC charged Anthony A. DePalma, the former Diasonics officer, with selling 79,000 shares of Diasonics stock in September 1983 before the company announced that it expected to report a third-quarter loss of $5 million to $7 million. At the time, he was vice president of operations for the medical diagnostic equipment company, based in Milpitas, Calif., the SEC said.    Mr. DePalma, of Monte Sereno, Calif., settled the SEC's fraud charges without admitting or denying that he had traded on inside information. He agreed to turn over $71,125 -- the amount of the loss he allegedly avoided -- to the U.S. Treasury and to abide by a court order against future violations.    As reported, the SEC began investigating Mr. Elliott earlier this year, focusing on his trading in KN Energy Inc. stock. He left Schiff Hardin in April. According to the SEC's complaint, Mr. Elliott had been one of the firm's two specialists in takeover law. A spokesman for Schiff Hardin said the firm was &quot;shocked&quot; when it learned of the charges.    The agency alleged that Mr. Elliott violated &quot;a fiduciary duty or a relationship of trust and confidence&quot; by capitalizing on inside information gleaned from Schiff Hardin clients between March 1984 and February 1986.    Mr. Elliott, according to the complaint, acted as KN Energy's defensive strategist when the Lakewood, Colo.-based concern was trying to ward off a takeover bid by T. Boone Pickens Jr., general partner of Mesa Limited Partnership.    The SEC said Mr. Elliott bought 12,000 shares of KN Energy in late January, before Mesa announced its bid, and then sold his holdings after the announcement in February, making an $80,712 profit.    The agency said Mr. Elliott advised G.D. Searle andamp; Co., now a unit of Monsanto Co., in August 1985 on the sale of its 40% stake in Pearle Health Services Inc. to one of three bidders. According to the complaint, Mr. Elliott made a $106,500 profit by trading on &quot;material non-public information&quot; about the impending sale.    The SEC also charged Mr. Elliott with illegal trading involving stock in Midlands Energy Co., Bearings Inc., Rival Manufacturing Co. and Rocky Mountain Natural Gas Co. </TEXT></DOC>
