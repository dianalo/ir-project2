Lawyers for fired National Security Council aide Oliver L. Northand three co-defendants sought a ruling that the attorney generalhas the sole authority to determine whether use of sensitivedocuments to prosecute the case would jeopardize national security.   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), thegovernment can decide that disclosure of secrets in a criminaltrial would so jeopardize national security that the case should bedropped.   The defense sought to disqualify independent counsel Lawrence E.Walsh from making that determinion under CIPA, which was invokedbecause the Iran-Contra conspiracy case involves an unprecedentedvolume of highly secret government documents.   Any determination to proceed with prosecuting the case ``willprofoundly affect this country's national defense and its foreignrelations,'' the defense said in a joint filing with U.S. DistrictJudge Gerhard A. Gesell.   ``A blunder by the IC (independent counsel) may well result inserious ruptures with our closest allies; in the loss of vitalsecrets to our enemies; and in the deaths of innocent persons ofwhom the IC does not even have knowledge,'' the defense said.   ``Congress has entrusted the delicate balancing that CIPArequires to the attorney general, and did so with utmost clarity,precisely to avoid such disasters,'' lawyers for North, formernational security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealersAlbert Hakim and Richard V. Secord said in the brief.   The four are accused of conspiring to defraud the government bydiverting profits from the U.S. sale of arms to Iran to theNicaraguan rebels when direct American military aid to the Contraswas banned by Congress.   In a May 13 filing, Walsh said he had authority to decide decidewhether to seek declassification of the large volume of secretdocuments that would be needed to try the case.   Such authority was derived from the independent counsel statuteand the parallel appointment he received from the attorney generalto prosecute the case, Walsh said.   But the independent counsel conceded that he ``must bedeferential to the executive's determination as to whether nationalsecurity concerns prevent public disclosure of validly classifiedinformation.''   In the final analysis, Walsh reluctantly conceded that theJustice Department would have the final say. ``It is the inherentfunction of the executive branch to maintain the confidentiality ofsensitive national security information to the extent necessary topermit the government to conduct the foreign affairs and nationaldefense activities effectively,'' Walsh had said.   The defense said it wanted the order to disqualify theindependent counsel's office becuse its ``vague promise to pay`deference' to the executive branch in exercising the attorneygeneral's responsibilities under CIPA cannot mask its attempt toseize power over national security in single-minded pursuit of itsown interests.''   More than 200,000 pages of classified government documents werecollected by Walsh during his investigation of the Iran-Contraaffair. Walsh said some 50,000 are relevant to the case and 5percent to 10 percent of the total contain highly sensitiveinformation that could jeopardize U.S. intelligence operations.   Only the government agencies that classified the documents inthe first place have the power to declassify the material so it canbe used in court as evidence.   The judge can delete classified text from a document orsubstitute a statement of facts to show what the document wouldprove if it were introduced as evidence. But Gesell has indicatedan unwillingness to spend much time poring over secret material toprepare sanitized versions for a jury.   No date for the trial has been set.</TEXT></DOC>
