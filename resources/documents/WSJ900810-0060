While the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Sabah, and his immediatefamily fled their palace by helicopter on the morning of theIraqi invasion, most members of the vast extended family wereleft to fend for themselves. Like thousands of otherKuwaitis, they made their way out by car across desertborders to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.</LP><TEXT>   Dusty Mercedes-Benzes and Jaguars fill the parking lot ofthe Bahrain Sheraton, where several dozen al-Sabahs areregistered, filling the luxury suites and spilling over intostandard hotel rooms. The Kuwaiti Embassy is putting upordinary Kuwaitis at only slightly less-plush hotels such asthe Holiday Inn. The only major difference is that Bahrain'sprime minister pays courtesy calls on the Sheraton-basedrefugees. &quot;This is a small place,&quot; observes one Bahrainisomewhat apologetically. &quot;We don't have enough palaces for somany royal guests.&quot;   Members of the royal family don't want to be quoted byname, saying that the emir should do the talking for thefamily in such a crisis. But a few shared their grief andanxiety, both for their lost kingdom and their family'suncertain future.   &quot;We don't know where half the family is -- who got out,who is still there,&quot; says one al-Sabah woman, nervouslydragging a hand through her long dark hair. Half a dozenfemale relatives of varying ages sit around the small hotelroom, their dress and faces telling of family fortunes thathave changed radically in a single lifetime.   The face of the oldest woman, in her 70s, bears thedistinctive blue tatoos of a tribal bedouin, while herleathery brown skin hints at a youth spent outdoors inKuwait's harsh desert climate. Speaking only Arabic, she sitsswathed in a black cloak, or &quot;abaya.&quot;   The youngest woman, by contrast, wears a smart greendress, speaks fluent English, and has the creamy complexionof 25 years of living in the lap of luxury.   The al-Sabah family has ruled Kuwait since 1752, elected,more or less, from among the nomadic tribes who settled downby some brackish springs on the Persian Gulf. But until WorldWar II and the beginning of oil production, being a Kuwaitiroyal wasn't much to boast about. In 1918, a British officialwrote that the then-ruler &quot;and his sons are perhaps among theworst-dressed and ill-lodged residents of the place.&quot;   Older members of the family remember Sheik Salim, theninth ruler, riding through the market, or &quot;souq,&quot; mostmornings to chat with his subjects and listen to their gripesover coffee in a cafe named Abu Nashi.   Such informality ended as Kuwait expanded, but oneal-Sabah woman says the current ruler, Sheik Jaber, sometimeswound his headdress over his distinctive beard and wentshopping in the fish market to catch up with street gossip.One daughter of a previous ruler recalls growing up in theroyal &quot;palace&quot; -- at that time a somewhat dilapidatedmudbrick pile without air conditioning.   Petrodollars changed everything, bringing the al-Sabahunimaginable riches. But while they became billionaires,plenty of other Kuwaitis became millionaires. And even thehumblest saw their children become educated, multilingualdoctors and engineers through the state's lavish provision offree education. &quot;You can still find a poor Saudi, but youcan't find a poor Kuwaiti,&quot; says a Western diplomat.   The Iraqi invasion may change that. Some of the al-Sabahare arriving in Bahrain penniless, relying on governmenthandouts even to buy a cigarette. But most wave away theirfinancial predicament, either because poverty isunimaginable, or because other fears are paramount.   In the Sheraton lobby, al-Sabah men, some in traditionallong white &quot;thobes,&quot; others in Lacoste sports shirts, clusteraround a news ticker to read the latest headlines. &quot;We mightbe al-Sabah, but we are no better off than you for knowingwhat's happening,&quot; says one.   &quot;We can't even find out if Jaber is going to Cairo for theArab summit.&quot;   President Bush said Wednesday that he wants the al-Sabahemir reinstated as ruler. The family he is backing hasgenerally ruled wisely, investing its oil wealth and buildinga fat &quot;fund for future generations&quot; while other oil statesdip into their financial reserves and even borrow money. Theyalso have allowed a measure of democracy, although only 10%of the population of 1.7 million has the vote and theParliament has been dissolved when it questioned rulingfamily corruption or criticized Kuwait's powerful neighbors.Non-citizens -- some 60% of the population -- rarely get muchshare of the state's lavish benefits or its luxury livingstandards.   Although Kuwait means &quot;little fort,&quot; the city state has acomplete absence of martial tradition. Instead, it hassurvived until now by shrewd diplomacy and remainingostensibly neutral.   The ruling family, like any group of people of its size,has had its share of scandals. Last year, a British courtawarded damages against two al-Sabah women when their Indianmaid sued them for brutally beating and humiliating her.   More typical, however, is Hussa al-Sabah, theOxford-educated director of Kuwait's Islamic Museum. She andher husband, also a member of the ruling family, used theirpersonal fortune to assemble a collection of Islamic artworkranging from ruby-encrusted Moghul daggers to rare antiquePersian carpets, all of which are displayed in a publicmuseum. The fate of that collection, like so much else inKuwait, is uncertain amid reports of shelling and looting.   In an interview before the Iraqi invasion, Shieka Hussaspoke of her fears that Kuwait would one day &quot;be devoured&quot; byits powerful and unpredicable neighbors. She also worriedabout her 19-year-old daughter's generation -- al-Sabahs whohad grown up entirely removed from any hint of hardship orchallenge.   &quot;People my age knew the pearl-divers and traders who hadto work so hard to make a living,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm worriedthat our children will be spoiled, will have nothing tostrive for.&quot; Now, the invasion makes such fears lookunfounded. Even if Kuwait is liberated and the al-Sabahsrestored, reconstruction is likely to provide amplechallenges.   Says one royal refugee, &quot;What we are facing iscatastrophe.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
