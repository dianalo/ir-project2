But none of this would mean a thing if thequality of its work weren't worth supporting, and the company has rarelylooked better than it does in &quot;Cat.&quot;;   At this point in his writing, Williamswas already on the downhill slide toward eccentricity for its own sake, thoughhe still penned powerful characters. There are few roles in American theaterplummier than Maggie the Cat, who struggles to hold together her marriage toBrick, passive, charming and dissolute; and Big Daddy Pollitt, the dyingpatriarch of a wealthy Mississippi clan.;   On the other hand, there'ssomething too cloying for words about &quot;Big Daddy&quot; and &quot;Big Mama&quot;; and as forBrick's grasping brother, we don't even have to see him once having heard thathis name is &quot;Gooper.&quot; Likewise the &quot;no-neck monsters,&quot; as Maggie callsGooper's children, in a phrase that's funny the first time but wears out itswelcome long before Williams could bear to let it go.;   Steel magnolias; But,no doubt about it, the man could write dialogue. Perfumed, overwrought andrepetitive as it reads, the stuff speaks beautifully, and the ACT actors wraptheir mouths around it as though it were hot biscuits sticky with honey.;  Anyone who's ever lived in the South knows that the magnolia exterior ofpeople like the Pollitts hides a steely determination to succeed. (&quot;SteelMagnolias&quot; -- good title for a play, don't you think?) That's the message inJoel Fontaine's beautiful set, a model of conscious incongruity.;   The roomitself is old, with delicate fanlights above the doors and a carved cornice,but the furniture is prosaic and modern, including a blond-wood stereo unit ofsurpassing ugliness. The wallpaper is actually an exquisite mural ofplantations along the Mississippi, with a graceful egret and a live oak tree-- an idealized picture that the first words of Big Daddy, the self-madeplanter, blast to pieces.;   Life-and-death tension;   &quot;Cat&quot; takes place in acountry where &quot;the stork and the reaper are running neck and neck.&quot; Big Daddyhas terminal cancer, and Brick is deliberately drinking himself to death. ButMaggie, a blazing beacon of life force, simmers with sexual desperation; BigDaddy, unaware of the beast within, grabs at power and pleasure with bothhands; and even Gooper and his fertile wife, Mae, teem with life, albeit of avenal and corrupt kind.;   In the unobtrusive hands of director Warner Shookof Seattle's Intiman Theater, the tension of life and death rarely slackens.The power struggle masks itself in a genteel Southern facade and behind a lotof cute grotesquerie, such as the birthday song of the no-neck monsters, butthe desperate schemes and stratagems are real -- as are the passions behindthem.;   The cast is all but peerless, from the sniveling preacher of EdHodson and the gentle doctor of William Paterson to the major players: DanielReichert as the self-destructive Brick; Lawrence Hecht's solid, thick-necked,hard-eyed Gooper; Deborah Sussel, who cloaks Mae's self-interest in a sweetand reasonable demeanor.;   Joy Carlin, in wing-frame glasses and a great wigof faded red hair (by Rick Echols) is just wonderful as the motherly, meddlingBig Mama, though she's so tiny that all the script's references to &quot;fat&quot; havebeen changed to &quot;bony.&quot;;   Tenacity and grit;   Returning for a third time toher adopted company, Andrea Marcovicci has a field day with the sensuousMaggie. Her voice isn't really opalescent enough to carry the first act, whichis close to a 65-minute soliloquy, but she projects passion and tenacity andgrit, and she sure looks decorative in the famous satin slip.;   However, theplay belongs, body and soul, to Ken Ruta, who has been with ACT on and offsince its first season in San Francisco. As Big Daddy, he balances power andpathos in his massive hands, controlling the man's bluster and anger andcompassion with his magnificent voice and dominating the stage with hisleonine bulk and sleekness. (It's a fortuitous bit of casting that Hecht andhe are the same size, so Gooper is a physical parody of his father.);   What aseersucker suit; Sandra Woodall's costumes are good, as always, but herseersucker suit for Big Daddy is better than good. When Ruta sits, the suitbunches around the crotch, and the pants legs ride up, exposing saggy bluesocks. In his rumpled shirt and tie askew, he's the image of a rakehell in thecholeric sunset of life.;   Despite its title, the heart of this play iselsewhere, and Williams knew it. He prefaced it with four lines of DylanThomas' &quot;Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night,&quot; and Ruta obliges by ragingbrilliantly against the dying of the light. If Maggie represents life force inits youthful brilliance, Ruta's Big Daddy shows what it looks like at the end,still potent, still raw.; Cat on a Hot Tin Roof; By Tennessee Williams;Producer: American Conservatory Theater; Through: Nov. 23; Where: Stage DoorTheater, 420 Mason St., San Francisco; Tickets: $10-$33.
