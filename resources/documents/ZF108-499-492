(services)Broderbund Software Inc. (product introduction).andO;Topic:     Electronic Mail SystemsComputer GamesNew Product.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>MCI MailandM;We are heavy users of MCI Mail for general E-mail functions and, moreimportantly, for putting together each month's Outlook.andP;  Since our writersand editors come from several parts of the country, it is the best vehicle wehave found to date to take us through the interactive editorial procedures.andO;Our ultimate goal is, of course, to get the newsletter in the hands of oursubscribers in a timely fashion.andP;  This process can require several rewritesof one or more articles.andP;  MCI Mail's relatively instant capability is betterthan fax, since we all use word processing to do our writing, and cheaper andeasier than computer to computer communication.andM;There are a few things that could be improved, however.andP;  The only way we cantransfer binary or native word processing files is via Lotus Express.andP;  Irecently made an attempt to use that program again and it wouldn't even runon my IBM PS/2 Model 70.andP;  I removed everything that could be controversialfrom my Autoexec and Config files and it flat would not run.andM;So we convert everything to ASCII text.andP;  Our writers use XyWrite  Andy), AmiProfessional (Dick Dexter), WordPerfect (Bob Remington and Peter Stephenson),Microsoft Word  me), IBM Writing Assistant (Bill Murray), and both Word andPagemaker for the Macintosh (Andy as well as several other writers).andM;One other major gripe with MCI Mail is the inability to utilize a 2400 baudtransmission speed all the time.andP;  Here in Atlanta, I cannot utilize 2400 baudbetween 8:30 AM and about 6:00 PM for whatever reason.andP;  Therc are just toomany errors and MCI offers no error correction mechanism.andP;  We try to transmitlarge files outside those hours, or we resort to 1200 baud when daytimetransmission is an absolute must.andM;Where in Time is Carmen SandiegoandM;Broderbund Software, Inc. (17 Paul Drive, San Rafael, CA94903-2101-415-492-3200) has recently released the fourth in a series ofeducational games starring Carmen Sandiego, head of V.I.L.E., aninternational band of thieves.andP;  In this adventure, you the detective, travelthrough time tracking down members of V.I.L.E.andP;  who have stolen famoustreasures of the past 1500 years.andP;  Included in the looting is Napoleon's hat,Don Quixote's lance, and even Paul Revere's horse.andP;  (According to theDetective's Manual, Paul Revere's horse was stolen on April 19, 1775, the dayafter his famous ride, so no damage was done.)andM;To begin the game, you enter Acme Detective Agency Headquarters.andP;  Take theelevator to the second floor to the personnel department where you meetDiane, the Director.andP;  She has you sign a liability release form which&quot;...releases the Acme Detective Agency from all liability associated with thepursuit and capture of dangerous criminals no matter what might happen.&quot; Shesends you down the hall for Agent Brassey to assign you your first case andissue you a Chronoskimmer 325i which you will use to travel through 1500years of time and 48 locations to find 15 villains with such names as Russ T.andO;Hinge, Nosmo King and Lynn Gweeny.andM;You are presented with the console of the Chronoskimmer 325i which is youroperations center for the playing of the game.andP;  For our first assignment, wefind that the Zuider Zee dam has been stolen from Holland in 1932.andP;  Anunidentified man is seen leaving the scene.andP;  The Federal Time Commission hasauthorized thirty-five hours use of the Chronoskimmer to solve the crime.andO;The machine takes you to 1932 and the game play begins.andM;From here, the player learns facts about history, uses a 1375 page DeskEncyclopedia, which comes with the game, to find or clarify facts about thepath to take to solve the mystery.andP;  The player &quot;searches&quot; the country byinterviewing witnesses and informants and by scanning the area from theconsole.andP;  In this case, the witness said he wanted to sec Tenochtitlan'sgardens.andP;  We go to the Encyclopedia and determine that the gardens werefounded in 1325 and are in Mexico City.andP;  You get the gist.andP;  Back and forthyou go, uncovering evidence about the suspect until you have enough to filean arrest warrant.andP;  There is even a robot to help with apprehending thecriminal.andM;Each time you solve a case, you are one step closer to a promotion fromstarting as a Time Cadet until eighty cases later you have achieved SuperTime Sleuth status and are inducted into the Hall of Fame.andP;  Once again,Broderbund has put together a marvelous teaching tool that no home withyoungsters should be without.andP;  The graphics are intense (we ran the programon both an IBM PS/2 Model 70 and Tandy's VGA 2500 XL, there is an Appleversion as well) and the sound is first rate.andP;  Now I have to go play thefirst three games as well-Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, Where in theUSA is Carmen Sandiego, and Where in Europe is Carmen Sandiego.andP;  No wonderthese have been best sellers for a long time.andP;  Incidentally, Where in theWorld is offered online on Prodigy as well.andM;That's all for this month.andP;  Next month we will be looking at some more newlaser printers, and some of the first Windows 3.0 applications to becomeavailable.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
