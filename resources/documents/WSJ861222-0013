At the suggestion of a White House trade strike force, the U.S. asked for high-level talks on the matter next month with senior officials of France, West Germany and Britain, the major partners in the Airbus group. U.S. officials said the Europeans have agreed to the talks in principle, but haven't set a date yet.    Washington has been complaining for years that the European government subsidies give Airbus an unfair advantage over U.S.-based competitors such as Boeing Co. and McDonnell-Douglas Corp. U.S. officials contend the high level of subsidies for the A-330 and A-340 planes violate the convention on trade in aircraft of the Geneva, Switzerland-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    The request for high-level talks marked an intensification of the U.S. complaints. In the past, lower-level U.S. officials have protested repeatedly to European negotiators, but so far haven't won any concessions. </TEXT></DOC>
