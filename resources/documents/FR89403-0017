The statuterequires that regulations be published for the NHSC Loan Repayment Programand Grants for State Loan Repayment Programs within 180 days of the passageof the act. The statute also requires that the Secretary establish guidelinesregarding monetary payments under the Special Repayment Program and issueregulations providing for the allowance of partial credit for service performedunder this program. It is the current plan of the Department that funding for the NationalHealth Service Corps Loan Repayment Program be phased down over the first2 years of the program's operation and that funding for the grants forState Loan Repayment Programs be increased so that communities totallyrely on State Loan Repayment Programs during the third year of operationof these programs. States should begin to develop State Loan Repaymentprograms to compete for future Federal funding for such programs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Interim rule effective April 3, 1989.

L. 100-177, amended section 338Bof the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 2541-1) by substitutinga new section authorizing the Secretary to establish the National HealthService Corps Loan Repayment Program (LRP). The purpose of the LRP is toassure an adequate supply of trained health professionals to be used bythe Secretary to improve the delivery of health services in sites or areaswhich are determined to have the greatest need for health services personneland for which alternative sources of health care services are not readilyavailable. The NHSC will regularly select health manpower shortage areaswhich are in the greatest need of health providers and will establish alist of ``NHSC Loan Repayment Service Sites'' at which LRP participantsmay fulfill their service obligations. Section 62.23 of the regulation sets out criteria for acceptance of applicationsfrom eligible applicants and assigns priority for funding approval as specifiedin the statute (i.e., for applications from individuals trained in professionsor specialties most needed by the NHSC and to persons who are most committedto serve in health manpower shortage areas). The acceptance criteria includeconsideration of the needs of the NHSC for individuals with the applicant'shealth professions and specialty training, the applicant's commitment toserve in a health manpower shortage area, the applicant's readiness toserve, the length of the applicant's proposed service (3 or 4 years asopposed to 2 years), and the applicant's professional qualifications. Thecriterion relating to the degree of readiness to serve is designed to reducethe time between the point at which a provider commits himself to participatein the program and the time that such service actually begins. In the NHSCScholarship Program, the commitment to serve was made many years beforesuch service was actually to begin. The NHSC program has learned that,over time, the priorities and needs of the individuals in the program andthe priorities and needs of the NHSC can change. Reaching agreement withprogram participants more closely to the point of service helps to assurea meeting of the minds and, thereby, reduces the possibility of defaultunder the Program. The criterion related to the health professions andspecialty needs of the NHSC will also permit the NHSC to more accuratelytarget the kinds of providers needed. A final criterion is added to allowthe Secretary to consider the professional qualifications, experience,and competence of the applicants.Section 62.24 of the regulation describes the statutory conditions of eligibilityfor participation in the LRP. The eligibility requirements specify thatapplicants must, as part of the application process for this program, submita signed contract agreeing to accept loan repayments and to serve in ahealth manpower shortage area to which they are assigned by the Secretary.The LRP will follow the same procedure as the NHSC Scholarship Programin paying for one site visit for the potential assignee (and spouse, ifmarried) to the site where an assignment is being considered. Applications will be accepted from persons who have an obligation to providehealth professions service to any other Federal or State Government agencyor any other public or private organization only if such obligation willbe completely satisfied prior to the beginning of the applicants' serviceunder this Program. See andSection; 62.24(b). The purpose of the LRP is toincrease the supply of physicians, dentists and other health professionspersonnel in areas where such services are in great need. The Secretarydoes not want to undermine the effectiveness of State or other programsby substituting one service obligation for another or by delaying one serviceobligation for another. Section 62.24(c) of this regulation denies eligibility for participationin this Program to any person who has breached a health professions serviceobligation to the Federal Government or a State or local government entity.Persons who have breached a service obligation are not considered to begood risks for the receipt of benefits under the LRP. The Secretary is authorized to repay educational loans health professionalsused to pay for their health education in amounts up to $20,000 for eachyear of a participant's service performed under the LRP and up to $25,000may be repaid for each year if the service is performed in specified sitesserving Indian populations. Only loans incurred for and during health professionsacademic training are eligible for repayment under the LRP. Applicantsmust document that their loans were incurred for health professions educationexpenses, including reasonable living expenses, during the time that suchtraining was being received. See section 62.22. Loans for living expensesduring periods of internship and/or residency cannot be repaid under theprogram. These provisions of the regulation are intended to ensure thatthe loans repaid by the Secretary are valid health profession educationalloans. The Secretary, based on the availability of appropriated funds, the needsand best interests of the areas to be served and/or the request of theapplicant, may reimburse loan repayment participants at levels which areless than the amounts set forth in the preceding paragraph. Accordingly,the regulation provides at andSection; 62.25(a) that the Secretary may establishdifferent levels of annual loan repayment for participants to encourageservice in a manner that is determined to be in the best interests of theNHSC. For example, the Secretary may use this provision to pay the maximumannual loan repayment amount for a LRP participant who agrees to provideservice for 3 or 4 years, and a lower annual amount for a LRP participantwho agrees to serve the minimum 2-year obligation. This allows the Secretaryto encourage LRP participants to increase the amount of service provided.Willingness to serve for longer periods of time is also a selection criterionunder andSection; 62.23. It is anticipated that payments on loans will be made on a regular basisto lenders (i.e. monthly or quarterly). Once a contract is finalized witha Program participant and the participant begins service, the Secretarywill begin payments of the amount the program has agreed to pay towardthe participant's qualifying health professions educational loans. Subsequentpayments will be made as long as the participant continues to provide healthprofessions service under the Program contract. Participants should understandthat the loan repayments may not cover the full indebtedness of the participant.For each year of service under the LRP, a participant may be given theopportunity to request a tax liability supplement as provided in the statute.The conditions under which these supplements will be paid and the methodto apply for these supplements are described in andSection; 62.25(c). A participant in the LRP must provide obligated service through full-timeclinical practice: (1) As a Commissioned Officer of the Public Health Service;(2) as a civil service employee of the Federal Government; (3) as a civilianmember of the NHSC who is not an employee of the Federal Government butwho may be employed by State agencies or other public or nonprofit privateagencies, such as Community Health Centers, under a Private Practice Assignment(PPA) arrangement; or (4) as a private practitioner or as an employee ofa private group practice, Health Maintenance Organization or other similaragency under a Private Practice Option (PPO) arrangement. The statute provides that the Secretary may repay health professions loanswhich have been incurred for actual tuition and for reasonable educationaland living expenses. These regulations, in the definitions at andSection;62.22, define reasonableness of educational and living expenses as follows.Educational and living expenses equal to or less than the level of suchexpenses that is/was estimated by the Program participant's school in thestandard student budgets for the degree program in which the Program participantis/was enrolled during the years in which the Program participant is/wasenrolled are deemed by the Secretary to be reasonable. As long as the Programparticipant's educational and living expenses are equal to or less thanthe applicable standard student budget, no documentation of these expenseswill be required by the Secretary and the entire amount of the loan forthese expenses will qualify for loan repayment. In those instances wherethe Program participant's school did not maintain a standard student budgetor the Program participant seeks loan repayment for educational and/orliving expenses in excess of the standard student budgets, the Programparticipant must submit documentation, as required by the Secretary, tosubstantiate the reasonableness of all the educational and living expensesincurred by the Program participant. To the extent the Secretary determines,upon review of the Program participant's documentation, that all or a portionof the educational and living expenses incurred by the Program participantwere reasonable, these expenses will qualify for loan repayment.Grants for State Loan Repayment Programs: Pub. L. 100-177 also amendedthe PHS Act by adding a new section 338H authorizing the Secretary to establisha program of grants to support State loan repayment programs that are ``similarto'' the NHSC LRP. The statute provides little specificity as to how theseState programs are to be administered at the State or Federal level. Thisregulation identifies those program components which are considered necessaryfor the State program to be similar to the Federal program and for theorderly conduct and administration of this program. The Secretary has chosen to use a standard grant application form for thisprogram. Section 62.54 sets forth those items which must be included inthe program narrative of the grant applications. Two specific items arerequired by the statute to be contained in the application: A descriptionof the State's standard for designation of medically underserved areasand for the determination of obligated service requirements under the StateLoan Repayment Program. The Secretary has determined that, in order topromote consistency in targeting health manpower resources to areas ofgreatest need, States may utilize health manpower shortage areas as designatedby the Secretary pursuant to section 332 of the PHS Act in lieu of individuallydeveloping State standards for the designation of medically underservedareas. See andSection; 62.22. If a State chooses to use the health manpowershortage areas as determined by the Department as its shortage area criteria,such State will not need to individually develop (or describe in its application)standards for designation of medically underserved areas. See andSection;62.54(b)(1). State standards for the determination of medically underservedareas will be subject to review and approval by the Secretary as providedin the statute. The application narrative should also contain information and appropriatedata on the need of the State for health professions manpower, with specialemphasis on health professionals trained in a profession or specialty identifiedby the Secretary as needed (see andSection; 62.23(c)), and the State's effortsto obtain such manpower; the availability, amount and use of the State'smatching funds; and the program and management plans, experience, and qualificationsof the State agency administering the program. These factors, and othersincluded in andSection; 62.54, will be evaluated as described in andSection;62.57 and will be used in selecting applicants for approval under thisprogram. The State's program description in its application is, by statute,the standard for the conduct of the State program. The statute authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States to supportthe establishment by States of State programs similar to the NHSC LRP.The Secretary has determined that the following NHSC LRP elements are necessaryto ensure that a State's program is similar to the NHSC LRP: (1) The priorityfor the selection of applicants; (2) the training level of applicants;(3) the obligated service requirements of State program participants and(4) the practice requirements for State program participants. These elements,as well as a few additional elements set forth at andSection; 62.55, areconsidered necessary elements of a State program to meet the requirementsof the statute that State programs are to be similar to the NHSC LRP. Theserequirements also include specifications that State program participantsmust provide service in medically underserved areas determined by the Stateto have the greatest need and demand for health manpower. See andSection;62.55.States are required to provide at least 25 percent of the cost of the approvedState program and are expected to increase the amount of money availablefor loan repayment by proposing State funds for use for repayment of loansin addition to State funds proposed for administrative costs. The Federalshare of the program must be spent entirely for loan repayments. None ofthe Federal share is to be used for program administration costs. See andSection;62.56. Under andSection; 62.57(g) the Secretary will, in determining whichState applications will be approved, consider the level and use of theState match and the percentage of the State's match which is proposed foruse for repayment of loans. Special Repayment Provisions: Section 204 of Pub. L. 100-177, establisheda new program which is not a part of the PHS Act and which provides a time-limitedopportunity for persons who are in default or otherwise in breach of anywritten obligation under the present NHSC Scholarship Program or the formerPublic Health and National Health Service Corps Scholarship (PH/NHSC) TrainingProgram, to repay these obligations through service or through a combinationof service and monetary payment. Participants in this Special RepaymentProgram may thus avoid the financial consequences under the default provisionsof the scholarship statutes. Service may be performed at a site on the1988 or 1989 Health Manpower Shortage Area Placement Opportunity List (HPOL)or at a site on the Supplemental HPOL (SHPOL) in 1989. A SHPOL will beestablished by the Secretary, in accordance with Pub. L. 100-177, exclusivelyfor this program and will include various sites which do not otherwiseappear on a HPOL because they are not considered as critically needy asHPOL sites. Service at SHPOL sites requires an additional commitment onthe part of the participant (i.e., to serve 150 percent of the remainingservice obligation or to serve 100 percent of the remaining service obligationand repay the original scholarship amounts paid to, or on behalf of, theparticipant under the scholarship programs). All persons in default or breach of a scholarship obligation as of Novemberl, 1987, may be eligible for this program and, except as noted below, havebeen sent a notice on or before February 29, 1988, as required by statute.The notice described the provisions of the Special Repayment Program andrequired a response by May 29, 1988, from persons interested in participatingin the program. The eligibility notice under this program was sent to the last addresson record with the Division of Health Services Scholarships. Mailing ofthe notice to the last known address of the individual constituted a legalnotice for the purpose of the statute and no further effort is requiredto locate new addresses for persons whose notices were returned undelivered.Notices were not sent to individuals who were serving their scholarshipobligations on December 1, 1987, under a judgment, forbearance agreementor other written agreement to serve. While these individuals may have beenin breach of a scholarship obligation on November 1, 1987, the Secretaryconsiders that their acceptance and commencement of a service assignmentbefore the statute was enacted, places them outside the intended scopeof the statute. Persons who were in breach on November 1, 1987, and whobegan serving under such agreements after December 1, 1987, and who wishto participate in the Special Repayment Program, may participate but mustassume full responsibility for extricating themselves from existing employmentcontracts. Participants in this program are responsible for matching to a site. Theprospective participant is also responsible for the cost of contactingand matching to a site, including site visits, if any.  The statute directs the Secretary to issue regulations allowing for a reductionin an individual's financial liability by providing credit for partialservice under this program. The regulations contain this provision at andSection;62.75. The Secretary will allow NHSC Scholarship Program recipients a creditof 50 percent of any time served under an agreement under this programtoward their remaining service obligation (including any additional monthsof service incurred by agreeing to serve 150 percent of the remaining serviceobligation at a SHPOL site). Thus, an individual with a two-year serviceobligation who elects to serve 100 percent of that obligation at a HPOLor SHPOL site and then serves only one year of that obligation would receivea \1/4\ reduction of his or her debt under the NHSC Scholarship Program.An individual with a two-year service obligation who elects to serve 150percent of that obligation at a SHPOL site and then serves only one yearof that obligation would receive a \1/6\ reduction of his or her debt underthe NHSC Scholarship Program. The Secretary will allow no partial creditfor service under the Public Health Service and National Health ServiceCorp Scholarship Training Program because of the relative ease of the monetaryrepayment under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program provisions. Credit for approved service performed or monetary payments made prior tobeginning service in the Special Repayment Program is allowed under thecircumstances outlined in andSection; 62.74 of the regulations. An individualwill receive one day of service credit for each day of approved prior serviceperformed by the individual. If a participant has made monetary paymentsand elects to serve 150 percent of the remaining service obligation ata SHPOL site or 100 percent of the remaining service obligation at a HPOLsite, the monetary payments would be converted into days of service creditin accordance with andSection; 62.74(b) of the proposed regulations. However,if a participant has made monetary payments and elects to serve 100 percentof the remaining service obligation at a SHPOL site and pay an amount equalto the orginal scholarship amount, prior monetary payments will first becredited against the participant's liability for the original scholarshipamount. Thus, payments previously posted against the participant's totalscholarship debt, as defined by andSection; 62.72, will be credited insteadby the Secretary to the participant's liability under the Special RepaymentProgram to pay the original scholarship amount, and the Secretary willincrease the participant's outstanding scholarship debt in the amount equalto the amount credited to the participant's liability under the SpecialRepayment Program for the original scholarship amount. Payments in excessof the scholarship amount will be converted into days of service in accordancewith andSection; 62.74(c).If a participant fails to complete service under the program, the moniespreviously paid will be applied to the outstanding scholarship debt. Exceptthat, any amount paid to extinguish an additional liability for the paymentof the scholarship amount under the option to serve 100 percent of theremaining service obligation at a SHPOL site will not be refunded and willnot be applied to the outstanding scholarship debt. The Secretary willtreat this up-front payment as a cost of exercising this particular SHPOLoption in order to place individuals selecting the other SHPOL option (i.e.to serve 150 percent of their remaining service obligation) on more equalfooting with respect to the financial consequences of only completing aportion of the service obligation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 </ITAG>This interim-final rule contains information collections which have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980.

Within States,the impact of the State Loan Repayment Program is generally limited tothe agency administering the State manpower programs. Therefore, the Departmentof Health and Human Services has determined that this rulemaking will notsignificantly impact on a substantial number of small entities and doesnot require preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis under theRegulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354. The Department also has determined that this rule is not a ``major rule''under Executive Order 12291. Thus, a regulatory impact analysis is notrequired because it will not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more; (2) Impose a major increase in costs or pricesfor consumers; individual industries; Federal, State or local governmentagencies; or geographic regions; or (3) Result in significant adverse effectson competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or onthe ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 42 CFR Part 62 </ITAG>Health professions, Loan programs_health, Grant programs_health, Scholarshipsand fellowships. <ITAG tagnum="84">Justification for Publication of Interim Final Regulations </ITAG>Pub. L. 100-177 was enacted on December l, 1987. The statute authorizedthree new programs that must be implemented by the end of the current fiscalyear. With respect to the Special Repayment Program, the statute also establisheda rigid time frame for implementation of the program, requiring notificationof defaulters 90 days after enactment and a response from defaulters 90days after the notice. It was therefore necessary to develop the policiesand procedures, forms, guidelines, and other program materials simultaneouslywith the regulations so that they could be provided to potential participantsin the program in timely fashion along with the required notice. It isalso necessary that participants who wish to participate in the 1988 cyclehave final regulations at the earliest possible date to guide them in theprocess of matching to sites and signing employment agreements with sitesand/or agreements with the Department, all of which must be accomplishedby October l, 1988. With respect to the NHSC LRP and the Grants for State Loan Repayment Programs,it is essential that final regulations be in place as soon as possiblein order to reach health professionals eligible to participate in FiscalYear 1988, many of whom must make employment decisions by the middle ofthe calendar year. Moreover, grant applications from States must be completedand sent to the Department by July 29, 1988, in order to be processed sothat grant awards can be made this fiscal year. Accordingly, the Secretary has determined, in accordance with 5 U.S.C.553(b)(3)(B), that notice and opportunity for public comment on the regulationsset out below are impracticable and contrary to the public interest. Interestedpersons are, however, invited to submit comments on these final regulationsby June 2, 1989. Comments so received will be considered by the Departmentand, if warranted, changes may be made in the regulations in the futurebased on those comments.For the reasons set out in the preamble, Subparts B, C, and D of Part 62of Title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, are revised as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="21">The OMB Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number for the NHSC/LRPis 13.162 and the catalog number for Grants for State Loan Repayment Programsis 13.165.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 1, 1988.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
