As of today, the United States does not recognize any legalauthority in Panama despite its role as one of the moststrategically located countries in the world. The changed situationis the result of Panama's disputed election process last spring.   Bush said in a statement that the administration will ``continueto take other steps ... to deprive the illegal regime of funds thatbelong to the Panamanian people.'' He did not elaborate.   He said the U.S. ambassador to Panama, Arthur Davis, called backto Washington last May, will not return to Panama and there will beno diplomatic contact with the new authorities in that country eventhough the U.S. Embassy will continue to function.   There have been no official dealings with the Noriega-dominatedgovernment in Panama for 18 months.   The statement came on the last day of the term of President EricArturo Delvalle, who was ousted by Noriega 18 months ago but hasbeen recognized by the United States in exile.   The president said the United States will continue to supportself-determination and democracy for Panama and ``counter the threatposed by Gen. Noreiga's support for drug trafficking and other formsof subversion.''   ``I am confident that other governments which support humanrights, democracy and self-determination and which opppose drugtrafficking will take similar measures,'' Bush said.   He said it was ``a sad day for Panama and for the democraticnations of this hemisphere,'' in the wake of Noriega's invalidationof last May's election to choose a new president who would havetaken office today.   Observers of the balloting said it was an overwhelming victoryfor Noriega's opposition despite his efforts to rig it, but themilitary strongman threw out the results.   The United States has chosen for the past year and a half not toextend diplomatic legitimacy to the Noriega-backed government inPanama, opting instead to continue recognizing Delvalle.   Delvalle has wielded no authority in exile, spent much of histime in hiding and had an almost-invisible base of support inPanama. But his term in office was to expire today with noacknowledged claimant as his successor.   The highly unusual diplomatic situation arises a day after theUnited States denounced Noriega as a man of ``shameless excess''with a fortune of up to $300 million from drug smuggling and othercriminal activities.   ``Noriega's greed, personal ambition and selfishness are theorigin, core and sustenance of Panama's crisis,'' Deputy Secretaryof State Lawrence Eagleburger told the Organization of AmericanStates on Thursday.   The political vacuum grows out of the decision of Panamanianauthorities to void May's presidential elections after independentobservers concluded that the anti-Noriega candidate, GuillermoEndara, had won by a landslide.   Speaking to the OAS, Eagleburger said Noriega's assets included astring of mansions and other dwellings in Panama and elsewhere, aswell as various jets and three large pleasure yachts _ ``The MachoI, Macho II and Macho III.''   An American lawyer for Noriega, Frank Anthony Rabino, said thecase against his client, based on two 1988 Florida grand juryindictments, was politically motivated.   Rabino said the U.S. government is asking ``you and me and othersto use our imagination, to let our dreams run wild and maybe we'llfind something evil in Gen. Noriega if we speculate ... long andhard.''   Noriega's OAS ambassador, Jose Maria Cabrera, said ofEagleburger's allegations, ``There is nothing new in this string ofinventions.''   The State Department asked for the special OAS meeting after aPanamanian diplomat demanded last week that the United States proveits drug smuggling allegations against Noriega.   In his speech, Eagleburger outlined a long list of criminalactivities he attributed to Noriega, contending that he ``protectedcocaine shipments from Medellin, Colombia, through Panama to theUnited States.''   He said that Noriega provided refuge and a base for continuedoperations to the members of the Medellin cartel after the murder ofa Colombian justice minister in 1984.   ``He agreed to protect a cocaine laboratory being constructed onDarien Province,'' Eagleburger said. ``And he assured the safepassage of millions of dollars of narcotics proceeds into Panamanianbanks.''   Refusing to deal with Panamanian authorities has made itdifficult for the United States to protect its interests in Panama,but there has been no apparent impact on the operation of the PanamaCanal.   The United States is responsible for operating the world's mostimportant inter-oceanic waterway. The country also is home to 10,000U.S. servicemen.   Another anomaly became history Thursday when Ambassador Juan B.Sosa, a Delvalle loyalist who has declined for 18 months tosurrender Panama's embassy in Washington to a Noriega appointee,shut down the mission.   With Delvalle's term expiring, Sosa said, he could no longerclaim to be the ousted president's official agent in Washington.   Under the Panamanian constitution an ``elected president'' was totake office today. With the May elections annulled, theNoriega-dominated Council of State on Thursday appointed aspresident Francisco Rodriguez, who has served as governmentcomptroller for seven years.</TEXT></DOC>
