Overhead, aman yells from a passing car on the First Street bridge: ``Get ajob.''   ``Right there is someone who doesn't understand the issues of thehomeless,'' said Page, who knows the problems first hand.   Page, 29, spends many of his days and nights on the shantytown,three scrapwood huts lashed together atop styrofoam blocks that havebeen anchored in the middle of the lake that bisects downtown Austin.   The floating eyesore _ deliberately ugly to prick the consciencesof the thousands who drive or jog by daily _ has been floating inthe lake since the end of October. It is the creation of the StreetPeople's Advisory Council, or SPAC, an organization founded by JamesWilliams that has performed similar publicity stunts to increaseawareness of the homeless.   Last year, SPAC members took a gosling hostage and threatened tocook and eat it if the City Council didn't meet with them. They gottheir meeting.   Williams, 49, was briefly held by police for trespassing lastyear when he and other homeless people broke into and lived forseveral days in an abandoned house owned by the University of Texas.   When the state Legislature convened in January, SPAC memberspanhandled at the Capitol for quarters so they could park a couch ina metered parking space.   The group is now lobbying the City Council to build a permanenttent city for the city's 2,700 homeless people. Although Austinwinters are generally mild with temperatures in the 50s, thethermometer occasionally dips below freezing.   ``I try to figure out something that is humorous and to thepoint. A lot of people have heard the issues and have turned a deafear,'' Williams said in a recent interview.   Acting City Manager Barney Knight says Williams and his grouphave been forceful. ``They've done a very effective job in keepingtheir issue before the public.''   Others who try to serve the area's down-and-out mistrust Williamsand SPAC.   ``They are a self-appointed group serving themselves. As far ashomelessness and needing of assistance, they are phonies,'' saidMarion Morris, director of Helping Our Brothers Out, or HOBO.   HOBO provides transitional housing for homeless people and workswith other human service agencies to get help the needy.   ``I personally don't feel these people (SPAC members) should comeunder the heading of the homeless,'' Morris said. ``They should comeunder the heading of chemical abusers.   ``A lot of these guys have been on the street most of theirlives. They would like to use the government services to sustainthem while they go about taking care of their drug habits,'' he said.   Williams concedes some SPAC members have drug and alcoholproblems, but he said Morris misses his group's point.   ``We're strictly a high pressure advocacy group. We're anon-providing group; we're a referral agency'' Williams said.   SPAC has only five people on its council, but 20 to 30 peoplecheck in daily at its offices, said Carl Riley, sergeant-at-arms andexecutive administrator.   ``HOBO has a low outlook on street people and we don't,''Williams said. ``I don't practice telling someone how to run theirlife. We don't push re-hab on them, we don't push religion. We tryto get people into some type of housing with dignity.''   Housing is the critical issue. ``If a person has an address and atelephone then they can get employment,'' said Williams, originallyfrom Los Angeles but who has lived in Austin for the past 15 months.``And then the next thing would be health care services.''   Williams, Page and a man named Joe who refused to give his lastname live in the floating three-plex.   Knight said the structure on Town Lake probably violates a cityordinance, but added, ``We're somewhat reasonable about giving thesepeople a way to advertise.''   To circumvent the ordinance, the three men have purchased afishing license and keep several lines in the water.   Although short on dignity, the huts have many comforts.   Page and Williams built shelves inside their units. They haveheaters, sleeping bags, camping stoves, lanterns, radios and an icechest full of food. They also have a car battery rigged up to powera light at night. Williams has a rowboat to ferry people andsupplies from shore. All the materials to construct the boats havebeen donated.   And as a symbol, the boats have served well, Page said.   ``That's what they're meant to be, eyesores. People ask us, whatis this for? We tell them we are protesting about low-incomehousing. There's not enough of it.''</TEXT></DOC>
