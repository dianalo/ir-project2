For 15 years, concern about becoming bogged down in ``anotherVietnam'' has influenced U.S. leaders' decisions about intervention.   And President Bush's decision not to openly assist the attemptedcoup against Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega showed he wasnot prepared to risk U.S. lives and prestige in a militaryoperation that had neither clear public support nor a clear chanceof success.   Still, Bush's predecessor, President Reagan, armedanti-Communist guerrillas in Nicaragua and other nations whereleftist governments had come to power following the U.S. withdrawalfrom Southeast Asia.   While members of Congress have welcomed diminished Bushadministration support for Nicaraguan guerrillas, the confused U.S.response in Panama brought calls from Capitol Hill _ from bothDemocrats and Republicans _ for Bush to be bolder.   ``Failure is the father of about 100 hawks on Capitol Hill now.Suddenly, everyone is fluttering around the Senate and the House,saying, `let's use military force,''' said Sen. William Cohen,R-Maine, a Bush supporter.   ``I find it ironic that many of the same people who have imposedsome restrictions on the administration by deed or word, suddenlynow want to use American force,'' Cohen said on the ABC-TV program,``This Week with David Brinkley.''   ``I think it is an opportunity for all of us to finally lay itout: Do the American people by virtue of the Congress, reallysupport the use of force to take out Noriega either overtly orcovertly? We've got to know that,'' said Cohen, the vice chairmanof the Senate Intelligence Committee.   Another Republican, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., however,called the administration's handling of the coup ``an incrediblestain on us'' and said White House statements were a ``weak-kneedexplanation for failure.''   And Democratic Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma, chairman of theIntelligence Committee, said, ``I don't think it's right for thiscountry, for a great country, to go out and encourage people totake action, put their lives on the line, to imply by encouragingthem to take that action that we're going to help them, and not bethere.''   A poll released by Newsweek magazine over the weekend showedsupport for Bush's approach. While 60 percent of those polledthought it ``very important ... to the United States that GeneralNoriega give up power in Panama,'' 45 percent said U.S. involvementwas ``just about right.'' Thirty percent said America played ``notenough'' of a role in the coup attempt and 9 percent said ``toomuch.''   The poll of 750 people, conducted last Thursday and Friday, hada 4 percent margin of error.   The issue is broader than whether the United States should useforce against Noriega, say administration officials as well aslawmakers who criticized Bush.   Should the United States intervene militarily in other nationsafter the Kremlin withdrew its army from Afghanistan and signaledthat it would not block democratic moves under way in such Sovietbloc countries as Poland or Hungary?   Or, as formulated by one of Bush's most outspoken critics, Sen.Sam Nunn, D-Ga., what would U.S. allies think if the administrationhad used troops from American military bases in Panama to toppleNoriega?   ``International considerations come into play here. We can'thave ... tunnel vision on Panama,'' said Nunn, the chairman of theSenate Armed Services Committee.   ``We cannot ignore the repercussions,'' of using a U.S. base foraiding or launching a coup, said Nunn, referring to lease renewalnegotiations for two key American military installations in thePhilippines.   ``What we do in countries where we have bases has a directbearing'' on such negotiations, Nunn said last week.   The disclosure on Sunday that Bush aides had been laying plansfor covert action to grab Noriega during the coup clouded the U.S.position.   The administration, said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, ``hasnot ruled out the use of military force'' against Noriega.   But U.S. involvement in a coup against Noriega would set offalarm bells all over Latin America, including among American alliesin the war on drugs, Cheney said on the CBS-TV program, ``Face theNation.''   ``If you are actively involved and using U.S. military force totopple governments of Latin America, you're going to have a lot oftrouble getting the Colombians and Peruvians and Bolivians andothers to agree to have military training teams, for example,''said Cheney.   ``The way that you use the military effectively in Latin Americais to help the Latin Americans help themselves, not use U.S.military forces to topple Latin American governments.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Bryan Brumley covers national security affairsfrom Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
