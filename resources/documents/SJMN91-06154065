President Bush wants to allow China to retain itspresent access to American markets but proposes strict limits on high-techexports to China. Many members of Congress, led by Senate Democratic leaderGeorge Mitchell, want to shut it out of American markets altogether.;    Ahighly moral debate. But just ask yourself: What is so exceptional aboutChina? Until last August, Iraq enjoyed most-favored-nation status, allowing itto sell goods to the United States with low tariffs. The United States,France, Britain, Germany and a whole list of other countries sold it arms andhigh technology.;    What about Israel, which is in violation of a wholeseries of U.N. resolutions, and denies 2 million Palestinians their humanrights? What about half the countries in Africa, starting with America'sfriends Zaire and Morocco, which have deplorable records on human rights, or adozen countries, starting, again, with the United States, which make a goodliving out of the international arms trade?;    So what's so special aboutChina? What's so special about the United States? Bush told Yale university onMonday: &quot;Some argue that a nation as moral and just as ours should not taintitself by dealing with nations less moral, less just.&quot;;    The rule injournalism and politics is avoid irony at all costs: people never recognize it-- and I confess I don't know whether Bush was being ironic when he describedthe United States as particularly moral and just. I'm afraid he wasn't.;   But he did go on to say &quot;this counsel offers up self-righteousness draped infalse modesty,&quot; so perhaps he admits in his heart that the United States hasits share of imperfections. Certainly, its policy toward Iraq before lastAugust proves the point.;    China is not exceptionally evil. Indeed, thereare plenty of countries in the world that have more detestable regimes(witness the overthrow of one of them in Ethiopia), and plenty of others whoseforeign policy is far more dangerous.;    Last week Bush also announced apolicy to control arms sales to the Middle East -- but it lacks stiffrestrictions on the sale of weapons to both Israel and Saudi Arabia. Chalkanother one up to the merchants of death.;    There's no doubt that Chinaplays a destabilizing role by selling missiles to Syria and Pakistan, and anuclear reactor to Algeria. However, there is less, much less, to this thanmeets the eye. It has to be asked where these three countries get the money topay for these weapons: They are all basket cases, and the way to controlSyria, which has lost its Soviet sponsor, is to cut it off from foreign aid.;   The real issue, and the one that Congress is going to debate, is whether theUnited States should trade with a country that sent the tanks into TiananmenSquare to suppress a democratic demonstration.;    Bush says yes, and advancesa coherent case. He says that the real question is which policy would have thebest chance of forcing democratic change, trade or sanctions.;    Now it'strue that sanctions seldom work. If the United States closes its doors toChina, it will hurt the Chinese economy but will not destroy it. It will alsoplease sections of American industry and labor unions, which resent cheapChinese imports, and will please South Korea, Taiwan, and other countries inEast Asia, which want the market, too.;    So does Bush or Mitchell have thebetter in the debate? Bush's most telling point is that for 20 years after theChinese revolution in 1949 the United States led the boycott against it -- andthose were the darkest days in China's modern history. The policy was definedand implemented by a series of Republican politicians (Eisenhower, John FosterDulles, Joe McCarthy) and it is, as ever, ironic to hear their heir repudiatewhat they so fervently believed.;    It is also ironic to hear the senioractive member of the Democratic Party now advocating policies once ferventlyupheld by those rabid Republicans, while the country's top Republican, likeRichard Nixon before him, wants to stay on the best of terms with the men whosent in the tanks.;    Perhaps the course of wisdom would be for both sides toclimb down from their high horses and admit that the United States cannotdictate to the world, certainly not to a country as big as China, andconcentrate instead on something the United States can really influence --like the arms trade in the Middle East.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PATRICK BROGAN  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910602  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  856  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday June 2, 199100154065,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
