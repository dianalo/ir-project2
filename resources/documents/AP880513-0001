(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Retired Gen. Richard Secord,accused of working as a middleman in the Iran-Contra affair, saidThursday he neither expects nor wants a pardon from PresidentReagan _ because one isn't necessary.   ``I didn't break any laws, so why would there be any pardon?''he told The Palm Beach Post before addressing the Young Republicansof the Palm Beaches.   ``I think we did the right thing. I'm not embarrassed about whatwe did, how we did it,'' Secord said. ``I think we will prevail.''   Secord and Iranian-born businessman Albert Hakim are accused ofhelping set up the arms-for-hostages deal that prosecutors said wasorchestrated by former White House aides Oliver North and JohnPoindexter.   The four were indicted in March on charges of conspiring todivert profits from the arms sales to Nicaragua's Contras at a timewhen most aid to the rebels was prohibited.</TEXT></DOC>
