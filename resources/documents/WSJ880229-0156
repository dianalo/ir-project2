Simon </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST </CO><TEXT>   Beijing's announcement this month that it will use stricter means to implement its &quot;one-couple-one-child&quot; policy -- including punishments for party cadres and individual families who don't fall in with national goals -- has once again put its population program in the headlines.    Planned Parenthood and the rest of the population establishment assert that the Chinese program is voluntary. They should think again. To the Chinese, the word &quot;voluntary&quot; includes pressuring someone until she or he agrees to use contraception or abortion. In the U.S. we call that arm-twisting.    This is supported by official Chinese sources. Indeed, although Chinese authorities repudiate particular events -- such as coerced seven-month abortions -- as unrepresentative excesses, the presence of government coercion in Chinese family affairs cannot be denied. Consider, for example, the &quot;Eight Steps&quot; of the family planning program in Hengdong County of Hunan province, as described in a Peking University professional journal:   &quot;The 'eight visits' are paid constantly and regularly. . . .    &quot;1. The visit is paid to youths at marriageable age for heart-to-heart talks persuading them of late marriage. . . .    &quot;2. The visit is paid to newlyweds who are greeted with congratulations and who are mobilized for late childbearing . . . visited by cadres . . . to know their life after marriage, to introduce the knowledge about contraception, to examine their contraceptive measures and to persuade their practice of late childbearing. . . .    &quot;3. The visit is made to single child families to mobilize the couples to get single child certificates. There is a specialized processor called Yand Renjun who was reluctant to pledge to have a single child after having a daughter and thus his wife had an unplanned pregnancy in 1984. Yand's case was talked about among the local people. Learning the story, deputy township party secretary Guo Shangchi paid a visit to Yand and made heart-to-heart talks with him. Like Yand, Guo had also an only daughter, but he not only pledged to have a single child, but also underwent sterilization. Immediately after the talks, Yand Renjun said, 'Though I become well-off now, I should do what the Party calls for. I am ready to get the single child certificate.' Moreover, he accompanied his wife, on that very afternoon, to the hospital for the surgical operation. . . .&quot;    Visit four is made to persuade married women &quot;by thorough and painstaking ideological work,&quot; of birth control. Visits five and six are made after sterilization to one-child families.    Visit seven &quot;is paid to the employees who are on home leave for family reunion, and they are reminded of contraception.&quot; And visit eight is to &quot;old folks to show care-taking for them. . . .&quot;    Then there is the report of activities as of 1981 in another country, Rongcheng in Shandong:   &quot;A few years ago, we were rather prone to launch several crash drives in doing family planning work each year, encouraging induced abortion at every riptide. Although some successes were achieved . . . the neglect of day-to-day work had . . . disadvantages . . . . As the tasks came crashing down in all haste, slackness in ideological work might lead to harsh penalties and coercion, causing unnecessary reluctance on the part of the masses.&quot;    The new policies were then described:   &quot;In our county there are 171 family planning center leaders, more than 1,100 full-time cadres working in the production brigades and 3,838 family planning leaders in the production teams. . . .    &quot;The communes make X-ray checks once every three months of the women using contraceptive devices. . . .&quot;    The striking results of the program are then proudly stated:   &quot;1. We have improved the work and met the targets set in the plan. . . . A total of 5,472 newborns were registered in the first half of this year, of whom 5,233 are first births, 38 and 200 second births conforming to and outside of plan respectively and only one third birth. . . .    &quot;2. The rate of induced abortion has dropped -- thanks to contraceptive measures. All the 110,000 married women of childbearing age in the county have come to know the significance of birth control and the contraceptive measures, resulting in a higher rate of contraception. In the first half of 1982, the abortion rate {fell} compared with the same period of 1981. Late-stage abortions in 1981 compared with 1980 recorded a drop of 8.9%, and it further dropped by 10.3% in the first half of 1982.    &quot;3. The idea of having one child has struck a deeper root and less people are punished for violating the birth control plan. . . . In 1981, 3.7% of the new babies were born outside the plan and the parents were duly punished.&quot;    The difference between American and Chinese notions of what is voluntary stems from different views about the proper role of government in people's management of their own lives. The Chinese family-planning theorists make much of the comments of Marx concerning the &quot;production&quot; of human beings. A member of China's Family Planning Commission interprets Marx as follows:   &quot;{S}ocial production is composed of material production and human reproduction. . . . The socialist system in China {emphasizes both} material production and human reproduction, and {must} regulate population growth in a planned way, as we regulate material production following plans.&quot;    Thus the Chinese have complained about U.S. value judgments about their program. Xu Dixin, the chairman of the China Population Society, wrote:   &quot;Recently some Americans advertised that since population would automatically decrease with the development of free economy, there was no need to 'limit births.' . . . They have proposed undisguisedly that China's population problem can be settled only by changing her social system and practicing 'free economy.' Such arguments made by some Americans are presumptuous to interfere politically in China's internal affairs and to sabotage her socialist system.&quot;    Refraining from comment, however, does not imply that one should help. Nations have no obligation to fund programs of which they do not approve. Even the touchy Chinese must agree that this is not &quot;internal interference.&quot;    In this regard the world could follow the U.S. lead in shifting money away from organizations, such as the United Nations' Fund for Population Activities, found to support or participate in coercive programs. Countries that want to use their population funds to further China's development would do well to train more Chinese demographers in the West. Perhaps this might include giving them a firsthand look at Asia's own models of development under freedom, notably Hong Kong and Taiwan. What could be simpler, purer of heart, possibly doing some good and certainly avoiding harm?    ---   Mr. Simon, who visited China in June, teaches business administration at the University of Maryland and is an adjunct scholar at the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute. </TEXT></DOC>
