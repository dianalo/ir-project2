The Department stated that the suspension agreement reachedwith Industria Nacional de Cementos, S.A., (``INCSA'') and the Departmentmet the criteria of sections 704(b) and (d) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``theTariff Act''). We received no request to continue the investigation.In March 1986, Cementos del Pacifico, S.A. (``CPSA''), also a Costa Ricanproducer of portland hydraulic cement, began exporting the subject merchandiseto the United States.On December 29, 1986, the petitioners, the Puerto Rican Cement Co., Inc.,and the San Juan Cement Co., Inc., requested in accordance with andSection;355.10of the Commerce Regulations an administrative review of this suspensionagreement. We published the initiation on January 20, 1987 (52 FR 2123).The Department has now conducted that review in accordance with section751 of the Tariff Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Review</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. We willbe providing both the appropriate Tariff Schedules of the United StatesAnnotated (``TSUSA'') item numbers and the appropriate Harmonized TariffSchedule (``HTS'') item numbers with our product descriptions. As withthe TSUSA, the HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customspurposes. The written description remains dispositive.We are requesting petitioners to include the appropriate HTS item number(s)as well as the TSUSA item number(s) in all new petitions filed with theDepartment. A reference copy of the proposed Harmonized Tariff Scheduleis available for consultation at the Central Records Unit, Room B-099,U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington,DC 20230. Additionally, all Customs offices have reference copies, andpetitioners may contact the Import Specialist at their local Customs officeto consult the schedule.Imports covered by this review are shipments of Costa Rican portland hydrauliccement. Such merchandise is currently classifiable under TSUSA item number511.1440 and under HTS item number 2523.29.00. We invite comments fromall interested parties on this HTS classification.The review covers the period October 1, 1985 through September 30, 1986and two firms, INCSA and CPSA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Compliance With the Agreement</ITAG>In the suspension agreement, INCSA renounced all existing bounties or grantswhich would benefit exports of portland hydraulic cement to the UnitedStates, and agreed not to apply for or receive substitute or equivalentbenefits. In accordance with section 704(b) of the Tariff Act and andSection;355.31(c)of the Commerce Regulations, the suspension of the investigation can remainin effect only so long as 85 percent of imports of the subject merchandiseinto the United States are covered by the suspension agreement. INCSA didnot export the subject merchandise to the United States during the periodof review and, accordingly, did not account for the mandated 85 percentof U.S. imports of portland hydraulic cement from Costa Rica during theperiod.A second firm, CPSA, also a Costa Rican producer of portland hydrauliccement, accounted for 100 percent of U.S. imports of portland hydrauliccement from Costa Rica during the review period. In its questionnaire response,CPSA stated that it had not been aware of the suspension agreement in effectrespecting this merchandise and indicated that it would not export thesubject merchandise to the United States in the future. However, CPSA chosenot to enter into a suspension agreement with the Department.<ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Results of Review</ITAG>As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine that the suspensionagreement no longer meets the requirements of sections 704 (b) and (d)of the Tariff Act. We therefore tentatively determine to cancel the suspensionagreement. Section 704(b) of the Tariff Act requires that manufacturersaccounting for ``substantially all'' U.S. imports of merchandise subjectof a suspended investigation be signatories to an agreement to eliminateor offset completely the total amount of any bounty or grant determinedto exist. Section 355.31(c) of the Commerce Regulations defines ``substantiallyall'' as 85 percent of total U.S. imports.If the Department determines as a result of this review that the suspensionagreement should be cancelled, we will resume the investigation as if theaffirmative preliminary determination had been published on the date ofpublication of the final results, and will instruct the Customs Serviceto suspend liquidation on all shipments of portland hydraulic cement exporteddirectly or indirectly to the United States from Costa Rica and entered,or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the 90th day priorto publication of the notice of suspension of liquidation (<T3>i.e., </T3>the notice of cancellation of suspension agreement). TheDepartment will also instruct the Customs Service, in accordance with section703 of the Tariff Act, to require a cash deposit or bond for each suchentry of the merchandise in the amount of 15 percent <T3>ad valorem, </T3>the rate found in our preliminary affirmative countervailingduty determination.Interested parties may submit written comments on these preliminary resultswithin 30 days of the date of publication of this notice and may requestdisclosure and/or a hearing within 10 days of the date of publication.Any hearing, if requested, will be held 30 days from the date of publicationor the first workday thereafter. Any request for an administrative protectiveorder must be made no later than five days after the date of publication.The Department will publish the final results of this administrative reviewincluding the results of its analysis of issues raised in any such writtencomments or at a hearing.This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 355.10.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: December 30, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jan W.
