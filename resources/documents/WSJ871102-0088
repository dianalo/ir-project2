The new system is intended to reduce disparities in sentencing for similar crimes and to provide greater likelihood of imprisonment for some crimes, particularly a variety of white-collar offenses.    Drafted by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a creation of Congress, the system provides judges with a range of sentences to follow on a mathematical grid, considering some variables such as whether a weapon was used or the amount of money involved. Judges who depart from the guidelines must give written reasons, subject to appeal by either the prosecution or the defense. Parole will be phased out and probation used far less often.    But the system is plagued by uncertainty for a number of reasons.    By law, the sentencing system took effect yesterday. Justice Department officials say that means the new sentences apply only to crimes committed beginning yesterday, but not to crimes committed earlier that are still awaiting sentencing. But the law creating the new system doesn't say it applies only to crimes committed after Nov. 1, and Congress failed to clarify the point before the system took effect.    Some judges say the system is just too complex and that there hasn't been enough time for training judges and lawyers. At one recent training session for judges in New England, one federal district judge says, &quot;There were a lot of eyes rolling up to the ceiling and people saying this is going to be complicated.&quot;    The authors of the new guidelines deny that the system is too complex. &quot;I believe we can teach this to federal judges in two hours,&quot; Stephen Breyer, a federal appeals court judge in Boston and a member of the Sentencing Commission, told a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.    Those supporting the guidelines -- including an odd coalition of Sens. Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.), Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) and Joseph Biden (D., Del.) and Attorney General Edwin Meese -- say any period of delay would just be used by opponents to try to kill the new system.    Another point of uncertainty is whether the guidelines are constitutional. Questions have been raised about whether the makeup of the commission -- federal judges, private persons, and one federal official -- violates the Constitution's separation of powers.    Challenges to the constitutionality are likely to be filed quickly by defense lawyers in criminal cases, and civil lawsuits may follow as well. &quot;There will be lots of litigation and lots of uncertainty,&quot; says Alan Morrison of the consumer-oriented Public Citizen Litigation Group, who has been involved in a number of major separation-of-powers lawsuits.    Because of both the constitutional issue and the starting-date question, representatives of the federal judiciary urged Congress to postpone the effective date. But the House rejected a delay, and the Senate never voted on it, although Sens. Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.) Arlen Specter (R., Pa.) and Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.) said at a Judiciary Committee hearing that they would support a delay.    Meanwhile, a highly volatile issue, on which the Sentencing Commission deferred action last spring for fear that it would lead Congress to block the whole system, has been raised once again. At a recent commission meeting, discussion was renewed on whether the commission should add the death penalty to the list of sentences for a few federal crimes, such as treason and espionage. The Reagan administration has urged that the death penalty be included, and commission members made clear that the issue will be raised again soon, now that the guidelines for other sentences have taken effect. </TEXT></DOC>
