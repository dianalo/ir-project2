The high court, on a 7-2 vote, declared that guards acting&quot;maliciously and sadistically to cause harm&quot; violate theEighth Amendment ban against &quot;cruel and unusual punishments.&quot;But the court said that excessive force &quot;applied in a goodfaith effort to maintain or restore discipline&quot; isn'tunconstitutional.</LP><TEXT>   The decision was significant in that a comfortablemajority, including five conservatives, ruled in favor of aninmate's complaint about prison conditions. The Rehnquistcourt so far has been notably unsympathetic to constitutionalchallenges by inmates.   &quot;We are very pleased to learn that the Supreme Court stillbelieves in respecting human decency,&quot; said Alvin Bronsteinof the American Civil Liberties Union, who represented theinmate in the case. Mr. Bronstein said that he was&quot;especially pleased&quot; that Chief Justice William Rehnquist aswell as Justices Byron White, Sandra O'Connor, AnthonyKennedy and David Souter -- all generally thought to take adim view of prisoners' rights -- formed a majority with moreliberal Justices Harry Blackmun and John Stevens.   Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion and, inwhat appears to be a blossoming alliance, Justice AntoninScalia joined him. Accusing the majority of distortinghistory, the Constitution and past court decisions, thedissenters said a beating that doesn't cause &quot;significantharm&quot; doesn't amount to &quot;cruel and unusual&quot; punishment.   The subject of the decision was Keith Hudson, an inmate inthe state prison in Angola, La. After an argument with aguard, he was placed in chains and beaten. One guard punchedhim in the face, chest and stomach; another held him in placeand kicked him from behind. A supervisor watched, accordingto Mr. Hudson, but merely told the attackers not to &quot;have toomuch fun.&quot; The beating caused bruises and swelling of theface, loosened Mr. Hudson's teeth and cracked his dentalplate.   Mr. Hudson sued the two guards and their supervisor. Amagistrate ruled that the guards used unnecessary force andthat the supervisor condoned the misconduct. The magistrateawarded Mr. Hudson $800 in damages. The federal appeals courtin New Orleans reversed that decision, ruling that therehadn't been cruel and unusual punishment because Mr. Hudson'sinjuries were &quot;minor&quot; and required no medical attention.   The Supreme Court, in an opinion written by JusticeO'Connor, reversed the appeals court's decision. The highcourt reinstated Mr. Hudson's victory.   Justice O'Connor stressed that judges generally shouldgive prison officials &quot;wide-ranging deference&quot; in using forceto impose discipline. She borrowed the key languagedescribing what the officials may not do -- namely, harminmates &quot;maliciously or sadistically&quot; -- from a 1986 SupremeCourt case involving a prison riot. Thus the high court, ineffect, extended that narrow ban to prison situations wherethere isn't a disturbance that threatens overall security.   In separate opinions, Justices Blackmun and Stevens agreedwith the majority's conclusion, but they criticized thesubtle extension of the malicious-and-sadistic rule tocircumstances other than a prison riot. Justice Stevensasserted that when there isn't a large-scale threat tosafety, prison officials should be restrained by a broaderban against the &quot;unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,&quot;which the court enunciated in a 1976 decision.   Justice Thomas, in dissent, echoed themes familiar fromrecent opinions of Justice Scalia, who urges an extremelynarrow view of constitutional protections. For example,Justice Thomas said that as a matter of history, theconstitutional ban on &quot;cruel and unusual punishments&quot; wasmeant to apply &quot;only to torturous punishments meted out bystatutes or sentencing judges, and not generally to anyhardship that might befall a prisoner during incarceration.&quot;(Hudson vs. McMillian)</TEXT></DOC>
