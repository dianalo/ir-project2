ATandamp;T is the most widely held stock in the nation at 2.6 millionshareholders, a legacy of the days before 1984 when it was theworld's largest company. Its status as a regulated monopoly made ita conservative investment, known as the ``widows and orphans stock.''   The 1984 breakup left ATandamp;T smaller and more exposed tocompetition, but the survey seems to indicate that shareholders havenot fully caught up with the 5-year-old change.   The survey showed that shareholders still place a high priorityon dividends, which have been stuck at $1.20 a year since thebreakup. The new ATandamp;T has been reinvesting profits for future growthinstead of distributing them as higher dividends.   ATandamp;T's survey of 1,712 shareholders, the first since 1983, wasprovided to The Associated Press for publication Monday. The surveyexcluded current employees, who account for about 5 percent of thedirect shareowners.   Among the findings of the survey, which was conducted in May andJune:   _Seventy percent of shareholders are 50 or older, 37 percent are65 are older, and 46 percent are retired.   _The percentage of shareholders who are younger than 50 is upsharply, to 28 percent in 1989 from 15 percent in 1983.   _Shareholders still rate security of the investment as their topreason for owning ATandamp;T stock, as they did in 1983. But growthpotential has moved up into second place, edging out dividend incomeas a priority for shareholders. Also, more shareholders cited profitopportunities than did so in 1983.   _Seventy-six percent of shareholders bought their shares beforethe 1984 breakup, and 40 percent bought their initial stock whenthey were employees of ATandamp;T or the old Bell System.   In the 1984 breakup of the Bell System, ATandamp;T shareholdersreceived shares in the new ATandamp;T as well as in each of the sevenregional companies that provide local phone service: Nynex Corp.,Bell Atlantic Corp., BellSouth Corp., Pacific Telesis Group, U SWest Inc., Southwestern Bell Corp. and Ameritech.   The new ATandamp;T provides long-distance service and sellscommunications equipment and computers. It doesn't provide localphone service.</TEXT></DOC>
