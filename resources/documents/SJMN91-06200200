PETE WILSONBUDGET: WHO WON, WHO LOST  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See also related article on page 1E of this section.;   Chart attached to theend of this article.;  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 7/19/91, pg. 4B); Because of a reporter's error, a chart in Thursday's edition's incorrectlylisted the additional state income tax owed by a couple with $500,000 intaxable income. The extra tax would be $3,100.  </MEMO><TEXT>  (box)Enacted: The governor got the cost-of-living freeze but only half thewelfare cuts. The homeless assistance program survived, though deeply cut.Homeless families will receive vouchers instead of cash, good for only 16 daysinstead of 28, and be ineligible for more assistance for two years rather thanone. To help make up for forcing counties to pay a greater share of services,the state will increase its AFDC burden by $253 million.; (box)Winners: Anyprogram not cut as deeply as feared.; (box)Losers: Poor families -- mostly thechildren of recently divorced or abandoned women. Benefits haven't increasedto account for inflation since 1988 and won't change until 1997. A mother withtwo children will get $663 a month, down from $694. In Santa Clara County,nearly 74,000 people -- 50,000 children -- live on AFDC. Nearly 42,000families live on AFDC in Santa Cruz, San Mateo and Alameda counties. Familieswill lose a total of nearly $1 billion due to lost federal and county matchingfunds.; Transit; (box)Proposed: While voters approved $3 billion in railprojects over a three-year period in 1990, the deficit threatened transitprograms. Wilson suggested only issuing about $585 million in bonds this year-- possibly delaying the Tasman light-rail line, BART extensions in Alamedaand Contra Costa counties and the purchase of the CalTrain right-of-way.Wilson also wanted the state highway fund, not the general fund, to pay thedebt on the bonds, further eroding money for rail projects.; (box)Enacted:Wilson restored the 1991-'92 bonds to their original $1.3 billion level, whichmeans all the rail projects will remain on schedule. And general fund money,not highway fund money, would be used for the pay for the interest on thebonds.; (box)Winners: CalTrain. It now has a better chance of getting the $173million in bond money it needs to buy and upgrade the right-of-way.;(box)Losers: None.; Public schools; (box)Proposed: Spending $16.3 billion onK-12, 5 percent more than last year. But most of that will merely accommodatethe 112,000 new students expected this year.; (box)Enacted: Schools got $17.6billion -- but only on paper. Some $1.2 billion in Prop. 98 money was actuallyspent last year but placed on 1991-'92 books. The real increase is about $422million, which will cover new students and save state projects to payexemplary teachers for extra work and begin reducing class sizes.;(box)Winners: Prop. 98 was saved in principle, protecting the concept forfuture years. Schools also picked up about $80 per student in reduced expensesfor property tax collections and retirement contributions.; (box)Losers: Withinflation growing faster than budgets, many schools still plan program cutsand layoffs.; Environment; (box)Proposed: More money for California CoastalCommission to beef up enforcement staff and reopen Eureka office closed by '84budget cuts, plus $42 million for local flood-control projects. Wilson wantedless spent on hazardous-waste cleanup despite end of $100 million bond fundfrom 1984.; (box)Enacted: Coastal Commission received a bit more -- $9.9million, up from $9.7 million but $200,000 less than budgeted. Flood controlprograms got only $29.75 million. Wilson also created California EnvironmentalProtection Agency from hodgepodge of existing state environmental agencies(Air Resources Board, Water Quality Control Board, Integrated Waste ManagementBoard, Department of Health Services hazardous-waste programs, and Departmentof Food and Agriculture pesticide programs); funding comes from their existingbudgets.; (box)Winners: Everyone. After the Deukmejian years -- whenenvironmental agencies first had their budgets whacked -- few are willing tocomplain about Wilson's budget. &quot;The support the governor's given this agencymakes it easier to get rid of the bad taste Deukmejian left in our mouths,&quot;said California Coastal Commission spokesman Jack Liebster.; (box)Losers:Nobody.; Higher education; (box)Proposed: Higher fees everywhere: 40 percentat the University of California, 20 percent percent in the California StateUniversity system, 20 percent in community colleges. Even with the increases,UC and CSU would take budget cuts while the community colleges would only geta negligible increase.; (box)Enacted: Just what the governor ordered: higherfees, slightly lower budgets for UC and CSU, and a 1 percent increase for thecommunity colleges.; (box)Winners: Community colleges, since their budgetsweren't cut.; (box)Losers: Students. Not just higher fees -- an average of$2,270 per year at UC, plus miscellaneous campus charges -- but tight budgetswill mean fewer classes. CSU fees will rise to $936 a year. Community collegesfees will increase up to $60 a semester, and campuses will be crowded asstudents are frozen out of the four-year colleges.; Health; (box)Proposed: A$90 million state-subsidized private insurance policy covering poor women'smedical care from pregnancy through the child's first birthday. Also $10million for family planning aimed at avoiding pregnancies among teen-agers anddrug users, and $25 million for drug and alcohol treatment for mothers. Wilsonalso wanted doctors to collect 50 cents to $3 from each Medi-Cal patient tosave the state $20 million, and he wanted to more than $1 billion bytransferring mental health, public health and medically indigent services tothe counties.; (box)Enacted: Wilson got most of what he wanted. Biggestexception: Prenatal care program was given $45 million for the first year,half what was sought, but it will include children until age 2 and themother's other children. The small fees were defeated -- but Medi-Cal's budgetstill was cut by $14 million.; (box)Winners: Clients of the new programs:women seeking contraception, abortions, drug rehabilitation and prenatalcare.; (box)Losers: Proponents of anti-smoking and health education programs,who lost about $25 million from the cigarette tax. The money went instead tothe new prenatal care program. Health programs in counties where thesupervisors decide not to spend as much as the state did on mental health,public health and indigent care will also lose. Santa Clara County alreadyplans cuts in its health department.; Prisons; (box)Proposed: Wilson asked for$2.61 billion for the Department of Corrections, 12.9 percent more thanprevious year.; (box)Enacted: $2.5 billion. Wilson, arguing that the cuts aretoo severe, has asked legislators to restore $94 million -- upping total to12.1 percent.; (box)Winners: Get-tough-on-crime advocates, who have helpedturn prisons into one of the few growth industries in recessionary California.This year's budget hikes are driven primarily by the continuing huge jumps inthe state's prison population -- the result of stiffer sentencing laws passedduring the past decade. The number of inmates is expected to exceed 114,000 bynext July, compared with 103,000 now. The number of prison employees isexpected to jump to 32,000 from 28,500.; (box)Losers: Supporters of&quot;alternative sentencing&quot; programs (house arrests, community service, etc.) fornon-violent offenders. Despite the fact that prison budgets have been growingat twice the rate of education and health-and-welfare budgets, prison reformadvocates note, California's prison system, now at 175 percent of designcapacity, is expected to hit 230 percent capacity by 1996.; How families willfare; Tax increases and welfare cuts combine to hurt poor families more thanwealthy ones.; ...; Single mother, two children; Living on welfare, she rentsan apartment, drives a subcompact car she purchased eight years ago for$6,000, drinks one six- pack of beer a week, spends $250 a year on snack foodsand candy and $72 a year on reading material.;  Sales tax; $64 general, plus$4 for newspapers and periodicals; Alcohol; $3(*); Auto; license; $19;Welfare; Monthly $694 payment is cut $31, and scheduled $38 increase iscanceled.; Annual loss: $828.; Total loss; $918; 10% of income; ...; Middle-;income family; With $50,000 in taxable income, this family drives a 3-year-oldstation wagon bought for $15,000 and a subcompact purchased eight years agofor $6,000.
