The compromise starts with a so-called narrow bill thatthe House Banking Committee adopted last week to rebuild thebank deposit insurance fund and tighten bank regulation. Itadds new Federal Reserve Board powers to regulate foreignbanks, some limits on deposit insurance, and a provision thatwould allow banks to branch nationwide. The nationwidebranching provision includes measures that would limit bankexpansion into insurance and real estate.</LP><TEXT>   But the compromise doesn't include provisions that wouldchange current bank authority to sell or deal in securities.This is a defeat for the securities industry, which, alongwith the insurance and real estate industries, had hoped toachieve new protections from banking competition.   But banking industry representatives said they oppose thecompromise because of the provisions that would roll backcurrent powers banks have to sell insurance and limitpossible future expansion into real estate. And Rep. JohnDingell (D., Mich.) predicted that as many as 120 lawmakers-- both Democrats and Republicans -- would oppose the billbecause it doesn't tighten regulation of bank powers to dealin securities. Other lawmakers are likely to oppose the billbecause they don't want to vote for any legislation thatlooks like a bailout for banks.   The compromise is the latest attempt to piece together abill that contains enough elements to build support for $70billion in new borrowing authority for the Federal DepositInsurance Corp., which is about to run out of money becauseof the high rate of bank failures.   The administration worked hard to kill a broad bankingbill last week, largely because it frustrated Treasuryproposals to allow banks to expand into the securities andinsurance businesses. Although the latest version of theunpopular legislation contains elements the Treasury opposes,the administration is asking Republicans to support the billbecause it includes a provision that would allow banks tobranch nationwide.   Branching would save the banking industry billions ofdollars annually by allowing BankAmerica Corp., Citicorp,NCNB Corp. and other multistate banking organizations toconsolidate their operations into unified branch systems.   The price of getting the branching provision, which wouldallow nationwide branching in three years unless a statevotes to opt out of the plan, was a compromise with thepolitically powerful Independent Insurance Agents of America.Thus, the branching provision would deprive banks of twoinsurance powers -- the authority of national banks to sellinsurance nationwide from small towns and the ability tounderwrite and sell insurance nationwide out of affiliates inDelaware.   In addition, the compromise appeases another powerfulinterest group, the real estate industry, by barring the Fedfrom allowing bank holding companies to expand further intoreal estate. The Fed has allowed bank affiliates to set upcommunity development corporations, provide real estateinvestment advisory services and to lease real estateproperty. But it has turned down requests to allow banks intothe real estate brokerage and development business.   But the leadership left out a request from Rep. Dingell toblock the Fed from granting bank affiliates any new powers tosell securities. Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. and Goldman, Sachs andamp;Co. had pushed the idea, but the administration and thebanking committee strongly opposed the proposal.</TEXT></DOC>
