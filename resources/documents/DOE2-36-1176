They feelthe reason is that agriculture has been a proxy for other concerns aboutthe US food and fiber industry - e.g., energy-intensive agriculture raisesenvironmental concerns, is viewed as unsustainable, and is thought topromote large corporate farms. These important issues, they feel, shouldbe dealt with on the basis of human health and environment, not on thebasis of energy use. Further, they conclude that government initiativesthat affect agricultural production and commodity prices will have morebearing on energy use in agriculture than energy policies. 10 references,1 table.</TEXT></DOC>
