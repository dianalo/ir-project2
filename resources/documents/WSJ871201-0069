Unknown gunmen, many firing from speeding cars, killed or wounded some 100 people before the provisional military government canceled the vote. Americans tend to think of Haiti as just another desperately poor Third World country, but in important ways it is like no other country.    Haiti is the only nation in this hemisphere that came into being through a slave revolt. Many of the slaves practiced voodoo religions from west Africa; ritual poisons were used to kill hundreds of French colonists during the uprising. After the French left in 1804, the male voodoo priests, or houngans, ruled the countryside through the use of native poisons and secret religious societies.    It is clear that to this day much of Haiti is controlled by a voodoo theocracy called the Bizango. A few years ago, Harvard ethnobiologist Wade Davis penetrated this world in search of the potion used to create zombies. He found it, but he also uncovered the immense power wielded by the Bizango sorcerer-priests.    &quot;The {politicians} in Port-au-Prince must cooperate with us,&quot; one of the Bizango leaders told Mr. Davis. &quot;We were here before them, and if we didn't want them, they wouldn't be where they are. There are not many guns in the country, but those that there are, we have them.&quot;    The Duvalier dictatorship that ruled Haiti for 30 years made an alliance with the Bizango, which basically served as the regime's secret police. Mr. Davis reports: &quot;The leaders of the secret societies almost inevitably became powerful members of the Ton Ton Macoute.&quot; To this day, Haiti's army is riddled with members of the secret societies.    Despite all this, Haiti is not quite an economic basket case. In the past two years, under U.S.-educated Finance Minister Leslie Delatour, it has reduced tariffs to a maximum of 40%, lowered marginal tax rates from a high of 55% down to 30% (and that only on annual incomes above $700,000) and abolished price controls.    Some 600,000 Haitians out of a population of just over five million have fled to the United States. A great number have prospered here, and many would return to their homeland if they would not be barred from ever reentering the U.S. But if Haiti is to gain release from its powerful voodoo theocracy, it will need the skills and energy of many of its exiles. Mr. Delatour says the most important policy change the U.S. could make would be to liberalize its strict immigration quotas and allow Haitians to come to the U.S. to work for brief periods and then return with the capital and training they will have obtained. Washington should also eliminate its perverse quotas on textiles and sugar, products that used to provide Haitians with needed export earnings and jobs.    The U.S. played a key role in the downfall of Baby Doc Duvalier last year. Since then it has had to realize the limits of its influence in a country as anarchic as today's Haiti. A frustrated State Department suspended some foreign aid grants in response to Sunday's canceled election. But the present Haitian leaders are more helpless than complicit in the current cycle of violence. While they should be held to their promise to turn over the government to civilians in February, they now need continued U.S. support if they are going to prevail against the kind of sinister forces in Haiti that most Americans can only begin to comprehend. </TEXT></DOC>
