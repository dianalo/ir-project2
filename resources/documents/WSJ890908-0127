Seldom has there been so much to be gained from peaceful relations with Europe's West.    To begin with, Western Europe is in the process of trying to shape itself into Europe 1992, something much closer to a united Europe than the current community. It would seem to be wise to step up efforts to convince these Europeans that we have mutual interests. There surely is a fine opportunity to do just that in the current talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Part of the negotiation concerns agricultural trade, and even getting the subject on the table was a triumph of sorts. In previous years the topic has been swept under the rug.    A key problem is wheat. Between 1977 and 1985, the U.S. share of the world's net wheat exports fell to 29% from 42%. In 1977, the European Community was a net wheat importer, while in 1985 it accounted for 15% of net exports. The sharp change in Europe's position was brought about by official subsidies, which let European producers cut their prices in world markets.    This marvelous export gain was purchased largely at the expense of European consumers; internal EC wheat prices are far above U.S. market prices.    In 1985 the U.S. Agriculture Department decided to fight back with subsidies of its own. The department introduced something euphemistically called the Export Enhancement Program. One aim was to increase U.S. wheat exports, but another was to blackjack the EC into cutting its subsidies during the GATT talks.    The first aim would seem to have been achieved. In the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank Review, Cletus C. Coughlin and Kenneth C. Carraro note that U.S. wheat exports have risen sharply since 1985. The U.S. now has about the same share of world exports that it had in 1977. This success, however, was purchased at a substantial cost. The Export Enhancement Program gets rid of wheat that otherwise would be held by the government under domestic support programs. The St. Louis Fed economists note that a cheaper way to dispose of the government's surplus wheat simply would have been to destroy it.    When it comes to the program's second goal, persuading the EC to liberalize agricultural trade, the gains have been zilch or, in fact, less than zilch. The EC hangs on to its subsidy programs and seems more likely to escalate the trade war than to end it.    Even before the era of the Export Enhancement Program, both the U.S. and the EC had increased subsidies. In January 1983, the U.S. subsidized the sale of one million tons of wheat flour to Egypt to undercut subsidized offerings by the EC. To keep the EC from buying back the market, the U.S. forced Egypt to agree not to import wheat flour from any non-U.S. supplier until June 1984.    In the short run the U.S. displaced the EC sales of wheat flour to Egypt. But don't count the Europeans out. The EC subsidized the sale of 320,000 tons of unmilled wheat to Egypt in the spring of 1983 and later subsidized the sale of wheat to Iran, Syria, Libya and Algeria. The EC also began competing in China and Latin America.    It's easy to say that the current U.S. policy is a mistake. &quot;One of the major problems of the EEP is that mixed signals are being sent to the EC and other agricultural nations,&quot; the St. Louis Fed economists say. &quot;The U.S. proposals are a highly publicized initiative to stimulate a cooperative search to reform agriculture through GATT. At the same time, the retaliatory challenges to European-subsidized export sales can be termed 'noncooperative activism.'&quot;    America's hard-nosed approach isn't likely to achieve the results it seeks. The EC's cost of beating U.S. subsidies is relatively small, aside from the higher costs that the subsidies inflict on consumers. The warfare, moreover, allows the EC to portray the U.S. as an enemy, increasing support for any budget boosts needed to support the subsidies. Since the U.S. has a much larger foreign market to defend, it is estimated that the U.S. would have to outspend the EC by 50% merely to maintain its market share.    The U.S. shoot-while-talking approach to GATT negotiations certainly weakens the position of U.S. representatives at the talks. The U.S., after all, is doing exactly what it objects to the EC doing. Other nations can be excused if they wonder, occasionally, what the U.S. position really is.    The U.S.-EC warfare, incidentally, is winning no friends for either side among other wheat producers. The warfare has caused the world price to fall, imposing substantial losses on such grain exporters as Canada, Australia and Argentina.    There must be some frustration among U.S. officials. The subsidies aside, the U.S. is a lower-cost producer than the EC. Europe is still trying to grow grain on postage-stamp farms ill-fitted to new, efficient farm machinery. Some move toward freer farm trade surely would benefit Europe's consumers, whatever the short-term losses to its farmers.    It's hard to say how this crazy mess will eventually work out. Surely U.S. negotiators should be able to approach the GATT talks with sympathy for the EC's farm-politics problems; the U.S. has plenty of those at home. The U.S. government has been supporting domestic farm prices since the 1930s, and it's hard to believe that Congress would agree to full liberalization of farm trade.    Both sides, however, have so much to gain from liberalization that it would be tragic if there were no movement in that direction at all. Even a small movement, with an agreement to continue talking, would be welcome. It's nice to have all those new friends on the far side of the Berlin Wall, but it would be a shame to lose our old friends -- especially now, with 1992 coming closer every day. </TEXT></DOC>
