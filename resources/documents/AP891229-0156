Manuel Antonio Noriega headed one ofthe most bungled operations in the history of Israel's Mossadintelligence agency.   Michael Harari, whose arrest by U.S. troops was announcedThursday, was described by an American diplomat in Panama as asecurity adviser to Noriega and an instructor to the PanamanianDefense Forces.   Israeli newspapers reported that Harari had considerableinfluence in Panamanian politics. He was once appointed by Noriegaas Panama's honorary consul general in Israel.   But he is best known, according to the daily Yediot Ahronot, asthe head of a team of 15 Mossad agents who set out to kill aleading Palestinian terrorist but instead murdered a haplessMoroccan-born waiter in a Norwegian resort.   Spokesmen for the Israeli Foreign and Defense ministries refusedcomment Friday on Harari's arrest in Panama, saying he was aprivate citizen. But his exploits have been described extensivelyin newspapers and books.   Yediot said Harari helped Noriega recruit Israeli mercenariesfor his personal bodyguard over the last year and noted that asecond Israeli, Eliezer Ben Giton, surrendered to U.S. troopsoutside the Vatican mission in Panama, saying he was ``responsiblefor the personal security of General Manuel Noriega.''   The Haaretz daily said Harari was convinced to leave Panama lastyear by Israel officials, who were under strong U.S. pressure tocut contacts with Noriega. But the former Mossad agent laterreturned.   Israel's ambassador to Panama, Reuven Ben-Eliezer, told Israelarmy radio he did not know Harari.   ``I don't know who Harari is, I didn't see him, I didn't meethim, I didn't get orders from him, and he also didn't receive''orders from Israel's embassy in Panama, Ben-Eliezer said in theinterview broadcast Friday.   ``He is a private Israeli. I don't know what he did there. Hedid business and he was appointed by Noriega as honorary generalconsul for Panama in Israel,'' Ben-Eliezer said.   Harari, 62, was born in Tel Aviv in a religious family thatobjected to his joining the Israeli army. He eventually became acolonel.   Yediot said Harari was chief of Mossad's special operations whenhe headed the unit trying to kill the leader of the PalestinianBlack September group, which massacred 11 Israeli athletes at the1972 Munich Olympics.   The case is described in the book ``The Quest for the RedPrince'' by Israeli authors Michael Bar-Zohar and Eitan Haber.Haber, now the spokesman for Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin,refused to comment on the case.   In the book, the team leader is referred to only as ``Mike,''but sources familiar with the case say it was Harari.   According to the accounts, Harari's squad traced the man theybelieved to be Ali Hassan Salameh, known as the Red Prince, to theresort of Lillehammer, Norway.   Two agents killed the man on May 23, 1973, but the victim turnedout to be Ahmed Boushiki, a Moroccan-born waiter living inLillehammer with his Norwegian wife.   The embarrassment was heightened when six of the Israeli agentsinvolved in the mission were arrested by Norwegian police.   The real Salameh was eventually killed when a bomb planted byIsraeli agents engulfed his car in flames on a Beirut street onJan. 22, 1979.</TEXT></DOC>
