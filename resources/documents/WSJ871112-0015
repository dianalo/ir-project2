At least 60 cities are expected to miss the Clean Air Act's year-end deadline for reducing levels of carbon monoxide and ozone, the main ingredients in smog.    Under the EPA's plan, about one-third of those cities may qualify for extensions of time to comply without incurring sanctions, said Robert Brenner, director of an EPA group that works with Congress on the Clean Air Act. But the EPA, while it would like more flexibility in deciding when to impose sanctions, has decided the law obliges it to ban construction of industrial plants in cities that can't clean up their air to national standards within five years, Mr. Brenner said.    A list of cities that would be subject to a construction ban hasn't yet been drawn up, but it's certain to include Los Angeles, Houston and New York, which have the nation's worst air-pollution problems.    The EPA's plan will be formally proposed next week, Mr. Brenner said. However, it won't be needed if Congress this year passes a proposal to briefly extend the clean-air deadline while it rewrites the nationwide program for reducing smog and other air-pollution problems.    The Clean Air Act's compliance deadline already has been extended twice -- in 1977 and 1982. If Congress fails to act this year, though, the EPA will have a plan for coping with cities -- primarily in the Northeast, California, Texas Gulf Coast and Chicago area -- that clearly still can't comply.    In keeping with a strategy outlined last year by EPA Administrator Lee Thomas, the agency's plan would defer compliance to different dates for different cities. Mr. Thomas also favors the flexibility to impose sanctions -- including cutoffs of federal highway or sewage-treatment grants -- only on cities that fail to file or enact air-quality plans, but not on those that simply can't meet a deadline. But some, including the General Accounting Office, question whether the EPA legally has much flexibility to withhold sanctions.    Under the EPA's plan, cities that file new pollution plans showing they can meet air-quality standards within five years won't incur any sanctions.    Cities with longer-term pollution problems will be subject to the construction ban but will get new compliance deadlines, ranging from three to 25 years, depending on the seriousness of the problem. In addition, though, state and local officials are to find ways to immediately begin reducing emissions in those cities by an average 3% annually.    The EPA expects its plan to be challenged in court, especially on the issue of whether the EPA has the legal authority to delay sanctions when a city fails to comply.    Besides the legal issue, Richard Ayres, a lawyer for the Natural Resource Defense Council, an environmental group, questioned whether the EPA should have so much discretion as a policy matter. His group prefers to let policy makers in Congress clarify and revitalize the air-quality program by amending the Clean Air Act.    The Senate Environment Committee last month passed a bill to rewrite the law; its bill would extend deadlines for cities in exchange for tougher compliance steps. However, chances for congressional passage of the measure aren't considered good. </TEXT></DOC>
