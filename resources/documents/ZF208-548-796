(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>AppleTalk Phase 2andM;This summer Apple issued a number of networking and related productannouncements, chief among which were the details of a new edition of itsAppleTalk networking protocols, the AppleTalk Phase 2.andP;  The announcement wasaccompanied by the introduction of several new products, most notably anAppletalk Internet Router, a Token Ring interface card for the NuBus, and aTokenTalk driver software to run AppleTalk protocols in a Token Ringenvironment.andM;At the same time, a variety of networking products for the IBM environmentwere introduced, including CL/1 environments for querying relationaldatabases on VM/CMS and MVS/TSO systems, a MacAPPC Macintosh peer-to-peerprogramming environment and Mac Distributed Function Terminal (DFT), afull-featured 3270 emulation environment for either Token Ring or twin-axialMacintosh connections.andM;The June announcement represents a considerable step forward in Apple'snetworking blitz, especially in legitimizing AppleTalk protocols forcorporate use and by adding important IBM links to its connectivity scheme.andO;The changes to AppleTalk are a key to its networking campaign, directing thefuture of its networking in an interesting direction.andM;AppleTalk Roots RevealedandM;Apple's goal for the networking component of the Macintosh, known as theAppletalk Personal Network (APN), is derived from its design goals for theMacintosh itself--namely, to provide a simple, easy-to-use, and flexiblemeans of interconnecting computers, peripherals, and servers.andP;  Although thegoals impose some limitations on the architecture under AppleTalk Phase 1,Apple succeeded admirably in providing built-in connectivity that wascompletely consistent with its &quot;plug-and-play&quot; philosophy.andM;AppleTalk Phase 1 was used in three primary configurations:andM;* As a peripheral bus to connect a Macintosh to peripherals (primarily theLaserWriter).andM;* As a standalone LAN, where a workgroup can share peripherals (printers,servers, modems, and so forth) and exchange files and otherandM;data.andP;   A single AppleTalk network accommodatesandM;up to 32 nodes, including Macintoshes, servers, and peripherals.andM;* For internetworks, built by using bridges to interconnect standaloneAppleTalk networks, each composed of no more than 32 nodes.andP;  Likewise,gateways can be used to connect standalone or interconnected AppleTalknetworks other than LANs (for example, Ethernet or DECnet).andP;  Apple'saddressing scheme limited network addresses to eight bits in width, for amaximum of 254 addressable network nodes (addresses 0 and 1 are reserved forspecial Apple uses).andM;All AppleTalk protocols (Phases 1 and 2) are designed to operate at thelayers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.andP;  The principalprotocols operate from layers one through five--physical, data link, network,transport, and session--with additional protocols operating at levelsix--presentation.andP;  Figure 1 (p.andP;  129) introduces the protocols by name andacronym, situating them in the OSI model.andM;The following sections introduce the protocols in the AppleTalk suite, basedon the layers they occupy in the OSI model.andP;  To understand how they functiontogether, assume that a Macintosh on a LocalTalk network wants to read a fileon a server connected to the same AppleTalk internet but resides on adifferent AppleTalk network.andM;The discussion on the protocols describes data flow through the protocolstacks for the two devices.andP;  The operation is called a &quot;file access request&quot;and the originating node &quot;the requestor.&quot;andP;  Interestingly, two protocol stacksare involved--one each for the requestor and the server.andP;  Also, the stacksshare information at the same levels, which is often called peercommunications among the protocols involved.andP;  For this reason, the fileaccess requested is discussed from both requestor and server perspectives.andM;Physical LayerandM;In the OSI model, the physical layer handles electrical and mechanicalaspects of network communications.andP;  At this level, a specification(LocalTalk, Ethernet, Token Ring, or Arcnet, depending on the networkingtechnology in use) determines the hardware (connectors and cables), managesdigital-analog translation for signals, signal transmission and reception,and arbitrates contention for network resources.andM;One of the advantages of following the OSI model is that any other system fora layer providing the same services can replace that layer's current occupantwithout affecting any layers above or below it.andP;  This means each of thenetworking technologies mentioned previously is more or less interchangeableand does not affect higher level protocols.andM;At the physical level, our file access request is translated into a series ofvoltage pulses representing the contents of data frames supplied by the datalink layer.andP;  The voltage pulses are broadcast across the physical medium,whatever it might be.andP;  The server's activity is the inverse of therequestor's--it translates voltage pulses into bit patterns (and trims offany preamble bits) and passes data frames up to the data link layer.andP;  Networkcontention and collision management are handled by the devices at this layeras well.andM;Link Access ProtocolsandM;LLAP provides LocalTalk data link layer services, while ELAP provides similarservices for Ethernet.andP;  Each of the protocols manages the transmission ofcoherent, distinct collections of data, called packets, between devicesconnected to a single AppleTalk network.andP;  LAP protocols also provide anencapsulation technique for packaging data into special containers, calledframes, and provides access to the physical layer for transmission andreception of the frames.andM;The file access requests reaches the appropriate LAP in the form of acollection of datagrams as assembled by the Datagram Delivery Protocol (DDP),which are broken into data frames with appropriate header and trailerinformation and sent down to the physical layer for translation into voltagepulses and broadcast.andP;  The server's activity is again the inverse; itassembles the datagrams to pass to DDP from the frames provided by thephysical layer.andP;  At this point, the server recognizes that a message is thereto decode.andM;Datagram DeliveryandM;Datagram Delivery Protocol (DDP) occupies the network layer, managingcommunication between multiple AppleTalk networks.andP;  The DDP extends LAPmechanisms to allow groups of interconnected AppleTalk networks, calledinternets, to communicate.andP;  Further, DDP allows logical entities (mostcommonly, particular applications or network services) within a given node,known as sockets to be addressed.andP;  Sockets act as sources and destinationsfor datagrams; they represent a common method for defining points ofconnection for network messages and are critical to reliable data deliveryover a network.andM;The AppleTalk Translation Protocol (ATP) message that encapsulates a fileaccess request is packaged into datagrams by DDP, where critical addressinformation is requested and supplied: network routing information by anaccess to Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP), if needed, and theserver's name resolved to an internet address by access to Name BindingProtocol (NBP).andM;This information is packaged into datagrams along with the ATP message forthe file access request, including the destination address and delivery routefor correct delivery.andP;  Furthermore, since file services depend on socketaddresses for both requestor and server, proper socket addresses arefurnished.andP;  When the server receives a datagram, it stores incomingaddressing and routing information as a &quot;return address,&quot; while the dataportion of the datagram is unpacked and passed along to the ATP.andM;Routing TableandM;Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP) is one of four AppleTalk protocolsthat occupy the transport layer, each of which adds capabilities to datagramdelivery services.andP;  The RTMP allows internetworking devices (especiallyrouters) to dynamically manage possible routes between individual AppleTalknetworks in an internet environment.andP;  Also, nonbridge nodes use a subset ofRTMP to identify their own networks and to locate internetworking devices toset up internet communications.andM;If the configuration of the network across which our hypothetical file accessrequest is passed requires that multiple internetworking devices be traversedwhen the message goes from the requestor to the server, RTMP providesinformation about the preferred route (number of hops and routers to betraversed) to the requestor's DDP for best effort delivery.andP;  The server canreuse that route, or it may again request the same services for its reply.andM;Name Binding ProtocolandM;The Name Binding Protocol (NBP) is another transport layer protocol.andP;  Itsupports name addressing and manages the correspondence between names andactual network addresses.andP;  NBP translates character strings into internetsocket addresses for sockets being named.andM;For our file access request, NBP services are extremely important.andP;  It takesthe name of the server supplied by the requestor and performs necessary tablelookup or address resolution to supply an internet address for the socketthat handles file access requests on the server.andP;  This isolates users anddevelopers from addressing details and is essential for most networks wheresuch details change constantly.andM;Transaction ProtocolandM;The ATP is yet another transport layer protocol that supports a reliable,loss-free connection service between sockets.andP;  It allows for exchangesbetween two sockets, with one socket requesting services from another socket,which then reports any of the results to the requestor upon completion.andM;ATP represents the level at which our file access request begins to involve&quot;meaningful communication&quot; between requestor and server.andP;  Up to this point,communications at the lower levels have managed access to the physicalmedium, packaging of low-level messages, and addressing and delivery routeservices to describe a pathway between two sockets.andP;  ATP permits thosesockets to exchange information; in this case, the requestor issues a messageto the server, and the server acknowledges that message and formulates areply.andM;AppleTalk Echo ProtocolandM;AppleTalk Echo Protocol (AEP) also occupies the transport layer.andP;  It providesa simple service--it allows any node to send a datagram to any other node onan internet and receive an &quot;echoed&quot; copy of that packet in return.andP;  This maybe used to confirm a particular nodes existence, or to measure round-tripdelays.andP;  The latter application can sometimes be useful as a measure ofnetwork performance.andM;Our file access request does not use AEP.andM;Data Stream ProtocolandM;AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol (ADSP) occupies the session layer, whichprovides services for reliable, bidirectional communications between any twosockets on an AppleTalk internet.andP;  It manages composition of messages fromdatagrams in sequence order, and eliminates duplicate datagrams.andP;  It can evendetect missing or damaged datagrams and request their retransmission toguarantee delivery of complete, error-free messages.andM;ADSP was described in the 1987 AppleTalk specification, but wasn't introduceduntil 1989, so it hasn't been until this year that companies are using it asa platform for developing distributed applications under AppleTalk.andO;Consequently, it remains one of the lesser-used AppleTalk protocols, but itis gaining favor as more and more AppleTalk distributed applications areimplemented.andM;ADSP is not a part of our file access request example, which depends on ASPinstead.andP;  ADSP is most commonly used where applications programmers find itnecessary to move sizeable byte streams between two sockets (for example, anetworked CAD application, as in AutoCAD, or for file transfer, as inFarallon Computing's new version of Timbuktu).andM;Zone Information ProtocolandM;Zone Information Protocol (ZIP) also occupies the session layer.andP;  It supportsname mapping, much like NBP, but it maps individual networks to particularzone names (used by NBP to determine which networks belong to which zones).andO;Because it is central to internet communications, it is handled by thosebridging devices responsible for internet activity.andM;ZIP might play a role in our hypothetical file access request if the networklink between the server and the requestor spans multiple zones.andP;  If this werethe case, RTMP would issue datagrams through DDP to access ZIP to obtain thedesired zone information, which would then be included in addressinginformation for the datagrams for the file access request itself.andM;Session and FilingandM;The two upper-level protocols, AppleTalk Session Protocol (ASP) and AppleTalkFiling Protocol (AFP), are critical to the hypothetical file access request.andO;ASP creates a session to permit the file access request to be recognized andserviced and then disconnects the network link between the requestor andserver when the service has completed.andP;  At this level, a &quot;live connection&quot;between the sockets on the two machines acts much like a single process on asingle machine.andM;ATP handles sequencing of datagrams into complete messages for the incomingdata that arrives out of order and can force datagrams to be retransmittedwhen they are lost or arrive with errors.andP;  For outgoing data, ASP breakscomplete messages into datagram-sized chunks passed on through the ATP toDDP.andM;At the presentation layer, AFP decodes the file access request, checkingaccess rights and availability of the file requested and formulating thereply to the request (either a window into the file or an access denial).andO;Because such activity requires ongoing dialog, it helps to explain why itmust be managed through a session protocol in which ongoing communicationsare provided and maintained.andM;Additional AppleTalk protocols are depicted in the accompanying diagram,including AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol (ADSP), Printer Access Protocol(PAP), and PostScript.andM;These protocols provide different high-level services: ADSP for applicationswishing to move data streams, PAP for printer access and print spooling, andPostScript for manipulating page images.andP;  For more information on these andother protocols, please consult Inside AppleTalk by Apple (Addison-WesleyPublications, 1989).andP;  This resource is extremely handy but because it went topress in November 1988 it unfortunately does not cover Phase 2 details.andM;The protocol collection defines the set of services in AppleTalk Phase 1 forcommunications management.andP;  The services collections also provides a powerfuldevelopment platform for building distributed applications over AppleTalk.andO;Over noteworthy features and services provided by AppleTalk Phase 1 are:andM;* NBP and ZIP support translating user-supplied names into unique networkaddresses as soon as they're defined, permitting access to such named devicesimmediately.andM;* Unique AppleTalk network addresses (internet name/node ID) are generatedwhen new devices are plugged into the network, ensuring addressability andaccess to network services.andM;* Users can view and select from a pool of network peripherals (such asprinters and networks) when directing output from their own desktops withoutworrying about addressing.andM;*Internetworking supports connections to networks supporting other mediathrough bridging or other internetworking devices, permitting access tominicomputers or mainframes (native AppleTalk protocol software is availablefor DOX, UNIX, and DEC--VMS and Ultrix--machines, with similar products forother platforms under development; also TCP/IP, XNS, OSI, and DECnet clientsoftware are available for the Macintosh from various vendors.andM;*Dynamic routing ensures network reliability, even when particularconnections are broken (as long as a viable path remains).andP;  Dynamicconfiguration keeps a networks description up-to-date.andM;Phase One: SummaryandM;The original AppleTalk protocol suite offered a powerful, flexible, yeteasy-to-use network platform, regardless of the physical medium chosen.andP;  Inparticular, its ability to sense current network configurations dynamicallyand to establish connections between devices made working in such anenvironment painless for users.andP;  Network administrators found it easy tomanage and maintain, within the addressing limitations.andP;  But administratorsfound that the architecture under Phase 1 did not support powerful networkmanagement.andM;Phase Two: ChangesandM;AppleTalk Phase 2 represents an evolutionary change relative to Phase 1,rather than a revolutionary one.andP;  Its primary motivation appears to have beento extend the address space for AppleTalk networks, breaking the old 254-nodelimit for the maximum number of addressable nodes.andM;AppleTalk Phase 1 used the one-byte node identifier field in the LAP Node IDfield to identify a device's node.andP;  As we've mentioned, this, combined withApple's treatment of node ID's 0 and 1 as special cases, only left 254addressable nodes on an AppleTalk network.andP;  Unfortunately, many of Apple'slarger customers found this restriction to be stifling, so it's notunreasonable to interpret its introduction of Phase 2 as partly due to itsdesire to support larger networks for its larger customers.andM;Under Phase 2, extended network is introduced.andP;  The extended network uses thetwo-byte network number field of the DDP header as well as the one-byte LAPnode ID to specify a single network node.andP;  theoretically, this provides anaddress space of 32 bits, but in actuality only 24 bits are utilized tospecify a node address.andP;  This raises the limit on the addressable nodes to acapacious 16 million-plus (16,777,216).andP;  The Phase 2 approach is based on thework done to support AppleTalk over Ethernet (EtherTalk) and uses AppleTalkAddress Resolution Protocol (AARP) to extend AppleTalk addressing.andM;The DDP header is used to specify a virtual network number.andP;  Each suchnetwork is limited to 253 nodes (an additional reserved network value isrequired for this scheme).andP;  However, because physical media segments can bemade of multiple virtual networks, and ranges of such networks, the sizerestrictions are largely irrelevant.andP;  By extending the number of addressablenetworks in the DDP header, Apple can maintain a degree of compatibility withthe Phase 1 addressing scheme that uses the LAP header node ID only, yetstill address a large number of nodes overall.andM;The change in addressing scheme affects the protocols that use it--namely DDPand RTMO--and additionally those involved with address resolution--thevarious flavors of AARP needed for the media types--and with zone and nameservices--namely namely ZIP and NBP.andP;  Other than this factor, the design ofthe AppleTalk protocol stack remains intact, and the overall design ofapplications and network services is largely undisputed.andM;Trouble in ParadiseandM;On the face of it, Apple's changes to the AppleTalk protocol environmentappear to be an unalloyed boon.andP;  However, there's some trouble in the newnetworking paradise of Phase 2.andP;  One of the implications of the change inaddressing schemes is that internetworking is profoundly affected.andP;  Not onlyin the size and composition of an address greatly altered (requiringinformation from two different packet headers: LAP and DDP), but also thecomposition and function of routing tables is changed.andM;For one thing, old addresses are clearly incompatible with new addresses.andO;Also, creating and grouping virtual networks more or less at theadministrator's will makes comparison of Phases 1 and 2 a bit of an &quot;applesand oranges&quot; activity.andP;  Last, and possibly most significant, LocalTalknetworks cannot upgrade to Phase 2 owing to their inability to support thecomplete 24-bit AARO-style addresses needed to operate in the Phase 2environment.andM;The upshot is that appleTalk Phase 1 packets are invisible to AppleTalk Phase2 clients and routers, and vice-versa, owing to the discrepancies betweentheir addressing schemes.andP;  This means that Phase 1 and Phase 2 machines onthe same network can't communicate with each other directly.andP;  Further, a lotof software (for instance, Farallon's TrafficWatch, Apple's InterPoll, or SunMicrosystems's TOPS) work fine in a Phase 1 environment but cannot work in orcommunicate with Phase 2 hosts.andM;This is primarily a problem for routers, because the RTMP tables for Phase 1are different enough to be incompatible with Phase 2, yet similar enough thatthe two cannot interoperate on the same network.andP;  All routers must beupgraded to Phase 2 (and all Ethernet drivers upgraded from EtherTalk 1.0 toEtherTalk 2.0) for them to work properly as soon as a Phase 2 host isintroduced on an internetwork.andM;Integrating the PhasesandM;Fortunately, AppleTalk's Internet router can route between Phase 1 and Phase2 hosts (in fact, it can translate between the two addressing schemes andallow intercommunication quite well).andP;  Apple originally intended to providethis Phase 1 and Phase 2 capability as a transition schemes, to give users anopportunity to migrate painlessly from one world to another.andM;Certain devices simply cannot be replaced willy-nilly, because of theirexpense-namely, Apple LaserWriters, particularly the older Laser-Writer andLaserWriter Plus using the Canon SX print engine.andP;  These products are nolonger supported by Apple, having been replaced by the newer LaserWriter SC,NT, and NTX products (which are likely to be phased out in the next year ortwo as Apple abandoned its Post-Script-based printing technology).andP;  Thesenodes are likely to remain at Phase 1 indefinitely, making Apple's transitionscheme likely to persist as long as the older products remain in use.andM;Apple's Internet Router is a software-only product permitting multiplenetwork interfaces to be active on a single Macintosh (including both theprinter and the modem ports, for multiple LocalTalk segments).andP;  The MacintoshII is the platform of choice for routers because its NuBus interface willsupport the greatest number of network interfaces.andP;  Also, the Internet Routercan route AppleTalk packets between LocalTalk, EtherTalk, and TokenTalk, butit does not offer support for additional protocol types (for example, DECnet,OSI, and TCP/IP), although multiple protocol supports has been declared to bea future goal for Apple's networking environment.andM;Like the Internet Router, other products from third-party vendors arescheduled to support Phase 2 capabilities, along with Phase 1 to Phase 2routing capabilities.andP;  These include the Novell/Kinetics FastPath 4 (whichsupports TCP/IP and DECnet, in addition to a promised release of AppleTalkPhase 1 and Phase 2 communications in the fourth quarter of 1989), and CaymanSystems' GatorBox (which supports TCP/IP and NFS, with support for bothphases also promised for the fourth quarter of 1989).andP;  Other router vendorslike Shiva (NetBridge and TeleBridge) and Hayes Microcomputer Products(InterBridge) are promising Phase 2 support.andP;  Currently, the Internet Routeris the only internetworking device permitting Phase 1 and Phase 2 nodes tocommunicate, using Apple's Upgrade Utility INIT.andM;As newer applications are introduced and some networking features promisedfor Apple's System 7.0 are released, Phase 2 capability will be increasinglyimportant.andP;  At present, it is an issue mostly for those sites needing toexpand beyond the 254-nodes limitations running Ethernet, and particularlyfor those installations wishing to employ Token Ring technology, since theonly version of Token Ring AppleTalk that Apple supports is Phase 2-based.andO;This latter condition is a consequences of the simultaneous release of Phase2 and the TokenTalk driver for AppleTalk over Token Ring.andM;Upgrade StrategiesandM;Several strategies should be considered when easing into the new networkingregime.andP;  Obviously, those sites intending to continue with Local-Talk-onlyinstallations will not have to grapple with Phase 2 considerations.andP;  Thosesites with Ethernet and LocalTalk will have to consider whether the number ofnodes they wish to network requires Phase 2 at this time.andP;  If not, it mightbe worth waiting until the system is released or other softwareconsiderations emerge that make the switchover necessary.andP;  Apple's EtherTalkcard (for Mac II only) can support the old Phase 1 EtherTalk 1.2 driver andthe new Phase 2 EtherTalk 2.0 driver simultaneously, allowing a singleinterface to manage communications between Phase 1 and Phase 2 nodes on anEthernet.andM;Because TokenTalk only comes in the Phase 2 flavor, those sites needingTokenRing support will have to connect existing Phase 1 Macintoshes andperipherals as soon as TokenTalk is used.andP;  If we wanted to upgrade Figure 1to reflect Phase 2 changes, we'd have to add Token Ring hardware to thephysical layer components, and a Token Ring Link Access (TLAP) at the datalink layer.andP;  (Since Thomas-Conrad (Austin, Texas) and Actinet (Palo Alto,Calif.) recently began shipping Arcnet products for the Macintosh, we shouldadd an Arcnet hardware component and an Arcnet Link Access Protocol, ALAP toFigure 1).andM;Those sites that have to run Phase 1 and Phase 2 hosts together should weighthe costs and benefits of the Internet Router.andP;  Including the cost of aMacintosh on which to run the Internet Router ($695) software, priceconsiderations indicate that FastPath ($2,795) or Gatorbox ($2,795 sans NFS,$3,695 with NFS) is a better buy.andP;  A dedicated device protects users fromdealing with a nondedicated Internet Router, where the machine running therouter software in the background is employed ostensibly for more normaldesktop use.andP;  In some cases, the need to support multiple protocols makes theInternet Router unsuitable, but even Apple company sites use dedicatedrouter/gateways.andM;Managing a hybrid Phase 1 and Phase 2 AppleTalk network requires planning andcareful implementation.andP;  All routers must be made Phase 2 compliant whenPhase 2 is introduced or network failures will result.andP;  At present, thisrequires upgrading the router software for each router on the network andadding the Upgrade Utility INIT to Internet Router nodes.andP;  Adding Phase 2means setting up new network and zone meaning conventions, updating Phase 2nodes, and internetworking devices to follow suit.andM;Implementation of Phase 2 in a preplanned framework helps in the coordinationand management of a growing Phase 2 base and eases the ultimate transition toa Phase 2-only networking environment.andM;Managing the FutureandM;A surprising gap in the Phase 2 introduction was the lack of a Phase 2 driverfor VMS.andP;  Rumor has it that the driver was withheld from release at the lastminute because of unresolved technical difficulties.andP;  Currently, it is notpossible to reach VMS-based Appletalk servers directly from Phase 2 clients.andM;Given Apple's widely promoted DEC alliance, this omission is strange and morethan a little galling for the wide audience of Mac-to-VAX Ethernet networks(who comprise a large sector of the Ethernet market for Macintoshconnections).andP;  AppleTalk Phase 2 support for VMS is not scheduled for releaseuntil 1990, but considerable speculation has been made that Apple may ship aninterim release (that is, AppleTalk for VMS 2.1) to accommodate Phase 2capability for VMS.andM;Looking further out, Apple's networking plans appear more solid.andP;  Its supportfor more protocols and environments will include Microsoft's Server MessageBlock protocols, used for OS/2 LAN Manager distributed file systems, Sun'sNetwork File System, and a wide range of IBM SNA and Advanced Program toProgram Communications (APPC) capabilities.andP;  This combined with its recentlydisclosed plans for network-transparent inter-process communications and itsCL/1 database environment augurs that networking will remain strong for Applewell into the 1990s.andP;  Making the switch to Phase 2 may open up a new world ofnetworking possibilities, especially as Systems 7.0 begins to deliver on itspromised capabilities.andM;Ed Tittle is senior product marketing manager at Thomas-Conrad Corp. inAustin, Texas.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
