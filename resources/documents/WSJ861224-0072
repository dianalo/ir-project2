LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Emerson Electric Co. said it agreed to acquire Liebert Corp., a maker of computer-support systems, for stock valued at about $430 million.    Emerson, making its second major expansion move in the space of a few months, said the agreement calls for it to exchange 0.3322 common share for each of Liebert's 15 million shares.    The acquisition, which was authorized by directors of both companies, remains subject to antitrust clearance and other approvals.    Emerson, which makes electronic products, said it exercised certain option agreements enabling it to obtain 58% of Liebert's shares outstanding. Emerson said it will issue a total of five million shares to acquire Liebert.    In the year ended Sept. 30, Liebert had sales of $290 million. The Columbus, Ohio-based company makes computer-support systems that are essential to the operation of electronic-processing equipment.    Two months ago, Emerson said it agreed to buy Hazeltine Corp., a maker of electric and electronic products, for $189 million. Hazeltine, Commack, N.Y., has technological expertise that attracted Emerson.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Emerson closed yesterday at $85.50, down 62.5 cents a share. In national over-the-counter trading, Liebert shares rose 75 cents each to $24.25. </TEXT></DOC>
