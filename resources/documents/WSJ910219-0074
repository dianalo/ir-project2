The suit, filed Friday in federal court in Memphis, comesafter the Justice Department's recent success in forcing LosAngeles County to change election rules that a federal courtruled discriminated against Hispanics. In the Memphis suit,the Justice Department is asking the court to prevent thecity and school board from continuing to use electoraldevices allegedly adopted in direct response to thecivil-rights movement during the late 1950s and 1960s. Thesedevices were designed and maintained to dilute minorityvoting strength, the Justice Department charged.</LP><TEXT>   Among the rules under attack is one providing for theelection of six of the city council's 13 members in&quot;at-large&quot; races. Under this system, all voters are allowedto cast ballots for each at-large seat. Where whites are themajority and voting is racially polarized, the at-largeapproach tends to dilute the voting strength of minoritycommunities, according to the Justice Department.   &quot;Despite the city's large black population and numerousblack candidates, only two black candidates have won acontested election to a citywide office since 1951,&quot; AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornburgh said Friday. The Justice Department'scharges are similar to those contained in a private suitfiled last year by individual voters. A trial date hasn'tbeen set for that suit.   Memphis Deputy City Attorney Kenneth McCown declined tocomment on the Justice Department's charges, although thecity has previously denied deliberate voter discrimination.Ernest Kelly, a lawyer for the Memphis School Board, said, &quot;Idon't feel there is any discrimination going on.&quot;   The nine-member Memphis school board has two at-largeseats, while three city judgeships are also filled byat-large elections.   The Justice Department is involved in similarvoting-rights lawsuits in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana andTexas.   ---   NEW FDIC POLICY limiting fees to law firms is alreadybeing felt.   The policy, which went into effect last week, covers legalwork for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and theResolution Trust Corp. It requires approval from uppermanagement before new legal work can be assigned to law firmsthat have received $2.5 million or more from the agencies inthe preceding 12 months.   The FDIC's objective is to spread its legal work amongmore law firms and, by increasing competition, reduce theagency's legal bills, according to general counsel AlfredByrne.   Private law firms were paid $615 million last year forwork on behalf of the FDIC, RTC and certain thrifts and bankswhose legal costs are covered under agreements with thefederal agencies. More than one-fifth of the total fees, or$129.2 million, went to just 48 of the 998 law firms that dowork for the FDIC.   The new limitations are already affecting law firms suchas Houston-based Hutcheson andamp; Grundy, at which annual feesfrom the now-dissolved Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp.reached a peak of $6 million in 1988. Managing partner JackCarter said Hutcheson andamp; Grundy was recently passed over fortwo new FDIC assignments because the firm had been paid morethan $2 million during the previous 12 months. &quot;They're beingvery strict,&quot; he said.   Mr. Byrne, the FDIC general counsel, said one law firm hasbeen approved to receive a new legal assignment despitehaving crossed the fee threshold. The policy providesexceptions for law firms with &quot;special expertise orexperience&quot; and for law firms that offer a &quot;justifiableexpectation of substantially reduced fees.&quot;   The first exception was made for Baker andamp; HostetlerMcCutchen Black, the Los Angeles branch of Cleveland-basedBaker andamp; Hostetler, which has been retained for a &quot;majorprofessional liability engagement,&quot; Mr. Byrne said. Neitherhe nor the firm would identify the financial institutioninvolved.   ---   BANK DOESN'T HAVE to return money mistakenly wiretransferred, court rules.   In a decision expected to affect future cases involvingmistaken electronic funds transfers, New York's highest courtruled that Banque Worms need not return almost $2 million itreceived from Security Pacific International Bank on behalfof a company that shortly thereafter went into involuntaryliquidation proceedings.   Sydney, Australia, based Spedley Securities Ltd. askedSecurity Pacific to wire the money, but then changed itsmind. Security Pacific transferred the money anyway. BanqueWorms, based in La Defense, France, successfully argued thatit was entitled to keep the funds because it was owed themoney and because it was not immediately informed of themistake.   A federal appeals court in Manhattan asked the New YorkCourt of Appeals to rule on the matter because it wanted NewYork state law on electronic funds transfers clarified. Thecase will now return to the Second U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals.   The decision is considered to be significant because somany electronic funds transfers are governed by New York lawand because the court explained how a month-old state law onsuch transactions should be applied.   J. Portis Hicks, of the New York law firm Boulanger,Finley andamp; Hicks, which represented Banque Worms, said theruling confirms &quot;that except in certain limited circumstances. . . responsibility for error will rest at the door of theparty who made the mistake.&quot;   Sarah L. Reid, a partner at the New York law firm KelleyDrye andamp; Warren, which represented Security Pacific, asubsidiary of Security Pacific Corp., Los Angeles, said thedecision &quot;will clearly be read very closely. It doesrepresent a departure.&quot;   According to the decision, nearly $1 trillion in wiretransfers occur each day.   ---   BOSTON DEFECTION: Hale andamp; Dorr announced that NutterMcClennen andamp; Fish partner John K.P.
