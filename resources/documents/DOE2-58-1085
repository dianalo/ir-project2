<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-58-1085 </DOCNO><TEXT>The solar-powered seawater desalination pilot plant at Yanbu combinesstate-of-the art solar thermal power technology with a freeze desalinationtechnique to produce 200 cubic meters of product water in a day. Thedata collected during the past two years of operation of the plant arecurrently being analyzed and technically documented. Operation and testresults have indicated the potential of the plant as well as key problemareas within the broader perspective of research and development forsolar thermal and desalination technologies. The PKI (Power KineticsInc.) point focus dish collectors concentrate the sun's radiation ontothermal cavity receivers, and the energy collected is turned into shaftpower to produce refrigeration required for CBI's (Chicago Bridge andIron Company) freeze desalination process.</TEXT></DOC>
