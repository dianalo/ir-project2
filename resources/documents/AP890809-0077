A Hezbollah leader said the attacker was a ``comrade'' of SheidAbdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem clergyman held by Israel. TheHezbollah spokesman, Sheik Sobhi Tofaili, did not say if the attackwas in retaliation for the abduction.   The pickup truck blew up in Israel's self-proclaimed securityzone in south Lebanon as a joint Israeli-South Lebanon Army convoywas passing by.   Israeli's army said five Israeli soldiers and one of the alliedLebanese militiamen were wounded. One soldier suffered seriousinjuries and the others suffered light or moderate injuries. Twopeople in the truck were killed, the army said.   Tofaili said there was only one attacker and identified him asSheik Asaad Birro, a Shiite clergyman.   Hezbollah also released a statement saying, ``The Mujahid (holywarrior) detonated the car he was driving as an enemy militaryconvoy drove past.''   Israel radio said the blast left a crater six feet deep,overturned an army vehicle and damaged nearby houses. The radiosaid the pickup was carrying 550 pounds of explosives.   Hezbollah, or Party of God, said the ``martyrdom operation'' wascarried out at the entrance to the Christian village of Qleiaa,about two miles north of Israel's border, at 9:45 a.m.   Hezbollah, believed to be the umbrella for factions holding mostof the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon, said in the statement thatthe attack was carried out to ``declare our loyalty to the courseof Imam Khomeini and his successor Ayatollah Khamenei'' of Iran.   Israel Army radio said Israeli soldiers and allied militiamenput up roadblocks and were searching for suspects. It said a numberof Lebanese residents had been detained.   In Beirut, Hezbollah released a second statement today sayingthat efforts to free Western hostages in Lebanon suffered ``theirgreatest setback'' as a result of Israel's abduction of Obeid onJuly 28 from his home in south Lebanon.   ``It is clear that things have backfired adversely on the enemyafter this foolish crime. It has become impossible to release theIsraeli POWs and all ways for a possible swap have been blocked,''the statement said.   Israel says Obeid, an ally of Iran, was involved in theabduction of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins near thissouthern port on Feb. 17, 1988.   Higgins' kidnappers, the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth,said July 31 that Higgins was hanged in retaliation for Obeid'sabduction. Some reports have said he was killed months earlier, andhis body has yet to be recovered.   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, another undergroundpro-Iranian faction, offered Sunday to release U.S. hostage JosephCicippio if Israel released Obeid and 450 Arab prisoners andallowed 55 Palestinian deportees to return to the occupied WestBank and Gaza Strip.   Israel carved out the security zone in south Lebanon, a6-to-10-mile-wide strip, after withdrawing most of its troops fromLebanon in 1985.   Israeli army officials said the casualties could have beenhigher if the convoy had not been keeping large distances betweeneach vehicle in the convoy of Israeli soldiers and South LebanonArmy forces.   The injured were taken to hospitals in Israel by helicopter.   Dr. Albert Sattinger, director of Rambam Hospital in Haifa, saidtwo soldiers suffered skull injuries and were undergoingoperations. A third suffered an eye injury from shrapnel.   The last suicide car bomb attack was Oct. 19, 1988, when eightIsraeli soldiers were killed and seven wounded 300 yards from theborder. Shiite Moslem radicals in Beirut also claimedresponsibility for that explosion.   In March 1985, a car bomb attacker drove into a convoy ofIsraeli vehicles, killing 12 Israelis and wounding 14. The attackwas claimed by the pro-Syrian Lebanese Syrian Socialist NationalistParty.   Prior to today's attack, the army said there were 43 car bombattacks and attempts along the border since October 1982.</TEXT></DOC>
