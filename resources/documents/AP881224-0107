But there is no known reason to believe that he was a specifictarget of terrorists or that his presence on Flight 103 was tied inany other way to the disaster, one of the officials told TheAssociated Press. ``I don't know of any specific link,'' theofficial said.   For the record, the Reagan administration declined to verify ordeny that the CIA agent was aboard the jetliner, as initiallyreported by NBC News. ``As you know, we never comment on any suchallegation having to do with intelligence,'' Sondra McCarty, a StateDepartment spokeswoman, said.   But two other U.S. officials, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, confirmed the CIA station chief was on the ill-fatedflight from London's Heathrow Airport to New York. The two would notidentify the station chief.   American, British, Israeli and Interpol investigators are tryingto determine whether the plane was the victim of sabotage, technicalmalfunction or high winds. All aboard perished and 20 people whoresided near the crash site were missing and believed dead.   Flight recorders recovered from the wreckage on Friday showed thepilots engaged in routine conversation, with no warning signsapparent before the Wednesday night crash. The tape ended abruptlywith a short, faint noise.   The loss of the CIA station chief in Beirut is the latest setbackto U.S. intelligence operations in Lebanon. In April 1983, aterrorist bomb that wrecked the U.S. Embassy in Beirut took thelives of a number of CIA agents. In 1984, William Buckley, the U.S.station chief, was kidnapped, tortured and killed, probably the nextyear.   The impact on U.S. intelligence-gathering and information aboutAmerican hostages was immeasurable. The State Department lists nineAmericans currently as hostages. Officials on Thursday deniedreports any of the victims in the crash had been engaged innegotiations to secure their freedom.   A little more than two weeks before the crash, a calleridentifying himself with the radical Palestinian Abu Nidal grouptelephoned a warning to the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki that a Pan Ampassenger jet bound from Frankfurt, West Germany, to New York viaLondon would be attacked.   The State Department said Thursday it sent out a security alert.Still, some U.S. officials complained privately that insufficientprecautions were taken and that servicemen traveling home for theholidays had not been informed.   After the crash, several callers to news organizations claimedtheir groups were responsible for the attack.   The U.S. Embassy in Beirut operates on a scaled-down basisbecause of the intermittent strife in the country among rivalgroups. It is not unusual for the U.S. government to assign a CIAofficial to such a sensitive post.   CIA agents in the past have been the targets of extremists. In aneffort to shield them, the State Department in 1975 ceasedpublishing the names of employees at U.S. embassies.   The State Department said on Friday that three of its employeeswere aboard, two stationed in Beirut and the third at the U.S.Embassy in Nicosia, Cyprus.   President-elect Bush declined to comment on the situation. ``Iknow nothing about it,'' he said in a question-and-answer sessionwith reporters outside his residence.   Asked if either of the two officials in Beirut had worked for theCIA, Ms. McCarty said ``We did not identify them further. Even if Ihad such information, we would not release it.''   U.S. intelligence officers abroad usually adopt ``cover''positions as diplomats.   The two in Beirut were Matthew K. Gannon of Orange, Calif., andRonald Lariviere of Holyoke, Mass., the State Department said.   Gannon was assigned to the Near East bureau, and was returninghome after completing an assignment in Beirut as a politicalofficer. He had previously worked in North Yemen, Jordan and Syria.   Lariviere, of Holyoke, Mass., had been working in Beirut as asecurity officer, while Daniel E. O'Connor of Boston had a similarjob in Nicosia, the department said.   CIA officials did not return repeated telephone queries.</TEXT></DOC>
