British Air, working with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.'s leveraged buy-out fund, expressed interest in bidding for United Airlines' parent last week as the UAL board reviewed its options with its adviser, CS First Boston Group.    &quot;There's a warm relationship, a great respect and trust&quot; between UAL's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, and Sir Colin Marshall, British Air's chief executive officer, according to a person familiar with both sides.    That relationship was cemented last year when UAL's directors, at Mr. Wolf's suggestion, held a board meeting in London and met later with Sir Colin and British Air Chairman Lord King of Wartnaby at a private reception and dinner.    Both airlines already have nearly two years of experience working together under a joint marketing agreement. The harmony of that relationship was recently underscored when United announced plans to fly to Europe for the first time. Although the carriers will be competing directly on some routes, the companies quickly pointed out they intend to continue their cooperative arrangement in many markets.    British Air, for instance, still sees ample opportunities to transfer its passengers to United's U.S. and Mexican flights. Likewise, United passengers still can use British Air for flights to many parts of Europe, Africa and the Middle East.    British Air and UAL both wouldn't comment on the takeover situation.    As a foreign carrier, British Air couldn't legally own more than 25% of any U.S. airline, nor could British Air exercise any semblance of control, under U.S. Transportation Department rules.    However, the British carrier could inject hundreds of millions of dollars in equity into any bid, as long as other U.S. interests retain 75% or more in voting control. That would still leave plenty of room for United's unions and Mr. Wolf to participate in the bid. Morgan Stanley's LBO fund could be used to provide any additional equity needed to reach the 75% level.    &quot;The winning bid is the pilots, the machinists, management and British Airways,&quot; one investment banker predicted. Each of those four has something valuable to contribute to any transaction, although bringing the unions together may prove difficult, the banker said.    Morgan Stanley is already familiar with UAL because it was the airline company's longtime investment banker before being replaced by First Boston in 1987. The switch took place during a siege against what was then Allegis Corp. that prompted a sell-off of the company's hotel and rental-car interests.    British Air clearly has other options. For instance, it can team up with other interested U.S. bidders, or wait and join forces later with the ultimate winner in any auction process.    Whatever course it chooses, British Air has reason to believe its involvement in any bid won't run into regulatory trouble. Although as recently as Friday, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said he remains &quot;very concerned&quot; about foreign ownership stakes in U.S. airlines, the department hasn't objected yet to a single one.    Last month, two foreign companies, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Elders IXL Ltd. of Australia contributed $480 million out of $700 million in equity financing in the recent sale of NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines. However, the two companies' combined voting interest is under 20% because $400 million of the two firms' stake is in preferred stock.    KLM and the group led by Alfred Checchi that bought NWA had only a vague-sounding &quot;understanding&quot; to cooperate in certain areas, including synchronization of schedules, customer services, and joint marketing and sales.    However, the accord says that neither side &quot;will enter into other arrangements which are contrary to the purpose or spirit of the cooperative arrangements.&quot; Although it doesn't legally amount to control, the pact certainly provides KLM with the opportunity to exercise influence over NWA.    Mr. Skinner warned, however, that he intends to ensure &quot;any transaction is not constructed in such a way&quot; that it skirts current law. He said the Transportation Department can monitor transactions, such as the KLM-NWA deal, on a continuing basis.    In addition to the Morgan Stanley-British Air team, Texas investor Robert Bass expressed interest last week in bidding for UAL. Mr. Bass is already familiar with UAL assets; he teamed up in 1987 with Aoki Corp., a Japanese hotel and construction company, to buy UAL's Westin Hotels unit for $1.53 billion. Since then, the partners sold off two of the hotels for $735 million.    Mr. Bass's use of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. as his financial adviser could handicap him initially in dealing with UAL's unions. An official of the United machinists union complained that a Bass proposal &quot;starts out with baggage&quot; because Merrill Lynch helped arrange the sale of Eastern Airlines in 1986 to Texas Air Corp., which is led by Frank Lorenzo, considered an enemy by airline unions. A pilots union official voiced a similar sentiment, but said it wouldn't necessarily be a barrier to talks.    The pilots union, meanwhile, is continuing its effort to strike a deal with United management that would include an ownership stake for employees in a management-led buy-out. However, the company has rejected all of the union's proposals thus far.    The pilots union has said it would prefer to work with UAL's current management, but the union has said it will seek out other partners if it can't reach an agreement with Mr. Wolf.    Meanwhile, Mr. Davis, whose bid touched off the current scramble for UAL, is expected to announce his bank financing sometime in the next week. Such a move would counter the idea that Mr. Davis isn't a serious suitor, but only wanted to trigger a bidding war to drive up UAL stock. Mr. Davis has previously been reported to own a 3.5% UAL stake, but his current holding isn't known.    If Mr. Davis comes up with a financial structure that includes equity and bank debt without any high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, he would be better able to ward off criticism from UAL unions and government officials.    Transportation Secretary Skinner said he will take a hard look at any leveraged buy-out. The pilots union warned its membership last week that in a leveraged buyout, an outside bidder would be likely to strip assets and curtail the airline's growth plans. </TEXT></DOC>
