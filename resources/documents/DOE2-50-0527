We now find that phospholipids derivedfrom membranes lacking an unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., oleic acid) areunable to promote the exchange. This observation correlates strikinglywith the long-known effect of 3-decynoyl-N-acetylcysteamine, a &quot;suicideanalog&quot; that prevents initiation of a cycle of replication in E. coliby inhibiting the synthesis of oleic acid, an inhibition that can beovercome by providing the cells with oleic acid. Profound influenceson the specific binding of dnaA protein to phospholipids by temperature,the content of unsaturated fatty acids, and the inclusion of cholesterolcan be explained by the need for the phospholipids to be in fluid-phasevesicles. These findings suggest that membrane attachment of dnaA proteinis vital for its function in the initiation of chromosome replicationin E. coli.</TEXT></DOC>
