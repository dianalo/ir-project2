<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-34-0945 </DOCNO><TEXT>The published information reviewed indicates the following conclusions:A single generic exposure limit is not applicable to all types of oilmists. The present ACGIH TLV of 5 mg/m/sup 3/ provides an adequate safetymargin for a broad range of oils recognized as non-carcinogenic, i.e.severely refined base oils or white oils and petrolatums of medicinalor food grade quality and products formulated from the above base oilsand containing additives which, by virtue of their nature or the smallamounts present, are of no toxicological concern. The ACGIH of 5 mg/m/sup3/ may not be applicable to: products containing lighter oils such askerosine, products containing additives of toxicological concern andproducts used as emulsions. For these types of products acceptable exposurelimits can be based on review of specific formulations. An exposure limitbelow 5 mg/m/sup 3/ would be prudent for products containing potentiallycarcinogenic oils. Some guidance can be gained from the ACGIH TLV-TWAof 0,2 mg/m/sup 3/ for particulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (asbenzene soluble material).</TEXT></DOC>
