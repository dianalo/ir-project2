Get Packing!</HEAD><BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A bargain vacation this summer doesn'tnecessarily mean pitching a tent at a nearby campground or drivingout to see Grandma in Florida.   But it may mean packing in a big hurry.   A growing number of discount travel programs has emerged inrecent years, offering travelers savings of anywhere from 5 percentto 80 percent for exotic and not-so-exotic vacations worldwide.   The catch is travelers have to wait almost to the last minute tobook these trips _ in some cases as little as three days _ sincethey're buying distressed merchandise: deluxe or standard hotelrooms left vacant from late cancellations, leftover airlinetickets, cruise-ship cabins or tours.   For annual fees ranging from $30 to $50, companies such asVacations to Go Inc. in Houston, Stand Buys Ltd. in Chicago andEncore Marketing International Inc. in Lanham, Md., offer travelerstelephone hotlines listing several discounted trips, most brokendown regionally. Many also regularly mail newsletters and postcardswith other details.   They say the average savings are about 30 percent to 40 percent.Each has about 100,000 members nationwide.   And about a year ago, Miami-based Eastern Airlines started an11-city Weekender Club for those looking for short, last-minutegetaways. The carrier sends out a regional weekly ``travelgrams''listing two- to four-day trips about a week in advance. The annualfee is $100 for a single member and $175 per couple, but theairline says most, if not all, that fee could be recouped afterjust one trip.   ``Essentially they're liquidators,'' said James V. Cammisa, Jr.,publisher of the monthly newsletter Travel Industry Indicators.``They liquidate perishable inventory for airlines cruise ships andhotels and provide a service to the consumer who can plan on shortnotice and effect the savings.''   ``Once a ship sales away its empty cabins are valueless,'' saidJackie Clarke, a vice president at Encore. ``Anything they can getis better than nothing.''   But experts say there are some drawbacks to investing in suchclubs, aside from the fact that the average departure dates areabout two weeks after booking.   For one thing, tickets are rarely refundable. And the fast-pacedhotline messages can sometimes be a bit confusing.   Callers often don't find out the suppliers' name until they makereservations or contact the broker separately. (While airlines,cruise ships, hotel and tour guides like to make money on otherwiseempty space, they don't like advertising these bargain-basementrates.)   Cammisa also warns, ``There's no exclusivity on bargains. Thething that you need to make clear ... is that the inventory is inconstant change and subject to supply and demand fluctuations.''   Sometimes, equally good bargains can be found through retailtravel agents who deal with ``air consolidators,'' companies thatpurchase airline seats by bulk and offer discounts for advancepurchases, noted Ron Kurtz, senior vice president for Miami-basedWindstar Sail Cruises, who also is researching a book on affordablevacations.   ``The key to traveling today is shopping around and comparing,''Kurtz said.   Still, many consumers feel its worth investing in at least onediscount-travel club for the chance at a top-notch vacation at afraction of the normal price.   Encore's Preferred Travelers-Short Notice Club, for instance,recently offered an all-inclusive, seven-night trip to Jamaica fromSt. Louis for an average $400 per person. It said the regular priceruns about $750 per person.   Among the biggest supporters of these programs are retirees likeDorothy and Kent Cox, of Austin, Texas, with plenty of time ontheir hands for leisurely travel at a moment's notice.   ``We traveled with some (non-member) relatives once ... on oneCaribbean cruise and their fare was at least 25 percent more thanours,'' said the 64-year-old Mrs. Cox, a Vacations to Go member.``I candidly told them that we were paying much less.''   E. Gordon Seiler, a 61-year-old market planning manager forGeorgia-Pacific Corp. in Atlanta, likes jetting off for longweekends in different cities every three months. He said one recenttrip to San Francisco, booked through Eastern's club, cost $175round trip. ``The cheapest (comparable) airfare I was able to findwas $268,'' he said.   But Seiler concedes, ``You have to have a job that allows you topick up at a week's notice and you have to have freedom. I'm justvery flexible.''   ``People think they're more flexible than they really are,''said Vacations to Go President Alan Fox, adding that only about 10percent of his company's members actually go on at least oneadvertised trip a year.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday June 23</NOTE></DOC>
