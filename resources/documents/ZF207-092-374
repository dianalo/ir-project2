(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Doug ChandlerandM;Not long ago, most network managers looking to buy LAN adapter cards stayedloyal to the big-name vendors, such as 3Com Corp., Novell Inc. and IBM, andpaid top dollar for their wares.andM;Times have changed.andP;  Now, a host of new players in the market compete withthe original big guns, offering high-quality LAN boards at a wide range ofprices, according to industry observers.andM;In fact, several observers said, the LAN card market has been cut in two.andO;ARCnet cards, at the lower end of the price scale, have become commodities,with purchasing decisions being based on vendor reputation and cost.andO;Token-Ring and Ethernet cards, at the other end of the market, are moreexpensive, more powerful and are priced according to the card's on-boardprocessing power and memory.andM;While the more powerful, intelligent cards still sport $1,000 price tags,industry observers noted that, overall, LAN card prices are falling.andM;''If you look at pricing for all LAN boards, the trend is definitely down,''said Arnie Lapinig, vice president of marketing at 10Net Communications, avendor of LAN products in Dayton, Ohio.andP;  ''[The downward trend] has slowed inthe last six months or so, but the damage [to prices] has been done.''andM;As recently as three or four years ago, Ethernet boards were selling for $800each, but they now can be bought at a street price of $220, according toLapinig.andP;  ARCnet boards that sold for $600 a few years ago are available foras little as $120 today, he said.andM;Token-Ring boards have not become commodities yet because of the expenses newvendors must face when entering the market, noted Mike Morris, manager ofstrategic planning and marketing at Pure Data Ltd., a LAN products vendor inRichmond Hill, Ontario, Canada.andM;Vendors new to the market must pay royalties to holders of Token-Ringhardware patents for chip-set specifications and must also licenseToken-Ring-specific software.andM;Despite these obstacles, however, Token-Ring boards probably will achievecommodity status in a few years, he said.andM;The LAN board market has matured for a variety of reasons, according toobservers.andP;  One reason is that much of the hardware that makes up ARCnetcards, and to some extent Ethernet cards, has been standardized, allowingvendors to get into the game more easily.andM;For example, a large number of ARCnet card suppliers are using the same chipsets on their products.andP;  This is also occurring, though not as quickly, withEthernet cards, according to Bruce Watson, division manager forcommunications products at Quadram Corp., a PC peripherals vendor inNorcross, Ga.andM;''Just about everyone in the ARCnet market copied Standard MicrosystemsCorp.'s chip-set design.andP;  They were the only supplier for many years,''agreed Dee Vaidya, president of Vestra-Subco Inc., a network products vendorin Temple, Texas.andM;ARCnet card vendors from the Far East are also bringing prices down, Vaidyasaid, by entering low-cost boards into the market, stiffening pricecompetition.andM;According to Morris at Pure Data, Novell Inc., a prominent LAN vendor, isinfluencing the growth of the LAN board market.andP;  Novell's strategy is to pushthe price of networking hardware very low and make a profit from networkingsoftware, Morris said.andM;''Novell is somewhat responsible for ARCnet prices going low, and they'llprofoundly influence Ethernet-card prices dropping in the next few years,''he said.andM;Software standards have also helped open up the market, observers said.andM;The LAN board market has benefited from the snowballing effect of networksbecoming more important in the corporate world, networking hardware andsoftware becoming cheaper and easier to use, and more vendors entering themarket, Morris said.andM;In addition, more vendors flock to a mushrooming market, meaning thatcomponents suppliers can ramp up production, Morris added.andP;  At the same time,dealers work harder to sell their goods in a market that's taking off.andP;  Allof these factors conspire to drive prices down, he said.andM;The flourishing market and falling prices of LAN cards come at a time whennetworks and applications have become more complex and LAN performance morecritical, according to Roger Bailey, director of marketing at Racore ComputerProducts Inc., a vendor of Token-Ring boards and other network hardwareproducts in Los Gatos, Calif.andM;But ranking the performance of ARCnet, Ethernet and Token-Ring networks isnot always easy, according to Vestra-Subco's Vaidya.andP;  ''Themegabits-per-second (mbps) data rate of network cards has little meaning interms of what a user actually sees on the network,'' he said.andM;For example, a Vestra-Subco customer in Switzerland recently moved from anARCnet network, with a data rate of 2.5 mbps, to an Ethernet network, ratedto move data at 10 mbps.andP;  He also added 20 workstations to his network.andM;The customer was amazed, said Vaidya, that the throughput on his Ethernet LANfell to 5K bytes per second after he added the new workstations.andM;Packet TrafficandM;The explanation lies in the different routing schemes in Ethernet and ARCnetLANs, Vaidya said.andP;  If two or more stations try to talk to the server at onceon Ethernet networks, packets collide and the data rate is degraded.andM;ARCnet networks use a ''token'' scheme similar to that found on Token-Ringnetworks that, for the most part, prevents logjams, Vaidya continued.andM;Ethernet users who have large, heavily used networks might consider investingin more expensive Ethernet cards that pack some memory on board, he said.andO;The RAM acts as a buffer, holding data until network activity has died downenough to let it through safely.andM;''If you need to share a printer, bring some applications across the networkoccasionally and run some word processing, you may be able to survive on aslower LAN,'' Bailey said.andP;  ''If you're a major corporation and want toconnect to a mainframe, use more intensive applications and have largerquantities of data going across the network, you need [a faster LAN].''andM;At the Dallas division of the North Carolina National Bank, support played akey role in choosing a LAN card.andP;  The bank's 3Com 3+ network runs almostexclusively on 3Com EtherLink II, EtherLink Plus and original EtherLinkcards, according to Timothy Crowell, vice president at the bank.andP;  Since thenetwork was set up, the bank has found it easier to deal with one vendor.andO;''If there's a problem, they can't claim it's somebody else's fault,'' hesaid.andM;If 3Com card prices go up, however, North Carolina National might look toother card makers, Crowell said.andM;Supply also is a purchasing issue: The bank has had problems getting enough3Com EtherLink II cards lately, according to Crowell.andP;  ''We've been expandingconstantly over the past two or three years, and we add 25 workstations at atime,'' he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
