The wind turbine,Switzerland's Elektro Co. model WV05G-24V, consists of two Clark-Y bladeswith a diameter of 2.5 m, and has a rating of 500W. The output of thewind turbine is calculated from the resistance of and potential differenceacross a nichrome wire resistor to which load is applied after beingsubjected to full wave rectification. The direction and velocity of waveare recorded by using an aerovance. The wind speed distribution of naturalwind is found to be similar to the Weibull distribution. The use of theWeibull probability density function allows the mean wind power density(Wh/m{sup 2}) to be estimated within an error of several percent. A highutilization rate of a wind turbine does not always mean high power coefficients.The power coefficients are affected by wind conditions. The power coefficientsare high when wind fluctuations are small. Large wind energy is obtainedwhen the mean wind speed is high and the shape parameter of the Weibulldistribution is in the rather low range of 1.5-2.0. (8 figs, 5 tabs,3 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
