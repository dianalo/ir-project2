The currency trading market -- in which volume averages$700 billion a day -- is both the world's largest financialmarket and the one with the most rapidly changing technology.In recent years, a wide variety of new computer systems forforeign exchange traders have been proposed or launched, withvarying results.</LP><TEXT>   Bankers and analysts said it is too early to speculateabout the new system's impact on the currency market. Butthey said the Quotron-led proposal signals an increaseddesire by banks to control costly trading systems, ratherthan passively accepting systems from outside vendors.   The proposed new Quotron system will shield traders'identities from one another -- a feature that may appeal tosome big traders. Currently, most electronic trading systemsrequire traders to identify themselves; traders who wantanonymity must route their orders manually through middlemen-- currency brokerage firms.   Electronic trading systems that provide anonymity arelikely to be &quot;the future of foreign exchange trading,&quot;asserted David Rivers, executive editor of FX Week, acurrency-dealers newsletter. Mr. Rivers cautioned, however,that developing a reliable system has proven much tougherthan vendors had expected.   Reuters Holdings PLC, the largest provider ofcurrency-trading information, had proposed more than a yearago to launch a similar system, to be known as Dealing2000-2. But the introduction of that system has beenrepeatedly delayed. Reuters officials weren't available forcomment yesterday.   As proposed, the new Quotron-led system will automaticallymatch traders' buy and sell orders electronically, whilekeeping traders' identities secret.   Telerate Inc., a unit of Dow Jones andamp; Co., which publishesthis newspaper, has been developing its own currency tradingsystem. A Dow Jones spokesman declined to comment on theQuotron announcement, except to say that Quotron's proposedproduct wouldn't compete directly with Telerate's offering,known as The Trading System. The Telerate system identifiescurrency traders to one another.   The Quotron-led group said it hopes its new system will bein production in 18 months. It said that prototypes of thesystem are currently being tested by some of the 12participating banks: BankAmerica Corp., Barclays Bank PLC,Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical Banking Corp., Citicorp,Credit Suisse, Lloyds Bank PLC, Midland Bank PLC, MorganGuaranty Trust Co., National Westminster Bank PLC, Swiss BankCorp. and Union Bank of Switzerland.   The 12 banks and Quotron will own equal shares of thesystem, or about 7.7%. A Quotron spokeswoman declined to sayhow much the 12 banks and Quotron will invest in the newsystem, or when they expect it to be profitable.   The 12 banks participating in the new system aren'tcommitting themselves to using only the Quotron system,Quotron said.   Quotron didn't announce the prices it will charge for itsnew proposed system, except to say that it will charge usersby the transaction, rather than merely collecting flatmonthly fees. Currency trading systems aren't cheap; Quotroncurrently charges between $2,000 and $3,600 a month perterminal for its existing F/X Trader machines.</TEXT></DOC>
