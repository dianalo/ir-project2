The problem arises from the industry's efforts to balanceits promise to pump more money into the Bank Insurance Fundwith a fear that bank profits are too low to finance the $25billion special recapitalization proposed by William Seidman,chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</LP><TEXT>   In recent days, the major banking organizations have beenrotating through the FDIC trying to win Mr. Seidman'sblessing for what he calls various &quot;buy now, pay later&quot; plansthat will provide enough money to maintain public confidencein the fund on a payment schedule that banks can afford.   While Mr. Seidman wants the industry to come up with aplan, banking organizations can't agree on a proposal. Thisincreases the chances that Congress will be drawn into thedebate over insurance-fund recapitalization, which woulddelay or complicate administration and congressional effortsto promote other, more-sweeping banking legislation.   &quot;We're all looking at some ways to provide for fundingthat may prevent failures, and at the same time providefunding for failures that's least damaging to the capital ofinstitutions,&quot; Mr. Seidman says. &quot;Most of the fundingsuggestions indicate that you need a way to level the costover a period of time, while dealing with the high cost of anumber of failures.&quot;   It became clear last fall that the economy was headed forrecession and that the bank insurance fund was shrinkingrapidly from $13.2 billion at the end of 1989 to an estimated$4 billion at the end of this year. At that time, both Mr.Seidman and industry officials expressed confidence thatbanks would be able to augment the fund, which is supportedby bank payments of 19.5 cents on each $100 of domesticdeposits, without reliance on taxpayer funds.   But when Mr. Seidman called for an industry payment of $25billion -- more than 10% of the banking industry's currentequity capital of some $216 billion -- bankers in New Englandand other economically strained areas began to argue that theSeidman plan was too burdensome. &quot;In recapitalizing the BankInsurance Fund, the hit has to be handled with anunderstanding of its consequences,&quot; says Thomas Ashley,president of the Association of Bank Holding Companies, whichrepresents the nation's largest banks.   In recent weeks, Mr. Ashley has argued that it would bewiser to create a new investment fund to help weak banksavoid failure. The plan is aimed at slowing the drain on thecurrent fund, which pays the cost of failed banks. Otherbanking groups are floating plans that rely on borrowings orguarantees from the Treasury, but government officials worrythat they look too much like the flimsy financing plans thatpreceded the collapse of the savings-and-loan industryinsurance fund, which is being bailed out by the taxpayers.   The holding company group is campaigning hard for a planit thinks would attract private investment into temporarilyundercapitalized banks. These banks would sell theirnonperforming loans or other substandard assets to privateinvestors, who would be protected from loss by a new bankingindustry fund. The weak bank would be strengthened by thecash it got for selling sick assets and, stripped of problemloans, would be able to lure new private investment.   John Rippey, the group's senior vice president, says theplan has been well received on Wall Street, but it hasn'tgotten a warm reception from Mr. Seidman. For one thing, Mr.Seidman objects to the group's insistence that Congressprevent the FDIC from raising the deposit premium from itscurrent level. Mr. Rippey calls the private investment plan&quot;a dramatic and different idea,&quot; but admits that selling itto Congress will be like &quot;carrying water uphill.&quot; However,the group has powerful lobbying connections through the majorbanks it represents, and its president, Mr. Ashley, is aformer congressman and a friend of President Bush.   To build support for the plan, the group has beennegotiating with the Independent Bankers Association, whichrepresents about 6,000 community banks. But the small bankshave reservations. &quot;Our guys don't want to be putting moneyinto banks to prop them up,&quot; says Diane Casey, the executivedirector of the independent bankers group. The associationhas come up with its own $25 billion plan that would shiftmore of the funding burden to large banks and require theFederal Reserve to pay interest on the funds.   The American Bankers Association, which claims most of thenation's 12,300 banks as members, hasn't started negotiatingwith either the holding company or the community bank groups.It's studying a long list of proposals, but seems to begravitating toward a plan to borrow $25 billion from theTreasury or through the private capital markets; the moneywould be paid back over 30 years by increasing assessments ondeposits.   Under another ABA plan, banks would purchase shares in anew Bank Investment Trust that would help finance the mergersof weak banks into strong banks. This would head off bankfailures and help promote the banking industry consolidationthat most analysts consider necessary.   &quot;I think the FDIC should call all the industryrepresentatives together, give them all the facts and putthem in a room until they come up with a plan,&quot; says Ms.Casey of the Independent Bankers Association. &quot;I think it's avery serious problem.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
