Pollard's father, biochemist Morris Pollard of South Bend, Ind.,said he was surprised to hear of the Israeli payments. His son, whohas been isolated from contact with the outside world at thefederal penitentiary in Marion, Ill., also did not know about theIsraeli payments, Morris Pollard said.   In an earlier interview with The Associated Press, Blitzer, acorrespondent for the Jerusalem Post, predicted that Pollard willbe deported to Israel if he is paroled at the end of 1995.   Pollard, 34, is serving a life sentence for selling Israelthousands of secrets and the prosecutor who handled the case hassaid he doubts that Pollard ``will ever see the light of day.'' Buthe is technically eligible for parole after 10 years.   In his book, ``Terrorism of Lies,'' Blitzer sets out to showthat ``at least one or two'' of Israel's senior leaders ``probablyknew'' that a senior intelligence operative named Rafi Eitan ``wasrunning a spy in Washington.   ``They are simply too experienced in these kinds of matters notto have known or suspected,'' Blitzer wrote.   Among those leaders were then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres andDefense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, both with broad intelligenceexperience, and then Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who was oncea senior operative of the Mossad spy agency.   A copy of the book was made available Tuesday on the eve of anofficial visit by Shamir, now Israel's prime minister, toWashington. The book is to be published next month by Harper andamp; Row.   Pollard's arrest here in November 1985 put a strain onU.S.-Israeli relations and Israel has maintained er since thatits use of him was an unauthorized rogue operation.   ``But even if they suspected that a spy was in place inWashington, they almost certainly did not know his name was Pollard... or any other specific details of the operation,'' Blitzer wrote.   Blitzer, who has been covering the case since the day Pollardshthe Israeli Embassy with his wife asking for asylum,said an Isnvestigator into the affair compared Eitan'sdecision to keep his bosses in the dark to the Reaganadministrat's Iran-Contra affair.   The book surmises that Eitan and other Pollard handlers``apparently assumed, arroglessly, that they wouldnot get caught.''   Blitzer said in an interview that the book is based on thousandsof documents, s with Pollard in jail, anddozens of interviews with his family and friends.   ``Some parts will anger Israel, others will probably anger tUnited States, and some will probably anger Pollard,'' Blitzerto be fair.''   In a chapter titled ``The Cover-Up: Code Name `Siren,'' Blitzerwrites that Israel's governmt scrambled to disavow knowledgehe espionageand give the appearance of full cooperation withAmerican investigators without cooperating to the full extent.   He cites a decision to keep from the Americannd roleof Israeli Air Force Col. Aviem Sella, who recruited Polard in1984 and was subsequently indicted here. ``The high-level decisionto cover up Sella's role was understandable but stupid,'' Blitzer.   To make sure the Americanvestigation team that went to Israelwould not learn about Sella or ask to interview him, Israeliauthorities spirited him outuntry to West Germany,Blitzer te. They falsely dated his passport several days earlierto make it appear he lft before the teBlitzer.   ``West Germany was selected because its customs officials do notroutinely stamp entry dates into visiting Israeli passports,''Blitzer said.   The author also said that former U.S. Defense Secretary Casper hadtold U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson in aclasemo that Pollard had sold Israeldocuments thatould fill a small room.   Among them, Blitzer said, were U.S. satellite photographs of thePalestine Liberat Organization's headquarters in  building in October 1985,a month before Pollard'sarrest, killing 60 people.</TEXT></DOC>
