Schlender (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MOT T SUNW </CO><IN> EDP TNM </IN><TEXT>   Motorola Inc. and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. are expected to announce today an agreement that could defuse much of the controversy surrounding ATandamp;T's stewardship of Unix, an important operating system for minicomputers.    Motorola said it reached an agreement in principle to work with ATandamp;T to develop special extensions to Unix that will make it much easier for applications programs designed for a specific company's machine to run on a competitor's machine, as long as both machines use a Motorola microprocessor. The extensions also will be designed to take advantage of a controversial new &quot;unified&quot; version of Unix that ATandamp;T is developing with Sun Microsystems Inc.    Other computer manufacturers had accused ATandamp;T in recent months of playing favorites by choosing Sun to help it refine and unify Unix. That criticism intensified in January, when ATandamp;T said it would buy as much as a 20% stake in Sun.    The agreement &quot;guarantees that our customers will have the latest possible Unix products with no disadvantages&quot; to Sun or others, said Ed Staiano, a Motorola executive vice president and general manager of its general systems group. Motorola supplies the chips at the heart of 80% of all machines that use Unix.    Even though Unix already is considered a so-called standard operating system that can be purchased cheaply from ATandamp;T, each company that licensed Unix usually customized it to suit its own preferences, resulting in hundreds of slightly incompatible versions. Consequently, a program written for one vendor's Unix had to be rejiggered to run on a competitor's. An operating system acts as the internal traffic cop for a computer, directing the flow of information to and from the keyboard, screen, printer and data storage devices.    ATandamp;T's agreement with Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola is similar to other accords with Sun and with Microsoft Corp. to develop simplified and consistent versions of Unix for families of machines based on other microprocessors. The agreement with Mountain View, Calif.-based Sun will develop a unified version of Unix for machines built around Sun's Sparc microprocessor chip, and the plan with Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash., is to develop a version for all Unix machines that use Intel Corp.'s 80386 microprocessor.    &quot;This levels the playing field considerably,&quot; said Adam Cuhney, a securities analyst for Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. &quot;Without something of this nature, the Unix world might have permanently splintered.&quot;    In January, a group of Unix licensees, including such heavyweights as Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., and Apollo Computer Inc., notified ATandamp;T they weren't pleased with its plans to work exclusively with Sun to develop the new Unix.    According to William Joy, Sun's vice president of technology, the Motorola/ATandamp;T agreement means that, &quot;as a practical matter, Motorola is endorsing&quot; the new version of Unix that Sun and ATandamp;T are working on at a special laboratory in Menlo Park, Calif. &quot;This is great news. I'm surprised it happened this fast.&quot;    Motorola also is expected to announce today that it will purchase an undisclosed stake in Unisoft Group, a U.K.-based software company, to help ensure that it can deliver the extensions by the end of the year. Closely held Unisoft, which is the parent of Unisoft Corp. of Emeryville, Calif., specializes in customizing Unix for computer makers. Most recently, it developed a version of Unix, called A/UX, that allows Apple Computer Inc. Macintosh II computers to run Unix programs.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Motorola's stock closed at $46, down 37.5 cents; ATandamp;T's stock closed at $29, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
