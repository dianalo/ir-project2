When it was first described in 1986, the blood test raisedhopes that a method had been found for screening seeminglyhealthy people for signs of hidden cancers. It also was hopedthat the test might be used to monitor patients who had beentreated for cancer to see if the malignancy had returned.</LP><TEXT>   The test involved taking a small blood sample andsubjecting it to a procedure called nuclear magneticresonance spectroscopy. In this procedure an intense magneticfield causes the protons in the hydrogen atoms of water togive off a detectable signal. Initial tests indicated thetechnique could distinguish between blood samples from cancerpatients and blood samples from healthy persons.   This week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine,however, carries two reports declaring the test producederroneous results in too many cases to be useful. One report,from a team of scientists at Massachusetts General Hospitaland Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that in 52%of cases the test wrongly indicated healthy persons hadcancer and that it failed to identify 56% of patients withcancer. The second report from Norwegian researchersdescribed similar results.   The blood test isn't to be confused with magneticresonance imaging, which gives an image of internal anatomymore detailed than X-rays. It is used to detect malignanttumors.</TEXT></DOC>
