Just one day after announcing a $119 million fiscal year loss,Florida's biggest thrift on Wednesday abandoned a proposal to mergewith Ensign Bank, a financially troubled institution led by cruiseship magnate Ted Arison.   Now, CenTrust is left with unbalanced books, a $1 billionportfolio of high-risk junk bonds and the cost of operating 63branches it hopes to sell to a California thrift.   Some analysts speculated Thursday that federal regulators may beclose to taking over the institution.   ``It looks to me that the time is growing nigh for federalregulators to take over the show,'' said Henry Peltz, a bankinganalyst at Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods in New York.   Meanwhile, state officials are preparing a hearing to seek theouster of CenTrust Chairman David Paul, who is blamed forencouraging the bank's lavish and unorthodox spending, which hasincluded a $30 million museum-quality painting collection, acompany yacht and huge salaries.   Terrence McElroy, a spokesman for the Florida Office ofComptroller, said a hearing date has not been set. CenTrust isappealing a Dec. 20 state order to remove Paul, who had a $4.8million salary from January 1988 to September 1989.   The proposed merger with New York-based Ensign, announced twoweeks ago, was seen as one of few options left by CenTrust to avoidfederal takeover. Arison, estimated to be worth $2.86 billion byForbes magazine, was the deep pocket the thrift needed.   Miami-based banking consultant Kenneth Thomas estimated CenTrustwould need at least $200 million from Arison or from privately heldHamilton Holding Co., Ensign's parent, before it could beconsidered solvent under current federal standards.   Paul and Arison have worked together on several arts projects inMiami.   But the proposed deal was dropped following a chilly receptionfrom federal regulators, according to a statement from CenTrust andEnsign.   Analysts said federal banking regulators are discouragingmergers of troubled thrifts.   ``Their theory is putting two troubled institutions togetherdoesn't solve problems, it just multiplies them,'' said RichardFreeman, at Kemper Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.   Ensign, which has 27 branches in metropolitan New York andFlorida, was more than $140 million insolvent, according to figuresby Sheshunoff Information Services in Austin, Texas.   Arison, majority owner of Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc.and 50 percent of the National Basketball Association's Miami Heat,could not be reached for comment Thursday.   Paul did not return telephone calls to his Miami office, but NewYork-based CenTrust spokesman Roy Winnick said no new plans areexpected ``in the immediate future.''   Thomas said officials from the Office of Thrift Supervision hadenough evidence to take over CenTrust in December, when regulatorsseized control of First American Bank and Trust in Lake Worth andCity Federal Savings Bank of Bedminster, N.J., which had extensiveFlorida real estate holdings.   He estimates CenTrust could be spending more than $100,000 aweek on legal fees to fight the state order to remove Paul andother federal court action concerning CenTrust spending.   In addition, Thomas predicts CenTrust could take another $100million loss this year from defaults and cut-rate sales of its junkbond holdings.   CenTrust is seeking federal approval for a $150 million sale of63 of its 71 branches to Great Western Bank of Beverly Hills.Calif. But some analysts say it is doubtful regulators will allowCenTrust to lose most of its relatively healthy, consumer-orientedoperations.   ``If CenTrust is valuable at all, it will be whole, not inpieces,'' said Thomas.   Moody's Investors Service in December downgraded CenTrust'sbonds and long-term deposits to among its lowest ratings, andpredicted federal intervention.   ``It's a pretty negative situation,'' said Moody's analyst MaraHilderman.</TEXT></DOC>
