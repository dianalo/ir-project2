In Row Over Patent </HL><SO> </SO><CO> DD EUROP </CO><DATELINE> ARNHEM, the Netherlands  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Akzo N.V. said it won a round in its bitter and long-running dispute with Du Pont Co. over Kevlar, a steel-like fiber made by the Wilmington, Del.-based chemical and energy concern.    Akzo, a Dutch chemical company, said a judge in Britain ruled Monday that Du Pont has been violating Akzo's patent in Britain on a key solvent used in manufacturing Akzo's similar aramid fiber. The court said it will outline next month the measures that it will take against Du Pont; such measures could include an import ban, according to Akzo.    John E. Falon, director of Du Pont's industrial products division, said: &quot;We are surprised by the court's ruling and will be reviewing it.&quot; The decision won't affect Du Pont's plans to begin production of Kevlar this summer at its plant currently being built in Northern Ireland, Mr. Falon said. Du Pont exports Kevlar to Britain.    Aramid fibers are synthetic materials that are five times stronger than steel and have growing industrial applications, especially in the automotive, aerospace and construction materials sectors. Du Pont and Akzo are the world's primary manufacturers of aramid fibers. </TEXT></DOC>
