A hearing was convened here yesterday on the issue of whether the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984 passes constitutional muster.    Arthur Liman of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison argued that by freezing assets before trial -- and not exempting from that freeze the payment of attorney's fees -- the government deprives a defendant of both due process and counsel of choice. Those rights are granted by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution.    The law doesn't specifically address the question of attorney's fees. But circuit courts so far have said the law allows the government to freeze a defendant's assets to make them available for forfeiture if the government wins its case.    Mr. Liman, speaking on behalf of three lawyers groups that had jointly presented a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, addressed a 12-member panel of federal judges for the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan and an audience of nearly 200 lawyers at an unusual &quot;en banc&quot; hearing. Such hearings before a full panel of circuit court judges are held only occasionally for cases deemed particularly significant.    The law as passed was intended to bar the transfer to third parties of a defendant's assets after indictment but before trial if the assets are believed to stem from illegal activities. The statute applies only to defendants indicted on federal narcotics or racketeering charges.    Yesterday's hearing was held to reconsider an appeal by Peter Monsanto, one of several defendants on trial in Manhattan on narcotics and racketeering charges. But the panel's ruling on the issue will broadly affect future defendants and defense lawyers' decisions about whether to take on these cases. The law allows the government, on conviction, to demand repayment of attorney's fees paid out of assets found later to be ill-gotten.    Mr. Monsanto currently is standing trial with a court-appointed lawyer because he can't afford to pay for chosen counsel, but for this hearing he was represented by a private lawyer.    Although the law says the government may ask a court to freeze assets based on an indictment, a three-judge panel for the second circuit last December said that a separate, so-called &quot;Monsanto&quot; hearing must be held at which the government must prove it is likely to prevail at trial.    Mr. Liman told the panel yesterday that requiring such a hearing represented an &quot;improvement&quot; to the statute, but he said that the statute as it stands is unconstitutional and Congress should rewrite it.    Another case in which the government has frozen assets is that of Franklyn Chinn, a former personal financial adviser to Attorney General Edwin Meese. In December, Mr. Chinn was charged with racketeering in connection with the Wedtech Corp. influence-peddling case.    A &quot;Monsanto&quot; hearing continues today concerning Mr. Chinn's assets. At this point, he is still represented by private counsel. But Mr. Chinn's attorney, Cristina Arguedas, said that if Mr. Chinn's assets remain inaccessible, she most likely won't be able to continue representing him. </TEXT></DOC>
