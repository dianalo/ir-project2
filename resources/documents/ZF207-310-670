(CSC) told the GeneralServices Administration Board of Contract Appeals all they wanted for Justiceto meet its obligations to intending bidders.andM;CSC is &quot;not seeking to establish any precedents here,&quot; only accountability,CSC attorney Sol Glasner said.andP;  &quot;We are not seeking any new standards here,we're only seeking the enforcement of the existing federal procurementstandards.&quot;andM;&quot;We think this protest is about sending a message to all other agencies: Ifyou have a procurement on the street, we think you ought to skew yourdecisions and stay with your procurement rather than go to FTS 2000, becauseif you don't, you've got a protest on your hands,&quot; ATandamp;T attorney D. MichaelFitzhugh said.andM;Justice officials dropped the JTN procurement in March before receiving thebids and chose to use FTS 2000.andP;  GSA previously had killed the JTN delegationof procurement authority.andM;CSC protested the cancellation, claiming Justice had an implied contract withthe company and the department had mismanaged JTN from the beginning.andP;  TheCSC protest said Justice officials never intended to award the $50million-plus contract.andM;CSC asked the board to pay for JTN preparations costs, legal expenses anddamages.andP;  The board must issue an opinion in the protest early next month.andM;The protest goes beyond whether agencies should use FTS 2000, said GSAattorney Anthony L. Washington.andP;  The vendors are asking the government andtaxpayers to pay for an acknowledged business risk in marketing to thefederal government, he said.andP;  &quot;If the board ruled for CSC on any of thegrounds of the protest, the decision would indeed be monumental,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;The JTN was an insurance policy for the department, and the vendors wereasked to pay the premiums,&quot; Glasner said.andP;  Justice kept JTN alive to ensuresome network could be implemented should FTS 2000 falter, he said.andM;&quot;In effect, what the department was doing was engaging in a horse race,&quot;Glasner said.andP;  &quot;Whichever one reached the finish line first was the winner.&quot;andM;On the technical front, Justice's witnesses said the FTS 2000 requirements donot match all the JTN requirements.andM;CSC's attorneys disagreed.andP;  JTN called for link encryption while the FTS 2000contract provides only end-to-end encryption, a much less rigoroustechnology, they said.andM;The GSA and Justice's technical advisers &quot;assured me Justice's securityrequirements would be met by FTS 2000 and other contractual alternativesavailable to GSA,&quot; said Stephen R. Colgate, deputy assistant attorneygeneral.andM;Last summer, link encryption was the only security commonly available on themarket to meet Justice's requirements, testified Frank A. Guglielmo, directorof Justice's computer technology and telecommunications staff.andP;  But thetechnical boom early this year of end-to-end encryption made its use morefeasible, he said.andM;GSA also told Justice the FTS 2000 network would use fiber-optic cablingextensively, which would provide security against tapping into the network,he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
