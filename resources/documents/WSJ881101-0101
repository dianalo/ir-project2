The settlement would be paid to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which inherited claims against the insurers as part of its 1984 bailout of Continental, and to former Continental shareholders, who in 1982 sued the banking concern and its top executives alleging mismanagement and failure to disclose its financial problems.    The split is about 77% to the FDIC and 23% to former holders, according to Lowell Sachnoff, a Chicago attorney for the FDIC. He said that all but one of the insurers, CNA Financial Corp., had agreed to settlement terms. The payment would be the biggest directors-and-officers settlement the FDIC has ever won, Mr. Sachnoff said. FDIC officials couldn't be reached for comment.    The other insurers are Harbor Insurance Co.; Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck and Co.; National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh; and First State Underwriters Agency of New England Reinsurance Co.    The case against the insurers had been scheduled to go to trial in federal court here tomorrow.    The settlement, if completed, would put an end to the massive, six-year-old Continental shareholder litigation. Individual defendants, including Roger E. Anderson, former chairman and chief executive officer, settled the litigation against them and assigned to the FDIC the right to press a bad-faith claim against the insurers for refusal to pay on the policy.    The insurers had sued Continental and the executives in 1985, seeking to void some coverage and alleging the bank covered up its financial problems to obtain increased coverage. Continental countersued, seeking to enforce the policy.    The terms must be approved by federal Judge John F. Grady, who oversaw the original shareholder suit, and that will likely take several months, FDIC lawyers said, because holders have to be notified of the terms.    According to Mr. Sachnoff, Harbor already has paid $15 million. Allstate would pay $9.2 million, National Union about $28 million, and First State about $2.6 million. The FDIC is asking CNA to pay about $6.4 million, though CNA hasn't agreed to that. CNA officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment.    A lawyer for National Union said the settlement talks are continuing, and declined to comment further. Allstate officials also declined to comment. First State officials couldn't be reached. </TEXT></DOC>
