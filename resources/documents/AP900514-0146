(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Neither time nor distance wipe outchild support obligations, the Florida Supreme Court told aVirginia woman who was abandoned nearly 22 years ago while pregnantwith her third child.   The result of the woman's long, draining legal battle isexpected to affect family courts in other states, some attorneyssaid Monday.   ``The biggest thing I feel is a sense of satisfaction,''Patricia Bennett, 44, of Springfield, Va., said. ``It was atremendous amount of work, (but) this will affect thousands.''   Bennett, a non-lawyer who represented herself in oral argumentsbefore Florida's high court more than two years ago, said shethinks last week's decision could be followed by courts in otherstates. She listed California, Texas, Ohio, and West Virginia asstates that remain havens for delinquent parents.   In its ruling, the Supreme Court said that Florida judges canjail for contempt parents who have not paid out-of-state childsupport awards and that back child support awards must be paid,even after children become adults.   Attorneys who filed friends of the court briefs supportingBennett's case agreed with her Monday that the ruling wassignificant both legally and symbolically.   ``Legally, of course, this decision is only binding in the stateof Florida,'' said Sally Goldfarb of New York, a staff attorney forthe NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. ``But frequently infamily law matters, courts look to the decisions of other states inorder to get insights.''   ``Because so many out-of-state cases are mentioned we suspect itwill have national prominence,'' said Joe Boyd of Tallahassee, whorepresents the state Department of Health and RehabilitativeServices.   But also important is the message the ruling sends to delinquentparents, the two attorneys said.   ``The court forcefully and eloquently stated that child supportobligations become stronger with time and that no parent should bepermitted to turn his back on the children whom he abandoned,''Goldfarb said.   ``I guess `Read my lips' is what the Florida Supreme Court hassaid,'' Boyd said.   Bennett and her ex-husband, Oscar Gibson, were married in 1964;five years later he disappeared. In 1985, Bennett found him livingwith a different name and a different wife in rural Lutz, Fla., andher legal struggle to get back child support from him resumed.   Bennett's daughters now are 21, 22 and 23. The eldest has a16-month-old son. A CBS movie called ``Runaway Father,'' based onher story, is being made.   Once children reach 18, parents who raised them are ``notmagically reimbursed for personal funds spent nor debts incurreddue to nonpayment of child support,'' Justice Gerald Kogan wrote inThursday's majority opinion.   ``Hardships suffered by a family do not disappear,'' Kogan said.``A family's feelings of indignation from abandonment by thenonpaying parent or from past reliance on public assistance are notforgotten.''   Bennett received welfare for two years after Gibson left her.But since then, however, she has earned a bachelor's degree and amaster's degree in business adminstration. She works now as afinancial analyst for the Internal Revenue Service and has appliedto law school.   Bennett's ex-husband, now known as James Parker, has been making$100 payments every week since 1987. But the insurance claimsadjuster said he'd have to make payments to wipe out $148,536 inback payments, interest and expenses a Virginia court said he owes.   ``Probably until I'm dead,'' Parker said.   Mark Kelly, who represented Parker, said he thought the ruling``really gives the party (trying to collect) twice as much leverageas they had before.''</TEXT></DOC>
