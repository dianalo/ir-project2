 -- Despite the variety of multimedia-related productsthat have been released or announced during the past year, severaltechnological and legal obstacles still prevent multimedia publishing frombecoming the next great market opportunity for the Mac.andP;  And until thoseobstacles are dismantled, according to multimedia developers attendingSeybold Seminars' Digital World conference here in June, multimedia willremain a buzzword.andM;On the legal side.andP;  Content -- and who controls that content -- is still thekey to multimedia publishing, according to representatives from Apple, TheVoyager Company of Santa Monica, Calif., and New York-based ABC NewsInterActive.andM;Scott Mize, Apple's multimedia content evangelist, defined the new breed ofmedia producers as creative professionals from the film, video and audioworlds who will form &quot;a new type of collaboration&quot; to produce interactivemultimedia titles.andM;But multimedia producers probably will fall into two groups when it comes tocontent: the haves and the have-nots.andM;One &quot;have&quot; is ABC News InterActive, a division of the TV network speciallyformed to produce interactive videodiscs for the education market.andP;  Duringthe past year, ABC has released several HyperCard-driven discs, including&quot;The '88 Vote: Campaign for the White House,&quot; &quot;In the Holy Land&quot; and &quot;MartinLuther King Jr.&quot; Later this summer, it will release a disc about AIDS.andM;The reason ABC could set up the division was because it already owned vastarchives of film footage.andP;  And because the network is in the business ofproducing visual news, it already has the facilities and resources to producevideodiscs, according to Executive Producer David Bohrman.andP;  &quot;The hardest partof what we're doing is conceptualizing what should be within this limitedamount of space [on the videodisc],&quot; Bohrman said.andM;But for the &quot;have-nots,&quot; multimedia publishing can be a nightmare.andP;  Acquiringthe rights to a film clip, a photograph or a piece of music, and negotiatinglicensing fees for distribution sometimes can make projects impossible.andM;Voyager President Bob Stein, whose company distributes laser discs andCD-ROMs, discussed his company's efforts to license a few minutes from an oldMGM film.andP;  &quot;Basically, they told us that the licensing fee wouldn't covertheir legal expenses to work out a license agreement.andP;  The single biggestbarrier to multimedia publishing is to figure out what the material is worthin this new medium,&quot; Stein said.andM;On the tech side.andP;  Apple's multimedia push leans toward turning average Macusers into producers of their own presentations.andP;  To make that happen, usersneed tools that allow them to handle sound and video as easily as text andgraphics.andP;  Some of these tools will be built into future Mac operatingsystems, while others will be developed by third parties.andP;  Both types oftools are being worked on now and should make their appearance within thenext year.andM;Tyler Peppel, Apple manager of the Media Integration Products Group, talkedabout future operating systems that can handle not only multiple data typesbut also time-based events, so that the data can be synchronized in apresentation.andM;As part of its commitment, Apple is readying QuickTime, a multimedia documentarchitecture that will provide developers with standard interfaces forcontrolling media devices such as videotape recorders and CD-ROMs as well asfor communications between various media data types.andP;  It is due out thisyear.andM;Apple also is investigating video compression technologies (see &quot;Coping withthe size, speed of video data,&quot; MacWEEK, July 31).andM;On the software side, both Farallon Computing Inc.'s Kubrick and MediaMakerfrom Max Whitby, director of the London-based MultiMedia Corp., which will bepublished by San Francisco-based MacroMind Inc., are due this year.andP;  Each isa low-cost application that lets users manipulate video using point-and-clickediting.andM;&quot;Tools for professionals are a good thing,&quot; Peppel said.andP;  &quot;But tools forindividuals are the next frontier.&quot;andM;While not every Mac user will want to become a multimedia producer, themultimedia technology is pushing users toward new ways to communicate withtheir computers -- from sound-annotated files to complex, hypertext-basedapplications.andM;Said Mize, &quot;What we see is the computer as media -- being used as both acommunication and a publishing medium.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
