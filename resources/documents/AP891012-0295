(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With floppy ears, flaccid faces and fatstomachs, the beauty of Chinese swine is in the eyes of theirscientist-beholders, who see them as a key to breeding efficient``super pigs'' of the future.   U.S. researchers hope to unlock the secret of large litters fromthese porkers of the Orient, and incorporate that trait intodomestic hogs. It would be an important breakthrough forscientists, who already have bred hogs that grow faster and produceleaner meat.   ``Litter size hasn't changed much in 30 years, but we're nowherenear the limit,'' said David McLaren, a University of Illinoisanimal scientist and member of the research team.   The brown Meishan and Fengjing sows wean about 15 pigs, and theblack Minzhu nearly that number _ about twice as many as most U.S.sows.   Scientists will try to determine exactly why these Chinese pigshave such large litters. Then, they hope to use conventionalbreeding or genetic engineering to give U.S. pigs more offspring.   They hope the result will be available to commercial producersin five to 10 years. Increasing the number of weaned pigs to 11 persow would save U.S. pork producers about $78 million a year throughlower production costs, university scientists say.   For example, Illinois sows now wean about eight pigs per litter.If Chinese pigs could be used to produce a new sow that could wean11 pigs, researchers estimate pork producers' costs would dropabout $9 a hog.   ``This is not like going down to your friendly, local breederand buying a boar,'' said Robert Easter, an animal nutritionist andmember of the research team. ``This is something new.''   The 47 Chinese pigs here are among 140 purchased from China andimported in March after more than six years of battling bureacraticobstacles.   The pigs cost $11,000 each, including delivery, and the expensewas shared by the University of Illinois, Iowa State University andthe federal government. Some of the pigs are at Iowa State and atthe U.S. Department of Agriculture livestock research station inNebraska.   The Chinese pigs at the University of Illinois share quarterswith sleek, white U.S. Yorkshire hogs in the school's new,$2-million, state-of-the-art swine research facility that includesa solar heating system. But that is all the pigs have in common.   The Yorkshires are as solid as the Chinese pigs are flabby. Theythrash about and squeal loudly for food, while the Chinese pigs arequiet.   ``These Chinese pigs are so docile and nonaggressive, they'llwork out the pecking order (with the U.S. pigs) in a short time,''McLaren said.   U.S pigs, which grow quickly, are bred for meat production andthe Yorkshires are known for heavy muscle _ big pork chops andhams. The Chinese pigs mature slowly and are too fat for domesticmeat standards.   Chinese pigs also are nearly blind, because the wrinkles oftheir faces cover their eyes.   Scientists are breeding the Chinese pigs to each other toincrease the number of animals to work with. The first Chinese pigsshould be born here in January. Then, the Chinese will becross-bred with Yorkshires.   Scientists from 13 disciplines will study every aspect of theChinese pigs, including what food makes them grow the fastest andleanest, and whether growth-enhancers will help.   ``We're talking about turning out an animal that's the pig ofthe future,'' said Easter.</TEXT></DOC>
