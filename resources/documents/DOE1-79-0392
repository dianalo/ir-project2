Experimentalset up as well as characteristics for 2{pi}- or 4{pi}-geometry measurementsare reported. Specially the determination of the counting efficiencyin the 2{pi}-geometry and unfolding of initial multiplicity distributionsproceedings from the experimentally measured ones are discussed. Theemployed method of unfolding was based on an approximation of the multiplicitydistributions by convolutions of model probability distributions, whoseparameters were selected from the conditions of the experimental momentadescriptions. The Poya generalized distribution was found to be the mostadvantageous and producing the best description of the experimental data.</TEXT></DOC>
