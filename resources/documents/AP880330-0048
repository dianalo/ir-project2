Marking that long-ago foothold, Sweden is putting on a travelingshow of their emigrants' contributions that range from the zipperand Coca Cola bottle to ball bearings and monkey wrenches.   The year-long celebration will begin with a 14-city U.S. tour inApril by King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia.   Swedish settlers disembarked on the shores of the Delaware Riveron March 29, 1638, 18 years after the Pilgrims landed farther northat Plymouth Rock, Mass. At its peak, ``New Sweden'' had 500 people,but within 17 years the Swedes lost their colony to the Dutch whothen lost it to the British.   ``It's not much to celebrate. We are a peaceful people and eventhen we had no knack for colonial work,'' said historian Per Sorbomof Uppsala University.   ``But it's a good excuse to make Sweden a little more known inthe United States and to give Sweden an identity,'' said Sorbom,who has organized an exhibition of inventions and innovations bySwedish emigrants.   Sorbom's ``It's Swedish'' exhibition will open April 19 inChicago and move in the autumn to Los Angeles.   About 1,000 exhibitions, music festivals, seminars and otherevents are planned in the United States for the celebrations called``New Sweden 88.''   They include a display of the Swedish crown jewels in Washingtonand tributes to Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat creditedwith saving 100,000 Hungarian Jews from Nazi death camps in WorldWar II. Wallenberg disappeared toward the end of the war and thereare occasional reports that he is still alive in a Soviet laborcamp after being seized by advancing Soviet troops. The Sovietsinsist he is dead.   Though the Swedes' Delaware colony had little impact on Americanhistory, it was the first page of Nordic emigration.   In the 19th century, before Sweden became industrialized,emigrants fled poor farmlands that could not sustain the growingpopulation.   By 1900, 1 million people or one-quarter of the world's Swedishpopulation lived in the United States. The number of Americans ofSwedish descent has grown to 4.3 million, compared to Sweden'spopulation of 8.4 million.   Among the Swedish immigrants are many whose names have beenvirtually forgotten but not their contributions. They include:   Alexander Samuelsson. A glassblower from Goteborg who emigratedin 1883, he won a design contest for a company selling its fizzydrink at soda fountains.   Coca Cola wanted a bottle ``that would be recognizable even ifit was broken in the gutter,'' said Sorbom, and Samuelsson's designis still in use.   Justus Sjoberg. He moved to Chicago from Goteborg and changedhis name to Seeburg. He is credited with inventing the parkingmeter and the jukebox.   Gideon Sundbach. In the early 1900s he patented the modernzipper.   C.E. ``Measurement'' Johansson. His gauges for steelmakingbecame an essential element of Henry Ford's assembly line.   Sorbon said other displays in his exhibition range from safetymatches to heart pacemakers to the Hasselblad cameras used byAmerican astronauts who landed on the moon.</TEXT></DOC>
