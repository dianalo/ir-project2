(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   United Parcel Service of America, Inc.,wasted no time letting customers know it was business as usualafter the Teamsters union announced its truck drivers and packagehandlers had ratified a new, three-year contract.   UPS account executives started calling or visiting the company's1.1 million daily pickup customers Monday to tell them the news,said UPS spokesman Ken Sternad. Delivery drivers will start handingout notices to delivery customers today.   A strike threat that had surfaced during the negotiations forcedUPS customers and competitors to come up with alternate deliveryplans, and Sternad said it was too early to determine what effectthat would have on business.   ``We're going to offer the same service we always have, andhopefully that will be enough to convince anybody that may haveheld off during this period that they'll stay with us,'' he said.   Some customers had begun shifting their business to the U.S.Postal Service or Roadway Package System, Inc., of Pittsburgh,UPS's two main ground-delivery competitors.   Union members voted 65,463 to 53,091 in favor of the contract,or 55 percent to 45 percent, Teamsters President William J.McCarthy said Monday in a statement from union headquarters inWashington.   About 146,000 UPS workers nationwide are covered by thecontract, which is retroactive to Aug. 1.   The contract includes a one-time $1,000 bonus to full-timeworkers, hourly wage increases totalling $1.50 an hour over threeyears and increased company contributions to health benefits.   McCarthy did not say what provisions the union leadership foundinadequate. Repeated telephone calls to his office were notreturned.   In his statement, McCarthy charged that Greenwich-based UPS``went to unprecedented lengths'' to win ratification.   ``In the final outcome, I believe that many of the company'semployees were frightened by management's ability to use permanentreplacement workers, or scabs, in the possible event of a strike,''McCarthy said.   UPS said last week that it did not plan to hire replacementworkers. Company spokesman Ken Sternad said he wouldn't comment onMcCarthy's assertions.   ``The bottom line is we made what we felt was a good offer andit was accepted,'' Sternad said. ``All the other words areunnecessary.''   Teamsters officials began counting ballots Friday, and UPSofficials spent the weekend awaiting results. The union had askedfor a 10-day extension to gather the ballots just before the oldcontract expired July 31.   The Teamsters had agreed Friday to go back to the bargainingtable if the contract was rejected, despite a threat of anationwide strike early in the negotiations, Sternad said.   UPS, the world's largest package handler, delivers more than 10million packages a day, and made 2.8 billion deliveries in 1989 for$12.4 billion in revenue. It's total work force is 230,000.   The contract will increase the hourly wage for the highest paidworkers from $16.10 an hour to $17.60 an hour by August 1992. Thecontract also calls for a cost-of-living allowance of up to 20cents an hour, per year, depending on inflation, Sternad said.   Part-time workers, who start at $8 or $9 an hour, will alsoreceive an additional $1.50 hour over three years, Sternad said.   Company contributions for health benefits and employees'pensions will increase from an average of $8,300 a year forfull-time workers to an average of $10,500 during the life of thecontract, Sternad said.   The proposal also includes the bonus, to be paid within thefirst month of ratification, of $1,000 to full-timers and $500 topart-timers, he said.   Improvements to working conditions in the contract includereplacement of worn-out truck seats with more comfortableair-suspension seats and easier-to-handle dollies.   The contract affects only U.S. workers. UPS has 12,000 to 13,000employees outside the United States, Sternad said.   There has never been a national strike against UPS, which hashad a national Teamsters contract since 1979, but sporadic workstoppages and strikes have occurred regionally.   The latest and biggest was in 1976, when 18,000 workers in 15Northeast states walked out for 13 weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
