After consultations under the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT) on February 25, 1982, the United States requesteda GATT dispute settlement panel on March 31, 1982. On August 17, 1982,the President directed USTR to expedite dispute settlement (47 FR 36403).After several GATT panel meetings and report revisions, a final panel reportfavorable to the United States was issued on July 20, 1984. The panel foundthat the production aids granted to processors of canned fruit nullifiedand impaired tariff concessions granted by the EC on those products, andthe panel suggested that the EC restore the competitive relationship betweenimported U.S. and domestic EC canned fruit. The United States requestedadoption of the panel report in GATT Council meetings of April 30, May29, June 4 and July 16, 1985, but Council action was deferred because theEC was not prepared to accept adoption of the report.On September 7, 1985, the President directed USTR to recommend section301 retaliation unless this case was resolved by December 1, 1985. On November30, 1985, the U.S. and the EC reached a settlement under which, in additionto subsidy reductions already implemented on canned pears, the EC agreedto eliminate the canning element of its processing subsidies for cannedpeaches. USTR closely monitored implementation of this agreement from 1986-1988.In August 1988, the United States informed the EC Commission that new subsidylevels implemented in July 1988 exceeded allowable levels under the agreement.Since October 1988 USTR had been consulting with the EC regarding boththe new subsidy levels and the methodology for calculation of its subsides,but the EC continued to subsidize at levels which are inconsistent withthe agreement.Pursuant to section 302(b)(1)(A) of the Trade Act, the USTR determinedon May 8, 1989, that an investigation under section 302 should be initiatedwith respect to the EC policy and practice in this matter, in order todetermine whether it was actionable under section 301 (54 FR 20219). Apublic hearing regarding this matter was held June 9, 1989, where testimonyof interested persons was heard.Consultations with the EC on this matter resulted in a resolution thatincludes three elements. First, beginning July 1, 1989, the EC loweredits 1989/90 subsidy rates for canned peaches and pears to comply with theterms of the 1985 Canned Fruit Agreement. Second, U.S. and EC officialsclarified their interpretation of that Agreement to forestall future disputes.Finally, the EC Commission has modified its regulations to limit cannedpeach and pear subsides in future years. In accordance with the GATT panel report, the Trade Representative determinedpursuant to section 304 of the Trade Act that rights of the United Statesunder the GATT were being denied by EC processing subsidies, but the TradeRepresentative has determined, under section 301(a)(2), that the EC istaking satisfactory measures to grant the rights of the United States underthe GATT. Accordingly, the two investigations arising from the EC practiceswith respect to canned fruit production subsidies are terminated.<ITAG tagnum="6">A.
