Backers of the Americans With Disabilities Act say the bill hasregained momentum after a nearly four-month interruption thatincluded adjournment of Congress. Supporters had planned on fullpassage before Christmas.   The bill would grant disabled people equal employmentopportunity, although business with fewer than 15 employees wouldbe exempted. It also would grant equal access to transportation,telephone service, business and entertainment, and professionalservices.   On March 6, a subcommittee of the House Public Works andTransportation Committee sent the Senate-passed bill to the fullcommittee after modifications favorable to the transportationindustry.   The House Education and Labor Committee approved the bill lastNovember on a 35-0 vote, adding only a clarification sought by thebusiness community on the status of drug users.   More importantly, the House Energy and Commerce Committeereported the bill last week on a 40-3 vote with no amendments tothe Senate-passed version except for more compromises overtransportation requirements.   The recent actions mean that only the Judiciary and Public Worksand Transportation committees must act on the bill before it goesto the House floor.   ``We are confident that the Americans With Disabilities Act willbe enacted into law in either April or May of this year,'' saidRalph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference onCivil Rights, a coalition of civil rights groups.   The National Federation of Independent Business, thesmall-business advocacy group that is trying to change the billsubstantially, says it has made gains through lobbying at the grassroots level and in Congress.   To that end, NFIB in February persuaded the House Small BusinessCommittee to conduct a hearing on the bill even though it lacksjurisdiction. Among witnesses were businessmen in wheelchairs whosaid they objected to portions of the legislation.   ``I think that we're making progress and I think that themomentum is shifting somewhat,'' NFIB lobbyist David K. Rehr said.   Rehr said both Democrats and Republicans in the House arelooking at the bill's economic impact more critically than theSenate did when the bill passed that chamber, 76-8, in September.   The supporters of the bill say business concerns were consideredat every step. The bill provides long timetables forimplementation, a number of exemptions and a promise of technicalguidance, supporters say.   They say the bill's costs will be offset by more disabledAmericans entering the economic mainstream and depending less ongovernment payments.   The NFIB and others contend the bill is laden with legalabstractions that will force the typical Main Street proprietor tospend even more on lawyers' fees, both inside and outside of court.   NFIB also wants a tax credit for businesses that accommodatedisabled employees or customers. The group argues that thedisabilities bill is the only civil rights legislation that imposesa direct cost on business.   But those issues will be set aside until a bigger one involvingthe White House is resolved. Vocal White House support helped movethe bill through the Senate and helped win over Republicans in theHouse.   When disabled activists demonstrated at the Capitol last week _many of them later to be arrested in their wheelchairs for acts ofcivil disobedience _ Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told them:   ``We are 25 years late in having a civil rights bill for thedisabled. We understand that.''   Hoyer's oblique reference to the Civil Rights Act of 1964pointed to the new threat. The same civil rights community thatbacks the disabilities law as a logical and morally necessaryextension of the 1964 act also backs the Civil Rights Act of 1990,which was introduced in February.   The new law would change Title VII of the landmark 1964 law tomake it possible to sue employers for damages if they intentionallydiscriminate against blacks, other minorities and women.   Title VII currently limits relief to non-damage remedies, suchas back pay and injunctive relief, that could be awarded by a judge.   The disabilities bill refers directly to Title VII as the sourceof relief for job discrimination against the disabled.   The Bush administration opposes the modification to the civilrights act and has asked that the Title VII reference be strippedfrom the disabilities bill. Instead, the specific remedies would bespelled out.</TEXT></DOC>
