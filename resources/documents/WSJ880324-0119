But merely scheduling the meeting may be enough to get OPEC through the current world-wide oil-pricing crunch, industry officials said. &quot;This signals to the market that OPEC is concerned oil prices are getting too low,&quot; said Thomas Burns, manager of the economics staff at Chevron Corp.    The call for the meeting came yesterday from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, apparently at the urging of Saudi Arabia, which had previously opposed it.    Mr. Lukman, the Nigerian oil minister, made his announcement at a widely expected news conference in Lagos, Nigeria, after it had been postponed from Tuesday. He said that the influential committee of five ministers would meet in Vienna early next month. &quot;The April meeting will review the market and decide if any action {is} necessary to stabilize prices,&quot; Mr. Lukman said.    A short time later, the Saudi Arabian government officially announced that Hisham Nazer, the oil minister, had called for an &quot;immediate meeting of the committee&quot; because of misinterpretations of an earlier statement this week by King Fahd regarding the kingdom's pricing and production policies.    In calling for the meeting, Mr. Nazer strongly denied reports by a number of publications, including The Wall Street Journal, that the Saudi government had confirmed price discounting by the kingdom. He added that reports this week that King Fahd had indicated Saudi Arabia would discount from OPEC prices were &quot;interpretations that run counter to reality.&quot;    The calling of the meeting, nevertheless, sent prices surging on world oil markets. On the European spot market, the North Sea Brent grades rose between 35 cents and 50 cents a barrel, with crude for April delivery closing at $15.20. On the U.S. futures market, West Texas Intermediate crude rose sharply to close at $16.86, up 49 cents, in New York Mercantile Exchange trading.    Although the price monitoring committee is made up of oil ministers of OPEC's most powerful countries, including Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, it cannot take any official action except to call an emergency conference of all 13 member countries. OPEC and industry sources ruled out such a development, largely because of the approaching of Ramadan, the Moslem holy period that calls for a month of fasting. In addition, OPEC already is scheduled to hold a regular meeting of all the oil ministers beginning June 8.    A spokesman for OPEC at its Vienna headquarters insisted that the committee meeting will be &quot;only routine.&quot; He added: &quot;You shouldn't expect an announcement of any steps to deal with the (pricing) situation.&quot;    Although Mr. Lukman didn't rule out further production cuts, he said the committee will discuss reports of the audits of OPEC production by a Dutch accounting firm. As previously reported, these audits will show that the exporters have been keeping within their production quotas.    But Mr. Lukman blamed non-OPEC producers for the turbulence in oil markets that has dropped some oil prices by as much as $4 a barrel since December. He said this overproduction piled on as much as one million barrels a day of world-wide production from outside OPEC. There were indications yesterday that OPEC will make new appeals to other producers for cooperation in keeping a lid on oil production. Mexico, which isn't a member of OPEC, is a particular target, along with Egypt, the Soviet Union and other producers.    &quot;OPEC is in no panic mood,&quot; Mr. Lukman said. He also predicted that world oil prices will climb because Western buyers have drawn down inventories to less-than-comfortable levels.    Many in the industry maintain that levels of oil inventories are still too high. But they note that demand for crude oil remains relatively buoyant, at least in the U.S., and that refiners continue relatively high operations because of available supplies of crude at market-related prices from OPEC.    &quot;Inventories are reasonably under control,&quot; said Dewey Mark, executive vice president of San Antonio, Texas-based Diamond Shamrock Refining andamp; Marketing Co., who is among those expecting a strong gasoline season this year.    Although market psychology still is the unknown, industry sources also generally agree with Mr. Lukman that the oil price declines may have run their course, so long as OPEC keeps production in the current range of 17 million to 18 million barrels a day. &quot;Our guess is that prices are near the bottom,&quot; said Chevron's Mr. Burns. &quot;We don't see the inexorable downward pressure that would be required to carry prices below the $15 level.&quot;    And G.H. Babikian, president of the Arco Petroleum Products division of Atlantic Richfield Co., told a San Antonio energy conference yesterday: &quot;We think prices will remain in the $18-$20 range in real (inflation-adjusted) terms for the next four to five years and then gradually increase.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
