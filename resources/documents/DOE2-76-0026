The device consists of: a firstdetecting means for detecting a degree of opening of the throttle valve;a second detecting means for detecting a flow of intake air in the intakeair passage in units of a certain physical quantity; a third detectingmeans for detecting whether or not the engine is operating in a steadystate; means for estimating a load of the engine from an output of thefirst detecting means in accordance with a predetermined estimation toprovide a load estimation value represented by the units; learning meansfor correcting the load estimation value provided by the estimating meansbased on the output of the second detecting means when the third detectingmeans detects that the engine is operating in a steady state; and meansfor calculating an amount of fuel to be injected in response to the mostrecently corrected load estimation value obtained from the output ofthe first detecting means.</TEXT></DOC>
