Don Pope of the holding company said Tuesday the ``informal,routine investigation'' began shortly after an announcement June 2that Burlington Northern was splitting in two.   The probe was sparked by an ``abnormally high trading volume''before the move, especially on May 17 and 23, he said.   Pope said corporate attorneys told him that although they don'tknow the focus of the investigation, they have ``no indications''that any Burlington Northern officer is a subject of the probe.   Burlington Northern Railroad separated from energy, timber andreal estate operations, which were spun off into a new concern,Burlington Resources.   On July 7, in accordance with an earlier announcement, 20 millioncommon shares representing 13 percent of Burlington Resources weresold at $25.50 a share. The remaining 87 percent of the shares areto be distributed to Burlington Northern shareholders Dec. 31.   Analysts said the move was intended to boost the value ofBurlington Northern stock and make a takeover bid less likely.   Burlington Northern chairman Richard M. Bresler has said thesplit was arranged partly because companies in one line of businesshad become preferred over conglomerates.   ``The objective here is to enhance shareholder value by creatingtwo very viable companies _ one in transportation and one inresources,'' he told The New York Times on June 3.   Illegal insider trading could result in civil action by the SEC,criminal charges brought by the Justice Department or both.   Burlington Northern is cooperating in the probe and has hired theWashington, D.C., law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver andamp;Jacobson, which represented former Wall Street mega-speculator IvanBoesky in a record $100 million insider trading settlement with theSEC, he added.   On May 23 Burlington Northern Inc. was listed as the 13th mostactive stock on the New York Stock Exchange with 734,900 sharestraded and closed at $57.875, down $2.375.   On May 17 the stock missed the most active list with a volume of273,800 shares and closed at $62.25, down $1.625.   On June 2, when the spinoff was announced, volume was about 2.7million shares as the stock rose $1.75 to close at $69.125.   SEC investigators have requested ``information on the eventsleading up to the announcement,'' Pope said   In addition, James Schropp of Fried, Frank, said investigatorsrequested the names of all Burlington Northern officials who wereinvolved in the deal and questioned William Pontius, vice presidentof Glacier Park Co., the main real estate subsidiary.   Pontius was not accused of any wrongdoing but was asked aboutpeople outside the company who might have been involved in trading,Schropp said.   ``It was felt that Mr. Pontius could shed light on thatquestion,'' he said without elaborating.</TEXT></DOC>
