It was the first official government apology for its handling ofthe citizens' uprising, the worst in modern South Korean history.   President Roh Tae-woo, who took office Feb. 25 with promises ofreform, pledged during his campaign to change the government'sofficial account of the violence and offer financial compensationfor victims.   ``The government offers its sincere apology, not only to thevictims of the turmoil, but also to all residents of Kwangju andthe general public,'' Culture and Information Minister Chung Han-mosaid in a statement Friday.   Chung, the official government spokesman, also said theresistance was ``part of the democratization efforts of thestudents and citizens in Kwangju'' in a concession demanded by cityresidents.   His description sharply departed from the stand taken by thegovernment of former President Chun Doo-hwan, which used the terms``rebellion'' and ``rioters'' to describe what happened in Kwangju.   The city, 200 miles south of Seoul, is the capital of oppositionleader Kim Dae-jung's home province, South Cholla.   He was arrested in a government crackdown on opposition leadersMay 17, 1980, when the former military-controlled governmentexpanded martial law and moved to suppress political dissent.   Most pro-democracy demonstrations elsewhere in the country werequashed, but the struggle in Kwangju led the government to movemartial law troops into the city.   Kwangju citizens, armed with rifles and machine guns taken fromgovernment arsenals, drove out troops. However, reinforcementsretook the city nine days later.   By official count, 191 people were killed and more than 800hurt. Dissident sources put the casualty figure much higher.   The government spokesman said Friday that Roh believed asatisfactory resolution of the Kwangju issue was essential topromoting national reconciliation. Others have said Roh is tryingto distance himself from the authoritarian Chun government toprepare for National Assembly elections at the end of the month.   Roh, a former general and schoolmate of Chun, helped the formerpresident gain power in 1980.   The government spokesman said the administration would offerfinancial support and employment to bereaved families and woundedvictims. The government also vowed to beautify a cemetery wheremany of the Kwangju victims are buried.   Civic leaders in Kwangju welcomed the government's offer offinancial aid.   But they have insisted that the government investigate the causeof the deaths and punish those responsible. The main oppositionpolitical group, the Reunification Democratic Party, called thegovernment measures a sham.   Government officials, however, have said an inquiry would onlyaggravate old wounds.</TEXT></DOC>
