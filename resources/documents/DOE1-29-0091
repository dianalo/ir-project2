Tripeptides with X = Ala, Leu, Phe, andTrp have been examined. Lipid {sup 2}H NMR spectra of acyl chain perdeuteriatedDMPC ([{sup 2}H{sub 54}]DMPC) show that the addition of peptide disordersthe bilayer lipid acyl chains and that the extent of the perturbationincreases as the size of the central residue increases. Moment analysesof the spectra indicate that, while the average acyl chain order parameterdecreases with increasing central residue size, the order parameter spreadacross the bilayer (the mean-squared width of the distribution) increases.Lipid segmental {sup 2}H longitudinal relaxation rates, 1/T{sub 1}(i),exhibit a square-law functional dependence on S/sub CD/(i) both withand without the addition of peptide. The addition of peptide causes anincrease in the slope of plots of 1/T{sub 1}(i) vs. absolute value S/subCD/(i){sub 2} with little change in the 1/T{sub 1}(i) intercept, indicatinga complex modulation of the acyl chain motions. {sup 2}H NMR spectraof Ala-[{sup 2}H{sub 4}]Ala-Ala-O-tert-butyl in DMPC bilayers have bothisotropic and powder pattern components that vary as a function of temperature.At 30{sup 0}C the {sup 2}H spin-lattice relaxation time for the labeledAla residue increase in going from bilayer-incorporated peptide to polycrystallinepeptide to polycrystalline Ala x HCl. These experiments provide no informationon the location of these peptides in the bilayer. If they protrude intothe hydrocarbon core, their disordering influence can be attributed toa direct disruption of acyl chain packing.</TEXT></DOC>
