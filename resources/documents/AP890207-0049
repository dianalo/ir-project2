I have to laugh,'' said Marion Sandler, president and chiefexecutive officer of World Savings andamp; Loan Association of Oakland.``We're not a cost-plus industry. We're going to have to eat it.''   Top officers at four other big California thrifts, Great Western,California Federal, Glendale Federal and Home Federal, said they,too, were unlikely to cut interest rates for fear of losingdepositors to banks, mutual funds or the stock market. All fivethrifts are among the nation's 10 largest.   Under the Bush plan, which must be approved by Congress, thegovernment would sell $50 billion in bonds to finance the cost ofclosing or selling about 350 failed institutions. That's in additionto the $40 billion pledged last year by regulators to rescue andprop up 223 institutions.   Insurance premiums paid by financial institutions, combined withtax dollars, would pay the interest on the bonds and meetregulators' 1988 commitments. Money to pay off the principal on thebonds would come from the Sandamp;L industry.   Bud Koch, chairman of the National Council of SavingsInstitutions and president of First Federal Savings Bank ofCleveland, said higher insurance premiums would imperil more thrifts.   ``This continues to bleed the healthy institutions; there is justno end in sight,'' Koch said. ``This is going to raise the cost ofour funds and create more insolvencies.''   The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the industry's biggestlobbying group, was more cautious, saying it would neither endorsenor reject the plan.   League Chairman Barney Beeksman said he was glad Bush dropped anearlier proposal to levy a fee on depositors and reiterated thegovernment's pledge to insure depositors. But he found other partsof the plan ``burdensome,'' particularly insurance premiums.   ``We see today's proposal as a first step only,'' Beeksman said.   The American Bankers Association took heart in assurances thateven though banks' insurance premiums would rise, their insurancefund _ the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. _ would be kept separatefrom the Sandamp;L fund.   But J.J. Pinola, chairman and chief executive of First InterstateBancorp in Los Angeles, criticized the proposed increase in bank'spremiums and said the plan would inevitably force banks and Sandamp;Ls tocut interest rates for depositors or raise fees.   ``I'm somewhat appalled and looking for the right word todescribe why someone in another industry that had nothing to do withthe mistakes of the first industry now is being asked to pay,''Pinola said. ``It's simply a bashing of the banks.''   Many Sandamp;L executives praised Bush for moving quickly to tackle thelong-festering problem.   ``I like what I see,'' said James Montgomery, chairman and chiefexecutive officer of Beverly Hills-based Great Western FinancialCorp., the nation's second-largest Sandamp;L with $33 billion in assets.``I think he's showing some leadership, saying, `We've got to get onwith this problem,' and spreading the pain around a little bit.''   Montgomery said he supported the administration's insistence thatthrifts put up more of their own money to back deposits and promiseto crack down on fraud and mismanagement.   The initial reaction appeared favorable in Texas, where thedepressed oil and gas industry has produced some of the biggest Sandamp;Llosses.   ``We are pleased that he (Bush), very strongly at the beginningand end of the press conference, spoke of the full faith and creditof government behind thrifts,'' said Russ Cobler, a spokesman forSan Antonio Savings Association, one of 350 insolvent thrifts thepresident's plan is designed to help.</TEXT></DOC>
