The action Monday came on the heels of an agreement with Taiwanlast week that will allow the United States to monitor its use ofdriftnets in the North Pacific. Earlier this year Japan entered intoa similar arrangement.   But so far the United States and South Korea have been unable tocome to terms on monitoring use of the enormous nets, which U.S.fisherman complain are making unauthorized catches of salmon,dolphins and other species.   The vacationing president, in a letter to leaders of Congress,said he was instructing the State and Commerce departments ``tocontinue intensive bilateral negotiations with Korea'' over thefishing dispute.   If they don't produce an agreement within 30 days, ``I will beprepared to exercise my substantial authorities'' under theFishermen's Protective Act that allows him to order the prohibitionof fish imports from offending countries, the president said.   ``It is extremely important to the international community thatKorea agrees to meet the standards of customary international law tocooperate with other nations and to take necessary measures toconserve high seas resources affected by driftnets,'' he said.   He said the U.S. officials conducting the negotiatons should alsotry ``to engage the international community in urging the adoptionof cooperative measures on driftnet fishing.''   The driftnets used by Asian fleets are intended to catch squid,but the nets can also ensnare dolphins, seals and salmon.   The U.S.-Taiwan agreement allows federal authorities to trackTaiwanese fishing vessels by satellite with radio transpondersinstalled in those boats and also permits U.S. officials to boardthe ships.   Conservationists have criticized the driftnets, some of which are40 miles long, for their ``incidental'' catches of thousands of seabirds, seals and other animals, as well as valuable salmon thatspawn in the United States.   Congress had set a deadline of Monday for Bush to act.   Japan signed an agreement in June that called for theexperimental use of transponders and a cadre of 47 observers _ nineAmerican, five Canadian and 33 Japanese _ to monitor driftnet damageto marine mammal populations.</TEXT></DOC>
