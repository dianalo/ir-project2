The job safety agency cited 98 alleged instances of willful failure to comply with federal record-keeping requirements, and proposed that the company pay $130,000 in penalties. The company has 15 days to appeal the citations.    USX officials in Pittsburgh couldn't be reached immediately for comment.    The agency cited 60 alleged instances of willfully failing to record cases of lost workdays or restricted work activity, and 38 instances of willful failure to record, or of improperly recording, medical treatment cases.    Agency officials said the citations resulted from an inspection of the coke works' ammonia plant, under OSHA's special program of inspections in the chemical industry. </TEXT></DOC>
