EverettDirksen _ ``A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon you'retalking about real money'' _ is coming painfully true for federalbank regulators.   The $4 billion rescue of First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas andthe closing and rescue of other banks this year will cause thegovernment insurance fund that backs deposits in commercial banksto suffer the first loss in its 54-year history.   Add in billions of dollars being spent to assist the even moretroubled savings and loan industry and it means ``real money'' _enough to hamper the government's fight to curb the massive federalbudget deficit.   Money spent by the federal deposit insurance agencies _ theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. for the nation's 13,500 commercialbanks and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. for 3,100savings institutions _ does not come from taxpayers, at least notyet. Both the FDIC and the FSLIC derive their money from anassessment on member institutions.   However, revenue to the funds counts as a government receipt forfederal budget purposes. When spending exceeds receipts, itinflates the budget deficit, projected by the administration to hit$152.3 billion for fiscal 1988.   So far this year, FSLIC has had two multi-billion-dollartransactions. It spent $2 billion to help Southwest SavingsAssociation of Dallas take over four smaller institutions in Mayand $1.3 billion a month later to close two severely insolvent Sandamp;Lsin Costa Mesa, Calif.   FSLIC is looking at spending $1.3 billion to $2 billion moreearly this fall on Irvine, Calif.,-based Financial Corp. ofAmerica, the nation's second-largest thrift holding company.   It's unknown if the FDIC faces any other big expenditures, butanalysts have been watching the efforts of MCorp, another largeDallas bank, to pull itself out of its hole by attractingadditional investors.   According to a congressional aide, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, budget watchers earlier this year were worried thatfederal spending on sick financial institutions could triggerautomatic, across-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudmandeficit reduction.   Stronger than expected tax collections in May and June haveeased the concern, for now.   Still, the White House Office of Management and Budget, in amid-year budget review released Thursday, boosted its estimate ofFDIC spending this year by $1.7 billion and by $1.2 billion in1989. The estimate for FSLIC was increased by $2.9 billion for 1988and $1.7 billion for next year.   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman, in announcing the FirstRepublicBank rescue late Friday night, told reporters he expectedthe FDIC to suffer its first loss since its founding in 1934.   Until now, revenue from banks and interest on investments hasalways outweighed whatever it spent to protect depositors infailures and forced mergers.   Even in 1984, when the FDIC bailed out Continental IllinoisCorp. of Chicago with $4.5 billion in the largest rescue ever, theagency made money. But all bank failures only totaled 79 in 1984.This year, they are expected to equal or surpass thepost-Depression record of 184 set in 1987.   Seidman said the fund, which stood at $18.3 billion at the endof 1987, would likely lose close to $2 billion this year. But, hecautioned, that's a ``best guess'' and the loss could go higher.   ``When you forecast ... you often get into trouble and yourcrystal ball ends up looking like ground glass,'' he said.   The effect of the wave of financial institution failures on thebudget several years down the road could be even more pronounced.FSLIC, which is technically insolvent, is in even worse shape thanthe FDIC and faces more severe problems.   And, unlike the FDIC, FSLIC in its assistance packages is usingnotes rather than cash, obligating it to pay billions of dollars asmuch as 10 years in the future.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, FSLIC's parent agency, says itexpects to have just enough money over the next 10 years to pay the$30.9 billion cost of closing or merging insolvent Sandamp;Ls.   However, private analysts put the price tag as high as $75billion and the House and Senate banking committees are alreadydebating about the prospects for a taxpayer bailout in order tofulfill the government's obligations to depositors.</TEXT></DOC>
