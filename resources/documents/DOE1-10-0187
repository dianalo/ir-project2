Samplesdeposited on [100] single-crystal MgO with and without a Au buffer layerall show high transition temperatures (82--87 K). The use of a Au bufferlayer significantly improves the superconducting properties, particularlythe Meissner effect and critical current density (3.3 x 10{sup 6} A/cm{sup2} at T = 2 K and 3.5 x 10{sup 4} A/cm{sup 2} at T = 77 K). The Au filmsremain metallic after high-temperature annealing in an oxygen atmosphere.We propose to use Au buffer layers as current shunts to protect superconductingfilms and devices.</TEXT></DOC>
