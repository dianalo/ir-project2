The proposed 110-mile pipeline would provide additional capacity from the Lobo Trend area to pipelines in south Texas that serve most U.S. markets, the companies said. A spokeswoman for Northern Indiana Public Service said the projected cost of the pipeline is $25 million.    Known and potential gas reserves in the Lobo Trend area are estimated to range between two billion and three trillion cubic feet. The proposed pipeline would be owned equally by units of the two companies, with Texas Oil serving as operator.    Dallas-based Texas Oil gathers and transports natural gas, and explores for gas and oil. Hammond, Ind.-based Northern Indiana Public Service is the state's largest natural gas distributor. USX is a Pittsburgh-based steel and energy concern. </TEXT></DOC>
