That the unlikely agreement between two major software companies came about largely reflects a friendship between their chiefs -- Bill Gates of Microsoft and Ed Esber of Ashton-Tate -- that goes back almost to the beginning of the personal-computer industry. But the agreement also reflects the changing nature of the personal-computer software industry, a highly competitive field where team spirit has been hard to find.    The agreement sprung from discussions in early 1986 between Microsoft and Sybase Inc., a hot start-up company known for software that controls data bases. Those talks led to a secret agreement for Microsoft to acquire technology from Sybase later that year.    The acquired technology, in turn, was used to develop the Microsoft/Ashton-Tate product, which coordinates the use of a data base on a personal-computer network and helps users of personal computers extract information from mainframes and minicomputers.    Ashton-Tate had been developing a similar product on its own, and the topic came up when Messrs. Gates and Esber got together last March for one of their periodic chats about the state of the industry.    Mr. Esber says, &quot;Light bulbs went on in both our heads. We thought: Aren't we going to just confuse the customer if we market two of these?&quot; They decided to explore the possibility of cooperating, even though the two companies compete heavily in many areas and no agreement of this magnitude ever had been reached among big personal-computer software companies.    After a series of meetings among Microsoft and Ashton-Tate technical people, a group gathered at the Marriott hotel near the Los Angeles airport in late June. Both companies worried that a leak to the press would strain and possibly scuttle the talks. They were even unnerved by the brief mention of an &quot;Ashton-Tate meeting&quot; on the hotel's television system.    Partly to demonstrate good faith, Mr. Esber shared with Mr. Gates his plans for the next generation of Ashton-Tate's dBASE product, which dominates among personal-computer data-base packages. Mr. Gates, in turn, sent Mr. Esber a copy of an unannounced version of Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet, even though industry rumor indicates that Ashton-Tate will soon produce a competing product.    The idea of sending a competitor the Excel program was met with disbelief. &quot;A call came back from someone saying, 'Do you really mean Ed Esber . . . of Ashton-Tate?'&quot; Mr. Gates says.    Various factions in both companies kept coming up with reasons why cooperation shouldn't happen -- mainly, it wounded the pride of the technical people to think they would have to take help, and some marketing people worried that the arrangement would help a major competitor at their expense.    Microsoft also worried that Ashton-Tate wouldn't acknowledge that their joint product was &quot;open,&quot; meaning that Ashton-Tate's competitors, and not just Ashton-Tate, would be able to produce software that would work with the product.    The companies signed a letter of intent in late September, but that still left scores of issues unresolved. Messrs. Gates and Esber held several secret meetings at industry gatherings during the fall. At the Comdex trade show in early November, they tried to sit at the baccarat tables in the Aladdin hotel, then at the blackjack tables, but were shooed away because they weren't betting. They ended up talking among the Roman statues outside the hotel.    By November and December, talks were being held every couple days between Mr. Esber and Jon Shirley, Microsoft's president, to whom much of the negotiating had been assigned.    And although an agreement was nearing, tensions didn't lessen. &quot;I could hear these guys and the teams of people they had with them yelling at each other over the speaker phone in Jon's office,&quot; says Mr. Gates.    The final agreement, signed Dec. 23, was finally rammed through under pressure from the two chiefs.    Problems could still develop, but no matter what happens, the agreement represents the wave of the future in the personal-computer software industry.    Software companies have found that they have confused customers to the point that they will sit on the sidelines until they are convinced that the software technology they buy will be the one that survives.    The effect of consumer confusion on the growth of the industry is becoming even more acute because software companies now must start selling huge quantities of software for computer networks if they are to maintain their growth rates. That type of software is far more complex than software that runs on an individual computer. So software companies are increasingly trying to settle the technology questions among themselves and present the customer a single solution -- or at least fewer solutions than have been available in the past.    &quot;Until this year, most of the talk of strategic alliances was just talk,&quot; says Richard Shaffer, editor of the Computer Letter. &quot;But this is a really important alliance,&quot; he says, and adds that many more will follow. </TEXT></DOC>
