The rise in sales was mostly a result of the company'sMiles Inc. health care business, while the decline in netreflected downturns in its Mobay Corp. chemicals segment andAgfa Corp. imaging unit, the chemical and pharmaceuticalconcern said.</LP><TEXT>   It said 44% of total sales were in health care, whichincludes pharmaceuticals and consumer products; 40% were inchemicals, which includes polyurethanes, dyes and pigments;and 16% were in imaging technology, which includesphotographic products and electronic graphics systems.   Konrad M. Weis, president and chief executive officer ofBayer USA, said the company's diversity provided a cushionagainst the economic downturn.   &quot;The results demonstrate how important our large andgrowing health care business has become,&quot; he said, addingthat this was the fourth year the segment had showndouble-digit sales growth.   Sales at Miles were $2.57 billion last year, up nearly18%, and net was $100 million, up 58%. The segment's successwas mainly due to sales of Cipro, or ciprofloxacin, ananti-bacterial agent.   Mobay's sales reached $2.22 billion, up from $2.15 billionin 1989, but net was $91 million, down 25%, because ofincreased raw materials costs, inability to raise prices tocover costs and reduced demand from the automotive market.Mobay sells engineered plastics, fabrics and coatings to automakers.   Afga's net sales rose 1% to $956.9 million from $947million, but the company posted an $8 million net loss,mostly because of reduced demand for the unit's electronicimaging equipment and hospital imaging systems, as well asmanufacturing problems that delayed production of newgraphics imaging systems.   Bayer USA's small specialty companies, including NRC Inc.,a maker of hard metals used in the electronics industry,recorded increased sales, but earnings were depressed by aone-time cost from NRC's acquisition and relocation ofcertain operations of Fansteel Inc., a North Chicago, Ill.,specialty metal products maker.</TEXT></DOC>
