Before answering, you comb your hair,straighten up and make sure you're smiling. It could be thebig client you've been wooing for months or the lawyer you'reasking out for dinner.   Primping before you answer the phone? In just a fewmonths, you may be doing that. And more: &quot;You'll have to losesome weight -- video makes you look fatter -- and put onbetter clothes,&quot; warns Nancy Friedman, president of TelephoneDoctors, a St. Louis consultant.</LP><TEXT>   The videophone era is at hand. Like many earlierinventions, it may change our lives. &quot;Just as the auto wasmore than a horseless carriage and radio was more thanwireless telegraph, the videophone isn't just a telephonewith pictures. In the end, it will lead to very differentways to communicate with each other,&quot; says Eli Noam, directorof Columbia University's Institute for Tele-Information.   The videophone will bring together friends and relatives,business people and customers, doctors and patients in a waythat regular phones don't and with a speed that travel can't.From the practical to the peculiar, the possibilities areendless. Corporate executives eventually could be doing muchless traveling, to the consternation of underused airlinesand overbuilt hotels. Lawyers might use videophones forout-of-town depositions. Work-at-home employees will be ableto &quot;meet&quot; with their bosses. Deaf people will have access totelephones through sign language. Social workers may counsel,face-to-face, some patients who can't leave home. Familieswon't have to fly cross-country just so grandma and grandpacan see the grandchildren. And 900-number phone sex linescould woo customers with, uh, body language.   Nearly three decades after they burst on the scene, whyare mass-market videophones finally at hand? Because of cheapbut powerful computer chips, small but reliable cameras andbreakthroughs in simultaneously sending video and audiosignals over phone lines.   &quot;The thing that amazes me is I figured this would begradual,&quot; says Albert Lill, an expert at Gartner Group Inc.,a market researcher in Stamford, Conn. &quot;Wrong. Everything iscoming together in 1993.&quot;   Fueling the excitement is American Telephone andamp; TelegraphCo.'s plan to start selling in May a $1,500 videophone with abaseball-card-sized color screen that can plug into a regularwall jack. Though the picture is fuzzy and the motion jerky,would-be George Jetsons have inundated ATandamp;T with inquiries.&quot;ATandamp;T has everyone in the country, from grandma to thecorporate CEOs saying, `By God, I can have one now,'&quot; saysElliot Gold, publisher of a telecommunications newsletter inAltadena, Calif.   For now, at least, the technology is made in America, notin Japan. Leading the race are two entrepreneurialhighfliers: PictureTel Corp., which makes expensive corporatevideoconference systems and whose technology will be used ina new PC/picturephone from International Business MachinesCorp.; and Compression Labs Inc., whose equipment is at thecore of ATandamp;T's new videophone.   But, with sales potentially running hundreds of millionsof dollars annually by the mid-1990s, a bruising battle withJapanese and possibly European companies seems foreordained.Several Japanese firms, led by Mitsubishi Electric Ltd.,flopped in the 1980s with still-picture, black-and-whitevideophones that few consumers bought. But they plan a secondforay. Eight Japanese companies have recently demonstratedcorporate videoconference systems. Hitachi America Ltd. saysthat late this year it will start importing an executivevideophone that Hitachi is selling in Japan for about $7,000.A Toyota Motor Corp. U.S. affiliate, A.W. andamp; Associates Inc.,has licensed technology from a U.S. inventor and will&quot;aggressively seek to open up mass-market applications,&quot;including a cellular videophone, says Ayao Wada, A.W.'spresident.   ATandamp;T insists that it -- unlike American makers ofeverything from television sets to fax machines -- can keepthe lead. &quot;Our consumer-products business is one of the fewsuccessful ones in America,&quot; contends Robert Kavner, whoheads that ATandamp;T operation. Five years ago, ATandamp;T's share ofthe U.S. cordless-phone market was &quot;in the teens,&quot; he notes.&quot;Now, we have a 50% or 60% market share,&quot; mostly won fromJapanese competitors.   But Gartner Group's Mr. Lill has his doubts. &quot;In the longrun,&quot; he says, &quot;it's difficult to see anybody competingagainst the Japanese.&quot;   How fast the market will grow is debatable, too. &quot;It'squite possible that in 1994 we could have millions ofvideophones out there,&quot; Mr. Kavner says. That would implymuch faster growth than even the video camera, which hit the500,000-unit sales level in 1985, two years after itsintroduction. ATandamp;T plans to rent phones for $30 a day topeople hesitant to buy them and also will install some videopay phones.   But skeptics predict that videophones won't becomeubiquitous household gadgets until the price drops under $500for models with crisp, full-motion color images. &quot;Farsuperior technology will come along, and what you see todaywill be abandoned,&quot; says Norman Gaut, president ofPictureTel, which considered working with ATandamp;T on a consumerphone but later decided not to.   In May, many customers who rush to ATandamp;T phone stores couldbe disappointed. &quot;We call it jerky-vision; others call itJello-vision,&quot; says Kit Galloway, co-owner of the ElectronicCafe, a Santa Monica, Calif., bar and performance center thathas held &quot;telepoetry&quot; sessions with other cafes usingfirst-generation, black-and-white, still-motionpicturephones.   But although scientists still have a way to go to achieveclear, full-motion color videophones, their progress has beenremarkable. The technology for simultaneously transmittingboth sound and moving pictures has been around a long time.Yet doing that through ordinary telephone lines -- a taskakin to squeezing traffic from an eight-lane superhighwayonto a one-lane dirt road -- has been a daunting task. Foryears, some experts have said videophones would require newfiber-optic cabling nationwide, a $20 billion investment.   Behind the recent progress is a technology called signalcompression, and compression techniques are improving so muchthat today's lower-capacity copperwire network is provingadequate.   First, a video camera shoots a scene. Then, specialdigital-signal processing chips convert up to 15 frames asecond into millions of individual pixels, or pictureelements. Other chips select key pixels -- the features ofthe speaker's face and clothing, for example -- whileignoring static background and redundant pixels. Finally, thecompressed image and sound are sent over a phone line to thereceiving videophone, which reassembles the pixels.   Far more headway has been made with high-priced -- $30,000and up -- corporate videoconference systems than with homevideophones. That's largely because most big companiesalready use high-capacity digital phone lines that can carryenough data to transmit sound and video that generally lookspretty good on TV-sized monitors. Coast-to-coast calls onsuch lines now cost just $30 an hour, less than cellularphone calls do.   By contrast, it would take the equivalent of 5,000 regularphone lines to send, at the usual 30 frames a second,TV-quality pictures. Despite using compression techniques,ATandamp;T's videophone can deliver two to 10 frames a second overa single telephone line, a monumental achievement thatnonetheless delivers only jerky motion. Producingcrystal-clear pictures on regular home phone lines will takeyears more work, if it can ever be done.   Short term, many believe, the business videophone marketmay be more lucrative than the consumer market, just as thebusiness PC has outstripped the home PC, because companiescan justify the cost. Video conferences, once for hard-coretechies only, took off last year when many companiesrestricted travel during the Gulf War. About 5,000 expensivevideo-conference systems were sold world-wide last year, andanalysts predict 10,000 may be sold this year.   &quot;Cultural acceptance grew tremendously,&quot; says Steven Levy,an analyst at Hambrecht andamp; Quist Inc., a San Franciscosecurities firm. For example, engineers at Apple ComputerInc. found they could deal efficiently with theircounterparts at Sony in Japan in designing the PowerBookportable computer. Now, Apple's teleconference rooms arebooked steadily.   Videoconferences slash travel costs. Bank of Boston saves$300,000 a year because its London bankers now present loansto its credit committee by video. David Saenz, specialcounsel in charge of fighting jeans counterfeiters for LeviStrauss andamp; Co., says he can instantly see &quot;a sample of what weseized in Tokyo&quot; the night before. &quot;I've saved air fare andall the time of going back and forth, not to mention wear andtear,&quot; he says. Congress has experimented with holdinghearings by teleconference.   Videoconferencing helps even at shorter distances. BoeingCo., which has videoconference rooms in 13 plants aroundSeattle, estimates its engineers saved five million miles ofdriving while developing the 767 jetliner. Prisons in Floridause videoconference equipment to have Miami medicalspecialists &quot;examine&quot; inmates and help prison doctorsdiagnose ailments -- eliminating the security risk of movingprisoners to medical facilities. &quot;You don't like to haveprisoners in shackles sitting in your waiting room,&quot; notesThomas Natiello, president of Telemedicine Systems Corp.,which operates a videoconference room in Miami's LarkinGeneral Hospital.   However, the real social revolution will come whenvideophones enter your home.   Even first-generation black-and-white, still-photopicturephones have their enthusiasts. Sue Werlin, aLexington, Mass., grandmother, feared she wouldn't get to seemuch of her grandson when he was born in Santa Cruz, Calif.,in 1989. So, she bought two Sony picturephones -- initiallypriced at $1,500 but mostly sold, like hers, for a fire-saleprice of only $400 -- and gave one to her son. &quot;When we hadchildren, we bought a home movie camera,&quot; she says. &quot;Forgrandchildren today, we bought a picturephone.&quot;   In today's transient society, videophones may helpscattered families and friends maintain ties. &quot;A lot of ournostalgia for village life is a sense of lost locale,&quot; saysDavid Riesman, the Harvard sociologist who wrote &quot;The LonelyCrowd.&quot; He adds: &quot;We've been able to restore that through(telecommunications) networks. The hope would be that picturetelephones would bring people even closer together.&quot;   ATandamp;T is clearly counting on the family-tie market. SaysArno Penzias, the Nobellaureate vice president for researchat ATandamp;T's Bell Laboratories: &quot;When you have a parent in anursing home, you can't see her every day. When you have achild in college, you want to look the kid in the eye whenyou ask if he's on drugs.&quot; Mr. Kavner of ATandamp;T'sconsumer-products division predicts that with frequentvideophone calls, he will cut back on his trips to see hismother in Arizona.   The idea of a picturephone requires some rethinking oftelephony. People may try to hide their emotions when theyknow they're being watched. &quot;Women might like it better thanmen,&quot; says Deborah Tannen, a Georgetown Universitylinguistics professor who studies communications between menand women. &quot;Women look into each other's faces when they haveintimate conversations, but men are much more likely toreveal themselves when they aren't staring at each other.&quot;   Ms. Tannen also says she thinks videophones &quot;will be anintrusion.&quot; And the thought of telemarketers usingvideophones, she adds, &quot;is truly chilling.&quot;   After numerous focus groups, ATandamp;T designers decided toreassure users about privacy by putting a mechanical shutterover the camera lens in addition to the button that turns onthe video. (They also dropped the idea of a fold-down screenbecause consumers said they would want visitors to see thatthey had a videophone.)   If phone users decide to stay unseen, callers may getsuspicious. Is a friend who won't &quot;go video&quot; unshaved orundressed? Is the house or desk in chaos? What is he or shetrying to hide? Columbia's Mr. Noam guesses that &quot;in thehome, users will want to maintain privacy with people theyaren't close to.&quot;   Video conversations will rule out many of the white liesthat get people through the day. Workers calling in sick willhave to look sick rather than just sound bad, and they willhave to be at home. While on the phone, people won't be ableto open mail or wash dishes; they will have to maintain eyecontact. And Ilene Kaplan, a sociology professor at UnionCollege in Schenectady, N.Y., predicts: &quot;Teen-agers will haveto spend a lot of time in the bathroom getting ready for thephone call as well as getting ready for the date.&quot;   ---                    The Tortured History                  Of the Picture Telephone                                                                                                          1964  ATandamp;T shows Picturephone at New York World's Fair.                                                                                                          1970  ATandamp;T offers Picturephone for $160 a month.                                                                                                          1973  ATandamp;T drops Picturephone.                                                                                                          1981  ATandamp;T unveils Picturephone meeting service in         $2,300-an-hour rooms.                                                                                                          1982  Compression Labs begins selling $250,000         videconference system, using $1,000-an-hour lines.                                                                                                          1985  ATandamp;T ends Picturephone meeting service.                                                                                                          1986  PictureTel unveils $80,000 videoconferencing         system, using $100-an-hour lines.                                                                                                          1987  Mitsubishi ofers $1,500 still-picture phone for         home.                                                                                                          1989  Mitsubishi drops still-picture phone                                                                                                          1991  PictureTel unveils $20,000 black and white         videoconferencing system, using $30-an-hour lines.                                                                                                          1991  IBM and PictureTel demonstrate video-phone in a         personal computer.                                                                                                          1992  ATandamp;T announces $1,500 Videophone for home market.</TEXT></DOC>
