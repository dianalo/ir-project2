But only a stranger would so surmise. The skeleton has been there since the early 1980s, a monument to a Caterpillar past that has no relationship to its present.    After Caterpillar began the structure the world was suddenly changed by Federal Reserve moves to restore the soundness of the dollar. The &quot;debt crisis&quot; curbed Third World developmental &quot;megaprojects,&quot; curbing as well demand for those big yellow earth-sculpting machines Caterpillar sells. Commodity prices plummeted, cutting demand from farmers, miners and drillers. After 50 years of profits, Caterpillar from 1982 through 1984 lost nearly $1 billion.    The company slashed its world-wide work force by one-third, closing some plants and otherwise paring costs. By last year, earnings had climbed back to $3.51 a share and they are expected to rise further this year. But in 1981, they were $6.64.    The decline of the dollar relative to the yen and most European currencies helped Caterpillar restore earnings. But George A. Schaefer, chairman and chief executive officer, knows that such benefits can be transitory. He has in fact become wary of politicians who seek national advantage through currency manipulation or protectionism. Caterpillar's future is being addressed in a way more subject to Mr. Schaefer's control, the total overhaul of manufacturing processes. The new Caterpillar, with twice as many products to offer as it opens up new markets in smaller-sized equipment, will need fewer workers and less space.    &quot;We're spending over a billion dollars modernizing our factories around the world, right up to the state of the art,&quot; says Mr. Schaefer. &quot;We've got lasers, we've got robotics and just-in-time cell manufacturing. This is letting us take processing costs out, at the same time improving quality and reducing the human element. Our strategy is to be as modern and efficient in manufacturing and engineering as we possibly can be.&quot;    Fortunately, Caterpillar, after 50 years of solid earnings, came out of its recession with enough resources to do this major modernization. By scouring the world for the latest in equipment and production techniques it has been able to take advantage of the significant revolution that has been under way in manufacturing technology.    &quot;We've always had a strong balance sheet, but we never expected to have to weather a storm like we had,&quot; says Mr. Schaefer. &quot;Between '81-82 and '85-86 we took 25% of our cost base out, so that gave us a lot better efficiency. But we decided that we needed another 15%. How are we going to get it? We're going to get it through these modernization programs. We're seeing major projects where we're getting significant reductions in the cost of producing this piece part or assembling this tractor. We talk about excess capacity in this industry and it's still there but it's obsolete excess capacity.&quot;    Modernization involves a lot of things happening at once at the company's 30 plants around the globe. Old-fashioned assembly lines and their large inventories of parts are being replaced with highly automated clusters or cells that produce components for final assembly. The company is &quot;out-sourcing&quot; a lot of noncritical parts, such as sheet-metal stampings, to suppliers, finding that it can save a lot of money by shopping the world carefully for the lowest-cost providers. The main objective is to sharply cut inventory costs. This has to be done through advanced logistics, getting delivery of needed parts to the manufacturing cell &quot;just-in-time,&quot; to quote the modern jargon. To make the entire world-wide process flow, a computerized network, using software still being improved, controls what is happening in company and supplier plants.    This process is not unlike systems other global companies, such as the auto giants, are developing. It is changing the face of manufacturing drastically in the direction of much greater efficiency, when everything works as planned. But the people who manage it are becoming increasingly aware of the threat to such operations from the economic nationalism that has become so popular with politicians.    Caterpillar benefited on balance from the dollar's decline. Its sales are about half outside the U.S., which means that when its sales and earnings in strong currencies, such as the yen, are translated into dollars they balloon significantly. It also can price more aggressively against foreign competitors in the U.S. market. Japan's Komatsu, which with its lower cost base some years ago became a serious challenger to Caterpillar, now has been disadvantaged by the strong yen. That no doubt is what prompted it to agree to a joint venture with Dresser Industries in February, calling for joint manufacture and marketing of construction equipment in the Western Hemisphere.    But the big dollar swing has been a mixed blessing. It has forced another look at the supplier network with a view toward shifting to U.S. sources. It has raised costs as well as sales in dollar terms. And the U.S. manufacturing recovery it has engendered has resulted in materials shortages.    &quot;Steel has been a problem for the last six months,&quot; says Mr. Schaefer. &quot;Whereas we would have bought plate from mills, we found ourselves buying some from warehouses. That, of course, raises the price.&quot;    These problems meant that Caterpillar could not meet demand for some of its most profitable tractors last year. And it has fallen somewhat behind in its drive to cut costs a further 15%. It had originally hoped to reach that goal in 1991. Now it looks like 1992.    The U.S. steel industry, of course, has various protections from non-U.S. competitors, which is one reason supply bottlenecks have developed. It should be no surprise then that Mr. Schaefer is concerned about damage by protectionists to the world's open trading system. In his annual report for 1987, he said the company was &quot;greatly concerned&quot; about the potential threat of trade legislation &quot;which seeks solutions to the trade deficit through protectionist measures. Protectionism pursued by any trading partner leads to reciprocity with the end result that everyone loses.&quot;    Mr. Schaefer would further like to see a more stable monetary environment. Caterpillar has something like $1 billion in futures contracts outstanding as a hedge against currency swings. When the dollar was falling, it came out ahead on such contracts. But Mr. Schaefer fears that a further dollar decline could be disruptive to the international economy.    &quot;If we could get a stable international monetary system at an exchange rate that is somewhere within purchasing-power parity or an equilibrium rate, that would be the best of all possible worlds,&quot; he says. &quot;Caterpillar would be a more efficient company.&quot;    Caterpillar isn't sure any such stability is in the cards, however. All it could do was try to prepare itself for new stresses and strains by trying to become the most efficient producer internationally. The skeleton alongside Interstate 74 is a symbol of what it has left behind. It also signifies that an ability to adapt is alive and well with some U.S. manufacturers. </TEXT></DOC>
