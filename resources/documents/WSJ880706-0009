While Intel Corp., Motorola Inc. and other U.S. manufacturers nearly corner the world market, their Japanese challengers are diverse and formidable. They range from the world's biggest chip maker, NEC Corp., to a small start-up run by two technology whiz kids.    &quot;Until now, Motorola and Intel took the leadership,&quot; says Masatoshi Shima, vice president of start-up V.M. Technology Corp. &quot;Now, we're proposing something completely new.&quot; Mr. Shima has reasons to be confident: He once designed chips for Intel.    But the U.S. microprocessor champions stand a good chance of keeping Japan in the dust. They benefit from increasing protection of their copyrights and patents, and computer makers around the world aren't likely to switch wholesale from established U.S. designs. &quot;Microprocessors develop their own culture,&quot; laments Hajime Yasuda, Hitachi Ltd.'s semiconductor planning manager.    Still, the Japanese challenge in microprocessors will be important to watch. The Japanese have already taken over the world market for memory chips, which store computer data, and they desperately want to join the microprocessor game because the chips embody leading-edge technologies. The market for the most sophisticated 32-bit chips, which process computer data in hunks of 32 pieces and are much more powerful than earlier 16-bit and 8-bit chips, is growing briskly, and profit margins are fat. The Japanese have already made huge inroads into the simpler microprocessors used in video recorders and microwave ovens.    &quot;Ultimately, the Japanese want to be the leader in all the segments&quot; of the semiconductor market, says Steven Myers, an analyst at Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd. who used to work for Intel here. &quot;And they want to be recognized as such.&quot;    Intel, the world's leader, doesn't take the threat lightly, despite a comfortable lead. With its chip designs, including those made under license by rivals, occupying the innards of 70% of the world's personal computers and workstations, &quot;this is our mainline business,&quot; says William Howe, president of Intel's Japanese unit. &quot;We're constantly looking over our shoulder.&quot;    What Intel sees over its shoulder is mostly NEC.    NEC's chip-making people don't like how dependent their company has become on U.S. microprocessors. NEC uses Intel chips in half its personal computers; it uses Motorola chips in all its workstations. So in the early 1980s, NEC gathered together an elite corps of engineers that began reverse-engineering a series of chips that understood the same commands as Intel's but had different circuitry. The chips, called the V-series, use less power, are faster and have more functions than their Intel counterparts.    But Intel took NEC to court, saying the Japanese maker illegally uses some Intel software in its 16-bit, V-series chips. NEC counters that the circuit patterns are different. Whatever the case, says Kenji Kani, general manager of NEC's microprocessor operations, many overseas personal-computer makers &quot;say they won't buy the V-series until this thing is over.&quot;    A lot is at stake for U.S. chip makers in the court case. If NEC loses, other Japanese makers will shy away from creating chips that use the same instructions as popular chips.    Increasing protection of copyrights already has driven the Japanese to rethink their microprocessor strategy. In the 1970s, Japanese companies simply pried open the latest U.S. chips and stamped out carbon copies. U.S. companies soon forced them into licensing agreements that allowed the Japanese to churn out legitimate copies.    Hitachi, for example, makes 8-bit and 16-bit Motorola chips under licenses it got in the early 1980s. Motorola tolerated the arrangement because it couldn't produce enough chips to meet demand. More important, having Hitachi as a &quot;second source&quot; lent legitimacy to the Motorola chip design.    But Hitachi did all too well at underselling Motorola. &quot;Eventually we weren't just dumb second sources any more,&quot; says Hitachi's Mr. Yasuda. When Hitachi came to asking for Motorola's hot 32-bit chip, the answer was no. For its part, Intel was giving the same answer to NEC and Fujitsu Ltd. on its own 32-bit chips.    Hitachi was suddenly left with what every Japanese conglomerate dreads, a hole in its product lineup. &quot;It was a very troubling situation,&quot; says Mr. Yasuda. &quot;All the Japanese makers were forced to make hard choices.&quot;    Then in early 1985, Mr. Yasuda attended a speech by a young, long-haired University of Tokyo professor named Ken Sakamura. Mr. Sakamura and a team of researchers had drawn up a blueprint for an all-Japanese 32-bit chip. Called &quot;Tron,&quot; the chip was specially designed to process Japanese language. Mr. Yasuda approached the professor after the talk; several months later Mr. Yasuda's division at Hitachi decided to build the chip.    Meanwhile, Mr. Sakamura continued peddling his chip with missionary zeal to Japan's other companies. In 1986, he convinced Fujitsu to join Hitachi. Last year, Mitsubishi Electric Co. joined as well, forming the Global Microprocessor Group. &quot;Doing it together makes us much more powerful,&quot; a Mitsubishi official says.    The group plans to start shipping its first Tron chips in July. Its market-share goals: one-third of the world market in five years. Others are close behind. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Toshiba Corp. and Oki Electric Industry Co. each are developing Tron chips.    Still, industry experts are skeptical Tron will come to much. &quot;I can see nationalistic reasons for buying it,&quot; says Mr. Myers, the analyst. But &quot;there are neither economic nor performance reasons why a user should be attracted to Tron.&quot; That's because manufacturers like microprocessors with track records. Few want a new chip like Tron that can't run existing software or doesn't have any powerful users.    But Japanese electronics conglomerates are never satisfied to depend on someone else for a crucial component, especially when it's one of the most prestigious technologies. Moreover, U.S. firms have ignored Japanese users' demands for new kinds of chips, says V.M., the start-up.    V.M., whose 30 employees are based in a shiny new building north of Tokyo, is betting on a microprocessor that packs on one chip many of the functions that normally would be done by separate chips. More important, the chip has a special patch of circuits called a programmable logic array that allows the chip to mimic many popular microprocessors. The first version, a chip compatible with Intel's 16-bit chips, is due out in July. As it is, the chip isn't capable of mimicking Intel's and Motorola's 32-bit chips, but the company says future versions will be able to do that.    V.M. is the brainchild of Kazuhiko Nishi, who helped build Japan's personal computer industry and once sat on Microsoft Corp.'s board of directors, and of Mr. Shima, who has had an impressive career designing brain chips for Intel and archrival Zilog Inc.    U.S. chip makers are fighting back in the face of the challenge. Intel and Motorola have sought to undo the reputation they got for haughtiness here during chip shortages in 1984, when Japanese customers were often stuck at the end of their delivery lists. &quot;We tended to get a little arrogant,&quot; admits Intel's Mr. Howe. &quot;It was pretty bad.&quot;    Last year, Intel brought over its senior management to hear out its Japanese customers. It has since received several quality awards. Analysts say it and Motorola have salvaged their reputations here. </TEXT></DOC>
