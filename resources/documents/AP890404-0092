One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said up to 25people may have died. His report could not be confirmed.   At least six rockets were said to have landed in or near theKhair Khanna and Wazirabad sections close to the airport, which hasbeen a frequent target of Moslem guerrillas fighting theSoviet-sponsored government.   It was the biggest rocket attack on Kabul since five struck theairport March 14, wounding two people but causing no serious damage.   Last summer and fall, before Soviet military forces left, 20 ormore rockets often hit Kabul every day. The Red Army completed itswithdrawal Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement.   Foreign sources said privately at least eight people werehospitalized Tuesday and another source reported 20 injuries. StateTV showed a burning bus it said was hit by a rocket.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said guerrillaattacks on Jalalabad, 75 miles east of the capital, had weakened inthe previous 24 hours.   Reminded that the government had accused the U.S.-backedinsurgents and Pakistani forces of massing men and arms for a newassault, Amani added: ``It may be the calm before the storm.''   He said two Pakistanis captured 3{ weeks ago and accused ofspying would go on trial Wednesday in Kabul.   The Afghan government often accuses Pakistan of militaryinvolvement in the civil war, but Pakistan has denied it.   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April1978 and the most active groups operate from Pakistan, onAfghanistan's eastern border. Soviet soldiers entered the war inDecember 1979 and an estimated 115,000 were in the country when thewithdrawal began May 15, 1988.   Amani said Jalaladad was ``relatively calm'' in the 24-hourperiod ending at sundown Tuesday. He described shelling of the cityas ``sporadic and limited.''   Guerrillas besieged Jalalabad on March 6 in their first majoroffensive since the Soviets left the Afghan army to carry on thefight alone.   Government artillery and air attacks killed 85 of the enemy andwounded 48 in the past 24 hours, Amani said. He gave casualties onthe government side as two civilians and one soldier killed and twosoldiers wounded.   Casualty figures cannot be verified. Government and guerrillareports customarily exaggerate the other's losses and foreignreporters are not allowed into the Jalalabad area.   Most of the recent guerrilla rocket fire at Jalalabad has comefrom Kama, about 12 miles east of the city, and from Surkhrod, sixmiles to the west, Amani told reporters.   He said government forces ``opened firs and the enemy was forcedto retreat.'' Amani said most of the insurgents were 15 to 30 milesfrom the city.   Several Scud-B missiles supplied by the Soviet Union were heardbeing launched Tuesday from Kabul toward Jalalabad, which is on themain road to the Pakistani border and near the Afghan end of theKhyber Pass.   Amani said the highway to Jalalabad was open and an army convoycarrying food reached the city Monday.   The Pakistanis to be tried were captured near Kandahar insouthern Afghanistan in mid-March and shown to foreign reporters inKaul a few days later. They identified themselves as Mohammed Afzaland Mohammed Ashraf and said they were spying.   Afghan law provides prison terms of 10 to 20 years forconviction on espionage charges, Amani said.</TEXT></DOC>
