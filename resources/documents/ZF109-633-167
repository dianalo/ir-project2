(Cambridge, MA), shared the Northern Telecombooth at the show.andM;The main enhancement to the system since we saw it last is the ability todisplay color graphics.andM;Odesta: big user now, Windows comingandM;Odesta's Document Management System will get a chance to prove its value in acomplex magazine-publishing environment with a new installation at HearstMagazines.andP;  Hearst will use the system to manage the workflow at all butthree of its monthlies, starting with Sports Afield.andP;  House Beautiful,Colonial Homes, Connoisseur, Country Living, Harper's Bazaar, PopularMechanics and Town andamp; Country are expected to be converted to ODMS by the endof the first half of 1991.andP;  The exceptions are the largest magazines:Cosmopolitan, Esquire and Good Housekeeping.andP;  Ted Felton, vice president anddirector of manufacturing at Hearst, told us that the Bestinfo Wave4 systemis expected to be used with these three titles.andM;The ODMS version at Hearst was customized by NEC, Inc., a value-addedreseller of ODMS.andP;  NEC, a color prep house in Nashville, Tennessee, has beenan innovator for many years.andP;  It was one of the first Scitex sites in theU.S., and it was an early and enthusiastic Visionary site.andM;NEC calls its ODMS implementation &quot;StarMIS&quot; (for Story Tracking Art RetrievalManagement Information System).andP;  ODMS is the glue through which an assemblageof PCs and Macs is turned into a system.andM;The configuration for Sports Afield, the first title installed, contains 7Macs and 10 PCs plus a Novell file server.andP;  The PCs run XyWrite and are usedfor editorial work.andP;  Four of the Macs are in the art department, runningMontage software (NEC's version of Visionary).andP;  An additional one acts as abridge to NEC's system in Tennessee.andP;  These are all Mac IIx's.andP;  The final twoMacs are SE/30's.andP;  One, the StarMIS host, runs ODMS.andP;  The other runs anNEC-provided program, StarBridge, which updates the ODMS host concerningactivity on the PCs.andM;Windows version in 1991.andP;  Odesta announced that it will offer support for DOSwith Windows 3.0 in 1991.andP;  This will be the first integration ofIBM-compatibles into ODMS.andP;  Later during the year will come support forPresentation Manager and for DEC workstations under Motif.andP;  The extension ofODMS to utilize SQL database servers (including DEC's Rdb) will also arrivein 1991.andP;  This will let ODMS interact with databases created for otherpurposes and serving other applications besides publishing.andM;Odesta also announced a further marketing agreement with DEC.andP;  Odesta hadbeen considered a &quot;Complementary Software House,&quot; calling jointly with DEC onsome prospects.andP;  Now, the companies have signed a Digital DistributedSoftware licensing agreement, under which DEC will distribute and support afuture version of ODMS.andP;  This agreement indicates DEC's emphasis on documentmanagement as an important issue for many of its customers.andP;  ODMS will bepart of DEC's Network Application Support strategy, which is intended toposition DEC as a system supplier capable of integrating the products ofmultiple vendors.andM;Wacom's stylus not always a soft touchandM;An increasing number of software applications are supporting Wacom'spressure-sensitive cordless stylus.andP;  The device can be configured for eitherof two sensitivies: soft for 300 grams maximum pressure input, hard for inputat up to 500 grams.andP;  The user can also choose from two modes of operation:stroke, where the tip switch takes 0.9mm of travel before it clicks on(suitable for CAD and menu selections), and non-stroke, with virtually no tiptravel (suitable for paint programs and handwriting analysis).andM;Available for Macintoshes or PCs, Wacom's styluses work in conjunction with aspecial electronic tablet, rather like a mouse pad.andP;  They are intended forpaint and drawing applications.andM;Electronic Arts' Studio/32 (see report elsewhere in this issue) and TimeArts' Oasis are recent examples of color paint programs that support theWacom stylus.andP;  By varying pressure, the user can change attributes such asbrush weight, color and blending.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
