Studies on the snake suggest that it willbe many years before techniques can be developed to control or eliminatesnakes on Guam. The habitat on Guam has been made unsuitable for the railfor the indefinite future due to predation by the snake. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), in cooperation with the GuamDivision of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources (Guam Division) and the CommonwealthDivision of Fish and Wildlife (Commonwealth Division), proposes to introduceup to 500 captive-bred Guam rails (<T3>Rallus owstoni</T3>) onto the island of Rota in the Commonwealth ofthe Northern Mariana Islands over a 5-year period. Although a populationof rails now exists in captivity, these birds may lose their ability tosurvive in the wild after several generations. The establishment of a wildpopulation on Rota would assure that a source of wild birds would be availablefor future reintroduction to Guam when the brown tree snake has been controlledor eradicated. The Service proposes that the Rota population be designated a nonessentialexperimental population according to section 10(j) of the Endangered SpeciesAct of 1973, as amended (Act). The species is currently protected at 13different captive propagation facilities and nonessential status wouldprovide for flexibility in managing the Rota population. Accordingly, a special rule describing circumstances under which takingof introduced Guam rails would be permitted is being proposed in conjunctionwith this proposal to establish the nonessential experimental population.Permitted management actions involving take within the meaning of the Actwould include recapture of rails to replace transmitters, provide veterinarycare, return animals to captivity that are severely injured or diseased,or to recapture for reintroduction to Guam.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments on this proposed rule and the draft EnvironmentalAssessment must be received by July 19, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments should be sent to the Field Supervisor, EnvironmentalServices, Pacific Islands Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 300 AlaMoana Boulevard, Room 6307, Honolulu, HI 96813.

It is thelargest and most developed island in Micronesia. The entire island is encircledby a fringing reef except at small areas comprised of limestone cliffs.A narrow central portion separates the island into a northern, fairly levellimestone plateau, and a southern, mountainous area of volcanic origin.The vegetation has been vastly altered by humans, and much of the originalforest has been removed. In general, the northern limestone substrate supportsa diverse forest, while the southern volcanic portion consists of extensivesavannas on the exposed uplands with native ``ravine'' forests in the comparativelyundisturbed, narrow valleys. The endemic flightless Guam rail formerly occurred island-wide. lt wasone of the few native birds that occurred more frequently in weedy fields,scrubby second growth, and mixed forests than in uniform tracts of matureforest. Availability of habitat was not a limiting factor; in fact, man'sdisturbance of the forests might have created habitat for the rail. The rail population declined drastically between 1963 and 1973, and bythe mid 1970's had disappeared from southern Guam. Bird surveys conductedin June 1981 indicated that a population of about 2,000 rails still persistedin northern Guam. By the summer of 1986, however, the species was consideredvirtually extirpated from the wild. Several inimical factors are believed to have caused the demise of theGuam rail, but most important was predation on eggs and young by the browntree snake. Earlier investigations had eliminated excessive taking, pesticidesand herbicides, inter-specific competition, and avian diseases as the causesfor the rail's drastic declines in the 1980's and l970's. More recent studiesclearly implicate the snake as the most important factor in the demiseof the rail as well as the other native forest birds of Guam. The ubiquitous distribution and high density of brown tree snakes has nowso altered the primary habitat of the Guam rail that this habitat is nolonger suitable for sustaining the rail. The basic habitat components requiredby the rail on Guam have essentially been made unavailable for the indefinitefuture due to the pervasive threat of the brown tree snake. When it was evident that the rail faced imminent extinction, the Guam Division,a consortium of zoos under the auspices of the American Association ofZoological Parks and Aquariums (AAZPA), and the Service embarked on a captivepropagation program by capturing as many rails as possible. Agreementswere entered into whereby cooperating zoos agreed to develop techniquesfor propagating the rail in captivity as well as maintaining a viable populationwith maximum genetic diversity. The captive flock presently consists ofmore than 112 rails which are being propagated at 13 facilities: the Division'sfacilities on Guam; National Zoological Park, Front Royal, Virginia; BronxZoo, New York, New York; Cincinnati Zoo, Cincinnati, Ohio; Pittsburgh Aviary,Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Sedgewick County Zoo and Botanical Garden, Wichita,Kansas; Lowry Park Zoological Garden, Tampa, Florida; Riverbanks ZoologicalPark, Columbia, South Carolina; Greater Baton Rouge Zoo, Baton Rouge, Louisiana;Trevor Teaching Zoo, Millbrook, New York; Philadelphia Zoological Gardens,Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; San Diego Zoo, San Diego, California; and KansasCity Zoological Garden, Kansas City, Missouri. The number of facilitiespropagating rails is expected to increase as more zoos in various partsof the country are enlisted as cooperators. The rail has been so prolific in captivity that it will be possible touse some of the excess progeny for release programs without jeopardizingthe continued existence of this species or causing deterioration in geneticdiversity of the captive flock. It is estimated that the mainland zooscould produce up to 100 birds for release annually without adversely affectingthe remaining captive stock. The draft Guam and Rota Endangered Forest Birds Recovery Plan (which isin the final stages of the Service approval process) recommends establishmentof self-sustaining populations of the Guam rail in other suitable sitesoutside its historic range because there is no assurance that the snakewill be controlled or eliminated on Guam in the foreseeable future. Thisproposal is intended to result in the release and establishment of Guamrails in previously disturbed but suitable habitats on Rota (i.e., habitatssimilar to those on Guam prior to the introduction of the snake). Further,this population would be managed with the long-term objective of providinga source of ``wild'' rails for reestablishment on Guam when the brown treesnake can be eliminated or controlled. Captive-held rails, while capableof reproducing and surviving in captivity, may, after several generations,lose their ability to survive in the wild. A population of rails on Rotawould assure that a source of rails capable of surviving in the wild wouldbe available for reintroduction to Guam. This project is believed to bean effective means for promoting long-term conservation and recovery ofthe rail.<ITAG tagnum="84">Status of Experimental Population </ITAG>The Service proposes that the experimental population of Guam rails onRota be designated as a nonessential experimental population accordingto the provisions of section 10(j) of the Act. The population would betreated as a threatened species, rather than an endangered species, forthe purposes of section 4(d) and 9 of the Act. The nonessential status would be appropriate for the following reasons:(1) Although the Guam rail is virtually extinct in the wild, robust captiveflocks have been established on Guam and in 12 cooperating zoos and aviarieson the mainland; (2) care and maintenance of the captive flocks are ofthe highest order and it is not likely that disease or other sources ofmortality are likely to threaten the survival of the species; and (3) theGuam rail breeds readily in captivity, resulting in the availability ofrails in excess of needs for the captive flock which can be made availablefor release. The taking of approximately 500 rails over the 5-year durationof this project from these sources of captive-reared progeny would notthreaten the survival of this species even if all of the animals releasedinto the wild were to succumb to natural or man-caused mortality. Designating the Rota population as a nonessential experimental populationwould enable the Service to propose a special rule which would authorizeconsiderable discretion in managing the population. The proposed protectiveregulations would be necessary and advisable to provide for the conservationof the rail, especially during the initial stages of the translocationprogram. The proposed special rule would siipulate that agents of the CommonwealthDivision, the Guam Division, and the Service would be authorized to takeanimals which need special care or which are causing depredation problems.Taking ``problem'' rails by killing would be avoided and resorted to onlyif there were no other viable alternatives. Live capture and release intoother suitable remote habitats would be the preferred form of take wheneverpossible. The special rule would also have a provision that would allow for specialtake by private individuals if the experimental population becomes wellestablished on Rota. This special take would be allowed under regulationsdrafted by the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas once the Service hasdetermined that the rail has become well established and occupies all suitablehabitat island-wide. These flexible rules would help gain and maintainpublic support for the project. The Commonwealth Division has the statutory authority to protect and conservelisted species. As a cooperator in this experimental translocation project,it has agreed to protect the Guam rails proposed for establishment on Rotaby promulgating regulations to prohibit the taking of rails, in the Commonwealth.It also has two staff members, a Conservation Officer and a Wildlife Technician,residing on Rota. The Service is satisfied that the Commonwealth's regulatorymechanisms and staff presence are sufficient to provide for conservationof the rail. <ITAG tagnum="84">Location of Experimental Population </ITAG>Rota, 50 km (31 miles) north of Guam, is one of the three main islandsin the Commonwealth. It is located at 14 degrees 10 minutes north latitudeand 145 degrees 12 minutes east longitude. It is 20 km (12 miles) longby 6 km (4 miles) wide with an area of approximately 85 square km (33 squaremiles). Rota is the third largest island in the Commonwealth after Saipan(the largest) and Tinian. A high plateau dominates the western half ofthe islamd, with steep cliffs to the north, west, and south that terminatein a narrow coastal shelf. The eastern side of the plateau is characterizedby a gentle slope to a large eastern plain. The steep slopes of the upperplateau support well-developed native forests. Taipingot Peninsula jutsout from the extreme western tip of the island. Most lowland areas were used for agricultural purposes in the past. Sugarcanewes grown over most of the level areas of Rota during the Japanese Administrationprior to World War II. Many of these fields are now re-vegetated with second-growthforests comprised of native and introduced species. Portions of this areaare being opened for grazing, for growing agricultural crops, and for residentialhome sites. The brown tree snake is not found on Rota, and the many weedyfields and second-growth forests should provide good habitat for the rail.Experimental releases would be made on Commonwealth-owned lands or on landsbelonging to cooperating landowners. Section 10(j) of the Act requires that an experimental population be geographicallyisolated from any existing population. The establishment of an experimentalpopulation on Rota would comply with this rule. Even if the rail were stillextant on Guam, Rota is separated from Guam by 50 km (31 miles) of openocean and it is unlikely that the flightless rail could cross this geographicbarrier. Rota is outside the known historical range of the Guam rail (although itis probable that some type of rail at one time occurred on Rota). Priorto the establishment of an experimental population outside of its probablehistoric range, the Service must determine that the primary habitat ofthe species has been unsuitably and irreversibly altered or destroyed.Although the basic habitat components required by the rail on Guam havenot been ``irreversibly'' altered or destroyed in the strict sense, theyhave essentially been made unavailable to the rail for the indefinite futuredue to the pervasive threat of the brown tree snake. There is hope thatit will eventually be possible to control or eradicate the brown tree snakeon Guam, but there is no assurance that this will be possible in the foreseeablefuture. This indefinite alteration of the rail's primary habitat is tantamountto the unsuitable and irreversible alteration or destruciion of its primaryhabitat.<ITAG tagnum="84">Management </ITAG>Although this experimental translocation project would be conducted cooperativelyby the Guam Division, the Commonwealth Division, and the Service, the GuamDivision would be the lead agency and would be primarily responsible forits implementation. The Commonwealth Division may provide assistance inmaintenance of the release site or in monitoring the release. The Servicewould coordinate and expedite any procedural matters relating to the project.Follow-up evaluation of the releases would be conducted by Dr. Stuart Pimmand selected graduate students from the University of Tennessee pursuantto a cooperative agreement between the University and the Guam Division.Studies would focus on dispersal patterns, mortality, reproductive success,overall success of the releases, and general health of the population.Guam rails selected for release in this experimental translocation projectwould be tested to ensure that they are disease-free before being transportedto Rota for release during the rainy season. A Quarantine Entry Permitfor Poultry and Birds (Form CNMI-AHI-001) required by the Commonwealthwould accompany all shipments of rails. If deemed prudent because of potentialavian disease considerations, only progeny produced by the captive flockon Guam could be used for the proposed releases. Approximately 50 to 100 captive-reared rails comprised of about an evensex ratio would be released annually. The rails would be released usingtwo methods: (1) Half of the rails would be captured from the release pensand transported 1 km away before being released directly into the wild;(2) the remaining half would be permitted to leave the pens at ``will''through doors left open for this purpose. Subsequent releases may consistof rails of varying ages to determine whether any age group is more likelyto survive and colonize Rota. All of the rails would be banded before release with numbered aluminumand color-coded bands. Between 25 and 30 rails per year would also haveradio transmitters attached to facilitate determination of dispersal patterns,movements, home range, and mortality. Radio monitoring would be most intenseduring the first two months after release, followed by monthly or semi-monthlytracking. A public information and education program would be conducted before railsare brought to Rota and during the actual establishment of the experimentalpopulation. The Mayor of Rota's wish to help a ``neighbor'' would serveas the theme for sustaining public support for the project. The programwould encourage the public to report sightings of rails throughout theisland. These observations would help determine dispersal and survivalof released rails. The Guam Division would provide annual reports on the results of theirand the University of Tennessee follow-up studies. The cooperators wouldmeet annually to assess the status of the experimental project so thatany appropriate changes and/or adjustments could be made. A more comprehensiveassessment of this project would be made at the end of the 5th year, anda public meeting would be held on Rota to assess public attitudes. Thethree cooperators would then recommend future direction for the project,including feasibility of limited subsistence taking if the rail becomeswell established and occupies all suitable habitats island-wide. The Service believes that this project would result in the establishmentof a ``wild'' population of rails which could be used to reestablish thespecies on Guam when the brown tree snake is eliminated or controlled.For this reason the Service finds that the release and establishment ofan experimental population of Guam rails on Rota would further the conservationof this species. (See section 10(j)(2)(A) of the Act; 50 CFR 17.81(b).)<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited </ITAG>The Service intends that any rule finally adopted be as effective as possible.Therefore, comments or recommendations concerning any aspects of this proposedrule or its accompanying draft Environmental Assessment are hereby invitedto be submitted from the public, concerned government agencies, the scientificcommunity, industry, or any other interested party. Comments should beas specific as possible and must be received at the above address within30 days after publication of this proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. If appropriate, a public meeting may be conductedwith interested members of the public. Final promulgation of a rule to implement this proposed action will takeinto consideration any comments or additional information received by theService. The regulation shall, to the maximum extent practicable, representan agreement between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the affected Stateand Federal agencies, and persons holding any interest in land which maybe affected by establishment of an experimental population.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>A draft Environmental Assessment (EA) and a draft Finding of No SignificantImpact (FONSI) have been prepared pursuant to the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act. The draft EA and FONSI are available to the public for reviewand comments at the Service's Pacific Islands Office at the above address.The draft EA will form the basis for a decision as to whether this proposalis a major Federal action which would significantly affect the qualityof the human environment within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of theNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (implemented at 40 CFR Parts1500-1508). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Regulatory FlexibilityAct </ITAG>The Service has determined that this would not be a major rule as definedby Executive Order 12291. The rule as proposed does not contain any informationcollection or record keeping requirements as defined in the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511). The rule would not have a significant economiceffect on a substantial number of small entities as described in the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354). The introduction sites would be on comparativelyundeveloped areas on the island of Rota. The introduction of a nonessentialexperimental population into this area is not expected to have any adverseimpact on public use of the immediate and surrounding area. No privateentities would be affected by this action. <ITAG tagnum="84">Author </ITAG>The principal author of this proposal is Ernest Kosaka, Field Supervisor,Environmental Services, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Pacific IslandsOffice, Honolulu, Hawaii [(808) 541-2749]. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 17 </ITAG>Endangered and threatened wildlife, Fish, Marine mammals, Plants (Agriculture).<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Regulation Promulgation </ITAG>Accordingly, it is hereby proposed to amend Part 17, Chapter B of ChapterI, Title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 17_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.

(1) The Guam rail population identifiedin paragraph (f)(7) of this section is a nonessential experimental population.(2) No person shall take this species, except: (i) In accordance with a valid permit issued by the Service under andSection;17.32 for educational purposes, scientific purposes, the enhancement ofpropagation or survival of the species, zoological exhibition, and otherconservation purposes consistent with the Act; or (ii) As authorized by the laws and regulations of the Commonwealth of theNorthern Mariana Islands, after the Service has made the determinationthat the experimental population has become well established and occupiesall suitable habitat island-wide. (3) Any employee of the Service, the Commonwealth of the Northern MarianaIslands Division of Fish and Wildlife, or the Guam Division of Aquaticand Wildlife Resources who is designated for such purposes, may take aGuam rail without a permit if such action is necessary to: (i) Aid a sick, injured, or orphaned specimen; (ii) Dispose of a dead specimen; (iii) Salvage a dead specimen which may be useful for scientific study;(iv) Take an animal which is responsible for depredations to personal propertyif it has not been possible to otherwise eliminate such depredations and/orloss of personal property, provided that such taking must be done in ahumane manner and may involve injuring or killing the bird only if it hasnot been possible to eliminate depredations by live capturing and releasingthe specimen unharmed in other suitable habitats; or (v) Take birds for approved reintroduction on Guam.(4) Any violation of applicable Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana IslandsDivision of Fish and Wildlife conservation laws or regulations with respectto the taking of this species (other than taking as described in paragraph(f)(2)(ii) of this section) will also be a violation of the EndangeredSpecies Act. (5) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, import,or export by any means whatsoever, any such species taken in violationof these regulations or in violation of applicable Commonwealth of theNorthern Mariana Islands Division of Fish and Wildlife laws or regulationsor the Endangered Species Act. (6) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit anotherto commit, or cause to be committed, any offense defined in paragraphs(f) (2) through (5) of this section. (7) The sites for introduction of Guam rails on Rota, Commonwealth of theNorthern Mariana Islands, are on an island separated from Guam by 50 kilometersof ocean. The last known observation of an individual of this species occurrednear the northern tip of Guam which is closest to the island of Rota. Nointermingling of these populations will occur since this species has beenextirpated in the wild on Guam. The Rota release sites are of necessityoutside the historic range of the Guam rail, as described in this proposedrule, because its primary range has been unsuitably and indefinitely alteredby the brown tree snake. (8) The nonessential experimental population on Rota will be checked periodicallyby staff of the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands Division of Fishand Wildlife and cooperating staff from the University of Tennessee todetermine dispersal patterns, mortality, and reproductive success. Theoverall success of the releases and general health of the population willalso be assessed. <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 10, 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Maryanne C.
