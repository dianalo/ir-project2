(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police have been guarding the offices of aconservative weekly newspaper that has revived stinging attacks ona black professor and reawakened charges of racism at DartmouthCollege.   A march through the school's Fraternity Row and continuedpicketing of several businesses that advertise in The DartmouthReview were planned today, and a larger rally was scheduled forThursday.   Four Review staff members face college disciplinary charges andpossible expulsion stemming from a confrontation last week withWilliam Cole, a music professor who once sued the paper for libel.   The staffers say they are being persecuted for taking strongstands on the quality of Dartmouth life and education, and denythat race has anything to do with it.   The independent newspaper also was at the center of controversytwo years ago when 12 students, mostly Review staffers, tooksledgehammers to symbolic anti-apartheid shanties on the campusgreen. That raid sparked a semester of sit-ins, disciplinaryhearings and other unrest that caused a leadership crisis forDartmouth President David McLaughlin.   McLaughlin resigned in June 1987, though he said thedisturbances didn't contribute directly to his decision.   As tensions rise again, McLaughlin's successor, James Freedman,said Tuesday he would ``urge everyone in the Dartmouth community totake the high road to civility of expression.''   Freedman had a similar message Monday when he spoke to 250students at a rally protesting the Review's attacks on Cole. Hedefended Cole's qualifications, as well as the right to freedom ofspeech, ``however unpopular, provocative and offensive that speechmay sometimes be.''   Cole sued the paper in 1983 for libel over an article that saidhe ``looks like a used Brillo pad.'' He dropped the suit in 1985.He received no damages and both sides claimed vindication.   Two weeks ago the Review published a cover story calling Cole'steaching performance ``academically deficient'' and includingexcerpts from a transcript from one of his recent classes.   On Thursday four Review staffers approached Cole after a class.Editor-in-chief Chris Baldwin said the staffers wanted to give Colea chance to rebut their article, and to demand that he apologizefor allegedly calling them ``white-boy racists'' during a class.   Shouting ensued, and the incident ended with the professorallegedly breaking the camera flash of Review photographer JohnQuilhot. The Review published a photograph of an agitated Cole onits cover in its next issue with the headline, ``The Truth Hurts.Cole Explodes Over Review Criticism.''   Cole has not commented publicly on the incidents.   Three police officers stood guard Tuesday outside the Review'soffice above a hardware store a block from the Dartmouth campus.   Nearby, hoisting signs that urged motorists to ``Honk if youdon't support the Review,'' about 25 people picketed the DartmouthBookstore and other stores that advertise in the Review.   The four Review staffers face punishment ranging from a fine toexpulsion if they are found guilty of disorderly conduct,harassment, or violating Cole's right to privacy. They are Baldwin,a junior from Hinsdale, Ill.; Quilhot, a sophomore from Fort Wayne,Ind.; executive editor John Sutter, a senior from St. Louis; andstaff writer Sean Nolan, a freshman from Lexington, Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
