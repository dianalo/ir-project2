Fiftypatients had medium-sized lesions (height between 3.1 and 8.0 mm andbase diameter less than 16.0 mm), and six patients had large lesions.There were 24 lesions less than 3.0 mm from the optic nerve. The averageradiation dose to the apex of the tumor was 8,468 cGy (dose rate, 71cGy per hour). Initial local disease control was achieved in 50 patients(86.2%). One patient with local treatment failure received another plaquetreatment, which controlled disease, so the total disease control ratewas 87.9%. Only eight patients died of their disease. Complications weresimilar to those with other treatment methods, but none of the patientsin this study developed optic nerve atrophy.</TEXT></DOC>
