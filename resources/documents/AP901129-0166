The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, allegesa conspiracy including attempted murder, coercion, arson androbbery. The filing comes three days after police said there was noevidence of a conspiracy in 229 strike-related incidents since thewalkout began five weeks ago.   The lawsuit asserted that the unions had one of two intentions.The News claimed they want to coerce the tabloid into accepting afeatherbedding settlement that contained abuses the News hasstriven to eliminate in 10 months of negotiations.   The News also claimed that through violence the unions hoped toimplement a buyout plan organized by Theodore Kheel, the unions'unpaid legal adviser.   Kheel is not named in the lawsuit. Named are the Newspaper andMail Deliverers' Union of New York and Vicinity, the AlliedPrinting Trades Council, the umbrella group representing the ninestriking unions, and 23 drivers, some of whom have been arrestedduring the course of the strike.   Kheel said ``the underpinning of this lawsuit was blown out ofthe water'' when top police officials said at a legislative hearingthey had found no conspiracy.   Richard Weiss, a spokesman for the Allied, said there would beno comment until the unions had seen the lawsuit.   ``This lawsuit is a response to a conspiracy of violence andintimidation that has victimized the News, its dealers, advertisersand readers since the strike began,'' said News Publisher JamesHoge in a statement given reporters.   ``We intend to resist this campaign of violence and coercionwith every legal means at our disposal.''   The 23 drivers named in the action include individuals who havebeen arrested in connection with specific acts of violence in thebitter strike.   Nine of the newspaper's 10 unions representing some 2,100strikers have been off the job since Oct. 25. The newspaper haspublished daily despite distribution problems, some of which havebeen linked to threats against vendors and attacks on trucks andreplacement workers.   RICO, or Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act, hasbeen used successfully by federal prosecutors. Provisions of theact that enable law enforcement officials to assess stiff civilpenalties tying up the assets of alleged organized crime figuresmade it popular.   In recent years it has been seen as part of more civil actionsbut use in a labor dispute is very rare.   Under RICO a series of criminal acts must be determined to bepart of an ongoing pattern of criminal conduct.   The lawsuit said drivers wanted to ``extort the News intopreserving payments to drivers' union members for fictitious andunwanted labor services.''   The lawsuit also said through a pattern of violence andintimidation, Kheel sought to get the News to sell to him and agroup of investors.   The News seeks $50 million but under RICO, a plaintiff can askfor triple damages, or $150 million.</TEXT></DOC>
