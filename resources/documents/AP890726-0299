The union, on strike since March 4, called Eastern's decision anadmission by Eastern it couldn't gain U.S. Bankruptcy Courtapproval of proposed cost cuts.   ``They realized they couldn't win,'' said pilots union spokesmanHank Weber. ``They were trying to use the bankruptcy court as avehicle to change the contract and impose new work rules.''   Eastern answered that its recruiting program has enabled thecompany to achieve the necessary cuts in pilot costs. Even thoughEastern is offering new pilots $28,000 a year, very high within theairline industry for new hires, company spokeswoman Karen Ceremsaksaid Eastern is saving money compared with the salaries of veteranpilots now on strike. The company says they were earning $75,000 to$100,000.   Eastern had proposed a 10 percent salary reduction for sixmonths and another 5 percent salary cut for another six months aswell as delays in vacation. The company said filing for a contractchange through the court was seen as a way of finding a settlementto prolonged labor differences with its pilots.   However, since the filing last month, Eastern and its pilotshave held intensive negotiations under the auspices of BankruptcyExaminer David Shapiro.   The pilots union earlier this month asked that the year-oldtalks be declared at an impasse and the National Mediation Boardtake over. Eastern's announcement Wednesday apparently means thetalks could be referred to the mediation board.   The Eastern announcement underlines the unusual situation itspilots contract is in. The pilots officially are not striking buthonoring the picket lines of Eastern's Machinists union, whichstruck March 4 after 18 months of federal mediation failed.   The pilots are still governed by the Railway Labor Act, whichrequires them to go through federal mediation before striking.Further complicating the contract is Eastern's March 9 filing forChapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, which gives that courtjurisdiction.   Eastern, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with hiring of new pilotsand under current U.S. Supreme Court precedent doesn't have to giveveteran pilots jobs already filled by new hires, even if the strikewere settled.   Six years ago, Texas Air was able to jettison contractualobligations to pilots as Continental Airlines emerged frombankruptcy proceedings. But bankruptcy laws were changed after thatto require more careful review before contractual promises could beleft behind.   Eastern announced Tuesday that it is continuing to boost itsdaily schedule, adding 59 percent more flights Aug. 1 with helpfrom sister carrier Continental.   Eastern, which struggled to fly 100 flights daily in the firstweeks after its unions struck, said it will increase its Julyschedule of 225 daily flights to 350 on Aug. 1 and to 390 flightson Aug. 15.   The Miami-based carrier on Tuesday announced leasing of fiveplanes and crews from Continental, also owned by Texas Air Corp.,to help with the August schedule.   Eastern has said it can rebuild without the unions and plans tobuild up by year's end to 800 flights, compared to nearly 1,100daily before the strike.   Most of Eastern's creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court haveexpressed approval of the company's rebuilding plans, while theunions are backing a buyout bid by Chicago options trader JosephRitchie.   Frank Causey, Eastern vice president for flight operations, said325 veteran Eastern pilots have crossed union picket lines, 260pilot recruits have completed training, and 680 recruits are stillin training. Eastern said 107 of the recruits enrolled this week,and that there were 25 pilot cross-overs Monday and Tuesday, themost in such a short time since the strike's beginning.   Only about 200 of the 3,600 Air Line Pilots Association memberscrossed picket lines at the strike's beginning.   ``We consider this as only a dribble,'' ALPA spokesman Ron Cole.``Eastern gave it its best shot last week, given the huge mediablitz. The picket line is still solid.''</TEXT></DOC>
