The ships are the first to be stationed in Japan with launchersfor Tomahawk missiles, which are made in both nuclear andnon-nuclear versions.   ``Get out from Yokosuka!'' about 100 people shouted in Englishat the gates of the naval base as the Ticonderoga-class guidedmissile cruiser USS Bunker Hill and the destroyer USS Fife arrivedin the port 28 miles southwest of Tokyo.   A coast guard official said the warships arrived withoutincident. Forty-two coast guard patrol boats escorted the U.S.ships into the port to prevent the approach of 28 small boatscarrying protesters and banners reading ``No Tomahawks,'' theofficial said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Japan forbids the production, possession, or introduction intothe country of nuclear weapons.   Nearly 200,000 people died in the Japanese cities of Hiroshimaand Nagasaki when the United States dropped the first atomic bombsto end World War II.   After the ships arrived, more protesters from civic and peacegroups, labor unions and the Japanese Communist Party stagedseparate rallies at a park overlooking the port, outside the navalbase and elsewhere, carrying placards and shouting slogans. Policereported no arrests.   Protesters said the biggest rally, sponsored by the communists,drew an estimated 1,000 people.   On Tuesday, Yokosuka's 48-member city assembly unanimouslypassed a resolution urging the government to keep out the U.S.warships. The city's mayor and the prefectural governor also lodgedofficial protests Monday with the Japanese government and said itdid not do enough to ensure that the ships were not carryingnuclear weapons.   ``We hope our grassroot struggles will spread to a nationalmovement,'' said Yoshiko Saito, a leader of a citizens' groupstaging a sit-in near the Yokosuka city hall.   The 9,600-ton Bunker Hill and the 7,810-ton Fife both arecapable of deploying Tomahawk missiles. Under the Japan-U.S.security agreement, the United States has pledged to notify Japanbeforehand if it plans to bring nuclear arms into the country.   But critics charge the Japanese government uses the agreement asa way of avoiding the question of whether U.S. ships dock in thecountry with nuclear weapons aboard.   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita told reporters Wednesday thatthe government would not ask the United States to confirm whetherthe ships were carrying nuclear missiles because ``we trust eachother in such matters,'' Kyodo News Service reported.   The U.S. military, which has about 50,000 personnel stationed inJapan, maintains a policy of not publicly confirming or denyingnuclear weapons aboard its ships.</TEXT></DOC>
