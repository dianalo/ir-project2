Mr. Stockman's bugbear, of course, is the budget deficit. But, as it happens, the outlook for this deficit is brighter today than at any time in the recent past. Fortune magazine, using a national income accounting model, sees a $186 billion deficit in this fiscal year and $120 billion in fiscal 1988. Whatever the exact numbers, the trend seems at last to be decisively downward. The reason is that government spending has finally decelerated. In its February Financial Market Perspective, Goldman Sachs reports:    &quot;Growth in federal spending is plummeting and will be the slowest since before President Johnson's mid-1960s Great Society and Vietnam military buildup. . . . This fiscal 1987 spending falloff is contributing to one of the largest deficit reductions . . . on record. Relative to GNP, the estimated deficit reduction will exceed one percentage point for only the eighth time in 35 years. . . . For the next 12-18 months, the Treasury's market borrowing requirement will be the lowest in years.&quot; st    Is there any real danger that the decline in the dollarwill precipitate a flight by foreigners from U.S. debtsecurities? Perhaps. But it is worth keeping in mind that --according to Richard Young, quoted in Business Week (Feb. 23)-- in the past seven years the percentage of U.S. debt heldby foreigners has actually declined to 11% from 14%.   ---   Is it possible that the American trade deficit is not quite as bad as it seems? The eminent economist Samuel Brittan, writing in the Financial Times (Feb. 19), thinks it is very possible indeed. He points to a &quot;black hole&quot; in OECD world trade statistics. Though, by definition, one country's deficit is another country's surplus, the figures nevertheless fail to balance. The total deficits are $80 billion larger than the total surpluses. Mr. Brittan proceeds to speculate:    &quot;If all the errors and omissions were attributable to the U.S. -- which is not impossible in view of the dollar's role in world finance -- the U.S. payments deficit would come down to $60 billion. . . . Even if half the unallocated credits were attributed to the U.S., that country's payments deficit would be just below $100 billion.&quot;    ---   In any case, it does appear that the trade deficit has bottomed out. As David A. Levine of Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. points out, however, the process is disguised by the fact that our trade statistics are in nominal dollars, rather than in constant (inflation-adjusted) dollars, while GNP growth is always given in constant dollars. The fall of the dollar means that import prices are rising more rapidly than export prices, so that even as imports decline relative to exports, the dollar value of imports may not decline at all. But in real terms, which is what counts for growth in GNP, the situation would be improving -- as it seems to be.    ---   Bear Stearns's Lawrence A. Kudlow points out that the reports of the death of American manufacturing are not simply exaggerated -- they are false. Manufacturing's share of total output today (22%) is above the postwar average. Since 1982, real output growth in manufacturing has been at the rate of 6.9% annually. Labor productivity in manufacturing has grown at more than 4% annually. Even employment in manufacturing has not declined since 1967 -- it is flat.    What has declined is manufacturing's share of total employment (from to 19% from 33%). It is the relative growth of the service sector that creates the impression that the manufacturing sector is in such bad shape. The focus of the media on a few of the largest industries -- notably autos and steel -- also plays its part.    ---   The basic problem with the &quot;Laffer curve&quot; is not its premise that a cut in marginal tax rates will, under most circumstances, stimulate economic activity and thereby increase government's revenues. That premise is close to being a platitude. The questions that arise involve relative magnitudes and times. How much of a cut will produce how large an increase in government's revenues, and over what period of time?    Laurence Lindsey, in a National Bureau of Economic Research &quot;working paper,&quot; has helped us get our bearings on this issue. He estimates that perhaps one-quarter of the revenue loss created by the 1981 tax cuts was recouped as a result of changes in taxpayer behavior in 1982-84. Those were not very good years, it will be recalled. By 1987, it is reasonable to assume, the proportion is much, much higher. Mr. Lindsey also calculates that if, in 1981, the marginal tax rate had been reduced to 35% (instead of 50%), federal income-tax revenues would have been still greater -- indeed, they would have been maximized. A reasonable guess -- and that is probably all we shall ever be in a position to make -- is that, other things being equal, a maximized cut in marginal tax rates restores government's revenues to the original level over a five-year period.    ---   In another NBER working paper, Douglas Bernheim raises the question, &quot;What Do Estate Taxes Do?&quot; The answer may come as a surprise to some. Mr. Bernheim calculates that one thing they do not do is collect more revenues for the government. Estate planners, apparently, see to that. They do, however, help considerably to finance non-profit organizations. And to a slight degree they may help break up large concentrations of wealth.    ---   Tired of &quot;poison pills&quot; and &quot;golden parachutes&quot;? Well, Potlatch Corp. of San Francisco has come up with a defense against a hostile takeover that makes sense, moral and economic and sociological. It has established what amounts to a &quot;residential requirement&quot; for shareholders. You have to own Potlatch stock for four years in order to vote it. Such a residential requirement is common enough in political elections. Why not in corporate elections? Why should the transient (i.e., arbitrager) with no commitment to the well-being of the community (i.e., institution) have the same political power as the more permanent residents (i.e., stockholders)? Even in our universities, tenured professors vote, while non-tenured faculty are rarely given that privilege.    On the other hand, four years does seem a bit too restrictive, too protective of management. A two-year requirement would probably serve the same purpose just as well. It wouldn't (and shouldn't) prevent a takeover bid, but it would surely discourage those out for a &quot;quick killing,&quot; regardless of the human or longer-term economic costs.    ---   Mr. Kristol is the John M.
