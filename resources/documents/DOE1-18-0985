Datawere gathered for several states up to 11.8 MeV in excitation energy.The experimental results are compared to distorted wave impulse approximationcalculations and to other pion scattering data from the same nucleusat higher beam energies. The striking enhancement of {pi}{sup -} over{pi}{sup +} scattering to the 9.5 MeV (9/2{sup +} state observed in previousstudies at resonance energies is found to persist at 65 MeV.</TEXT></DOC>
