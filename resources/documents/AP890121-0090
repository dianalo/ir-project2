President Bush said Saturday in Washington the United Stateswould make no concessions to free the hostages. ``We are not goingto escalate the currency of holding Americans hostage,'' he said.   The fundamentalist cleric, Sheik Sadek Mousawi, said the UnitedStates should meet Iranian conditions for freeing the Americanhostages, according to the interview published by the Beirutmagazine An-Nahar Arab and International.   The magazine quoted Mousawi as saying, ``I would like to assertthat there are good indications of an imminent release of theBritish hostages as a result of the Iranian-British rapprochement.''   Britain and Iran agreed Dec. 9 to restore full diplomatic ties,ending a 19-month break that followed the arrest of an Iraniandiplomat in England on shoplifting charges.   Three Britons are among the 15 foreign hostages in Lebanon. Theyare Anglican church envoy Terry Waite, who disappeared Jan. 20,1987; journalist John McCarthy, kidnapped April 17, 1986; andeducator Brian Keenan, a dual British-Irish national abducted April11, 1986.   Also missing is Alec Collett, a British journalist who wasworking for the U.N. Relief and Works agency when he disappearedMarch 25, 1985. An Islamic group claims to have killed him, but nobody was found.   Mousawi heads a small group called The Islamic Movement, whichseeks to set up an Islamic republic in Lebanon patterned after theIranian regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   Mousawi's group is allied with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, orParty of God, an umbrella organization for pro-Iranian factionsbelieved holding most of the hostages.   The magazine quoted Mousawi as saying the United States wouldhave to make concessions to win freedom for the nine Americanhostages.   ``If America wants its hostages, then it has to respond to theIranian demands so that Iran would give the advice (to the hostageholders) to free the American hostages,'' he said.   Tehran has demanded release of $10 billion in Iranian assetsfrozen in the United States as a precondition for its aid inreleasing the American hostages.   The American captives include Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who is the foreigner heldlongest in Lebanon. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Mousawi said Iran could exert influence on the captors, eventhough the kidnappings were ordered by ``Lebanese personalities''and carried out by Lebanese without intervention from Iran.   He added, ``But it is normal for any Moslem irrespective of howfar he is geographically from Iran to be influenced by the advice ofthe officials in Iran.''</TEXT></DOC>
