Gorbachev, on hisfirst visit to Cuba on Sunday, may seek to defuse conflicts inCentral America and tell Fidel Castro the Kremlin is weary offinancing Cuban adventurism.   Both Soviet and Western analysts interviewed in Moscow predictthe reformist Soviet leader will be outwardly friendly toward thedoctrinaire Cuban president. But they expect Gorbachev to use theisland as a platform for a major speech signaling his desire for apeaceful settlement of regional strife.   President Bush has urged Gorbachev to use his influence withNicaragua to further peace efforts.   ``We would like to see the Soviet Union withdraw their resourcesand support in Nicaragua,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwatersaid Thursday.   In a speech in Atlanta, Secretary of State James A. Baker IIIurged the Soviets to show ``signs of new thinking'' in CentralAmerica. He said the region was ``not a dumping ground'' for armsand failed ideologies of outsiders.   Gorbachev's four-day visit to Havana, to be preceded by a briefstop Sunday in Ireland and followed by a visit to Britain for talkswith Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Queen Elizabeth II, hadbeen set for December. After addressing the United Nations andmeeting Ronald Reagan and George Bush in New York, however,Gorbachev broke off his trip and flew home after the devastatingearthquake in Soviet Armenia.   ``We are not going to worsen our relations with Cuba,'' oneSoviet specialist on Latin American affairs said of the visit toHavana. ``But Gorbachev is a very persuasive man and he will try toexplain his intentions.''   The expert said Gorbachev will inform Castro that Moscow is nolonger interested in financing class struggle and wars of nationalliberation abroad.   Castro, who just celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Cubanrevolution, has supported armed struggle not only in Latin Americabut in Africa as well.   After years of backing leftist forces in Angola, Cuban troopsrecently began a withdrawal from southern Africa as part of aSoviet-backed negotiated settlement between Cuba, Angola and SouthAfrica.   A senior Western analyst, who like the Soviet expert spoke oncondition of anonymity, said Gorbachev also is likely to tellCastro privately that the Kremlin can't afford to subsidize Cuba'seconomy indefinitely.   ``Castro has been protected from his mistakes by Soviet aid,''the Western diplomat said, citing U.S. calculations that Sovieteconomic assistance account for perhaps 20 percent of Cuba's grossnational product.   While Gorbachev's program of perestroika seeks to decentralizethe communist-controlled economy, open markets and create financialincentives for improved production, Castro's ``correction oferrors'' campaign has clamped tighter government controls onproduction while shutting down peasants' markets and seeking toeradicate pay differences among workers.   Castro's determination to follow communist doctrine in the faceof widespread evidence that his island's economy is in shamblesprompted the Western analyst to observe, ``It's easy to talk aboutideological purity when somebody else is paying for it.''   U.S. sources say there already have been substantial reductionsin Soviet aid to Cuba as evidenced in the marked decline in thepurchase of sugar, which the Soviet Union buys from Cuba at pricessubstantially higher than world market levels as a form of subsidy.   The Soviet Union has embarked on a major overhaul of its ownailing economy and has taken steps to extract itself from regionalconflicts that have drained its resources while threatening to blowup into superpower confrontation.   Gorbachev announced to the United Nations on Dec. 7 his plan topare a half-million men from the Soviet armed forces, withdrawthousands of tanks and other offensive military units from EasternEurope and ease tensions on the Chinese border by drawing downSoviet forces in Mongolia.   The Kremlin completed its promised military withdrawal fromAfghanistan on Feb. 15. Three weeks later, it entered talks withthe West in search of a negotiated reduction of all conventionalforces in Europe.   But Soviet intentions are less clear in Centeral America, wherethe Sandinista government in Nicaragua continues to receivesubstantial Soviet military aid _ much of it channeled through Cuba_ and Salvadoran rebels press their civil war with East blocweaponry.   The United States, meanwhile, has backed the Salvadorangovernment and Contra guerrillas in Nicaragua.   Central America, the Western diplomat noted, ``is one of thelast remaining really hot regional conflicts outside the MiddleEast in which there's a strong superpower presence.''   In his address to the United Nations, Gorbachev rejected ``theuse or threat of force'' as an instrument of foreign policy,calling instead for new world order based on ``universal humanconsensus'' and respect for individual differences.   ``As the world asserts its diversity,'' he said, ``attempts tolook down on others and to teach them one's own brand of democracybecome totally improper to say nothing of the fact that democraticvalues intended for export often very quickly lose their worth.''   Adhering to that policy, Gorbachev is unlikely to lecture Castroon how to run his own country, but it remains to be seen how muchthe Soviet Union is prepared to subsidize Cuba's longstandingdeficit economy.</TEXT></DOC>
