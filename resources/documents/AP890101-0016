Omar Reyh, chairman of the Eritrean Liberation Front-UnifiedOrganization, said Sudan proposed the talks after a recent visit toKhartoum by an Ethiopian delegation, the Al-Siyassa newspaperreported.   The newspaper quoted Reyh as saying he met Saturday with SudanesePrime Minister Sadek Mahdi, who suggested Sudan as the site for thenegotiations.   ``Sudan proposed that there be a preparatory meeting between theEritrean and Ethiopian sides to prepare for an official negotiatingdelegation,'' the rebel leader was quoted as saying. ``We haveaccepted this proposal.''   There was no immediate word from Addis Ababa, the Ethiopiancapital, about the Marxist government's position on the proposal.   The governments of Sudan and Ethiopia often have exchangedcharges of harboring each other's rebels, but relations haveimproved recently.   Three factions of the Eritrean Liberation Front _ which have beenfighting 26 years for independence of their northern Ethiopianregion _ joined forces on Jan. 23, 1985, as the Eritrean LiberationFront-Unified Organization.   The Eritrean revolt, exacerbated by famine, has forced about850,000 Ethiopians across the border into Sudan in search of safety.</TEXT></DOC>
