The space agency announced a new category of ``space flightparticipants'' and said, at the same time, that flight opportunitiesfor them ``are not available at this time.''   Before the Challenger exploded on liftoff Jan. 28, 1986, NASA hadgiven minimum training to a senator, a member of the House ofRepresentatives, a Saudi Arabian prince and Christa McAuliffe, thefirst ``Teacher in Space.'' Mrs. McAuliffe was killed along withindustrial engineer Gregory Jarvis and five astronauts.   ``The Challenger accident marked a major change in the U.S.outlook and policies with respect to the flight of other than NASAastronauts,'' the National Aeronautics and Space Administration saidin the policy statement Thursday.   ``NASA and interested external parties, domestic andinternational, must re-examine previous understandings,expectations, and commitments regarding flight opportunities.''   At the time of the Challenger explosion, the process of choosinga reporter to fly on the shuttle was in its final stages. Committeeshad winnowed down thousands of applications to 40.   When the shuttle does begin flying non-essential passengersagain, NASA said, a teacher will be the first.   The agency said that for now, flight opportunities generally willbe limited to professional astronauts and payload specialistsessential for mission requirements while it works to improve thereliability of the shuttle and reduces a payload backlog.   The new space flight participant category embraces those ``whosepresence on board the space shuttle is not required for operation ofpayloads or for other essential mission mission activities, but isdetermined by the administrator of NASA to contribute to otherapproved NASA objectives or to be in the national interest.''   Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, flew on the shuttle in April 1985 andRep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., was aboard in January 1986, at theinvitation of NASA's administrator. Both hold positions important tothe space program on congressional committees and the officialexplanation was that the flights were important to their oversightresponsibilities.   In 1985, shuttle passengers included Sultan Al-Saud of SaudiArabia and Rodolfo Neri Vela, a Mexican. They were aboard, NASAsaid, to ``observe'' the launches of the Arabsat and Morelos-Bcommunications satellites for their countries.   NASA said that while it remains committed to a long-term goal ofproviding such flight opportunities it is devoting its energies toproving that the shuttle is safe and reliable.   ``Accordingly, flight opportunities for space flight participantsare not available at this time,'' NASA said. ``When NASA determinesthat a flight opportunity is available for a space flightparticipant, first priority will be given to a Teacher in Space infulfillment of space education plans.''   All shuttle flights will be planned with a minimum crew of fiveNASA astronauts and can be increased to a maximum of seven forpayload or other mission requirements, the agency said. Such addedcrew members have to be chosen at least 12 months before the flightand first consideration will be given to NASA's own people.</TEXT></DOC>
