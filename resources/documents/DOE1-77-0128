The informed workers reported more health problemsthan controls, but there were no significant differences between theinformed and uninformed groups in mental health, attitudes toward healthhazards in or outside of the workplace, or in smoking rates. Ninety percentof all respondents felt that exposed workers definitely should be toldof their health risks. These findings indicate little psychological riskfrom informing workers about their risks because of exposure to toxicsubstances and a strong desire on the part of workers to be informed.</TEXT></DOC>
