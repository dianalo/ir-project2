HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Although female doctors can successfully combinechild rearing with teaching at medical schools, most feel thatmotherhood has slowed their careers, according to a survey releasedtoday.   Women make up 19 percent of medical school faculties _ up from13 percent two decades ago _ but they have been slower to crack thethe academic world's top ranks.   A nationwide survey of 558 of these women, all younger than 50,found that nearly two-thirds had children. About half of those withyoungsters had delayed starting their families until they were intheir early 30s and had finished their medical training.   Although the majority said they were satisfied with theircareers and their decision to have children, 78 percent felt thattheir families had slowed their job advancement.   ``We believe that it is possible for women to combine motherhoodwith a fulfilling career in academic medicine, but it is difficult,and most such women believe that motherhood slows the progress oftheir careers,'' the researchers wrote.   Drs. Wendy Levinson and Susan W. Tolle of Oregon Health SciencesUniversity and Charles Lewis of the University of California, LosAngeles, conducted the survey. The results were published intoday's New England Journal of Medicine.   To earn senior posts on medical faculties, junior doctors mustfirst receive tenure, and that requires conducting research andpublishing reports, among other duties.   The study's authors suggested that women _ or men _ who taketime off for their children be given longer to complete thesemilestones. ``For example, a faculty member working half time wouldhave twice as long to achieve standards for promotion and tenure asthose working full time,'' they wrote.   In a separate commentary in the journal, Dr. Carola Eisenberg, achild psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School, said medical schoolsshould use affirmative action to get more women into their upperlevels.   ``If there is only one tenure slot and there are both men andwomen fully qualified to fill it, a woman should be appointed,''she wrote. ``That is the only way to offset the prevailing patternof discrimination.''   She also urged that the proportion of women among tenuredfaculty members rise from the current 6.7 percent to 10 percentwithin the next three years.   ``Does anyone really believe that 500 qualified women cannot befound among the 8,000 now at the level of assistant or associateprofessor to make this goal realistic?'' she asked.</TEXT></DOC>
