In an attempt to formulatemicroemulsions with the desired phase behavior, a solubilization studyof a nonionic water-in-oil microemulsion system was conducted. One ofthe key attributes of the microemulsion system studied is the absenceof a cosolvent. A simple geometric model is proposed to explain the observedeffects of hydrocarbon chain length and electrolyte concentration onsolubilization. This model is useful for optimization of microemulsionformulation. The microemulsion system developed was used to separateacetic acid from a dilute aqueous solution. The effect of mixing speedas well as treat ratio on separation rate and leakage were also investigated.Demulsification of the microemulsion to recover the separated aceticacid was successfully achieved.</TEXT></DOC>
