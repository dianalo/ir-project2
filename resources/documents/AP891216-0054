The Vietnam News Agency said on Friday that a Foreign Ministryofficial delivered a note on Vietnam's position regarding the boatpeople to Emrys Davies, Britain's ambassador in Hanoi.   A Foreign Office spokesman in London said today taht Britainwould not comment because it had not received confirmation of whatthe note said.   A group of 51 Vietnamese was flown from Hong Kong to Hanoi onTuesday in the first forced repatriation of boat people.   Vietnamese authorities accepted the group and said the refugeeswould not be mistreated, but officials also criticized the forcedrepatriation program.   According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Foreign Ministry notestrongly rejected forced repatriation and said Vietnam would onlyaccept ``those who volunteer to return or who are not opposed tothe repatriation.''   It said the ministry official cautioned Davies that ``anyviolation of these principles may hamper and even completelydisrupt the process of cooperation to resolve this problem step bystep'' as agreed to at a conference on Indochinese refugees held inGeneva in June.   According to the news agency, the ministry official said that``if Vietnam discovers any case of `forced repatriation,' itreserves the right to return them to Hong Kong.''   Many of the 44,000 Vietnamese who have sailed into Hong Kongsince June 1988 are considered illegal ``economic migrants'' unlessthey can prove they fled their Communist homeland to escapepersecution. Thousands have demonstrated to protest the decision byBritain and its colony to force the return of the refugees, adecision condemned by the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
