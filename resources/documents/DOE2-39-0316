In this way it is possible to estimatethe influence of the occupied Dirac sea and the role of the nearly unknownNanti N-meson vertex. Our results depend strongly on this vertex andgive for the usual dipole ansatz of the form factor always attractiveNanti N-pair contributions, special choices of the Nanti N-meson vertex,however, also allow repulsive effects.</TEXT></DOC>
