The precise dates vary, but it's as good a point as any to markthe beginning of the presidential campaign that ends, finally,today. It was mind-numbing in length, rich in color and leftpolitical activists yearning for a little peace and quiet.   ``It's hard to believe this is going to be over, but it's timefor it to be over,'' said Iowa Republican Chairman Michael Mahaffey.``There'll be a little letdown.''   The race between Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis andRepublican nominee George Bush was just the final matchup of thecampaign for Iowans, who look back at nearly four years of rallies,coffee klatches and barnyard tours.   They watched Jesse Jackson milk a cow, Robert Dole drive atractor and Bruce Babbitt pedal a bike _ in summer and the dead ofwinter.   Iowa was the first testing ground for Gephardt's tough-talkingtrade policies, Pat Robertson's ``invisible army'' of Christianfollowers, Dole's ``I'm one of you'' theme and Paul Simon's returnto liberalism of earlier years.   In the early rounds of the caucuses on Feb. 8, Bush suffered astunning loss, finishing third behind Dole and Robertson. Dukakisalso finished third behind Gephardt and Simon in a closer Democraticcontest.   If today's decision brings a respite, the popular consensus isthat the peace and quiet could last all of 48 hours before yetanother campaign begins.   ``They won't have time to rest because they get about a month offand we're right back at it,'' said State Democratic Party ChairwomanBonnie Campbell.   ``I'm not sure it ever comes to an end in Iowa. We have this kindof perpetual campaign here,'' said Phil Roeder, who was spokesmanfor the state Democratic Party until this spring.   ``We'll have period of 24 or 48 hours for either celebration ormourning, depending on what happens. It's the end of the end, andthen it's going to be the beginning of the beginning,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
