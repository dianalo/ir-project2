Air Cargo, a Rancho Dominguez, Calif., maker of cargo enclosures, previously rejected a Zero offer of $7.75 per share, or $19.7 million. However, Zero said Air Cargo's president, Thomas Prendergast, has agreed to tender his family's shares, which constitute a stake exceeding 15%. Zero said certain other shareholders and directors will also tender.    Zero, which makes enclosures and other products for the electronics industry, said it would finance the acquisition from cash on hand. The transaction is contingent upon, among other things, Zero acquiring at least 51% of the Air Cargo shares outstanding, Zero said. </TEXT></DOC>
