Another Palestinian man was reported wounded in a clash betweensoldiers and stone-throwers at a refugee camp.   The army began enforcing a new policy requiring Gaza StripPalestinians to buy special stickers for their cars to drive intoIsrael. A military spokesman said the practice will bar severalhundred of about 25,000 Arab-owned vehicles from Israel.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told the Cabinet he saw no need to``rush into'' devising a Middle East peace plan before he visitsWashington for talks with President Bush in April, Israel radioreported.   Shamir spoke during a review of his meetings last week withFrench leaders in Paris and talks in Egypt between Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard Shevardnadze and his Israeli counterpart, MosheArens.   The meetings failed to break a deadlock over Israel's rejectionof Soviet proposals for an international peace conference and fordirect negotiations with the PLO.   In Jewish West Jerusalem, suspected Palestinian nationalistsstoned a bus in the center of the city, wounding one Israeli, Israelradio said. Police detained a 16-year-old suspect for questioning.   In Israel, police uncovered a seven-member squad of Palestinianswho belonged to the Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine-General Command, a radical group headed by Ahmed Jibril,the radio reported.   The squad lived in Arab villages inside Israel. The group hadcameras and electronic equipment, but details of their activitiesare banned from publication.   In Gaza City in the crowded seaside Gaza Strip, toops shot andkilled 20-year-old Ahmed Abed Muharram when stone-throwing youthsconfronted tax collectors during a raid at a Palestinian home, Arabreports said. Withholding of taxes has been a frequently used tacticduring the uprising.   The army said it was checking the report.   The death raised to 386 the number of Palestinians killed in therevolt against the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and WestBank. Seventeen Israelis, including six soldiers, also have died.   Also in Gaza City, a masked Palestinian walked into thegovernment-run Shifa Hospital and shot deputy director Abdel RaufHilles in the head for being a suspected collaborator, Arab reportssaid.   An army spokesman confirmed the shooting and said Hilles wastransferred to an Israeli hospital.   The national Itim News Agency said Hilles, 35, was in charge ofsecurity at Shifa, and Israel radio said he personally guarded anIsraeli medical officer.   At least 60 Arabs killed during the uprising have been slain byfellow Palestinians who suspect them of collaborating with Israeliofficials, said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.   The other wounding in Gaza involved a 30-year-old man shot in thewrist during a clash in Shati refugee camp, Arab reports said.   The car sticker policy requires Palestinians to have their policerecords checked before they can purchase a sticker. A militaryspokesman said each sticker costs 10 shekels, about $5.50. Theaverage monthly wage for Palestinians is 400 to 500 shekels.   Arab reporters said stickers will be denied Palestinians who havenot paid taxes.   In the West Bank city of Nablus, soldiers arrested dozens ofsuspects during searches for the Palestinian who killed Israelireserve Sgt. Binyamin Meisner, the radio said.   Meisner died Friday when someone dropped a concrete block on hishead.   Arab reports said troops blew up a house near the site of theattack and a room in an adjacent house. A third home in the area wassealed shut, the reports said.   Soldiers maintained a curfew on most of Nablus' 120,000 residentsfor a third straight day.   Dr. Amir Al-Masri, an obstetrician at Al Ittihad Hospital, saidthe curfew prevented most of the medical staff from reporting towork and that only 24 doctors and nurses out of 145 arrived Sunday.   Al-Masri also said the hospital lacked fresh meat and vegetablesto feed its patients. Only one of four ambulances was permitted tooperate, other Arab reports said.   Military sources denied the reports and said doctors are allowedfree access to the area, despite the curfew. They added that thereare no shortages of food in the city.</TEXT></DOC>
