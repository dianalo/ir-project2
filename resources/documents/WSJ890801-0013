For bond investors, such news raises the possibility that the Federal Reserve will further loosen its grip on credit and allow interest rates to fall further.    &quot;The rally was predicated on speculation that the Federal Reserve eventually will have to cut rates drastically&quot; in the face of a sharp economic slowdown, says Lawrence Leuzzi, managing director at S.G. Warburg andamp; Co. &quot;People now believe we are heading for a bumpy landing rather than a soft landing.&quot;    David Jones, a senior vice president and economist at Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co. termed the mood in the bond market as &quot;almost euphoric.&quot;    The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 7/8 point, or about $8.75 for every $1,000 face amount. Its yield slipped to 7.91% from 7.99% Friday, which was the first time in more than two years that the rate had dipped below 8%.    Corporate bonds also rose while municipal bonds were unchanged to slightly higher. Mortgage-backed securities, which have been hurt as several ailing savings and loans associations liquidate their portfolios, ended mixed.    Yesterday's bullish sentiment was fueled by rumors that the latest National Association of Purchasing Management economic index, which is due out today, will come in at about 45%, well below the 48.8% June level. The index will provide the first look at how the economy fared in July. An index under 50% implies a slowing economy while one above 50% suggests the economy is expanding.    Economists contend that Thursday's data on June leading indicators and the July employment report, scheduled for release Friday, also will reveal slower growth.    Mr. Leuzzi says some traders are speculating that the Fed might even cut its discount rate. That rate, now at 7%, is the fee the Fed charges on short-term loans to banks and savings institutions. Few economists, however, believe that the Fed will resort to such drastic measure prior to its next policy meeting Aug. 22.    Meanwhile, traders said investors are awaiting details of the government's huge quarterly refunding, which could put between $28.5 billion to $29.5 billion of new Treasury securities on the market.    Although interest rates have dropped as much as 1 1/2 percentage points since May's $28.8 billion refunding, analysts say there continues to be strong demand for Treasury issues from both foreign and domestic investors.    William Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., says next week's auction &quot;can be underwritten in a declining rate atmosphere if the data that are coming out, including the purchasing manager's survey and employment, portray a continuing sluggish economy for July.&quot;    Refunding details will be outlined tomorrow by the Treasury, which is expected to sell the securities next Tuesday through Thursday. Analysts doubt if the recent debt ceiling problems will obstruct the refunding.    Congress last week agreed to a $70 billion temporary increase in the nearly exhausted $2.8 trillion debt limit. The measure, which must be passed by the House and Senate and signed by President Bush, could be in place by week's end.    Between $9.75 billion and $10 billion three-year notes, $9.5 billion to $9.75 billion of 10-year notes and $9.5 billion to $9.75 billion of 30-year bonds are estimated to be auctioned at next week's Treasury refunding. Those estimates represent little change from the $9.79 billion three-year, $9.53 billion 10-year and $9.54 billion 29 3/4-year issues sold in May's refunding.    Treasury Securities    Treasurys ended higher in light trading with long-term securities posting much larger gains than shorter-term securities.    The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted at 110 27/32 compared with 109 31/32 Friday. The latest 10-year notes were quoted at 108 29/32 to yield 7.975% compared with Friday's price of 108 17/32 and yield of 7.85%. The latest five-year note rose a little more than 1/8 point.    At the government's weekly auction, short-term interest rates moved sharply lower from a week earlier. The average discount rate on new three-month Treasury bills was 7.65%, down from 8.09% at last week's auction. The discount rate on new six-month Treasury bills was 7.35% compared with 7.73% last week. The rate on the three-month bill was the lowest since the average of 7.54% at the auction on Nov. 7, 1988. The six-month bill yield was the lowest since the average of 7.34% at the auction on Sept. 19, 1988.    Here are details of yesterday's auction:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year. @ 13-Week 26-Week @Applications ............ $27,913,280,000 $22,217,400,000 @Accepted bids ........... $6,403,295,000 $6,403,205,000 @Accepted at low price ... 68% 3% @Accepted noncompet'ly ... $1,479,440,000 $1,195,495,000 @Average price (Rate) .... 98.066 (7.65%) 96.284 (7.35%) @High price (Rate) ....... 98.069 (7.64%) 96.289 (7.34%) @Low price (Rate) ........ 98.066 (7.65%) 96.274 (7.37%) @Coupon equivalent ....... 7.91% 7.74% @ Both issues are dated Aug. 3. The 13-week bills mature Nov. 2, and the 26-week bills mature Feb. 1, 1990.    Corporate Issues    Corporate securities ended 1/8 to 1/4 point higher in sluggish trading.    Meanwhile, Thailand became the first Asian nation to issue Yankee bonds, dollar-denominated bonds issued in the U.S. by foreign banks and corporations. The $200 million issue of non-callable 10-year notes, underwritten by Salomon Brothers Inc., was priced to yield 8.70%.    Among other new issues, John Deere Capital Corp., a unit of Deere andamp; Co., offered $150 million of 30-year subordinated debentures priced to yield 8 5/8%. Limited Inc., a women's clothing retailer, offered $100 million of 10-year non-callable notes priced to yield 8 7/8%.    Syndicate managers say other deals are being finalized and should come to market in the next day or two. Among them is a $200 million issue of 10-year subordinated debentures by Penn Central Corp.    Mortgage-Backed Securities    A subsidiary of Japan's Nomura Securities Co. issued $150 million of U.S. collateralized mortgage obligations, becoming the first foreign financial institution to underwrite and distribute the securities.    Investment bankers said the move by Nomura underscores the growing internationalization of the U.S. mortgage market and reflects the growing appetite of foreign investors for U.S. mortgage-backed securities. In February, Nomura filed a registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue as much as $1.1 billion of mortgage securities. Nomura said the bulk of the new Ginnie Mae CMOs will go to Japanese investors, although it expects to sell future mortgage securities world-wide.    Meanwhile, mortgage securities were mixed in secondary trading.    Sales of mortgage securities by ailing thrifts have been keeping the mortgage market under a cloud and the story was no different yesterday. Traders said there were several portfolio liquidations by thrifts, including the sale by one of $500 million Ginnie Mae 9% securities.    &quot;As prices move up the thrift selling accelerates,&quot; said one trader. And although the market has lagged Treasurys, &quot;its ability to absorb the supply has been nothing short of amazing,&quot; another said.    August Ginnie Maes closed up 4/32 at 99 11/32, yielding 9.21% to a 12-year average life assumption. Other Ginnie Maes were quoted from down 2/32 to up as much as 7/32.    Municipal Issues    Municipal bonds were unchanged to 3/8 point higher in very quiet dealings.    With the available supply of bonds in the secondary market thin and investors focusing on new issues, seasoned municipals have been languishing for weeks.    &quot;It's dead,&quot; summed up one trader. &quot;There's been virtually no trading.&quot;    Traders are hoping that some activity will spill over into the secondary market today from what's expected to be a bustling new-issue market.    A BankAmerica group may launch $3 billion of California revenue anticipation notes due in 1990. Speculation is that the notes will be priced to yield 5.65%, about a tenth of a percentage point less than underwriters were contemplating Friday.    Nonetheless, the rate still would be significantly below what the state had to pay last year when it came to market with $3.2 billion of similar notes. That issue was priced to yield 6%.    On the long end of the municipal market, underwriters led by Prudential-Bache Capital Funding are expected to set tentative pricing today for $825 million Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority revenue and revenue refunding bonds. The authority, which supplies most of the electric power consumed in Puerto Rico, is one of the largest municipal utilities in the U.S.    Foreign Bonds    Friday's bond market rally in the U.S. spilled over into West Germany and Japan where prices rose in busy trading.    West Germany's 6 1/2% bonds due February 1999 rose 0.15 point to 102.65, for a yield of 6.61%. The 6 1/2% notes due 1994 gained 0.05 point to 99.50, for a yield of 6.62%.    In Japan, the bond market continued to gather strength from tight supply and expectations of further easing in U.S. monetary policy. Japan's benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 closed at 97.12 to yield 5.07%.    In Britain, government bonds ended little changed in quiet trading. The benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose 2/32 to 116, to yield 9.60%. The 11 3/4% notes due 1991 fell 1/32 to 100 1/8, to yield 11.60%. </TEXT></DOC>
