<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-38-0726 </DOCNO><TEXT>An electron-positron pair spectrometer with nearly 4{pi} acceptance isdescribed. The spectrometer can detect e/sup +/e/sup -/ emission fromnuclear 0-andgt;0 transitions and can be operated in coincidence with (backscattered)particles from a reaction exciting the pair-emitting state. The spectrometerhas a cylindrical design with the target at the center. A cylinder ofthin plastic scintillator divided into four segments identifies the electronsand positrons ({Delta}E) and is surrounded by a cylinder of thicker plasticscintillator also segmented into four quadrants to determine the totalpair energy (E). The four {Delta}E scintillators are rotated 45/sup 0/relative to the four thick E scintillators to increase the probabilityof identifying both members of the electron-positron pair. The efficiencyof the spectrometer is determined at two different pair energies frommeasurements of the pair branches (100%) of the 0/sub 2//sup +/ -andgt; 0/sub1//sup +/ transitions in /sup 40/Ca and /sup 16/O. Pair detection efficienciesof (23.6+-0.3)% and (36.3+-0.7)% are obtained for the 3.35 MeV, /sup40/Ca and 6.05 MeV, /sup 16/O transitions, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
