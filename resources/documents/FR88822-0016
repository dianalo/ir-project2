The proposed regulations establish rules and procedures forthe General Services Administration to collect, compromise or terminatecollection action on claims owed to the U.S. from activities arising underGSA jurisdiction. In particular, procedures were set forth by which GSAcan collect debts owed by Federal employees through the use of administrativeoffset from the employee's disposable pay.GSA received one comment on the proposed regulations. The writer proposedthat certain time limits on employee responses be extended, and that theprocedural requirement of requesting reconsideration of a debt prior torequesting a hearing be eliminated. These comments have been reviewed,and GSA is now adopting a modified rule which responds to the suggestionsreceived.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 22, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>David C.

L.97-365, to 5 U.S.C. 5514. The amendments expanded the authority of Federalagencies to offset debts owed to the United States from the salaries ofits employees. The intention of Congress in passing these amendments wasto minimize the cost to the Government of recovery of the debts. In addition,the amendments imposed more stringent procedural requirements to protectthe interests of Federal employees who have been determined to be indebtedto the U.S.GSA received one response to the proposed rule. The commenter made threepoints:1. While 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(2) requires that an individual request a hearingon the debt or repayment schedule on or before the fifteenth day followingthe receipt of the agency's notice of intent to collect the debt, it doesnot require furnishing all the facts, evidence and names of witnesses withthe request, as required in andSection; 105-56.006(b) of the proposed regulations;2. In a similar fashion, andSection; 105-56.005(c) provides for a seven daylimit for an initial request for reconsideration, which may be insufficienttime to obtain additional facts in support of the reconsideration request;3. Finally, the commenter noted that andSection; 105-56.006(a) of the proposedregulations required that a request for reconsideration be made prior toany request for a hearing, a procedure not strictly required by 5 U.S.C.5514(a)(2).The commenter suggested that 20 days would be appropriate time for an employeeto gather facts, evidence, or witnesses in support of his petition forhearing or request for reconsideration under items 1 and 2, above.After review, GSA has concluded that the additional time requested foran employee to obtain facts, evidence, or witnesses (5 days for item 1,13 days for item 2) would have little or no real effect on the speedy processingand collection of the debt, and insures that employees will have a fairopportunity to present their case. GSA has therefore determined to adoptthe suggestion. The regulations have been amended at andSection; 105-56.005and andSection; 105-56.006 to provide the employee additional time to preparehis response.Likewise, GSA has concluded that a request for reconsideration should bea permissive, and not a mandatory, prerequisite to a pre-offset hearing.The regulations have been amended at andSection; 105-56.006 to eliminatethe requirement of a reconsideration request prior to a request for a hearing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980</ITAG>Under section 3518 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq</T3>., the information collection provisions contained in theseregulations are not subject to the Office of Management and Budget reviewand approval.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with E.O. 12291.
