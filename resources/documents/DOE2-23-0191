The samples were analyzed by the Rutherford backscattering(RBS) and perturbed angular correlation (PAC) techniques, using some10/sup 11//cm/sup 2/ implanted radioactive /sup 111/In tracers. Furthermore,the oxygen surface profiles were also scanned with high resolution byusing the nuclear resonance technique (NRA). The formation of passivatingAl/sub 2/O/sub 3/ surface layers, preventing deeper oxygen diffusionand the indium diffusion into these oxidized surface layers and intothe bulk, were studied. Several quadrupole interaction frequencies previouslyattributed to strained cubic indium precipitates and indium (-vacancy)clusters were observed. When the samples were oxidized above 750 K, theformation of In-O complexes and of substitutional /sup 111/In in Al/sub2/O/sub 3/ was observed.</TEXT></DOC>
