NGA President Terry E. Branstad of Iowa and New Mexico Gov.Garrey E. Carruthers, chairman of the Education Commission of theStates, said most of the 50 governors attending the education summitnext week in Charlottesville, Va., will seek mainly to loosen thestranglehold of federal rules and regulations. Branstad andCarruthers are Republicans.   Admitting that money is a sensitive issue that few can agree on,Branstad said, ``I think there is a feeling that there isconsiderable amount of money being spent on education. We want tospend it as wisely as possible.   ``We want to make sure that when the federal government doesprovide money to states and local school districts it providesenough flexibility to meet the needs of those local students in theschools,'' he said.   Branstad said Bush already has indicated a ``willingness to dosome more in helping `at-risk' kids and programs like the Head Startprograms.''   ``The main focus of this will not be on additional dollars butthere will be discussions about it,'' Branstad said of the summit.``There are some governors who do feel strongly about it and othergovernors feel that is not a major area.''   ``I'm not coming to the summit to ask the president of the UnitedStates for more federal dollars,'' Carruthers said. ``I think that'swrong. I think there's a lot of things that can be done withoutasking him for those federal dollars.''   ``I'm certainly not asking the president to reduce those federaldollars by any means either,'' added Carruthers. ``But there arethings that can be done with deregulation that can free up moneythat can be more properly utilized in the states.''   For example, Carruthers suggested that Medicaid, the governmenthealth care program for the poor, ``become the principleresponsibility of the federal government and education continue tobe the principle responsibility of the state government.''   According to Branstad, ``Our hope is that the summit will help usfocus attention of this nation on the critical issues of educationand will help us draw the support of the American people for some ofthe most important and pressing challenges that we face.''   ``The key to the future will be goals that we establish in thiscoming year,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
