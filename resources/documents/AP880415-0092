About 30 passengers were reported being held in grim conditions,all handcuffed and forced to remain silent. About four crew membersalso are believed to be aboard the jet.   The Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 was hijacked April 5 on a flightfrom Bangkok to Kuwait with 112 people aboard. It was forced toland at Mashhad in northeastern Iran, where the hijackers freed 57hostages.   The plane then flew on to Larnaca, Cyprus, where 13 people werereleased and two Kuwaitis were killed. It arrived in AlgiersTuesday night.   The hijackers are demanding that Kuwait release 17 jailedpro-Iranian terrorists. Kuwaiti officials have refused.   The two recorded messages, almost identical in wording, weresent by radio from the plane to the control tower at HouariBoumedienne Airport.   ``In the name of God the merciful, I greet my family and myfriends and I ask the Kuwaiti authorities to free the 17 prisonersheld in Kuwaiti prisons,'' said Soleiman Mohammed Soleimanal-Mashari. ``In the event of refusal, they are going to kill us.''   In a second message, a man identifying himself as Mohammed AhmedAl-Ajem said: ``I am one of the hostages from the Boeing ... and Iask the Kuwaiti authorities to free the prisoners held in theprisons. Without that, the kidnappers have decided to kill us.''   A passenger made a similar plea Thursday.   The hijackers released one of their captives Thursday during thesecond day of negotiations here with a Kuwaiti delegation throughAlgerian mediators.   The freed hostage, Djuma Abdallah Chatti of Kuwait, is a70-year-old diabetic who doctors said urgently needed an insulinshot.   The gunmen issued a statement saying they would not budge intheir demand that the 17 prisoners be released. They said theystood by their demand ``even if the price we have to pay is veryhigh.''   ``We are not highway bandits,'' they said in the statement,radioed to the control tower in Arabic and English. ``We are men ofprinciple.''   According to a Kuwaiti official who spoke on condition ofanonymity, Chatti reported that the hostage worst affected wasFadel Al-Sabah, 33, cousin of the emir of Kuwait, regarded as thehijackers' most valuable captive. Al-Sabah's two sisters also areon board.   Chatti was quoted as saying Al-Sabah suffered from a severenervous disorder even before he boarded the plane, and theexperience of the hijack ``seems to have put him over the brink.''   Al-Sabah had continuous violent shakes, could not speak and``just cries all the time,'' he said.   Chatti said there were eight hijackers. Other freed passengershave said there were between five and eight.   ``Praise to God, I am fine, but they had me tied all the timeand I am tired,'' Chatti told reporters in the airport lounge.``They are not good people. They beat me.''   Chatti was examined on board Thursday by an physician who toldthe hijackers the man would die unless freed.   The Kuwaiti official quoted Chatti as saying all hostages hadtheir hands handcuffed behind their backs at all times and were notallowed to speak or move.   The official said Chatti had deep, bleeding cuts on both wristsfrom the handcuffs he said he was forced to wear since the planewas in Mashhad.   The Kuwaiti official quoted Chatti as saying four bombs made ofstick explosives connected by wires were attached to the four doorsin the plane's midsection.   In Washington, lawmakers on Thursday urged Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz to intervene because of reports that one of thehijackers might be responsible for kidnapping American journalistTerry Anderson in Lebanon.   Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, was seized March 16, 1985 and is the longest-held of the 22foreign hostages in Lebanon. Nine are Americans.   Kuwait's independent al-Qabas newspaper reported Wednesday thatthe alleged kidnapper, Imad Mughniyeh, was believed to have boardedthe plane when it landed in Mashhad, Iran.   Mughniyeh has been identified as one of the security chiefs inBeirut for Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed to be theumbrella organization for pro-Iranian groups holding the hostages.</TEXT></DOC>
