(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With the successful maiden launch ofthe huge Titan 4, the Pentagon has an unmanned rocket that lessensits reliance on the space shuttle for lifting heavy militarysatellites into orbit.   Nearly 40 of those satellites have languished in storage for lackof a launch vehicle since the shuttle Challenger exploded more thanthree years ago.   The 20-story-tall Titan 4 made a spectacular debut Wednesday whenit thundered off its launch pad with a 2{-ton satellite designed toprovide instant alert of a missile attack on the United States.   It was the most expensive unmanned space mission ever by theUnited States, with the $220 million rocket, the $180 millionsatellite, a $45 million payload booster stage and other costsraising the total to close to $500 billion.   The Air Force reported the big rocket had successfully passed itsmaiden test and placed its military satellite in orbit.   ``This is an important milestone for the Air Force because it'sthe first Titan 4, our new heavy lift launch booster which will giveus assured access to space for our critical heavy national securitypayloads,'' said Lt. Col. Ron Rand, an Air Force spokesman.   The Air Force reported only that the rocket launched Wednesdaycarried a classified payload which it would not identify fornational security reasons.   However, it has been widely reported by knowledgeable observersand by Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine and otherpublications that the rocket carried an advanced missile warningsatellite.   ``The satellite is the first of a new class that uses an infraredtelescope to detect an all-out nuclear missile attack on the UnitedStates within a minute of launch,'' said John Pike, associatedirector of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists.   This quick alert would give the president and military units 15minutes to prepare for a submarine missile attack from the Atlanticor Pacific oceans or 30 minutes for a land-based strike from withinSoviet borders, he said.   Defense Department officials decided after Challenger exploded in1986 that they were relying too much on the manned shuttle forcritical military payloads. So they more than doubled the number ofTitan 4s on order and authorized development of two new smallerrockets, the Delta 2 and Atlas 2, for medium-size payloads.   The Delta 2 made its debut in February, carrying a navigationsatellite into orbit. It repeated with another navigation payloadSaturday.   The shuttle flights resumed last September, and the second flightin December deployed one of the backlogged heavy militarysatellites. Two more are scheduled on shuttle flights later thisyear, with at least one more Titan 4 launch planned.   The Pentagon hopes eventually to shift most of the payloads tothe Titan 4, which can boost 39,000-pound payloads to an orbit 150to 300 miles high or propel 10,000-pound packages to so-calledstationary orbits 23,000 miles up.   The U.S. once had a much more powerful rocket, the Saturn 5 thatlaunched Apollo astronauts to the moon. It could hoist 240,000pounds into orbit. The new Soviet Energia rocket, the world'slargest rocket, has nearly the power of the Saturn 5.   Both the Air Force and National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration are studying designs fpr a large advanced boostercapable of lifting between 150,000 and 200,000 pounds to orbit.   The space shuttle can deliver 55,000 pounds.</TEXT></DOC>
