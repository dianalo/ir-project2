Due to subsequent court and administrativeactions, OSHA has not enforced the rule in the construction industry, andhas not enforced in any industry certain requirements dealing with maintenanceof material safety data sheets on multi-employer worksites, coverage ofconsumer products, and coverage of drugs in the non-manufacturing sector.This notice is to advise the public that, as a result of further courtactions, all provisions of the rule are now in effect in all segments ofindustry.This document also makes technical amendments to the HCS by deleting allnotations that certain provisions lack Office of Management and Budgetapproval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATES: </T2>The revised HCS, codified at 29 CFR 1910.1200,1915.99, 1917.28, and 1918.90, has been in effect for all manufacturingestablishments and for all non-manufacturing establishments other thanconstruction since June 24, 1988. The HCS for the construction industry,codified at 29 CFR 1926.59, has been in effect since January 30, 1989.Compliance with the rule will not be checked during programmed inspectionsin construction establishments until March 17, 1989.

Compliance with the three provisionsof the HCS that were not previously enforced in any industry will not bechecked during programmed inspections until March 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. James F. Foster, Office ofInformation and Consumer Affairs, Occupational Safety and Health Administration,200 Constitution Avenue NW., Room N3647, Washington, DC 20210; (202) 523-8151.To aid employers' efforts to comply with the HCS, a single copy of thefollowing documents may be obtained without charge from OSHA's PublicationsOffice, Room N3101 at the above address, (202) 523-9667: the Hazard CommunicationStandard; OSHA 3084, Chemical Hazard Communication, a booklet describingthe requirements of the rule; and OSHA 3111, Hazard Communication Guidelinesfor Compliance, a booklet which helps employers comply with the rule.OSHA 3104, Hazard Communication_A Compliance Kit (a step-by-step guideto compliance with the standard) is available from the Superintendent ofDocuments, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, (202)783-3238, GPO Order No. 929-022-00000-9; $18_domestic; $22.50_foreign.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2>1. <T3>Coverage of the construction industry.</T3> The HCS requires employersto establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on thehazards of chemicals to their employees by means of labels on containers,material safety data sheets, and training programs. The original rule,which was promulgated on November 25, 1983, covered employees exposed tohazardous chemicals in the manufacturing sector of industry (48 FR 53280).The August 24, 1987 modified rule expanded coverage to all employees exposedto hazardous chemicals, thus providing protection for those in non-manufacturingemployments as well as manufacturing (52 FR 31852)(codified at 29 CFR 1910.1200,1915.99, 1917.28, 1918.90, and 1926.59).The August 1987 rule was scheduled to become fully effective on May 23,1988. On May 20, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit transferred several consolidated cases challenging the standardto the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and in the interim,ordered an administrative stay of the revised standard ``until the ThirdCircuit ruled on the emergency motion for stay'' which had been filed bypetitioners representing the construction industry.On June 24, 1988, the Third Circuit issued an order granting the stay requestedby construction industry representatives. On July 8, 1988, the Third Circuitclarified its earlier order stating: ``The order entered on June 24, 1988,is clarified to make clear that the stay applies only with respect to constructionemployers in the non-manufacturing sector.''OSHA published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 22, 1988 (53 FR 27679) to alert the publicthat the stay only applied to the construction industry. The Agency alsoannounced that programmed inspections in the other non-manufacturing industrieswould begin on August 1, 1988.After considering the merits of the challenges to the standard which werefiled by employer representatives, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the ThirdCircuit issued a decision on November 25, 1988 that denied the petitionsfor review. The Court stated: ``None of the substantive or procedural challengesto the application of the hazard communication standard to the constructionor grain processing and storage industries have merit. The petitions forreview of ABC (Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc.), AGC (The AssociatedGeneral Contractors), NGFA (The National Grain and Feed Association, Inc.)and UTC (United Technologies Corporation) will therefore be denied. Thestay of those standards granted by a panel of this court on June 24, 1988,shall be vacated.'' <T3>Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Brock, </T3>862 F.2d 63, 69 (3d Cir. 1988). Further requests from theAGC and the ABC for a continuation of the stay were denied by both theThird Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan (Nos. 88-1070,88-1075). The Third Circuit's ruling became fully effective on January30, 1989. OSHA recognizes that some employers in the construction industry may beunfamiliar with these legal actions, and may be unsure whether they mustcomply with the revised HCS at this time. This document provides additionalnotice to employers and employees in the construction sector that the HCSis in effect in their industry. As a matter of enforcement policy, OSHAwill not check for compliance with the HCS during programmed inspectionsin the construction industry until March 17, 1989. 2. <T3>Provisions disapproved with regard to information collection requirements.</T3>On October 28, 1987, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), citingauthority of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.), </T3>disapproved certain information collection requirementsin the expanded scope rule, as of the rule's effective date. On December4, 1987 (52 FR 46075), OSHA published OMB's letter describing its determinationin a notice in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>(<T3>see also </T3>53 FR 15033 (Apr. 27, 1988) (OMB letter to Departmentof Labor dated April 13, 1988)). The provisions that OMB disapproved were: (1) The requirement that materialsafety data sheets be provided on multi-employer worksites; (2) coverageof any consumer product that falls within the ``consumer products'' exemptionincluded in section 311(e)(3) of the Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct of 1986; and (3) coverage of any drugs regulated by the Food and DrugAdministration in the non-manufacturing sector. In accordance with OMB'sdecision, OSHA has not enforced these three disapproved requirements. OMB's disapproval of the HCS provisions was challenged in the U.S. Courtof Appeals for the Third Circuit. On August 19, 1988, the Court of Appealsinvalidated OMB's disapproval and ordered that: ``The Secretary [of Labor]shall publish in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a notice that those parts of the August 24, 1987hazard communication standard which were disapproved by OMB are now effective.''<T3>United Steelworkers of America </T3>v. <T3>Pendergrass, </T3>855 F.2d 108, 114 (3d Cir. 1988). On September 2, 1988, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a petition withthe Third Circuit requesting a rehearing and suggesting a rehearing <T3>en banc, </T3>which automatically stayed the effect of the Court'sorder. The Court has now denied the petition for rehearing (November 29,1988), as well as requests for stay of the decision. In addition, a furthermotion by industry representatives for a stay of the decision was deniedby U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brennan (January 24, 1989). The SolicitorGeneral has authorized the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorarion behalf of the government in the United Steelworkers case. Also, on January27, 1989, industry resubmitted its stay request with Chief Justice Rehnquistin both United Steelworkers and Associated Builders and Contractors. Thatrequest is pending. If certiorari is granted, the Supreme Court will ultimatelydecide the enforceability of these provisions. The Third Circuit's decisionbecame effective January 30, 1989. As ordered by the Third Circuit, OSHA is publishing this document to providenotice to affected employers and employees that all provisions of the HCSare now in effect in all industries. As a matter of enforcement policy,OSHA will not check for compliance with the three provisions in programmedinspections until March 17, 1989. To implement the court order, technical amendments are being made to theHCS to delete from notes following the headings of the standard, and fromthe parentheticals following the text of the standard, statements thatany provisions of the HCS are disapproved by OMB. The OMB-assigned controlnumber for the approved collection of information requirements of the HCSremain following the text of the standard. The Paperwork Reduction Actrequires display of OMB control numbers with all information collectionprovisions. <T3>Status in State Plan States. </T3>The twenty-five (25) states withOSHA-approved State plans and their own hazard communication rules havenot been bound by either the court actions or OMB's administrative actions.Those State plan states that have voluntarily honored the court stay orsuspended enforcement of the disapproved provisions are expected to similarlybegin enforcement of all requirements of the standard. <ITAG tagnum="84">Authority and Signature </ITAG>This document was prepared under the direction of John A.
