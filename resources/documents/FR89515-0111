Installationof flow restricting devices is being considered on gas and hazardous liquidtransmission lines only, not on gas distribution lines. This decision ismade based on comments to Docket No. PS-93 (to be discussed later in thisnotice) that the piping of distribution systems is too complex for suchinstallations. Notwithstanding, the valves and other pressure control deviceslocated at pressure regulator stations (end of transmission lines) servingas transfer points to distribution centers will be considered in the assessment.The focus of this Congessional concern was an event which occurred on July8, 1986, when a Williams Pipe Line Company 8-inch hazardous liquid pipelinesustained a ruptured pipe seam in Mounds View, Minnesota. The accidentresulted in two deaths, one injury, and property damage well in excessof $1,000,000. The accident was exacerbated by back flow or draining fromthe pipeline after the manually operated valves on either side of the rupturedsection were closed. The spill ignited in 20 minutes and it took over 1hour and 40 minutes from the time of the rupture to when the pipeline sectioninvolved was isolated by closing the valves. One of the actions taken asa result of this accident was that Williams Pipe Line Company installedremotely controlled valves on each side of Mounds View, a spacing of about5.8 miles.Closer valve placement might have reduced the spillage from some otherrecent hazardous liquid pipeline failures. Three examples are cited:(1) A failure of a pipe seam in May 1986 in Minnesota resulting in a spillof 25,000 gallons of fuel oil. (2) A crude oil pipeline spill of 863,300 gallons in Missouri in December1988 from a failed pipe seam. (3) A pipe seam failure in Texas in January 1989 resulting in a spill of988,400 gallons of crude oil. In the last failure cited, the pipeline pumps were reported to have beenshut down in about 8 minutes, but the crude oil continued to drain fromabout 19 miles of pipeline which was at a higher elevation than the rupture.Limiting spillage after a pipeline failure by either a remotely controlledvalve (RCV) or an automatically controlled valve (ACV) has been studiedby OPS in the past. It was the subject of a contract study in 1973-74,also regulatory proceedings concerning valve spacing requirements on pipelinescarrying highly volatile liquids (HVL) in inhabited areas (Docket No. PS-53),and another regulatory proceeding which included the spacing of RCVs andACVs on pipelines (Docket No. PS-93). There were considerable technicaldata and cost data generated from these past OPS actions. The OPS anticipatesreceiving a significant amount of new information due to technologicaladvances in equipment to operate RCVs and ACVs since the PS-53 proceeding,which was conducted in 1981. Also, updated cost figures on such valve installationsare anticipated. Both the Federal gas pipeline safety regulations (49 CFR Part 192) andthe hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations (49 CFR Part 195) containvalve placement provisions. However, neither set of regulations requirethe valves to be operated automatically or remotely controlled. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>In 1973 the Department initiated a contract to study the rapid shutdownof failed pipeline systems. The purpose of this study was to determinethe state-of-the-art of equipment and systems used to rapidly shut downfailed pipelines and limit pressure to prevent failure. The final reportdated October 31, 1974, is titled ``Rapid Shutdown of Failed Pipeline Systemsand Limiting of Pressure to Prevent Pipeline Failure Due to Overpressure.''The report is available from the National Technical Information Service,U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia22151. There was insufficient failure information available at the time of thestudy to substantiate that the rapid shutdown devices identified had reducedaccident severity by limiting discharge of the commodity being transported.However, the study established a strong correlation between accident effects(fatalities, injuries, and property damage) and amount of product dischargefrom hazardous liquid pipelines. This correlation was based on a reviewof the limited number of accidents available for analysis in the early1970s. Because accident data revealed strong correlation between accident effectsand the amount of hazardous liquid product discharge, the study reportrecommended that mainline valves on hazardous liquid pipelines in populatedareas be spaced according to the industry code, Liquid Petroleum TransportationPiping Systems, ANSI B31.4 (1974 edition). At that time, this industrycode specified a maximum spacing of RCVs of 7.5 miles on piping systemstransporting liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in industrial, commercial, orresidential areas and a maximum spacing of 10 miles for valves on systemstransporting other liquid petroleum. The 10-mile spaced valves were notrequired to be remotely controlled. A spokesman for the ANSI B31.4 Committeestated in a later RSPA regulatory proceeding that the reason the B31.4Code required closely spaced valves in industrial, commercial, and residentialareas was to reduce the duration of the hazard and facilitate pipelinerepair, not to prevent or reduce the magnitude of the hazard. The valvespacing requirement of 10 miles on non-LPG pipelines has since been removedfrom the B31.4 Code along with the requirement that valves on LPG pipelinesbe remotely controlled. Supporting studies from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)and a DOT contract study by Battelle Laboratories in addition to the recommendationfrom the rapid shutdown study resulted in a regulatory proposal in 1978(Docket No. PS-53) to limit spillage from a pipeline carrying HVL in inhabitedareas. (The term ``HVL'' is defined in andSection;195.2 as a hazardous liquidwhich will form a vapor cloud when released to the atmosphere and whichhas a vapor pressure exceeding 276 kPa (40 psia) at 37.8anddegrees;C (100anddegrees;F).The commodities included in the term ``HVL,'' are LPG and anhydrous ammoniaand certain natural gas liquids.) Notice No. 1 in Docket No. PS-53 (43 FR 39402, September 5, 1978) proposedthat ACVs or RCVs be installed in inhabited areas on both newly constructedHVL pipelines, and on existing HVL pipelines that are replaced, relocated,or otherwise changed, at points on the pipeline which are more than 6.0km (3.7 mi) from a sectionalizing valve. There were widely conflicting views in the responses to the notice. Sometotally rejected the idea of specific intervals for installing valves.Others recommended installing valves only at pump stations and terminals.Few of the recommendations were well supported with meaningful information.In view of the disparity of views, and the general lack of supporting information,publication of another notice (44 FR 53187, September 13, 1979) proposedthe adoption of two alternative valve spacing requirements. One alternativewould have adopted the concept of class locations and valve spacing requirementssimilar to the requirements of andSection;andSection;192.5 and 192.179 of 49CFR Part 192 for new HVL pipelines and for existing HVL pipelines whichare relocated, replaced, or otherwise changed. However, the proposed valveswould be remotely controlled. The second alternative would require installationof remotely controlled valves on both new and existing onshore HVL pipelinesto permit isolation of pipeline segments from pump station to pump stationand from pump station to terminal. Neither of these alternative proposalsprovided for the installation of automatic valves in lieu of RCVs, as didthe original proposal, because responses to that notice indicated thatautomatic valves are not reliable, especially in pipelines transportingseveral commodities of different physical characteristics, such as mightfrequently be found in HVL pipelines. Studies by the B31.4 Committee and the American Petroleum Institute clearlydemonstrated that closely spaced valves over the full length of HVL pipelineswere not a reasonable means to reduce the accident effects. Based on thesestudies, the Department decided to withdraw the proposal. The question of requiring RCVs and ACVs was again addressed by OPS in aFebruary 6, 1987, Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Docket No. PS-93;Notice 1). This advance notice invited public comment on whether certainproposals for new or amended standards were needed for the safety of gasor hazardous liquid pipelines. These proposals were advanced in part byCongress and by the Minnesota Commission on Pipeline Safety as a resultof the Williams Pipe Line Company pipeline accident in Mounds View, Minnesota.Proposal No. 4 in this advance notice proposed to ``convert required shutoffvalves on existing pipelines to work automatically and require new pipelinesto be equipped with automatic shutoff valves.''The commenters in response to questions posed in the advance notice indicatedthat neither RCVs nor ACVs are installed as shutoff valves as standardpractice. Many of the commenters indicated that ignition usually occurredbefore either type of valve could shut down a pipeline. The concern ofpotential hazard for false closure of ACVs was brought out by the comments.Cost estimates ranged to several billion dollars for the entire industry.The advance notice was discussed at a joint meeting of the two OPS technicaladvisory committees, the Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committeeand the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committe,on September 23, 1987. The committees recommended that OPS study the possibleuses of RCVs and ACVs in selected situations.Because of a concern for a possible reduction in safety due to the rapidchanges in the transportation environment resulting from technologicaladvances and economic deregulation, the Secretary established a SafetyReview Task Force with the mandate to review and analyze the safety programsconducted by the DOT. The January 1989 final report on the pipeline safetyprogram, ``Safety Review Task Force Report on the Research and SpecialPrograms Administration's Pipeline Safety Program,'' included the recommendationthat ``RSPA should develop criteria for the use of automatic and remotelycontrolled valves on hazardous liquid pipelines.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Questions</ITAG>The questions which follow are intended to focus public discussion on theissues of installing flow restricting devices identified by commenterson existing and new pipelines, including RCVs and ACVs. The OPS believesthat more sophisticated systems for leak detection and emergency controlon pipelines have been installed in recent years, and that the experienceacquired from designing and operating these Supervisory Control and DataAcquisition (SCADA) systems may provide new information relevant to thisstudy, particularly regarding hazardous liquid pipelines.The RSPA is particularly interested in receiving comments that addressthe safety of valve installations and discuss the feasibility and costeffectiveness of such valve installations. In response to this notice,commenters are requested to use the same numbering system used in the notice.Commenters may assume that the proposals relate to interstate and intrastategas transmission and hazardous liquid pipelines.<ITAG tagnum="84">Identify Flow Restricting Devices</ITAG>The study is to address the installation of ``emergency flow restrictingdevices'' on existing and new pipelines. While this term is not definedin the legislation, the term is interpreted to include block valves, plugand ball valves, flow control valves, pressure limiting and control valves,relief valves, and check valves as types of valves that will accomplishflow restriction. The term is also interpreted to encompass all means ofactivation.<T3>Question 1:</T3> Do the valves identified above have application as``emergency flow restricting devices?''<T3>Question 2:</T3> What type of devices other than valves named aboveshould be included as ``emergency flow restricting devices'' in this studyfor rapidly isolating a pipeline section subsequent to a failure? If thereare other types, could they be operated automatically or remotely controlled?<ITAG tagnum="84">Identify SCADA Technology</ITAG>SCADA systems are being installed on many pipelines utilizing computertechnology to gather pressure, temperature, delivery flow valves, and otherdata continuously from remote locations on the pipeline. Computer analysisof this data is used to assist in day-to-day operating decisions on thepipeline and to provide input for real-time models of the pipeline operationwhich can identify, size, and locate leaks.<T3>Queston 3:</T3> The following information on SCADA as it relates tothe installation of emergency flow restricting devices is needed by OPS:3a: What is the sensitivity in detecting imbalance?3b: What are typical time periods required to respond to abnormal or emergencyconditions?3c: What types of communication systems and control systems are used inSCADA?3d: What are optimum systems for limiting discharge from a failed pipelineas related to valve type and valve spacing?<ITAG tagnum="84">Safety of Installing RCVs and ACVs</ITAG>One consideration with the installation of RCVs and ACVs is the allegedproblems that can result from such installations. For instance, past commentsto studies and regulatory proceedings have pointed out that unintendedor improper closures of automatic valves, particularly on hazardous liquidpipelines, can cause potentially hazardous situations because of the surgepressures created. We are interested in obtaining information, includingreliability, from manufacturers of these valves and manufacturers of controls,specifically on whether there have been documented cases of unintendedclosure of ACVs, and problems that may be associated with installationand control of RCVs. Also, the relative reliability of converting existingvalves to RCVs and ACVs or maintaining them as manually operated valvesshould be addressed.<T3>Question 4: </T3>The following information on the safety of installingRCVs and ACVs is needed by OPS:4a: Information on the reliability of RCVs as compared to the reliabilityof ACVs on pipelines that have used these types of operators or valves.4b: Documented cases from pipeline operators of unintended or improperclosure of RCVs.4c: Documented cases from pipeline operators of unintended or improperclosure of ACVs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Limiting a Spill</ITAG>One approach to reducing spillage is to space valves based on a maximumallowable spill. Some commenters in the past have pointed out that damagefrom a spill in terms of death, injury, and property damage can be reducedafter a failure by adopting a spill limitation. RSPA would like furtherpublic comment on a maximum spill value.The maximum allowed spill in thousand cubic feet (MCF) of gas or barrelsof hazardous liquid (one barrel equals 42 gallons) would have two components:Dynamic and static. The dynamic component is the amount of commodity lostfrom the pipeline from the time of the failure to the time the pipelinesystem is shutdown and valves on either side of the failure are closed(one of the valves could be a check valve). The static component is drainagefrom the pipeline after the valves on each side of the failure are closed.This dual component approach was used by Alyeska Pipeline Service Company(Alyeska) in developing its valving plan for the 48-inch diameter Trans-Alaskacrude oil pipeline. The valving plan was approved by the Department (39FR 45310, December 31, 1974). Alyeska's criterion was a maximum spill of64,000 barrels of crude oil with a static component of 50,000 barrels.<T3>Question 5: </T3>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of establishinga valve spacing based on a maximum allowed spill criterion.<T3>Question 6: </T3>If the spacing of RCVs and ACVs is determined by amaximum spill from the pipeline, what should that maximum spill value be?<ITAG tagnum="84">Cost of Converting Existing Valves</ITAG>RSPA needs to assess the costs that would be incurred if existing manuallyoperated valves are converted to RCVs or ACVs. To accomplish this, bothequipment installation cost and annual operating cost must be considered.The next question is addressed primarily to pipeline operators.<T3>Question 7: </T3>For the existing valves on gas transmission pipelinesoutside Class location 1 areas (defined in andSection; 192.5) or hazardousliquid pipelines outside of rural areas (defined in andSection; 195.3), whatwould be the total cost of installing RCVs or ACVs on your system and thetotal annual operating cost? How would the operating cost of RCVs or ACVson your system compare with the present operating cost of manual valves?Indicate the miles of pipeline covered by these cost figures and whichyou would recommend, RCVs or ACVs, and the reasons for the selection. <ITAG tagnum="84">Cost of Installing RCVs and ACVs on New Pipelines </ITAG>The RSPA needs to obtain the equipment installation and operating costsof RCVs and ACVs on new pipelines and compare these costs with the costof installation and operating costs of manually operated valves at thesame location. For the costs to be of greatest use to RSPA, they shouldbe based on the size of the valve or a range of sizes. For developing thislast information, RSPA has chosen four ranges of sizes: under 8 inch indiameter, 8 inch up to 20 inch in diameter, 20 inch up to 30 inch in diameter,and 30 inch and above. <T3>Question 8: </T3>For the ranges of valve size stated above, providethe equipment installation cost and annual operating cost for each of thefollowing on a new pipeline: manually operated valve, RCV and ACV. <ITAG tagnum="84">Criteria for Valve Spacing </ITAG>The RSPA requests public discussion on describing or listing locationswhere RCVs or ACVs should be placed in order to limit spillage. Publiccomment on this issue is important so that RSPA can be assured that alllocations have been considered. In past questions in this notice, RSPAhas considered: (1) A spill limitation value; (2) pipelines outside ofClass location 1 areas on gas pipelines; and (3) pipelines outside of ruralareas on liquid pipelines. There may be other areas which should be considered(such as on either side of shopping centers, schools, or other areas ofpublic assembly) or possibly the locations already considered by RSPA arenot correct. <T3>Question 9: </T3>Where should RCVs and ACVs be placed and why?<ITAG tagnum="84">Initiating a Demonstration Project </ITAG>Public Law 100-561 requires the Secretary of Transportation to ``* * *assess the cost and effectiveness of initiating a demonstration project* * *'' concerning emergency flow restricting devices. The RSPA requestspublic comment on this provision of the public law. Describing a varietyof projects with attendant costs would enable RSPA to choose the one, ifany, which would demonstrate the most features. Written documentation ofpast experience in the use of various devices by pipeline operators whohave devices already installed is solicited.<T3>Question 10: </T3>What are some possible demonstration projects ofemergency flow restricting devices with attendant costs and describe criteriafor evaluating the anticipated effectiveness of the suggested projects?<ITAG tagnum="84">General Questions </ITAG><T3>Question 11: </T3>Should valve spacing be the same in rural and nonruralareas?<T3>Question 12: </T3>Should operators have better capability to closevalves in urban areas than rural areas? If not, why not?<T3>Question 13: </T3>For various reasons, some operators have taken along time to close valves after detection of failure. What should be themaximum time for closing valves?<T3>Question 14: </T3>What is the additional cost of accident effects whenflow cannot be shut off?<T3>Question 15: </T3>Should any of the valve locations described in andSection;192.179 for gas transmission and andSection; 195.260 for hazardous liquidrequire RCVs or ACVs? <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>49 App. U.S.C. 1681 and 2010; sec. 305 Pub.
