The securities include as much as $20 million face value of the convertible subordinated debentures outstanding of the two entities, as many as two million Apache Corp. common shares, and as many as two million Apache Petroleum units. The companies have $200 million in debt outstanding.    Apache Corp., an independent oil and gas exploration and production company and the general partner of Apache Petroleum, an oil and gas limited partnership, said the securities will be acquired from time to time to meet sinking fund provisions and retire debt. The company said it was purchasing the units and common shares as a means to acquire underlying gas and oil reserves on behalf of continuing equity holders.    Apache recently sold its California agricultural holdings, and said it has a &quot;strong balance sheet free of bank debt.&quot; The company also said its cash flow has been improved by &quot;modestly&quot; higher natural gas prices. </TEXT></DOC>
