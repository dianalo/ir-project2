(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>IBM's Data Management DesignandM;IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to discuss database management systems without recognizingthe impressive contributions IBM has made over the past 20-odd years.andP;  IBMhas been a major player, not only in developing products, but also in guidingour sense of what a database manager can and should be able to do.andP;  IMS, thecompany's transaction-oriented hierarchical database manager, celebrated its20th birthday last year and is still going strong.andP;  IMS is responsible forstoring and managing a majority of data in the commercial world.andM;IBM can also take credit for developing the relational database model back inthe late '60s.andP;  Dr. E.F.andP;  Codd did much of the work on this as an IBMresearch fellow and published a seminal paper on the relational model in1970.andP;  He has since left IBM to become a well-known champion of therelational approach, still busy at work extending the model.andP;  The relationaldatabase management system (RDBMS) has become the current star in the fieldas more and more organizations move to this technology.andM;Another important IBM contribution to the database field is SQL, orStructured Query Language, which has become an industry standard as well asthe de factor standard for accessing data stored in an RDBMS.andM;Thus, IBM has filled a significant role in getting us all to where we aretoday, even those who are using non-IBM relational database products.andP;  IBMcontinues to move strongly in the direction of distributed, relationaldatabase systems, within the framework of its Systems ApplicationArchitecture (SAA) strategy, in an effort to provide effectiveenterprise-wide information systems.andP;  This means giving the enterprise theability to get at all of its data from two perspectives: operational andend-user access.andP;  Operationally, the organization will be able to develop newapplications on the relational platform without turning its back on itsexisting hierarchical DBMS environment.andP;  This means devising methods forcoexistence between relational and hierarchical products and data.andP;  The goalfor the end user is to have access to all organizational data, IBM or not,regardless of format.andP;  A daunting task, but the same one facing all computingvendors who wish to survive and prosper in the 1990s.andP;  (In IBM's case, it'smore a question of prosperity than survival.)andM;IBM's task is perhaps more daunting than most, given its huge installed base,plethora of hardware/operating system platforms, and multiple databasestructures and products.andP;  The company has combined both necessity and visionin structuring a strategy that, while it may take a long time to come tofruition, has the potential to serve it well in achieving its goal.andM;Current ProductsandM;IBM offers two types of database management systems, those based on thehierarchical model and those based on the relational model (see Illustration1).andM;HIERARCHICAL.andP;  The hierarchical products, both of which run on theSystem/370, are IMS/DB (Information Management System/Database) for MVS(Multiple Virtual Storage) and DOS/DL/I (Data Language/I) for VSE (VirtualStorage Extended).andP;  MVS is IBM's high-performance, heavy-duty mainframeoperating system for production applications that can handle thousands ofusers on a single system.andP;  VSE can be thought of as MVS's younger sibling,generally used in much smaller installations of up to 200+ users.andP;  It doesn'thave as much function and power, but it doesn't require as much full-timesupport.andP;  When an organization outgrows VSE, it generally migrates to MVS.andM;IMS/DB and DOS/DL/I have a similar relationship because each is optimized forthe underlying operating system.andP;  IMS/DB has many extra enhancements for highperformance, high transaction rates, and high availability, features whichare not as critical in the VSE environment.andP;  Both DBMS products use DL/I asthe data access language.andM;IMS was originally developed to manage contractors and parts for the Apolloproject that successfully put a man on the moon.andP;  IMS has evolved throughmany implementations over the past 20 years.andP;  The most recent productannouncement, IMS/ESA Version 3, will be generally available in March 1990.andM;We should point out that IBM also offers TPF (Transaction ProcessingFacility) at the very high end of the online transaction processing (OLTP)market.andP;  This is used by American Airlines and others for their airlinereservation systems.andP;  TPF is not truly a DBMS since it provides its ownoperating environment in order to support the required transaction rates.andM;RELATIONAL.andP;  IBM's first SQL-based RDBMS was SQL/DS (Structured QueryLanguage/Data System), release in 1981 for VSE on the System/370 and followedshortly by a version for VM.andP;  Database 2, the familiar DB2, did not appearuntil 1983; it took IBM longer to develop an RDBMS that was comprehensiveenough for the larger and more complex MVS environment.andP;  DB2 is IBM'sflagship, strategic RDBMS.andM;Both DB2 and SQL/DS evolved from IBM's prototype relational system, System/R,and are very much alike under the covers.andP;  The primary difference betweenthem is related to the underlying operating systems and the services thatthey provide.andP;  As we stated, MVS is designed for high-volume,high-performance transaction-oriented production applications.andP;  MVS alsoprovides DB2 with more services that allow it to exploit multi-engineprocessors at the high end of the 3090 family.andP;  This translates intoperformance and capacity advantages for DB/2: the number of users supported,response time, and throughput (amount processed per unit of time).andP;  VM can becharacterized as more of an ad hoc, interactive, end-user operating system.andO;PROFS, IBM's Professional Office System, for example, runs on VM, not MVS.andM;OS/400 Database Manager (DBM) is the relational database for the AS/400,IBM's family of midrange systems.andP;  Introduced in 1987, OS/400 DBM is the oldSystem/38 database system with an SQL interface added to the originalproprietary data access interface.andP;  Unlike the other IBM RDMBSs, OS/400 DBMis physically part of the OS/400 operating system.andP;  However, the SQL languageinterface, SQL/400, is separate from the DBMS.andP;  To write an SQL application,the developer must also license the SQL/400 precompiler.andM;OS/2 Extended Edition (EE) Database Manager (DBM) is IBM's newest DBMS,targeted for the PS/2 desktop.andP;  It is packaged with the OS/2EE operatingsystem, although it is not actually an integral part of the base operatingsystem.andP;  The DBM is installed separately, as is the Communications Manager,after the OS/2 Standard Edition operating system is installed.andM;The OS/2EE DB, provides an SQL database server in the OS/2EE LAN environmentthat is the equivalent of DB2 in the host environment.andP;  Some within IBM callthe OS/2EE DBM &quot;micro DB2,&quot; describing it not as a subset of, but as aparallel to, DB2.andP;  OS/2EE DBM developers worked closely with the DB2developers in an effort to take advantage of DB2's architecture and to ensurethat the two products will be able to interoperate effectively in the future.andO;OS/2EE DBM can already interchange data with DB2 and SQL/DS on animport/export basis.andP;  Version 1.2 of OS/2EE will offer a long list ofsignificant enhancements to the DBM, such as operation in a multiuser LANenvironment, referential integrity, and remote data access.andP;  However,availability has been delayed until March 1990.andM;IBM does not currently offer any generally available proprietary databases inAIX, although development efforts are underway.andP;  (AIX is IBM's version of theUnix System V operating system.)andP;  The company does market AIX DBMSs fromother vendors, such as Oracle and Ingres.andM;The SAA PerspectiveandM;IBM's distributed relational database strategy is a cornerstone of SAA,mirroring many SAA objectives (see Illustration 2).andP;  SAA's overall goal is toconnect IBM's diverse and incompatible operating system platforms at theapplication level, creating a &quot;single system view&quot; for the user, regardlessof the system to which he or she is attached.andP;  It is, in essence, a strategyfor technology transparency.andP;  The database strategy shares that same goalwith regard to data access across the enterprise.andM;IBM is taking a distinctly evolutionary approach to both SAA and its databasestrategy.andP;  The first consideration is providing a migration path for millionsof current users that does not require throwing out the old to make way fornew systems and applications.andP;  IBM wants to allow customers to move at theirown pace in implementing the new architecture and functionality whilepreserving their investment in current systems.andP;  Therefore, coexistencebetween existing hierarchical DBMSs and newer relational offerings is a majorpart of the database strategy.andM;PARTICIPANTS.andP;  There are four strategic SAA environments: MVS and VM on theSystem/370, OS/400 on the AS/400 midrange family, and OS/2EE on the PS/2.andO;IBM has already achieved one of its key goals, which is to have an RDBMS ineach of these.andP;  IMS/DB is not part of SAA.andP;  While the company has no plans toput a full SAA SQL interface on DL/I, efforts are reportedly underway toimplement some level of SQL, probably for read-only access to IMS data.andO;However, the size of the installed base and its reliance on IMS for manycritical business applications both require that IBM address the issue ofcoexistence as well.andM;Two of IBM's transaction managers, also known as trasaction processingmonitors--CICS and IMS/DC--will be SAA-participating environments.andP;  These arethe systems that handle networks of terminals attached to IBM mainframes,managing high volumes of concurrent requests.andP;  Here, IBM's goal is to allowan SAA front end (an OS/2EE workstation) to connect to a &quot;participating&quot; SAAenvironment, such as an IMS/DC back end accessing an IMS database.andO;Currently, the user is limited to using a dumb terminal or terminal emulationfor this, since all the necessary functions--CPI-C (Common ProgrammingInterface-Communications) and LU6.2--aren't implemented yet.andP;  An interimoption is to use a product like Easel.andP;  This allows the customer to use anexisting IMS application while adding a graphical front end on theworkstation.andP;  The Easel software does the translation between the workstationand IMS.andM;DATABASE FOUNDATION.andP;  SAA is, in essence, a set of interfaces.andP;  Two SAACommon Programming Interfaces (CPIs) apply to the database world: thedatabase interface (SQL) and the query interface (based on QMF).andP;  Forexample, SAA SQL is the way the user accesses data in SAA.andP;  SAA is also a setof products--AD/Cycle, Office Vision, etc.--all of which depend, in one wayor another, on the bedrock of DB2 and the other SAA relational databases.andO;IBM is not talking landfill here.andP;  It's talking case iron,industrial-strength DBMSs on which companies can depend and to which they canentrust their mission-critical data and applications.andP;  The SAA DBMS productsmust provide a firm foundation for many types of tools and applications,including office, applications development, OLTP, etc.andP;  These represent a setof products that need to use and access data in a distributed environment.andM;Another key point of SAA is that an SAA-complaint application will beportable across all four of the SAA environments.andP;  It will be executable inMVS, VM, OS/400, and OS/2EE, regardless of where it was developed.andP;  An SAAapplication can be developed in a non-SAA environment, but it must beexecutable across SAA.andP;  Implementing the SAA database interface, in the formof the SAA SQL CPI, on all of the RDBMSs is one way to facilitateapplications portability across platforms.andM;Relationship with AD/Cycle.andP;  Database applications development tools areprovided in the SAA environment by the newly announced AD/Cycle framework.andO;AD/Cycle is intended to offer a broad set of development tools from both IBMand third-party vendors.andP;  (See last month's News and Analysis for a detailedlook at AD/Cycle.)andP;  IBM AD/Cycle products include Cross-System Product (CSP,IBM's 4GL), Application System for decision support and project management,QMF for query and reporting, all of the SAA-supported programming languages,the future DevelopMate CASE front end, and others.andM;These products are all closely tied to the database strategy and products,since they will use the SAA SQL interface and/or the query CPI for access toSAA relational databases.andP;  AD platform services, such as the RepositoryManagers/MVS, are built on the DBMSs as well.andP;  Repository Manager/MVS(available in June 1990) is a DB2 application, storing its repository data inDB2 tables.andM;Relationship with Office Vision.andP;  Office Vision is viewed by IBM's databasefolks as essentially a set of database applications.andP;  The Address Book, forexample, is an OS/2EE Database Manager application.andM;In addition to standard database functionality, the office environmentpresents its own set of challenging and important requirements, such as theability to intelligently manipulate text, images, and, eventually, voice.andO;IBM is currently working on several parallel internal projects to determinehow best to support these requirements within its DBMS strategy and products.andO;Image, for example, is a complex object that presents both storage andmanipulation issues to developers.andP;  The ability to effectively capture andmanipulate image information within the DBMS is a long-term development goalfor IBM.andM;Object Orientation.andP;  IBM is also developing an understanding of other complexobjects, such as an aggregation of rows in many tables, or parts of rows inmany tables.andP;  An example here is a parts explosion, the ability to manipulateas a single component a part that comprises 20 subassemblies, each of which,in turn, comprises multiple individual parts, even though the data for eachpart may come from a separate table.andP;  The user may also need to maintainmultiple versions of such a complex object.andM;Storage and manipulation of complex objects is a well-known and difficultproblem.andP;  IBM's database developers are still working in conjunction withresearch efforts to define what types of complex objects are appropriate andwhat functions or operators are needed to manipulate the objects.andP;  The nextstep is to decide how to map these additional business needs into therelational model or how to extend the model to accommodate them.andM;One of IBM's basic concerns about the object-oriented approach is that it isnot based on a rigorously defined model.andP;  The relational model, on the otherhand, is built on a sound, extensible mathematical model.andP;  IBM acknowledgesthe utility of the object-oriented approach and its ability to deal withcertain applications that are beyond the scope of current relational systems(particularly in the area of performance).andP;  However, the jury is still out onthe basic question: Is it possible to extend the relational model toincorporate object-oriented capabilities and get good performance, or is itnecessary to build a system from the ground up to gain the benefits of objectorientation?andP;  Definitely not clear, according to IBM.andP;  Since IBM is basingits strategy on the relational model, we expect to see object-orientedextensions to IBM's relational DBMSs.andM;The Database StrategyandM;The main focus of IBM's database strategy is to deliver primary databasefunctionality in the form of an SAA distributed, relational database.andP;  Whilethe company will continue with IMS development and enhancement, for thelong-term strategy, relational is the basket into which IBM is putting allits data management eggs.andM;The five major components in IBM's database strategy are:andM;* ConsistencyandM;* SAA connectivityandM;* Non-SAA connectivityandM;* Common technologyandM;* Systems managementandM;CONSISTENCY.andP;  There are two focuses in terms of consistemcy: implementing astandard SQL within the IBM SAA platforms, and complying with externalstandards (making them adapt to IBM, where possible).andP;  The bottom line is tosupport and extend SQL as the standard database interface.andM;SAA SQL.andP;  SAA SQL has been implemented at some level in all four SAA databaseproducts, although each implementation is somewhat different.andP;  DB2 has fullyimplemented SAA SQL.andP;  SQL/DS does not support unequal-length stringcomparisons.andP;  OS/2EE DBM does not support date/time arithmetic or scalarfunctions.andP;  The OS/400 DBM is behind the others in implementing standard SQLand has the most work to do to catch up.andP;  It is missing several SAA SQLfunctions, including null support; date/time data types, arithmetic, scalarfunctions; variable-length fields; alter table statement; and the ability torevoke view and dependent privileges.andM;The data manipuatlion language (e.g., insert, update, delete, select) isgenerally consistent among the products, although OS/400 DBM doesn't supportsubqueries.andP;  A major area of difference is in the data definition language.andO;This is primarily due to the different objects in each DBMS and the differentdata structures necessary to store data on different platforms.andP;  For example,since a DB2 table can be huge--up to 64GB in size--DB2 has to be able tohandle tables in pieces.andP;  This concept of partitioned tables is not yetrequired, however, at the low end on the OS/2EE DBM.andM;There are also differences in the extensions to SAA SQL.andP;  As an example,referential integrity is missing on OS/400, and does not have exactly thesame implementation in the other three products.andP;  All four products, however,do use the same programming interface, which is a fundamental building blockof the SAA distributed relational database.andP;  Ultimately, SQL will beconsistently implemented across the SAA platforms.andM;External Standards.andP;  All of the external standards groups, including ANSI(American National Standards Institute) and ISO (International StandardsOrganization), are having an impact on IBM's implementation of SQL in itsproducts.andP;  IBM participates on these committees in an effort to understandwhat the committees and users will think is most important in animplementation of SQL.andP;  SQL Level 1 and the referential integrity addendumhave been approved by ANSI.andP;  The SQL2 standard is in process, with SQL3waiting in the wings.andP;  In IBM's view, the scope of SQL2 is so broad that itcannot be implemented in its entirety in a reasonable amount of time.andO;Therefore, the company is looking to its customers to establish priorities sothat IBM can implement the most practical components of SQL2 first.andM;Query Manager.andP;  Another area of evolving consistency is implementation of astandard SAA query manager in all four environments.andP;  The importantarchitectural features required are that the query manager use the SAA SQLinterface to access data, and that it have a callable interface correspondingto the SAA query CPI.andP;  DB2 and SQL/DS share the same query manager, QMF(Query Management Facility), which runs in both the MVS and VM environments.andO;OS/2EE DBM has its own Query Manager, which looks and feels much like QMF.andM;The OS/400 DBM is the only SAA DBMS that does not yet have an SAA-compliantquery manager.andP;  This also means that there is no end-user, dynamic SQLinterface to the database.andP;  This is coming in the next release, and it willlook like QMF and the OS/2EE Query Manager.andP;  The old tools, such as theAS/400 version of Query/36 and 38, still work on the database but use theoriginal, non-SQL interface.andM;SAA CONNECTIVITY.andP;  Distributed database is IBM's core technology forproviding data transparency among the relational databases in the four SAAoperating platforms.andP;  The key foundations for the distributed relationalmodel are SAA SQL, the consistent implementation of relational technologyacross the products, and LU6.2 connectivity.andM;IBM plans a staged implementation of distributed database, focusing on four&quot;levels&quot; of distributed access to data (see Illustration 3):andM;* Remote requestandM;* Remote unit of workandM;* Distributed unit of workandM;* Distributed requestandM;IBM uses the term unit of work for what many in the database world refer toas a logical transaction.andP;  In a relational database, a logical transactionconsists of a set of SQL statements sandwiched between a &quot;begin work&quot; and a&quot;commit&quot; statement.andP;  This type of transaction is characterized by atomicity,the &quot;all or nothing&quot; rule in the relational model; either all statements inthe transaction are committed, or none of them are committed.andP;  This is usedto maintain integrity in the database.andP;  If a transaction is interrupted atsome point and cannot be completed, any statements in the transaction thathave already been executed are rolled back (undone) to leave the database(s)in a consistent state.andP;  Think about how you would feel if the debit to yoursavings account was recorded while the offsetting credit to your checkingaccount somehow got lost!andP;  The point here is that, since there are manydefinitions of a &quot;transaction&quot; in the real world, some of which span multiplecommits, IBM uses the term &quot;unit of work&quot; in the relational world to avoidconfusion.andM;Remote Request.andP;  The remote request facility is implemented external to theDBMS, making it essentially a &quot;download&quot; function.andP;  A remote request isexecuted in a requester/server environment.andP;  Each request can query or updateone remote database (site), and each request is independent.andP;  There is nocoordination or synchronization between the requester and server, nor amongmultiple servers.andP;  The request is handled asynchronously.andM;For example, IBM's Enhanced Connectivity Facility (ECF) and Host Data BaseView (HDBV) both have remote request capability.andP;  HDBV supports arequester/server architecture between a PC application and a mainframeapplication.andP;  A PC user who needs data from DB2 goes into HDBV on the PC andissues an SQL request to the HDBV component on the host side (MVS, where DB2resides).andP;  HDBV passes the SQL statement to QMF, which runs it as if it werea local query, passing back the results to the user.andP;  (The data must then beimported into a PC format, such as Lotus; the extraction cannot be donetransparently from within a PC application.)andM;Remote Unit of Work.andP;  A remote unit of work is also based on arequester/server architecture.andP;  However, the function is now part of the DBMSitself, adding the concept of a unit of work consisting of multiple requests.andO;In a remote unit of work, each request can access only one site.andP;  Each unitof work is also limited to a single site, and is further limited to a singleupdate statement (e.g., there is not yet a two-phase commit protocol).andM;IBM is now implementing distributed database at the remote unit of worklevel.andP;  In October 1988, IBM issued a statement that it would provide remoteunit of work support in DB2 2.2 for DB2-to-DB2 connectivity.andP;  This version ofthe product was just released in September.andM;Remote unit of work is currently limited to homogeneous systems (e.g., DB2 toDB2, SQL/DS to SQL/DS), and is now available on DB2 (2.2) and SQL/DS (2.2),and announced for OS/2EE DBM (Version 1.2, shipment of which has been delayeduntil March 1990).andP;  Remote unit of work has not yet been implemented in theOS/400 DBM.andM;The next step for IBM is to implement support for a remote unit of workacross SAA systems, an any-to-any approach that will go a long way towardrealizing the SAA vision of a &quot;single system view.&quot;andM;Distributed Unit of Work.andP;  The third building block in IBM's distributeddatabase strategy is the addition of a two-phase commit protocol for updatingmultiple sites in a single unit of work.andP;  The restriction here will be that asingle SQL statement cannot query or update multiple dispersed databases.andO;That is, an SQL statement cannot execute a remote join among two or moredatabases.andP;  Joins will still be done locally on retrieved data.andM;DB2 2.2 already has limited support for a distributed unit of work.andO;Multisite reads can be executed in the same unit of work (a DB2 applicationissuing an SQL statement can query databases in multiple DB2 sites), but onlyone remote update can be performed.andP;  The one remote update is also limited toan application accessing DB2 through TSO or the Call Attach facility of DB2.andO;Applications running in the IMS/DC or CICS transaction managers are limitedto a single local update; remote update capability is coming for these.andP;  QMF2.4 also supports the multisite read function of DB2.andM;IBM points out that it has implemented a two-phase commit protocol betweenDL/I and DB2's SQL.andP;  A developer can write an IMS/DC application that updatesdata in both IMS and DB2.andP;  However, this only works locally, when both IMSand DB2 reside on the same system.andM;Distributed Request.andP;  With a distributed request, a single SQL statement canquery or update multiple remote databases, and a distributed query optimizerwill decide the best way to perform the join.andP;  Global optimization is one ofthe most complex issues in implementing distributed database capability.andP;  IBMreadily acknowledges that this is a &quot;tough nut to crack.&quot;andP;  The company'sstated goal is to get all four SAA DBMSs to the distributed unit of worklevel, with the understanding that SAA-wide distributed request capability isthe real long-term goal.andM;NON-SAA CONNECTIVITY.andP;  Connecting to non-SAA data is an important issue forIBM.andP;  Most of the data in the world is, in fact, in non-SAA systems.andP;  Thisincludes both IBM data (e.g., that managed by IMS) and non-IBM data (Oracle,Ingres, Adabas, et al.).andP;  In the IBM environment, a vast majority of data isin IMS and VSAM.andP;  IBM won't give specific numbers, but it will state that thenumber of customers using IMS and the amount of data entrusted to it are&quot;very large, larger than any other DBMS.&quot;andP;  The movement to RDBMSs is arelatively new one, and, if IBM is going to successfully grow its SAAstrategy of relational distributed database, it has to figure out how to getthe data from there to here.andM;IBM is working on solving non-SAA connectivity through coexistence,interoperability, and/or conversion.andM;Conversion.andP;  We all know how easy conversion would be in the ideal world.andO;IBM would build a simulation system on top of DB2, for example, allowing thecustomer to move both applications and data from a non-SAA, hierarchical DBMSlike IMS over to DB2.andP;  The old applications would run unchanged, but woulduse SQL to access the data.andP;  This approach would preserve the significantinvestment already made in IMS applications while enabling the use of newtools, and a relational database engine, to build new applications.andO;Unfortunately, this &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot; just doesn't work.andP;  IBMknows, because it tried this approach for IMS and finally gave up.andP;  Theparameters for success are so narrow--e.g., a simple application, using onlycertain IMS features, with perfectly normalized data--that it's aone-in-a-million shot.andP;  There is no technology available today that willpainlessly convert every nonrelational application to a comparable relationalone.andP;  It is very difficult to migrate applications from IMS, Cullinet's IDMS,and other nonrelational databases to an RDBMS without rewriting them.andM;One major difference between nonrelational and relational DBMSs is the factthat, in nonrelational, data is accessed one record at a time.andP;  RDBMSs, onthe other hand, use a set-oriented process, retrieving the appropriate set ofrecords with the search engine and then operating on the entire set.andP;  Findinga way to make any level of transition between such fundamentally differentmodels is certainly not going to be easy.andM;IBM has published some manuals for customers who want to convert data fromother systems into DB2.andP;  But no code exists to help in this process.andP;  Thereis no conversion panacea; it is a long, painful process.andP;  Existingapplications must usually be rewritten to achieve conversion.andM;Coexistence.andP;  Therefore, IBM has recognized the obvious need to coexist withnon-SAA data and applications.andP;  The objective here is to keep the existingdatabase system and applications running with the ability to move the dataitself into an SAA RDBMS such as DB2.andP;  The user can then not only usedecision support tools to access the data, but can also begin to build newapplications in the relational environment using more state-of-the-artdevelopment tools.andP;  The major problem becomes moving the data at theappropriate interval, a particularly onerous task for crucial business datarequired by all or many applications on a daily or even more frequent basis.andO;Another problem is the size of the data to be moved.andP;  MIS managers do notlook kindly on requests to make daily copies of entire million-row tables.andM;So the issue of data propagation for coexistence raises two questions.andP;  Thefirst is whether the data is moved synchronously or asynchronously.andO;Synchronously means automatically reflecting changes in the copied data assoon as they are made in the original data.andP;  If a parallel operationalenvironment is necessary, where new applications access up-to-the-minutedata, a synchronous copy is required.andP;  Otherwise, the copy can be madeasynchronously, that is, at the end of the day, week, month, etc.andP;  Here, thecustomer creates an information system fed by operational data at apredetermined interval.andM;The second question is whether all of the data or only changes to the dataare copied every time.andP;  If the amount of data to be copied is very large,this issue may arise even if an asynchronous copy is sufficient.andM;A project is underway at IBM to develop a propagation method for moving datafrom IMS to DB2 in a synchronized manner, with the option to move onlychanges as they are made.andP;  That is one version of coexistence.andP;  Once IBM hassolved the technical problems inherent in this, it will move on thecoexistence between other systems, and from relational back to hierarchical.andM;In the meantime, IBM's Data Extract (DXT) products provide the option ofmanually moving data from a variety of IBM and non-IBM sources into a varietyof IBM targets, albeit without synchronization.andP;  Available on the S/370, DXTextracts source data and transforms it into a target format, such as a DB2table.andP;  Sources can be any flavor of IMS data, VSAM files, MVS flat files,DB2, SQL/DS, and non-IBM MVS databases such as Adabas and IDMS (using ageneric data interface).andP;  Targets can be DB2, SQL/DS, an AS/400 file, a localflat file, a remote flat file in either MVS or VM, or an IXF file.andO;(IXF--Integration Exchange Format--is a self-defining file format that can behandled directly by IBM products such as QMF.)andP;  DXT can join IMS, VSAM, andDB2 data in a single extract, with up to a 16-way join of like and unlikedata.andP;  The latest version of DXT, Version 2.4, is scheduled for availabilitythis month.andM;IBM made an historic (for IBM) announcement in September with itsintroduction of DXT/D1, a new module that runs on Digital's VAX/VMS.andP;  ThroughDXT/D1, DXT 2.4 users on MVS can extract data from Oracle, Ingres, Rdb, andRMS files on the VAX.andP;  This is IBM's first software offering for the VAX,indicating that IBM is well aware that access to data is a critical part ofthe solution users need.andP;  DXT/D1 will be available in March 1990.andM;IBM has not made any statements about general coexistence with otherthird-party SQL-based RDBMSs.andP;  No mention has been made of IBM gateways toOracle, Ingres, etc.andP;  other than those available through the DXTenvironments.andP;  Some of this will come from the third parties themselves.andP;  Allof the major relational vendors have or are developing gateways to DB2, forexample.andP;  IBM is looking at the emerging Remote Database Access (RDA)standard, and this is probably the most likely way that IBM will connect toother compliant SQL-based DBMSs.andM;Interoperability for AIX.andP;  While IBM has not made any official statements ofdirection about its data management strategy within the AIX (Unix)environment, the company is building an AIX RDBMS.andP;  This will be based onIBM's existing relational technology (i.e., the equivalent of DB2) and willinteroperate with the SAA relational products.andP;  It will talk to SAA DBMSs,although IBM has not yet defined what &quot;talk to&quot; means exactly.andP;  We wouldexpect the same level of connectivity as between SAA database managers.andP;  Thebottom line is that there will be IBM relational database products in AIXthat act like SAA RDBMSs in every way except name.andP;  The fundamentaldifference will be in the communication protocols: LU6.2 for SAA versusTCP/IP for AIX.andM;Summary.andP;  Aside from AIX development, the major effort is in the area ofcoexistence, with the emphasis here on automatic propagation and data extractthrough DXT.andP;  IBM acknowledges that connectivity with non-SAA data presents anumber of difficult problems, and that the company still has a lot of workahead of it in this area.andM;COMMON TECHNOLOGY.andP;  With the great difference in scale between its low- andhigh-end platforms--OS/2EE on a PC up through MVS on a 3090 mainframe withsix multiprocessors--IBM's approach has been to optimize the database managerspecifically for the underlying hardware and operating system.andP;  Each DBMS isdesigned for the types of tasks, volume of data, and number of users it wouldbe called upon to handle.andP;  This is done to achieve maximum performance and toadapt to the different services and storage provided by each platform.andP;  (Theopposite extreme is the Oracle model, where the same relational database isported to a multitude of hardware and operating system platforms--a&quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; approach, if you will.andP;  The downside here is thedifficulty of enhancing the product to take full advantage of the platform.)andM;Within these constraints, however, IBM's strategic direction is to implementcommon technology in a consistent way across all four SAA DBMSs.andP;  Thisensures that the user will have similar functionality and get the sameresults no matter what the platform or DBMS.andM;Industrial-Strength DBMSs.andP;  One of IBM's primary goals is to offer robustDBMSs, what it calls general purpose, industrial-strength DBMSs.andP;  &quot;Generalpurpose&quot; comes with IBM's clear targeting of both transaction processing anddecision support requirements within its SAA DBMS products.andP;  There are alsocritical capabilities that go into the making of an industrial-strength DBMS:performance, integrity, recoverability, security, and availability.andP;  IBM hasfocused on these for so long in its DBMS product development that it almostseems to take them for granted when talking about its strategy.andP;  Thefoundation here is IBM's view of data as a fundamental corporate resource.andO;While access is important (performance and availability), protection of thedata is also important (integrity, recoverability, and security).andP;  Rememberthe story of the three little pigs?andP;  IBM is laboriously building the brickhouse.andP;  It may not be as quaint as the ones made of straw or sticks, but,when disaster strikes, the pig in the brick house will be sitting prettywhile the others run for cover.andM;Performance.andP;  Increases in performance are a critical part of IBM's ongoingdatabase development and an absolute requirement if IBM is to compete.andP;  &quot;Wecan't stand still at all on this front&quot; is the company position.andP;  IBMdedicates a large portion of every new release of a DBMS to performanceenhancements.andP;  It has managed to get DB2 up to a level of 270 transactionsper second (DB2 2.1 on the Data Systems Workload benchmark, an internal IBMtest), proving that an RDBMS can indeed attain impressive performancestatistics.andM;A large portion of IBM's customer base uses DBMSs for OLTP applications.andO;Therefore, it is important that the DBMS have the ability to connect to andsupport the transaction processing monitor products--IMS/DC and CICS.andP;  DB2allows both IMS/DC and CICS to connect to DB2 and run concurrently againstthe DBMS along with user and batch applications.andP;  This is necessary toprovide a high-volume transaction processing environment.andP;  IBM is continuallyworking on DB2 to ensure that there is no bottleneck within DB2 that slowsdown the transaction managers.andP;  IBM must be able to compete with othertransaction processing systems on the market, such as those from TandemComputers.andP;  The IBM OL TP solution is IMS/DC or CICS attached to DB2 orIMS/DB running on IBM hardware.andP;  The goal is the best performance in terms ofboth raw numbers (e.g., transactions per second) and price/performance.andM;Recoverability and Integrity.andP;  IBM is also emphasizing the need to providerecoverable data with integrity under all circumstances.andP;  Coming from itsbackground of building IMS, IBM knows that many customers rely on IMS to runtheir business; when you are transferring millions of dollars, it isimportant to know if the transaction did or did not happen.andP;  IBM has toguarantee recoverability and integrity for even the most complex anddifficult systems.andM;IBM has been adding referential integrity to all of the SAA DBMSs, althoughthe implementation is not yet equivalent.andP;  DB2 provides the mostfunctionality here, with OS/2EE DBM close on its heels.andP;  Includingreferential integrity in the PC LAN product takes the OS/2EE DBM at least onestep beyond many of the existing PC DBMSs.andP;  Again, IBM anticipates thatOS/2EE DBM will be heavily used by customers who want to connect workstationsto host data.andP;  As Dan Wardman, IBM's manager of database strategy, says, &quot;Toimplement referential integrity effectively across heterogeneous platforms,you'd better have good common technology in place, consistently implemented,as well as good performance.&quot;andP;  SQL/DS has more limitations in itsimplementation of referential integrity.andP;  For example, deletes can onlyautomatically cascade one level.andM;IBM is also working toward system-managed recovery.andP;  XRF (Extended RecoveryFacility) in MVS is a step in this direction.andP;  The system keeps track ofeverything that is executed so that it can specify what needs to be done ifrecovery is necessary.andP;  The ultimate goal is an automatic, &quot;lights-off&quot;environment in which the system not only knows how to recover from a failure,but goes ahead and does it.andP;  This is particularly important as customersstart to distribute processing and data storage across the network.andM;Scalability.andP;  IBM's approach is designed to allow the customer to choose theappropriate platform for a database application, taking full advantage of theplatform without sacrificing DBMS capability.andP;  An important consideration forIBM is the effort required to implement the necessary common technologyacross these multiple platforms.andP;  The objective is to scale the solutionacross all of the SAA environments, to build it once with the ability to thenmove it to all four DBMSs.andM;Extendability.andP;  Another major objective for IBM is designing databaseproducts with functionality that can be extended over time to handle abroader scope of applications.andP;  IBM also plans to enhance its support of therelational model, for example, adding outer joins and domain support to DB2.andM;SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT.andP;  Since IBM's database strategy is firmly based on adistributed, heterogeneous environment, achieving this goal also increasesthe complexity of systems management--monitoring system performance, securityadministration, and database administration.andP;  IBM recognizes that it cannotexpect the customer to increase the number of database administrators inproportion to the increase in the complexity of managing the system.andO;Providing a comprehensive, easy-to-use set of system management tools iscritical to the continued growth of distributed database.andM;IBM is not particularly strong in this area today, although it offers somesystem management tools for specific database products, such as DB2/PM forperformance monitoring and ANDB2, an internal tool for capacity planning inthe DB2 arena.andP;  Third-party products are also available.andP;  Managing aheterogeneous, distributed database environment, however, requires a muchbroader set of tools than those currently available--tools forenterprise-wide database system management.andP;  IBM has projects under way tobuild a set of such tools.andP;  IBM also states that it is putting increasedfocus on this area, and that the tools will operate in a distributedenvironment and use the SAA cooperative processing model.andP;  (We do hope that,when IBM announces these system management tools, they will not require a 370platform, as does NetView.)andM;While the company would not describe its efforts in detail, here are some ofthe &quot;enterprise database management functions&quot; on which we expect IBM isworking: Coordinated auditing and accounting, database configurationmanagement, database and table management, installation (softwaredistribution and level management), service (an interesting problem in adistributed system--e.g., which DB2 has the problem?), operations,performance management, problem management, security administration, recoverymanagement.andM;ROLE OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM.andP;  As the operating system provides additionalfunctionality that can be used by the DBMS, IBM will gladly moveresponsibility for this from the DBMS to the OS.andP;  The OS can perform certaintasks faster and better than the DBMS, the customer may be able to centralizemanagement of specific functions, and systems other than the DBMS can takeadvantage of the increased scope of the OS.andP;  One example here is security.andO;DB2 has its own security system built on top of RACF (Remote Access ControlFacility).andP;  As DB2 can depend more on RACF's capabilities, it will do so.andO;This occurred when DB2 2.1 allowed the customer to define a security group.andO;The security group was actually defined in RACF, and the information thenused by DB2 in its security checks.andM;Another example in DB2 is pushing down to the operating system the task ofdetermining what data goes into what VSAM files on the disk.andP;  The user wouldrather have the physical storage of data managed by the system itself.andM;CONCLUSIONandM;At the high end of the market, IBM sees Tandem and Teradata as DB2's primarycompetition, with Tandem focusing on OLTP and Teradata on decisionsupport/query processing.andP;  IBM, in contrast, is trying to compete on bothfronts with a single product.andP;  It views both transaction processing anddecision support as vital to its long-term ability to compete successfully.andO;Release 2.1 of DB2, which added referential integrity and major performanceenhancements, has been very successful.andP;  Release 2.2 has added moreperformance improvements as well as the first installment of distributeddatabase capability.andP;  The number of licenses for DB2 is increasing rapidlyand is now over 4,000.andM;On the IBM midrange platforms, there is not much competition for SQL/DS (over6,000 licenses) and the OS/400 DBM (especially since every AS/400 gets thedatabase manager with the operating system).andP;  None of the major DBMS softwarevendors runs on the AS/400.andM;On the PC platform, it is too early to tell how the IBM database manager willfare in competition with products such as the SQL Server fromAshton-Tate/Microsoft/Sybase, and the OS/2 server from Oracle.andP;  The delay inreleasing Version 1.2 of OS/2EE will certainly not help IBM's case here.andM;And what about the other major systems vendors, such as Digital Equipment andHewlett-Packard?andP;  Since everyone is going relational, the primary bone ofcontention becomes distributed access across heterogeneous environments, withperformance an issue as well.andP;  Whose customers will get there first?andM;Unix.andP;  HP has the best story with regard to Unix, since its entire Allbasefamily of RDBMS products runs across both of HP's platforms: the proprietaryHP3000 (MPE) and the HP9000 (Unix) environments.andP;  The same interfaces and thesame set of tools work on both platforms.andM;Neither IBM nor Digital has a good story to tell in the Unix environment,although Digital appears closer to a solution.andP;  Digital has program-announcedthe availability of an RDBMS (Ingres) for Ultrix, and is working with IngresCorporation to tailor the DBMS for the Ultrix environment.andP;  The Ultrixproduct will interoperate with Rdb, Digital's RDBMS on VMS, with the ultimateobjective full portability of applications between VMS and Ultrix.andP;  As in theIBM world, the main ingredient of this is implementing the same SQLinterface.andP;  And, since the Ingres front-end tools also work with Rdb, thereis the vision of consistent developing tools as well.andM;The major RDBMS IS Vs (Oracle, Ingres, Informix, Sybase, etc.) offer theadvantage of multiplatform strategies, all of which include a combination ofboth Unix and proprietary platforms.andM;Distributed Database.andP;  IBM appears to be slightly ahead of HP and Digitalhere in terms of clearly articulating its strategy, although currentimplementations are similar.andP;  Digital's Rdb has always had remote access todata, but this is limited to homogeneous Rdb-to-Rdb access and to a singleupdate within the transaction.andP;  HP's situation is similar, with accesslimited to homogeneous platforms.andP;  The next release of Allbase/Net will allowconnectivity between MPE and Unix Allbase databases.andP;  None of the three yethas a two-phase commit protocol nor a distributed query optimizer.andP;  IBM is astep ahead in DB22.2 with a multisite read capability.andM;Some of the major ISVs are ahead of the systems vendors here.andP;  Both Ingresand Sybase, for example, support a two-phase commit protocol as well as avariety of networking protocols.andP;  Ingres also has a distributed queryoptimizer.andM;Heterogeneous Access.andP;  In terms of heterogeneous database access, IBM isreaching out to Digital's turf with DXT/D1, while Digital now has its VIDA(VAX-IBM Data Access) for DB2 product.andP;  Version 1 is read only, but Digitalplans to fully interoperate with DB2 in the future.andP;  VAX Data Distributorperforms extractions or replications from an Rdb or DB2 database to an Rdbdatabase.andP;  VAX/Link product allow Digital users to extract data from IMS andVSAM files on MVS and download them into Rdb tables.andP;  Digital does not yetprovide access to relational databases such as Oracle, Sybase, and Ingres onits own platforms, although third-party products are currently available forthis.andM;HP is making the connection between Allbase and Oracle databases running onHP platforms.andP;  It will also provide access to its networked DBMS, TurboImage,in the future.andP;  Connectivity to DB2 is a future direction, but HP has notaddressed access to IMS and VSAM.andM;The major ISVs all have or are building gatewars to other DBMSs; primary datasources are DB2, IMS, SQL/DS, and Rdb.andP;  Some, like Ingres and Sybase, alsooffer toolkits for rolling your own gateways.andM;Front-End Flexibility.andP;  Both Digital and HP offer a broader set of strategicfront-end platforms for database access than does IBM.andP;  SQL Services, one ofDigital's Network Application Support(NAS) services, is an API that enables acompliant front-end application or program on any of Digital's strategicclient platforms (DEC windows, DOS, OS/2, Macintosh, or Unix) to query/updatea remote Rdb database using SQL.andP;  This has the same limitations as Rdb remoteaccess, but the advantage of providing access from heterogeneous front ends.andO;HP also supports a variety of strategic front ends, although those other thanthe PC are still terminal emulation.andM;Summary.andP;  The management market is a constantly moving target, and a complexone at that.andP;  There is no clear front-runner at the moment; every solutionhas its advantage disadvantages.andP;  Each vendor is working on its own set ofissues, and each customer has a unique set of requirements.andP;  There are someareas of consistent focus, however.andP;  Relational and SQL are now givens.andO;Migration paths and integration of existing systems are often as important tothe customer as state-of-the-art technology.andM;IBM is as aware of these needs as anyone in the industry.andP;  Given its awesomeresources and broad scope of experience with database management, it has agood a chance as anyone of solving the ultimate problem of distributed accessto heterogeneous data.andP;  IBM is currently focusing on its own systems, andrightfully so.andP;  The urgency of the connectivity issue is all the greaterbecause it involves multiple diverse platforms within IBM's own product line,not just connecting to third-party products.andP;  Other vendors with a singlestrategic DBMS don't have a problem of the same magnitude as IBM's.andP;  The keyissue is whether IBM can continue to invest in its multiple DBMSs and stilloffer the required functionality across the SAA environment on a timelybasis.andP;  Without a consistent foundation across SAA, the rest of the issuesdon't matter anyway.andP;  Once that is accomplished, the key to success will beIBM's effectiveness in helping the customer build a truly multivendorenvironment--transparent access to all required data, IBM or not, across theenterprise.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
