Ruder said SEC studies after the October 1987 stock market crashshowed that one factor contributing to its severity was legislationthen being considered by the House Ways and Means Committee tocurtail some of the deductions on interest paid by companies toholders of high-yield junk bonds.   Ruder admitted that the double taxation of dividends _ first aspart of the 34 percent income tax on corporations and again whenthey are distributed to shareholders as personal income _ is helpingdrive the leveraged buyout or LBO phenomenon.   But he said he opposed taxing the interest that leveragedcompanies pay on junk bonds as a way of equalizing the tax treatmentbetween the two primary means for raising captital: debt or bondsand stock or equity.   Ruder, like Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady who testifiedbefore him on Tuesday, said the better alternative would be to allowcompanies to treat as a deductible expense the dividends they pay orto give shareholders a tax credit for the corporate income taxespaid by a company.   But, also like Brady, he added, ``I do not believe we can do thatgiven our enormous deficit problem.''   In an LBO, an investment group borrows heavily in order to buyout stockholders and take over the company. Often LBOs are proposedby managers seeking to thwart a hostile takeover.   The company's new owners either cut costs or sell off pieces ofthe company to pay back loans. Critics of the practice fear the highdebt levels, in a recession, would endanger both the bought-outcompany and the banks and brokerage firms financing the buyout.   Both the tax-writing Finance and Ways and Means committees arere-examining leveraged buyouts in the wake of the pending $25billion purchase of RJR Nabisco Co. by LBO specialist KohlbergKravis Roberts andamp; Co. and the $13 billion buyout of Kraft Inc. byPhillip Morris Co. last year.   Those were the two biggest of more than 300 leveraged buyoutstotaling nearly $100 billion in 1988.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Tex., the Finance Committee's chairman,said the primary concern is the possibility the recent surge ofleveraged buyouts ``has created a mountain of corporate debt thatwill make our next recession deeper and longer than it needs to be.''   While Bentsen said the goal is to balance the attractiveness ofequity and debt financing that is clearly tilted to the debt sideunder current tax laws, but he acknowledged it is going to bedifficult to find the right combination of ``carrots and sticks.''</TEXT></DOC>
