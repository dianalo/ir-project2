More than 20 components were detected; most were identified fromtheir mass spectral fragmentation patterns. The six major TMAE impuritieswere dimethylamine, tetramethylhydrazine, bis(dimethylamino)methane,dimethylformamide, tetramethylurea, and tetramethyloxamide. The majorimpurities accounted for greater than 99.5 area % of all impurity componentsdetected. Electron capture analysis of the major TMAE impurities suggestedthat tetramethyloxamide and tetramethylurea have relative high electroncapture cross sections compared with oxygen. Liquid TMAE was observedto be generally compatible (less than 1% decomposition) with 24 commonlyused metal, polymer, and ceramic laboratory materials. In some cases,however, low concentrations of products were generated that had a highaffinity for electron capture. Materials that formed statistically significantamounts of these products were identified. A technique was developedthat uses gas chromatography to measure the major TMAE impurities ina gas flow stream containing TMAE vapor.</TEXT></DOC>
