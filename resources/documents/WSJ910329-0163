Earlier, on the first day of an extraordinary RussianCongress, Mr. Yeltsin appeared to have headed off a CommunistParty attempt to oust him as leader of the Russian republic.With strong backing on the streets and organized politicalsupport within the Congress, he also strengthened his ownposition by creating a new directly elected presidency forthe republic.</LP><TEXT>   The two events dealt a double blow to the authority of Mr.Gorbachev, who was forced to compromise on the holding of therally and has strongly objected to the idea of a Russianpresidency. Only a massive show of force, involving 50,000Interior Ministry troops and police, prevented thedemonstration from taking place at the foot of the Kremlin.Mr. Gorbachev promised to remove the troops today.   As many as 150,000 protestors gathered in two separatelocations calling for Mr. Gorbachev's resignation, cheeringfor Mr. Yeltsin and pledging support for striking coal minersaround the nation. Despite a campaign of intimidation in theSoviet media this week denouncing the rally and warning ofpossible violence, the three-hour demonstration wasgood-tempered and passed without serious incident.   Green army trucks and rows of soldiers and police inbulletproof vests, but unarmed except for nightsticks,blocked the streets leading to the Kremlin. After someinitial tension, many of the police chatted amicably with thedemonstrators.   Lurking in side streets, however, were hundreds ofsoldiers in camouflage uniforms, and &quot;black beret&quot; specialforces. Some trouble did occur inside the central areacordoned off by the security forces. U.S. Sen. David L.Boren, an Oklahoma Democrat visiting the Soviet Union, saidhe witnessed about a dozen incidents of plainclothesofficers, presumably from the KGB, beating up protesters. Hesaid three to five officers would pounce on individuals inthe crowd, drag them to parked buses and then beat them outof sight of the public before throwing them into the buses.   &quot;It was very disturbing to watch,&quot; said Sen. Boren, whowitnessed the incidents from the balcony of his hotel. Hesaid that, at a meeting earlier in the day, he had told KGBchief Vladimir Kryuchkov &quot;in the strongest possible termsthat if {the Soviet authorities} turned to repression, itwould potentially have a very grave impact on the future&quot; ofU.S-Soviet relations.   At one of the locations, a Russian Congress deputyappealed to police over a loudspeaker to &quot;stop defending thecriminals in the Kremlin.&quot; One placard read: &quot;Is this alreadyCommunism, or are things going to get even worse?&quot;   &quot;Yeltsin is the only one who doesn't deceive us. Gorbachevhas deceived us many times, and everyone before him liedtoo,&quot; said Robert Chabarov, a weather-beaten 67-year-oldprotestor, who carried a sign saying: &quot;We will save Russiafrom the Communist Party.&quot;   The demonstration took place despite an official 20-dayban on rallies in the capital that had been ordered by theSoviet government this week. Mr. Gorbachev himself issued adecree transferring responsibility for security in Moscowfrom the city's elected council to the national InteriorMinistry.   But the Russian Congress voted overwhelmingly to revokeboth decisions, condemning them as unconstitutional and aviolation of Russian sovereignty. The vote was another act ofdefiance by Russian deputies, increasing the politicalturmoil that is paralyzing the nation.   The Congress originally was called by hard-lineCommunists, who hoped to push through a no-confidence voteagainst Mr. Yeltsin. But the move seems to have fizzled,particularly after Mr. Yeltsin won strong backing in Russiafrom voters who supported his proposal to create an electedpresidency.   That issue will now be discussed during the remaining daysof the Congress. If it is approved, presidential electionsare likely to be held in Russia within a few months. Mr.Yeltsin has said he will run, and is expected to win.   A presidency, a new post for Russia, would be designed tostrengthen executive power and create a strong counterweightto Mr. Gorbachev. According to Oleg Rumyantsev, a Russiandeputy who is expected to outline details at the Congresstoday, the Russian post would combine elements of the Frenchand American presidencies. The president would have the powerto issue binding decrees and would form the cabinet, but hewouldn't be able to dissolve the Congress, the supremelegislative body. Mr. Yeltsin is often now described asRussian president, but actually he is chairman of theparliament's presidium, and wasn't popularly elected.   Communist deputies conceded that they have backed offtheir drive to oust Mr. Yeltsin. But they still hope totorpedo his plans for a presidency. Viktor Stepanov, aleading Communist official from the Karelia region, said manyso-called autonomous regions within Russia are unhappy withthe notion and want to discuss it more thoroughly beforedeciding.   In Washington, the administration stepped up pressure onMr. Gorbachev to lift the ban on demonstrations. The WhiteHouse issued a lengthy statement urging Mr. Gorbachev'sgovernment &quot;to remove all unnecessary restrictions on rightsof expression and assembly as soon as possible. The currentpolitical crises in the Soviet Union cannot be resolvedthrough confrontation. A truly durable and legitimatesolution can only come through peaceful dialogue, and anorderly democratic political process.&quot;   The statement added: &quot;We have seen no indications thatsuggest the demonstrations planned for today would have beenany less peaceful or orderly than previous demonstrations inMoscow, all of which have occurred without incident.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
