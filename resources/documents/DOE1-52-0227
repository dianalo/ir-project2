Even fewerbreeding projects place major emphasis on genetic improvement for wildlife.People are still working basically with wild plant populations in bothreclamation and wildlife habitat improvement efforts. If you assess thesurviving plants on disturbed sites for their adaptation and select superiorgrowth, these materials should be suitable for additional breeding. Individualsdemonstrating preferential feeding by wildlife will similarly yield improvedmaterial for wildlife, state and private gameland planting of denudedareas.</TEXT></DOC>
