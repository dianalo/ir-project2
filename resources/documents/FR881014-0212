In that determination,the Director denied Dempsey's request for information pursuant to the Freedomof Information Act (FOIA). Specifically, the Director denied Dempsey'srequest for information related to DOE Solicitation No. RFP DE-RP01-86DP48042on the grounds that Dempsey's request failed to reasonably described therecords sought. In considering the Appeal, the DOE found that some recordsmust exist regarding the ``initial proposals,'' ``price,'' ``technicalevaluations,'' and ``selection criteria'' of this solicitation. Consequently,the Appeal was granted and the case was remanded to the Director for athorough search for documents responsive to the Dempsey request.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Exxon Company U.S.A., 8/9/88, KFA-0201</T3>Exxon Company U.S.A. (Exxon) filed an Appeal from a determination by theEconomic Regulatory Administration to release certain documents, pursuantto a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, which Exxon had submittedto the DOE in 1978. In considering the Exxon submission, the DOE determinedthat neither the FOIA nor the DOE regulations provide for an administrativeappeal by the submitter of information of a determination to release thatinformation. The DOE concluded that Exxon's appropriate remedy was an appealto federal district court. Accordingly, the firm's Appeal was dismissed.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>William Hyde, 8/12/88, KFA-0206</T3>William Hyde filed an Appeal from a determination issued to him by theIdaho Operations Office concerning a request which he had submitted underthe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

No responsive documentswere identified by the Operations Office. However, on Appeal, the DOE foundthat a copy of the letter from which the Opeations Office had blocked outthe recommended deletions was responsive to Hyde's request. Nonetheless,the DOE found that the recommended deletions were deliberative in natureand fell within the scope of Exemption 5. Accordingly, the Appeal was denied.<ITAG tagnum="84">Supplemental Order</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>King Petroleum, Inc., Richard C. King, Dewveall Petroleum, Inc., WillardC.

The DOE rejected both these arguments,finding that governmental authorities have not waived their right to adirect refund, either explicitly or implicitly and that NPPD was not claimingthe refund for itself but rather agreed to pass through to its customersany refund that it would receive.
