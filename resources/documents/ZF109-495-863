Ronald Carey, the RCAS program manager, toldNavy officials he was precluded from using any existing system by thesubcommittee's mandate that the Army buy a new system, according to a Navyreport.andM;The new Naval Reserve study group will investigate claims that militarycommanders have been authorized to buy computers without bona fiderequirements and that money reported as spent by the reserve's IRMdirectorate has not been showing up on the directorate's books.andM;Since 1988, the Navy has been implementing software upgrades and fielding newmicrocomputers under the RESCOMMIS program, which has won praise for itsapproach to downsizing applications.andM;But among the charges recently made is that senior Naval Reserve commandersno longer support the centralized office that Ates ran until last month.andM;The anonymous letter sent to the subcommittee cited a variety of internalmanagement problems impeding RESCOMMIS.andM;The author suggested the subcommittee should seek to merge Army and Navyreserve ADP.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
