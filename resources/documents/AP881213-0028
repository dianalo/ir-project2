Show the hostages that we care,'' Moore,co-chairman of the Operation Hostage Freedom committee, said in astatement.   The committee is the brainchild of Leonard Saffir, president ofthe Overseas Press Club of America, and Peggy Say, sister of TerryAnderson, The Associated Press' chief Middle East correspondent whowas captured on March 16, 1985.   Anderson has been held longer than any other American hostage.   In Lebanon on Monday, kidnappers holding U.S. Marine Lt. Col.William R. Higgins said in a statement they have sentenced him todeath for alleged spying for Israel. Higgins has been held sinceFeb. 17.   ``It would seem that some Americans care more about whales thannine of their fellow citizens held hostage,'' Saffir said. ``Let'ssave our whales and our hostages, too.''   The group plans a series of newspaper advertisements and publicservice radio announcements to publicize the hostages' plight.   Other celebrities on the committee include Woody Allen, PhilCollins, Hank Williams Jr., Randy Travis, Reba McEntire and ChetAtkins. Journalists supporting the effort include Bill Foley, aphotographer for Time magazine, and Don Mell, an AP photo editor whowas with Anderson when he was abducted.   Besides Anderson and Higgins, the American hostages are ThomasSutherland, Frank Reed, Joseph James Cicippio, Edward Austin Tracy,Robert Polhill, Alann Steen and Jesse Turner.</TEXT></DOC>
