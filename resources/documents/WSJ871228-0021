It will of course be primarily up to Alan Greenspan and James Baker to convert that urgent desire for monetary stability into reality. If they do, the world economy will benefit.    As it turns out, the Group of Seven was awaiting President Reagan's signing of the compromise budget finally produced by Congress before declaring its intention to stabilize exchange rates. The budget Mr. Reagan signed was by no means a great achievement but the Group of Seven seems to have decided that if it waits for Congress to get its act together there will never be monetary stability. Some businessmen and economists to the contrary, a consensus has been building for months now that the dollar has fallen enough.    Consider, for example, the recent statement by 33 economists gathered by the Institute for International Economics headed by C. Fred Bergsten. In the past, we've disagreed with Mr. Bergsten and his colleagues, viewing their model as one that says a lower dollar is &quot;needed&quot; to get trade in balance. We still have differences in priorities, as an &quot;aside&quot; indicated on Dec. 17, with the statement of the 33.    We very much agree, though, with some of its sentiments. In particular, &quot;A further sharp fall in the dollar -- by increasing inflation in America and the threat of recession elsewhere, and further undermining confidence in the world's key currency -- could lead to a financial crisis and a serious world recession.&quot; And also, &quot;Businessmen in America and in the surplus countries need to be assured that the cycle of excessive currency fluctuations since 1973 has been tamed, and that a sensible pattern of real exchange rates can and will be maintained over the medium run.&quot;    Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, too, was critical of proponents of floating exchange rates in an address in Geneva last month marking the 40th anniversary of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He observed that when floating exchange rates came into being in 1973, it was widely argued that they would provide strong support for free trade. &quot;Now, 15 years later, that kind of optimism looks pretty naive.&quot; Exchange-rate volatility hasn't diminished as predicted, he noted. Instead, it has increased.    The current Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, recently told a House committee that he agreed with Treasury Secretary Baker that the use of commodity indexes to guide monetary policy would be a good idea, suggesting that he too at least is toying with the idea of a price standard in currency management. He didn't elaborate, but it will not be lost on monetary-policy specialists that guiding dollar creation by means of a price standard would be a first step toward restoring stable currency relationships around the world.    As for Europe, Pierre Beregovoy, former economics minister of France and a confidant of French President Francois Mitterrand, told us recently that Europe wants stronger leadership from the U.S. in stabilizing currencies. Such a wish is of course also reflected in the Group of Seven statement.    The main dissenters from this consensus, ironically, seem to be concentrated in the Reagan White House and Treasury. They fear that &quot;raising interest rates&quot; to defend the dollar will cause a recession. This is confusion. Defending the dollar requires slowing the pace of dollar creation, that is, adding to bank reserves at a slower rate. No doubt overnight interest rates would rise, but long rates would be more likely to fall with a decline in inflationary expectations. Bonds, after all, rallied last Thursday on news of the Group of Seven agreement to try to prevent any further decline of the dollar. Regrettably, this White House/Treasury confusion is fed by monetarist economists who during the 1970s so eloquently taught us that the Fed can't target interest rates.    This economic confusion of course feeds the ever-present political temptation to play games with money. There is little doubt that driving down the dollar temporarily improved the income statements of American farms and international corporations, though it may also have contributed to boom-and-bust on Wall Street. Over time, sound money is the best politics. If a consensus is starting to develop on that point, it is about time. </TEXT></DOC>
