Another familiar refrain in many markets was concern about the dollar's weakness.    Prices fell in Tokyo as buying sentiment wavered on an absence of positive news regarding progress in the U.S. deficit-cutting negotiations.    Profit-taking carried the market's leading indicator lower despite the efforts of a large Japanese securities house to fight the trend.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks, which rose a bullish 390.21 points Wednesday, retreated in afternoon trading, falling 65.69 to close at 22668.80. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index fell 7.66 to close at 1859.90. Turnover, estimated at 700 million shares, surpassed Wednesday's 500 million.    At the end of the morning session Friday, the Nikkei slipped 137.20 points to 22531.60.    Traders said the fact U.S. budget negotiators recessed Wednesday without agreeing to a final package and the absence of encouraging words tended to deflate investor sentiment during the Thursday afternoon session. The Nikkei managed to open the late session a little in the plus column and slipped slowly on profit-taking in pharmaceutical and other issues to finish lower by the close.    According to industry sources, of Japan's three biggest brokerage houses, only one remained a net buyer by the afternoon close, while another recorded equal numbers of buying and selling orders. The other lapsed to the sell side. The mixed performance ran counter to morning expectations that all three would push selected shares in an effort to drive the market higher.    Shares of Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone dropped 50,000 yen to close at 2.65 million yen a share. The stock was seen as a market litmus test because of hope that large brokerages would seek to push up its price to encourage profit-taking on NTT and diversion of cash into other shares.    Profit-taking did hit heavy industrial shares, some with a focus on shipbuilding, which had been targets of strong brokerage buying campaigns in the morning. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries slipped 10 yen to 636 ($4.70), and Kawasaki Heavy Industries was down 3 to 277.    Large steel shares managed to retain some of the day's gains. Kawasaki Steel rose 6 to 356, and Nippon Steel was up 2 to 436. Tokyo Steel, on the other hand, dropped 60 on profit-taking to 3,200.    Some pharmaceuticals lost strength from the morning session, though many retained the gains of a strong morning advance. Brokers said the sector rose earlier on belief it provided a defense against unpredictable market downturns. Yamanouchi closed up 80 to 3,810. Takeda Chemical, rumored as an object of brokerage buying, was unchanged at 3,000.    In London, share prices closed lower in a quiet day of trading dominated by U.S. budget uncertainty.    The Financial Times 30-share index was off 19.4 points to 1289.9 at the close. Volume was a very modest 418 million shares, well down from 766.3 million a day earlier. The 100-share index was off 24.6 at 1639.1.    Trading in British Petroleum new shares, which dominated activity earlier in the week, dropped off sharply during Thursday's trading, dealers said. Without the support of BP trading, the market drifted down on a very low level of business, they added.    Trading in BP new shares totaled 49 million shares, well down from 320 million a day earlier. The reason for the high volume was disclosed late Wednesday, when BP said the Kuwait Investment Office had built up a 10% stake in BP. KIO is the London-based investment arm of the Kuwaiti government.    BP new shares slipped 3 pence to 79 pence ($1.40) as the heavy buying dried up. Regular BP shares fell 6 to 250.    Other major shares were mixed. Imperial Chemical Industries was off 15 at #10.08 ($17.94), Glaxo Holdings fell 19 to #10.29, and Jaguar was off 15 at 285. Plessey fell 14 to 133 after announcing second-quarter earnings that were lower than expected; pretax profit fell 25%.    Share prices closed generally lower on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in response to the dollar's weakness, brokers said.    The dollar was officially priced at 1.6791 marks at the Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing, down from 1.6972 marks at Tuesday's fixing. West German markets were closed for a holiday Wednesday.    Export-oriented stocks took the brunt of the sell-off, with shares of the best-known international companies leading the market lower.    Still, share prices were generally above depressed opening levels by the end of the session, and brokers said the fact that losses were relatively small was a sign of strength.    &quot;Many people had expected the market to cave in because of the dollar,&quot; said an analyst. &quot;Instead, we had one of the quietest trading days of the year.&quot;    The heaviest hit was the auto sector, where Daimler-Benz dropped 20.5 marks to 660 marks ($393). Bayerische Motoren Werke slipped 6.5 to 438.5, and Volkswagen dropped 1 to 265.    Banks were also lower, with Deutsche Bank declining 7.5 to 449.5. Commerzbank eased 4 to 225, and Dresdner Bank was down 2 to 238.5.    Chemical issues were only a bit lower, with Hoechst off 1.1 to 253.9, Bayer down 1.7 to 273.3, and BASF declining 1.8 to 255.2.    Stocks closed lower in the other European markets, falling in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Milan and Zurich. Analysts throughout Europe cited the lower dollar and the uncertainty over the U.S. budget talks.    In Paris, traders also cited month-end technical selling and disappointment about France's wider October trade deficit.    The story was the same in Asia, as prices fell slightly in Hong Kong, Singapore and Sydney. Traders said the markets would remain bearish unless the U.S. budget negotiations produce a significant agreement.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
