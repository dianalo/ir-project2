It also called for the release of ANC leader Nelson R. Mandela,who has been imprisoned since the early 1960s, by the new governmentof acting President F. W. de Klerk.   ``The ANC is one of several organizations with substantialpolitical support in South Africa, particularly but not only amongblacks,'' the statement said. ``It is a political diverseorganization representing a range of views.''   The Bush administration intends to expand its dialogue with theANC and other South Africans across the political spectrum, thestatement said.   Earlier, the State Department called on South Africa to end thestate of emergency it imposed in 1986 and legalize the ANC and otheranti-apartheid groups.   And yet, the department's statement said ``we strongly differwith the ANC on some of its methods for pursuing these objectives.We have condemned its use of violence, as we have all violence inSouth Africa, whatever its source.''   Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler called the electionof de Klerk ``a mandate for real change in South Africa.''   The department press office said later that Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III would like to meet with de Klerk ``at a mutuallyconvenient time.''   Congratulating de Klerk on his election, Ms. Tutwiler said: ``Weare committed to working with all parties to bring the South Africangovernment and black South Africans together in a substanial effortto end apartheid.   ``We therefore are prepared to work with the new governmenttoward this end. The most important first step in the process isdialogue among South Africans.''   She offered no hint as to what role the United States may play inpromoting an end to apartheid.   U.S. influence in South Africa declined sharply after Congressimposed sanctions against that country in 1986 over PresidentReagan's veto. There has been little high-level contact between thetwo governments since.</TEXT></DOC>
