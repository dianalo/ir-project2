In particular, it is possible to determine the in-situ resistancefactor and residual resistance factor of a polymer solution from theHall plot. Two field injection tests and one hypothetical example areexamined using the analysis methods developed. The analytical resultsare verified using a two-phase numerical reservoir simulator in radialcoordinates.</TEXT></DOC>
