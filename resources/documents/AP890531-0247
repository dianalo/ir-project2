But even last year's program, which was ranked No. 42 in theNielsen ratings for that week, was seen in an estimated 9.5 millionhomes. Those viewers would fill a lot of Broadway theaters, a factnot lost on the Tony nominating committee. All seven productionsnominated this year for best play or best musical are still running.   And Tony Awards sell tickets. ``M. Butterfly,'' last season'sbest-play winner, started to sell out after it won the top award.Also-rans such as ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' and ``A Walk inthe Woods,'' quickly folded.   Don Mischer and David Goldberg, who produce the Tony televisionshow, are optimistic about this year's edition, which will betelevised live from the Lunt-Fontanne Theater.   ``You always hope for a strong season,'' Mischer says. ``Thebiggest thing you work for in this show is to try and keep thetelevision viewer familiar with what is happening on Broadway sothat when awards are given, they have some idea who the people areand what the plays and musicals are about. If you have a reallypopular season, that helps you a bit.''   For the third straight year, Angela Lansbury will serve as hostfor the show which will feature scenes or dance numbers from thebest-play and musical nominees. Among the stars scheduled to appearare Steve Martin, Tommy Tune, Gwen Verdon, Colleen Dewhurst andRichard Thomas.   But the suspense should be minimal. ``The Heidi Chronicles,''which has won every honor from the Pulitzer Prize to the New YorkDrama Critics' Circle award, is a clear favorite to be tapped asbest play. Wendy Wasserstein's look at one woman's journey from the1960s to the present faces ``Largely New York,'' Bill Irwin'swordless entertainment; ``Lend Me a Tenor,'' a farce by Ken Ludwigabout an indisposed opera star; and ``Shirley Valentine,'' WillyRussell's portrait of a bored but never boring English housewife.   There's even less uncertainty about the winner in the topmusical category. The season produced one hot ticket _ ``JeromeRobbins' Broadway'' _ and it should easily ace the best musicalcategory. The telecast will feature a dance number from ``West SideStory,'' the high point of the Robbins show.   Only two other shows _ ``Black and Blue'' and ``Starmites'' _were nominated for best musical. The television presentation willalso feature two songs from ``Black and Blue,'' a revue of bluessongs and tap dancing, and a campy, Bette Midler-style number,``Hard to Be Diva,'' from ``Starmites,'' a sci-fi, comic stripmusical.   ``With the Emmys, Grammys and Oscars, the nation is basicallyfamiliar with those TV shows, records and films nominated,''Goldberg says. ``Here, it is more difficult. That's one of thereasons we are presenting segments from the plays and musicals. Weare trying to make the show more relevant for them. So if BillIrwin wins, for example, they have seen him and what he won for.''   Broadway had a bumpy year. Although it grossed a record $262million, attendance declined slightly from 8.1 million to 8million, and the number of productions slipped to 30, down two fromthe previous season. The biggest hits were still two long-runningshows, ``The Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Les Miserables,'' andothers such as ``Cats'' and ``Me and My Girl'' show no sign ofclosing soon.   Even those big hits couldn't guarantee high ratings for previousTony shows. Mischer is philosophic about the gradual ratings slidefor the program over the years.   ``The Tonys still do better than the average variety show ontelevision,'' he says. ``If you look back on the variety shows overthe last two or three years, the ratings have simply gone down anddown and down. We're living in an age of hyperactive televisionwatching. We sit there with a clicker in our hand, go through 38channels and dare something to hold our interest for five seconds.   ``That works against variety television. It works against thingsthat are different. If there is one act you don't like, one songyou don't like or one speech you feel is too boring, you're apt tomove on. And all of that affects the ratings.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv</NOTE></DOC>
