In fact, it reminds me of the time my Uncle Jack met his ex-wife Mona for a drink, trying to get back the family silver. You can sure bet none of his new in-laws are going to &quot;understand.&quot;    You should have met my ex-aunt Mona. What a woman! And can she hold grudges! Now, she and my Uncle Jack got along OK until he had a crisis, trying to &quot;find himself.&quot; By the time he got it together, Mona had hired a cheap lawyer, gotten a no-fault divorce, and split, taking Uncle Jack's family silver.    My Uncle Jack was pretty irate about that. After all, the silver had been in the family for a couple of generations. So he called up Mona to ask for the silver.    &quot;Drop dead, creep,&quot; Mona said, and laughed in his ear.    Well, life went on and my Uncle Jack got married again. Blanche is OK, she's got a job in the plant, but her family is like out of &quot;Dynasty&quot; without the money. They hate Jack's guts.    But Blanche loves my Uncle Jack. Besides, she's already been divorced once and doesn't want to go through that hassle again. So she told her relatives to stuff it. They quieted down a little bit, but they sure never liked my Uncle Jack.    Now here's where it gets rough: Jack has never forgotten his silver. Mona's still got it, and Blanche's folks are always rubbing it in. So Jack decides he oughta try to talk some sense into Mona, and maybe she'd give the silver back. Why not?    So he meets Mona at this bar, see, and for once she's in a good mood! But just as she's about to give Jack back his silver, an old girlfriend of Mona's with an ax to grind spots them and starts blabbing it all over town!    Well, does it hit the fan when Blanche's folks find out! It happened right before the holidays, and when Jack and Blanche go over to her folks' place for dinner, they all start in on him!    &quot;I don't understand,&quot; Blanche's mother starts crying. &quot;How could you have an affair with that woman?&quot;    Now Uncle Jack tries to explain but Blanche's sister yells, &quot;Anyone who'd go out with his ex-wife is a worm!&quot; All Blanche's folks say they're shocked and horrified to hear he's cheating on Blanche. Cousin Dood snorts he'll get to the bottom of it all.    &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Blanche asks, and Uncle Jack starts sweating like a convict. You see, he hadn't told Blanche about meeting Mona! A simple error in judgment, huh?    Blanche is beside herself: &quot;Behind my back!&quot; she shouts. &quot;That's right, honey!&quot; her mother chimes in. &quot;Give it to him!&quot;    Now Great Aunt Lillian begins to cry. &quot;A gentleman doesn't consort with other ladies no matter what might be gained!&quot;    &quot;Whyn't you tell me, you weasel!&quot; Blanche makes a fist. Now all her folks are shouting at Jack, who starts to turn purple.    &quot;I was after the silver,&quot; he howls. &quot;And the letters!&quot;    &quot;What letters?&quot; Blanche screams, and Jack feels real sick. Jack's mother-in-law puts her arm around Blanche. &quot;There, there, honey, we'll find out the truth. All we want is to understand.&quot;    &quot;You bet!&quot; Blanche's ugly sister growls. &quot;You can trust us!&quot;    Yeah, sure. The in-laws are happy now, but you got to wonder. Blanche may end up with a divorce she doesn't want, Jack's in the soup, his side of the family won't speak to hers, everyone's mad, and you know what the hell of it is? Mona's still got the silver.    ---   Mr. Moss stays with close relations in Birmingham, Mich. </TEXT></DOC>
