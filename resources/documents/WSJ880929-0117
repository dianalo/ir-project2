The more generalized approach, which has the support of organized labor and a major chemical trade group, would strengthen similar expansions of worker-health rules by the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Instead of dealing on a substance-by-substance basis, those recent actions proposed or set broad regulations for workplace-exposure limits and for telling workers when they've been exposed to hazardous chemicals.    In its latest move, OSHA asked for comments by Dec. 27 on whether to issue two broad, &quot;generic&quot; standards. The agency also wants to hear suggestions for other approaches, such as voluntary guidelines that could accomplish the same goals as broad standards. The timetable means the final decision will occur in the next president's administration.    One possible regulation would require employers to monitor the amount of workers' exposure to toxic chemicals or other hazardous substances. The other could require companies to provide medical tests to detect any ill effects on workers from such exposure.    Any such standards could be applied to a large number of chemicals or industries, covering as many as 17 million workers, OSHA officials said. Currently, OSHA requires medical surveillance of workers only as part of 28 specific standards for such substances as asbestos, vinyl chloride, lead, formaldehyde, benzene and cotton dust. And it requires monitoring of workers' exposure to toxic materials for only about half of those standards, the agency said.    Any general application of such requirements could mean a &quot;substantial&quot; increase in the number of workers they cover, an OSHA official said. While it's difficult to know how many workers are covered by the 28 specific standards, he said his &quot;guess&quot; put the total at less than one million workers.    Any broad expansion of the medical-testing and exposure-monitoring rules would be &quot;very, very significant,&quot; said Margaret Seminario, associate director of occupational safety and health for the AFL-CIO. It could spur employers to develop general &quot;programmatic capability&quot; to monitor toxic exposure and any resulting worker illness, she said, just as OSHA's cotton-dust standard encouraged such capability for other toxic exposure in the textile industry. The Chemical Manufacturers Association also supports the more-general approach.    Labor unions have urged OSHA to include such requirements in its recently proposed &quot;permissible exposure limits&quot; for more than 600 toxic chemicals, Ms. Seminario said. Lack of rules for exposure monitoring and medical testing &quot;compromises (those limits) severely,&quot; she said. &quot;If people don't know what the exposure is, they can't do anything else.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
