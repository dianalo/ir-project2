WallStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD)STOCK INDEXES (NDX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT (AGD) </IN><TEXT>   The price of wheat futures contracts for near-term delivery surged amid rumors that the Agriculture Department may offer subsidized wheat exports to East Germany, Nigeria and China.    Heavy buying by grain merchants and rumors that China may have purchased wheat from Australia or the U.S. also fueled the price rebound.    It also was rumored that China bought U.S. corn.    Wheat futures for March delivery rose 8 cents to $2.7625 a bushel. Most corn, soybean and soybean product futures also rebounded sharply.    The Agriculture Department refused to confirm rumors that it is considering offering subsidized wheat sales under its export enhancement program. But the department said it will allow Egypt to buy U.S. wheat under the PL480 export-credit program.    Sales under the two programs could help revitalize U.S. wheat exports, which have been flagging badly. In the week ended Jan. 1, sales totaled only 7.5 million bushels, 46% below the year-earlier level.    Rumors of an export subsidy to China have surfaced repeatedly in recent months without action being taken, said Ted Mao, a grain analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York &quot;You get to the point where it's like Peter and the wolf,&quot; he said.    In addition to rumored wheat purchases, China also was rumored to have bought as much as 500,000 metric tons of U.S. corn, analysts said. Although China has been a net corn exporter in recent years, logistical problems have forced some of the nation's southern provinces to import corn recently.    Soybean futures were buoyed in part by growing concern about a possible shortage of soybeans available on the open market, said Victor Lespinasse, a floor trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. Although farmers harvested a bountiful soybean crop this year, they are shovelling soybeans into government price-support storage programs at a rapid clip.    In other futures markets yesterday:    STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices resumed their steep climb, fueled by a strong bond futures market, expectations of lower interest rates and institutional program trading. The stock market soared as well, climbing 19.12 points to a record 1993.95. &quot;It was bordering on hysteria down there,&quot; said one trader, referring to the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures trading pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. &quot;We moved 100 (basis) points on four bids. There weren't any offers.&quot; Some profit-taking occurred near the close of trading, when the March Sandamp;P 500 contract eased from 257.00 to close at 256.25, up 2.70, an analyst said. Stock-index futures may stall a bit as the stock market tries to break 2000, but the rally should continue once that milestone is reached, said John Gustafson, analyst with Discount Corp. of New York Futures.    PRECIOUS METALS: Gold, platinum and silver futures prices posted modest gains following early losses. February gold contracts on the Commodity Exchange in New York fell to $400 before reversing course and closing at $404.30 an ounce. Platinum and silver futures prices followed gold higher, traders said. Silver contracts for March delivery on the Comex rose two cents an ounce, to $5.455; January platinum contracts for delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $4.60, to $482.40 an ounce. Some traders and analysts were surprised at the metals' buoyant performance in the face of the dollar's strength yesterday, when it rose against most other major currencies. The gold market &quot;had every reason to crack,&quot; said Bernard Savaiko, senior precious metals analyst for PaineWebber Inc. in New York. But traders said demand from producers and dealers developed at the $400 level, helping to prop prices. &quot;Any dips below $400 will be short-lived,&quot; Mr. Savaiko said. Some analysts expect higher prices in the coming days. Sharon Ziemian, assistant vice president of Citicorp-owned Citibank in New York, said gold prices could rise &quot;a couple of dollars more&quot; by tomorrow.    SUGAR: Futures prices recovered from Tuesday's decline, after the contract for March delivery traded as low as 5.77 cents a pound, just 0.02 cent above its life-of-contract low. The March contract recovered to close at 5.90 cents, a gain of 0.06 cent. The market attracted trading houses doing hedge buying, which helped the recovery, an analyst said. He said some speculators had taken short, or selling, positions in expectation that the March contract price would slide below the 5.75-cent mark and trigger further selling by technically-motivated traders. When the price recovered, these speculators closed out their short positions by buying contracts, the analyst said. In addition, the Common Market offered 61,000 tons of refined beet sugar, bought by French dealers, anaylsts said. They said the offering's size and a large subsidy that accompanied it suggested that the sale involved surplus sugar. That bolsters the prospect of oversupply, which doesn't bode well for the long term, an analyst said.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Pork belly futures prices fell sharply, and hog futures also finished lower. Traders' fears of lower cash prices and slackening retailer interest in the coming days pressured prices, analysts said. The weakness in the pork belly and hog markets was reflected in the cattle pit, where the contract for February delivery closed unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
