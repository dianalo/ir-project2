Abustling university building filled with holiday decorations andserious students chasing those elusive engineering degrees.   Abruptly, a man enters the modern, six-story school structure,ammunition belts criss-crossing his chest, a semi-automatic assaultrifle in his hands.   Shots, screams echo through the halls. For a second, Jean-RobertCadieux thinks it is only a pre-exam prank.   ``One of my friends said, `If it's a gag, it's a good one.There's a bloody corpse by the photocopy machine,''' said the23-year-old student.   By the time the unidentified gunman was through stalking theclassrooms and corridors Wednesday of the engineering school at theUniversity of Montreal, 14 women were dead, nine women and four menwere wounded.   The gunman, a brown-haired, blue-eyed man clad in blue jeans,work boots and a green-and-black sweater, killed himself on thethird floor of the building.   Frantic parents rushed to the school as pandemonium erupted.Stunned students walked trance-like on the snow-covered campus ofthe sprawling university that rests on a hill overlooking the city.   ``I saw death close up and I shook,'' said Vanthona Ouy, 22, oneof scores of horrified students who streamed out of the buildingafter the carnage. ``It's our friends who have been killed.''   ``It was just like Rambo,'' said student Robert Leclerc. ``Hehad at least two ammunition belts across his chest.''   Roger Tiffault, 23, a student, said the gunman walked into athird-floor classroom and said, ``Everybody out!'' When no oneleft, the gunman began shooting. Thiffault said a friend, who wasstanding close by, was shot, as was another woman crouched betweendesks.   Asked why he hadn't been killed, Thiffault kept repeating, ``Idon't know.''   The gunman entered a cafeteria first, killing three women, thenmoved up to a second-floor classroom, where he ordered the men outand fired on a group of frightened young women, killing six.   ``He came in quietly,'' said student Eric Chavarie, who wasamong the men ordered out of that classroom. ``And he told us tostop what we were doing. Everyone thought it was a joke.   ``He was smiling at us. He was very calm.''   No one moved, Chavarie said.   ``Then he fired a shot, right by my ear.''   Pierre Robert, 25, who was also in the classroom, said ``Ithought it was a blank. I didn't see anything on the wall. But itmade a very loud noise.   ``When he came in he was really calm but after the first shothis voice became nervous.''   Distraught, horrified parents frantically sought informationabout their children. The university turned into a temporarymorgue. School officials urged students to let their parents knowthey were safe.   Students and professors, their voices trembling from fear andshock, stood by the building in the cold Montreal evening.   One of the first police officers on the scene learned first-handthat his daughter was among the victims, according to a universityspokesman.   Pierre Leclair, the police's head of public relations, found hisdaughter, Maryse, dead on the floor, university spokesman RichardDoin said.   ``She was a really nice girl, very clever. She was a brilliantstudent,'' Doin said.   Some parents went to an auditorium at the school waiting tolearn if their children were among the dead. Some were in tears,others waited with their heads in their hands.   As many as 200 police officers were on the scene, including aheavily armed SWAT team that arrived in the first, most confusedmoments.   The university is the largest in Quebec, Canada's majorityFrench-speaking province, with some 50,000 students in 13 facultiesand about 60 departments.</TEXT></DOC>
