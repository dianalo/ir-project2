The walkout by 1,700 workers at provincially-owned B.C.Rail Ltd. has crippled freight transport from dozens of pulpand lumber mills along B.C. Rail's 980-mile main line andhalted shipments from two mines that jointly account forabout 40% of British Columbia's coal exports.</LP><TEXT>   There have been no negotiations since the walkout beganSept. 4, and no new talks are planned between the company andrepresentatives of its seven unions. A meeting is set forthis morning, however, between the warring sides and BritishColumbia's minister of labor, who is empowered to forceworkers back to their jobs.   &quot;At the present time {the government} is not consideringintervention,&quot; a spokeswoman said late Friday.   Meanwhile, Quintette Coal Ltd. said it will start reducingoutput and temporarily lay off most of the 1,450 workers atits northeast British Columbia mine beginning Thursday unlessthe contract dispute is settled. &quot;We simply have no way ofgetting our product to market, and that means that we have nosource of revenue,&quot; said the company, which sells its coal toJapanese steel producers.   Teck Corp., which owns 61% of the neighboring Bullmoosecoal mine, hasn't yet said what its plans are.   Weldwood of Canada Ltd., a big lumber and pulp producer,sees an &quot;imminent&quot; round of shutdowns and layoffs at severalof its mills, some of which already cut output because of thestrike, said Thomas Buell, chairman and chief executive. &quot;Theimpact is substantial. We're getting to a point where wedon't know if we'll be able to continue operating,&quot; he said.   Like Weldwood, other big forest products concerns thatrely heavily on B.C. Rail's line through central BritishColumbia are using trucks, where possible, to haul freight toCanadian National Railways' line, which interconnects withB.C. Rail's system. The hardest-hit producers include CanforCorp., Slocan Forest Products Ltd., West Fraser Timber Co.and Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd., among others.   &quot;It's certainly created a difficult situation,&quot; said aspokesman for Canfor. A survey of 17 affected sawmills showedproduction is down anywhere from 10% to 95%, said GregJadrzyck, spokesman for the Council of Forest Industries ofB.C., a trade group.   B.C. Rail, which is losing about 4.5 million Canadiandollars (US$3.8 million) a week due to the strike accordingRoger Clarke, vice president, finance, has been runningadvertisements in Vancouver newspapers outlining its positionon the dispute. The ads said B.C. Rail's annual union payrollwould jump 60% to C$123 million if it satisfied all of itsunions' demands.   The ads prominently display the 23.5% one-year wage boostinitially sought by union negotiators, along with otherdemands. &quot;That was an opening figure&quot; only, said ClydeMulhall, chairman of the Council of Trade Unions of B.C.Rail, which comprises the company's seven unions.   &quot;The main issue here is contracting out&quot; work to nonunionpersonnel, Mr. Mulhall said. &quot;We've told the company andeverybody that. If they're prepared to negotiate contractingout, then we'd revert back to a more realistic increase&quot; inwages.   The unions' previous three-year contract with B.C. Railexpired June 30.</TEXT></DOC>
