And that, he says, will be it. ``I'll be 68years old. If I even live that long I'll be thankful.''   Maloof has long fought diabetes, a disease underlying his otherhealth problems. One leg is larger than the other, leaving him witha laborious gait. He was soaking a painful foot earlier this yearwhen he was scalded and complications set in _ infection,pneumonia, blood clots in both lungs.   ``They wrote my obit,'' Maloof says with a laugh. ``They'vestill got it out there in the office. They wrote me off.''   He recalls lying in his hospital bed, terribly ill, seeing``this cliff, in my mind, that I was going to fall off of and die.It was all covered with all this slimy, green vegetation, vines andstuff. And I could look down in there and see this hole. I wasgoing to fall off of there. And all of a sudden, they just pushedme back.''   It was, Maloof believes firmly, the prayers of his many friendswhich saved his life. ``I'll believe that 'til my dying day,'' hesays.   Maloof hears that he's mellowed.   ``No, that's not so,'' he growls. ``I've always said there's theblessed and the damned: the blessed are those who don't give adamn, and the damned are those who do. Somehow or another, I wasalways the damned, because ... if I think something's not right,I'm not going to just let it slide.''   Maloof acknowledges that coming close to death ``gave me a lotto think about. You get in these jobs and you get to wondering _everything I do must make somebody mad. But there was a genuineoutpouring of affection in those prayers. ... That was the nicestsurprise.''   Maloof was a delegate to this summer's Democratic NationalConvention in Atlanta, for another son of immigrants, MichaelDukakis. Maloof is an unabashed old-style Democrat. In a time when``liberal'' is a political profanity and Ronald Reagan callsDukakis ``an invalid,'' Maloof worries what has happened to hiscountry and its politics.   ``They throw up these walls, and you're a way-out left-wingerbecause you care about people,'' he says. ``All of a sudden, itisn't right to say what you think. And we are losing that ability,I think. ...   ``What happened to us? Maybe it's because I've gotten old....''   These days, Manuel's Tavern only sees Manuel once or twice aweek; he doesn't have the time. His brother, Robert Maloof, and hischildren run the original tavern and two branches in the suburbs.   But there was a time when Maloof ran his bar morning 'til night,and his friends gathered 'round. Politicians and journalists wouldargue politics. Faculty members from nearby Emory University wouldhold after-class seminars; a religion professor named Tom Alitzerwas explaining his ``God is dead'' theory at Manuel's long beforethe rest of the world heard about it.   Maloff still prides himself on building a tavern where cussingtoo loudly will get you tossed, where a woman can sip a beerwithout getting hit on, and where talk and friendship, are the bestentertainment.   Maloof has firm ideas about he wants people to remember himyears from now, when he'll be running neither their county northeir bar.   ``I hope they just say, `He knew what he was doing. He cared. Hereally cared.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 23</NOTE></DOC>
