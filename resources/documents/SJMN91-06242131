I said: 'He must be careful. Hisheart is going to explode.' &quot;;   Nastase and his party had left their seatsduring the first-round match in the U.S. Open between Connors and PatrickMcEnroe.;   &quot;I should have known better,&quot; Nastase said. &quot;Jimmy you can nevercount out.&quot;;    NASTASE left when Connors was behind two sets to none, andlove-3 in the third set. It seemed time for most people to evacuate.;   Afterall, Connors, in his 21st U.S. Open -- and the winner of five -- is an old mannow in tennis terms. He'll be 39 Monday. He was playing Patrick McEnroe.;  Little Mac is 25 and an improving player. He was running Old Jimmy Connorsragged.;   Connors was chasing and missing, and he scraped his knuckles and hehurt his knee and he hobbled in the second set.;   Then suddenly he wasbattling back. While 18,000 were there to watch the match's beginning, onlyabout 4,000 remained, and they cheered. And in the fifth set, many began tobow to the master.;   &quot;That's never happened to me before,&quot; Connors said. &quot;Iliked it, but I couldn't pay much attention. I was too busy trying to work outmy ending to the match. I was playing like I was possessed . . . the way I'vealways played.&quot;;   It is true. Connors has always given virtually every ounceof energy to every stroke, groaning with every hit.;   &quot;I love it,&quot; he said.&quot;I've always loved it. And you can't fake loving it. Everyone knows whetherit's from the heart. Like Pete Rose diving headfirst. The dirtier the uniformthe more he liked it.&quot;;   It is not unheard of among the pros that when one isdown as far as Connors was, you &quot;tank&quot; it and pack up for another day.;    NOTCONNORS. He talks of an obligation to give everything he has for the fans.;  &quot;It's what they pay their money for,&quot; he says. &quot;And I play for my ownsatisfaction most of all, but I also play for the respect of my peers. Don'twe all?&quot;;   At 1:35 in the morning, after 4 hours, 20 minutes of gruelingtennis, he emerged the winner over a stunned McEnroe.;   On Wednesday hereturned to the Tennis Center and worked out on Court 11, one of the outercourts. Several hundred fans, standing five and six deep, waited for Connorsto practice. From Court 9, Boris Becker bounded over and congratulated him.Gabriela Sabatini, in a white baseball cap, stood nearby and smiled the smileof an adoring fan.;   Connors hit for 30 minutes. And later, with a towelaround his neck, Old Jimmy Connors was mobbed and signed autographs.;   &quot;Didyou ever think you'd have a summer like this again?&quot; someone asked.;   &quot;Stickaround,&quot; Connors said. &quot;It's not over yet.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ira Berkow column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New York  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910829  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1G  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  621  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, August 29, 199100242131,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
