(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Yellowstone National Parkgot its first significant rainfall since Memorial Day on Friday,and the rain and cooler temperatures aided firefighters battling a40,000-acre fire.   In California, the pilot of a U.S. Forest Service plane waskilled Friday when his plane crashed while surveying a fire in theSequoia National Forest about 35 miles northeast of Bakersfield,Calif., authorities said.   Fires also burned in Idaho and Montana.   Yellowstone received about two hours of intermittent rainfallFriday.   ``One short rain shower is not adequate to douse the fires. Butit does help increase humidity in the air and it helps slow thefires down,'' said park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.   She said the temperature in Yellowstone cooled down Fridayafternoon, the wind slowed and firefighters made some progress intheir efforts to contain fires burning on nearly 200,000 acres ofthe park.   Park officials on Friday morning reopened a road between MadisonJunction and Old Faithful that had been closed Thursday because ofthe fire and smoke.   The fire, pushed east by winds whipping at up to 40 mphThursday, had crossed the road in several spots near Nez PerceCreek as it grew by about 3,000 acres during the day.   The fire's north edge was about 1{ miles south of the MadisonJunction campground, which remained open, and wind was pushing theflames to the east into backcountry, Anzelmo said.   The 20,260-acre Fan fire in the park's northwestern cornerremained inside containment lines and burning had slowed on theShoshone and Red fires, which had charred about 34,000 acres.   Despite the fires, tourism in Yellowstone remains high, Anzelmosaid.   ``We are continuing to see a very busy park with campgrounds andhotels full each night,'' she said. ``But the last two days, therehave been fairly smoky conditions in the park and the vicinity, sothat has been difficult for everyone.''   In Montana, cool, cloudy weather slowed a 2,800-acre fireburning in the Elkhorn Mountains southeast of Helena Friday. Firecrews continued the slow work of building fire lines by hand insteep terrain, forest officials said. The cool weather also helped125 firefighters battling an 8,000-acre grass and range firesoutheast of Dillon.   In Idaho, fire crews carved a break line between the raging4,000 Walker Creek fire and the southeastern town of Inkom onFriday. Residents from 16 rural homes were evacuated Thursday whenflames whipped by 60 mph gusts swept over thousands of acres ofsage, grass and groves of trees. The families stayed away fromtheir homes Friday, and residents of 32 other homes were warnedthey might have to leave their homes.   No structures were lost and no injuries were reported.   Hundreds of firefighters were strung out across the southernpart of the state against the worst of more than 75 fires startedby lightning Thursday.   ``We're snowed under here just trying to get people on fires,''Challis National Forest spokesman Jim James said. ``We're going tobe really thin on resources.''   In the Nez Perce National Forest, where Thursday's storm sparked20 new fires, some 180 firefighters tried to regain containment ofthe 1,000-acre Ruby Rapids fire after wind-driven flames brokethrough the containment line. Fire bosses hoped to recontain thefire by day's end and control it Saturday.   Crews finally controlled the stubborn 1,500-acre Spring CanyonII fire in the Targhee National Forest near the Wyoming borderThursday night, and fire bosses were hoping to begin demobilizationthis weekend.</TEXT></DOC>
