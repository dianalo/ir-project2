Using the method of cocrystallizationthe values of solubility products (SP) of complex compounds of the compositionMeI/sub 2/ x 18-crown-6 (Me Sm, Eu, Yb, Am, Cf, Es, Fm) in THF solutionare determined. The SP values obtained are in the range (5.9 - 7.9) x10/sup -12/ and are close to SP value for SrI/sub 2/ x 18-crown-6 (6.5x 10/sup -12/), which signifies the similarity of the elements properties.</TEXT></DOC>
