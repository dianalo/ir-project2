Hong Kong investor Lo Yuk sui on Wednesday offered to lend theAustralian concern $75 million through his property company,Richfield International Investments Ltd.   Hooker's U.S. interests, which total $1 billion, include theBonwit Teller and B. Altman chains, a shopping mall in Cincinnati aswell as other properties.   In late July a group of creditor banks abandoned a plan to keepthe company afloat and forced Hooker, which owes about $1.2 billionto Australian and international banks, to turn itself over to acourt-appointed provisional liquidator.   Earlier this month, L.J. Hooker, the Atlanta-based U.S.subsidiary of Australia's Hooker Corp., filed for protection underChapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in New York.   At the time of the filing, reports surfaced that vendors werereluctant to sell merchandise to Bonwit Teller and Altman's due tothe parent company's financial difficulties. Some vendors reportedlysaid they would sell merchandise to the stores only on a cash basis.   As part of the proposal, Richfield would acquire shares in Hookerand gain options that eventully would give it at least 65 percent ofthe Australian company.   In a letter proposing the takeover, Richfield said therestructing plan would provide for the ``orderly'' sale of someHooker assets.   Richfield said it wanted to acquire Hooker ``as a going concernin order to preserve asset values in Australia and in the U.S. ...otherwise many Hooker assets will be sold prematurely and atunfavorable prices.''   Wardley James Capel Corporate Finance Ltd., a unit of Hongkong andamp;Shanghai Banking Corp., is advising Lo on the proposed transaction.   Hooker ran into financial problems earlier this year partlybecause of rising Australian interest rates and the falling value ofAustralian dollars.   Lo is executive chairman of five publicly listed companies inHong Kong, including Regal Hotels (Holdings) Ltd., PaliburgInvestments Ltd., and Century City Holdings Ltd. and Aircoa.   The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, which obtained a copy of theletter, said that if the banks support the plan they would have toagree not to enforce their securities and to withold demands forpayments for the next three months.   Richfield would then be given until Nov. 30 to undertake adetailed review of Hooker's operations and to decide whether anappropriate rebuilding plan can be devised.</TEXT></DOC>
