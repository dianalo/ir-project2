Lebanese newsreports said Syria might try to help gain the release of thecaptives.   Hezbollah, the Iranian-sponsored group thought to be an umbrellafor hostage holders, said it would not trade three captured Israelisoldiers for a kidnapped Shiite cleric Israel has refused to freeon other terms.   In Tel Aviv, U.N. envoy Marrack Goulding appealed to Israel torelease the 33-year-old cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, butDefense Minister Yitzhak Rabin refused.   Israeli commandos kidnapped Obeid, who is affiliated withHezbollah, from his home in southern Lebanon on July 28. Israel hasoffered to exchange Obeid and Shiite prisoners it holds, estimatedat about 400, for the three soldiers and the 16 Western hostages inLebanon, eight of whom are Americans.   Sheik Sobhi Tofaili, a senior Hezbollah leader, said in astatement distributed Tuesday in Beirut: ``There shall be nocontacts and no negotiations as long as Sheik Abdul Karim Obeidremains in captivity.   ``This is the party's unshakeable conviction and this is what weshall do. Hezbollah is not concerned with the question of thehostages or the negotiations revolving around it.''   Hezbollah, or Party of God, has insisted Obeid be freed withoutconditions.   The Tehran Times quoted a source close to President HashemiRafsanjani as saying: ``The first step should be taken by theUnited States, and if Tehran gets satisified that its assets willcertainly be unfrozen, then the second step will definitely comefrom Iran.''   In the newspaper report, carried by the official IslamicRepublic News Agency, the source said Iran's influence in Lebanonwas limited and there was no guarantee the hostages would bereleased.   The Iranian assets, including arms purchased by the late ShahMohammad Reza Pahlavi but not delivered, were frozen whenWashington broke relations with Tehran over the seizure of the U.S.Embassy in 1979, after the shah was overthrown. Some of theAmericans in the embassy were held hostage for 444 days.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said:``There are a lot of ideas being floated, a lot of exchanges beingmade. ... We see ideas coming out from Iran, from Syria, Algeria,Israel, the United States, everybody.''   Goulding repeated pleas by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perezde Cuellar that Israel free the Shiite cleric, and told reportersafter meeting Rabin: ``I have to say that the kidnapping of SheikObeid does not help.''   Rabin said at another news conference: ``We believe that after3{ years ... of trying to bring about an exchange (for thesoldiers) we had to have assets ... to bring about an exchange andhopefully end the phenomenon of keeping hostage Israelis andnon-Israelis.''   Hezbollah's spiritual adviser, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,said in a statement published by several Beirut newspapers Tuesdaythat the abduction of Obeid left ``the region poised on a powderkeg.''   ``That act of piracy led to the killing of American officerHiggins,'' said Fadlallah, referring to the announcement by thecaptors of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins that they hanged him July 31in retaliation.   A poor-quality videotapepe the kidnappers released showed thebody of a man that appeared to be the U.S. Marine hanging from agallows.   Mrs. Higgins said Tuesday in Washington she considered herhusband dead, and offered President Bush her support as he ``triesto save the living and end the suffering.''   Robin Higgins, a Marine Corps major, said the time had come totell her husband ``we love him and miss him.''   The FBI said Monday it believed the man on the gallows wasHiggins, but that when or and how he died could not be determined.There have been reports that Higgins, who was on U.N. duty when hewas seized in February 1988, was killed months ago.   Fadlallah said Israel's refusal to free Obeid, and U.S. navalmovements in the eastern Mediterranean, reminded him of tensionthat preceded Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982.   ``I do not rule out the possibility of a large-scale militaryoperation by Israel to get itself off the hook in this crisis whichit created,'' he declared.   An-Nahar, an independent Beirut newspaper, said Tuesday therewere indications Syria and Iran would ``coordinate and intensifyefforts to resolve the hostage issue and defuse the crisis itgenerated.''   ``This is expected to take its final shape when Iranian ForeignMinister Ali Akbar Velayati arrives in Syria soon for talks withPresident Hafez Assad's government,'' said a dispatch from itsDamascus correspondent.   Syria supported Iran during its 8-year war with Iraq, in which atruce was reached in August 1988, but their interests in Lebanonsometimes conflict. Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon and is thecountry's main power broker.   An-Nahar said Syria was among the countries President Bush askedto intervene after kidnappers holding American hostage JosephCicippio threatened to kill him, ``but Syria rejected the contentsof the (Bush) letter because they did not conform with the role ithad played, and is playing now, to secure the release of hostages.''   ``This prompted Washington to send a flexible explanation of theletter to Syrian officials after a major crisis was about to arisebetween the two countries over the letter's contents,'' it said.   Cicippio's kidnappers, who call themselves the RevolutionaryJustice Organization, said Thursday they had suspended the deathsentence against him. He was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986.   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
