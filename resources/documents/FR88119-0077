Telephone: (313) 668-4214.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended,requires EPA to establish certain ambient air quality standards and requiresthat all areas in the United States plan to meet these standards by theend of 1987, at the latest. Based on 1985-1986 ambient monitoring data,it is estimated that 40 to 50 of these areas will not be in attainmentof the ambient standard for CO (``nonattainment areas'') at the end of1987.      Mobile sources account for most of the total CO inventory. A substantialreduction in vehicle CO emissions is currently occurring as older vehiclesare replaced in use with newer technology vehicles designed to meet stricteremission standards. In-use emissions can be further reduced by encouragingowners to properly maintain their vehicles. Inspection/maintenance (I/M)programs have been implemented in most nonattainment areas to facilitateimproved in-use maintenance. However, even assuming improved I/M programsare adopted, EPA still projects 4 to 10 potential CO nonattainment areasin the year 2000. A number of uncertainties are involved in making thisprojection. For example, as noted below, additional data on cold ambientperformance of current vehicle designs would be useful. Such additionaldata and refinement of EPA's modeling analysis could affect the projectionsof CO nonattainment areas. Some observers have expressed their view thatmany more areas may still be in nonattainment (reference: report datedSeptember, 1987 entitled ``Ambient Temperature During CO Exceedances_Programand Policy Implications'' by Richard W. Joy and Thomas C. Austin). In theextended time frame, the number of CO nonattainment is expected to riseafter the year 2000 due to continued growth and a leveling off of the benefitsof new vehicle turnover and improved I/M programs.      The large majority of CO ambient air violations occur at temperatures below68 anddegrees;F. Since EPA currently tests vehicles for compliance with emissionstandards only in the 68-86 anddegrees;F temperature range, cost-effectivenessmethods of reducing vehicle CO emissions at colder temperatures may existwhich are not currently being utilized on all vehicles. Such methods couldhelp many areas comply with CO ambient air quality standards and maintaincompliance in the future.      EPA is conducting this public workshop to solicit input from the industry,states, local air quality control districts, and other knowledgable partiesregarding the extent of the CO nonattainment problem, in both the shortterm and the long term, and the relative costs and benefits of reducingvehicle CO emissions at colder temperatures.      The following list of issues constitutes a preliminary agenda for the workshop.A document prepared by EPA which contains additional background informationand examines the issues in further detail may be obtained from the Agencycontact listed above. Comments on additional items to be added to the agendaare solicited.                  <ITAG tagnum="84">Issues to be Addressed</ITAG>A. Extent of Future CO Nonattainment<ITAG tagnum="81">1. CO Nonattainment Through the Year 2000</ITAG>Participants in the workshop are requested to provide information on theextent to which the current Federal motor vehicle control program and variouslocal control strategies will enable local areas to attain compliance withthe CO ambient air quality standards. Comments are also requested on therelative costs and benefits of various local solutions which could be usedby potential noncompliance areas. In particular, any as yet unpublishedinformation is requested on the technical potential of exygenated gasolineblends to reduce vehicle CO emissions, especially at cold ambient temperatures.Anticipated plans to promote the use of exygenated fuels in the short termshould also be described.Analyses are requested on the potential short-term local CO air qualitybenefits of a new Federal motor vehicle program to reduce cold temperatureCO emissions. In addition, comments and supporting analyses are requestedon the extent to which area growth could be a significant factor in short-termCO noncompliance.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Continued Long-Term CO Compliance After the Year 2000</ITAG>It is anticipated that the CO emission rate benefits from the current Federalmotor vehicle control program and most currently conceived local controlstrategies will be almost totally realized by the year 2000. Comments arerequested addressing the following issues:a. What will be the effect of growth on the ability of areas to complywith the ambient air quality standards in the long term?b. What strategies would be available to offset anticipated growth andincreased vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the long-term?c. Will the potential CO benefit of exygenated gasoline fuels be erodedin the long term due to such vehicle design strategies as closed-loop fuelcontrol and adaptive memory? If so, what is the anticipated ultimate CObenefit of exygenated fuels?d. What is the potential for the use of alternative fuels such as methanoland compressed natural gas (CNG) to help CO nonattainment areas?e. Would a Federal motor vehicle program to reduce cold temperature COemissions be a cost effective method to help CO nonattainment areas andprevent long term increases in area noncompliance?B. Vehicle Cold Temperature CO Emissions<ITAG tagnum="81">1. In-Use Vehicle Cold Temperature CO Emission of Late Model Vehicles</ITAG>Currently, very little cold temperature test data exist for modern technologycars and trucks. EPA is implementing testing programs to collect additinaldata on a small sample of 1985-1987 fuel injection light-duty vehiclesat 20 anddegrees;F, 50 anddegrees;F, and 75 anddegrees;F. Participants in theworkshop are requested to provide information on what data currently areavailable, especially colder ambient temperature vehicle emission testdata, and the status of programs intended to procure additional data. EPAwill also report on the status of its own data acquisition projects.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Technological Feasibility for Vehicle CO Improvements</ITAG>Comments are requested on the relative cold temperature CO benefits andcosts of technology-based methods, including alternative hardware and calibrationstrategies, for further reducing vehicle CO emissions. If lead time considerationsare significant these should also be described.3. Cold Temperature Testing Procedures and FacilitiesStandardized test procedures do not currently exist for temperatures below68 anddegrees;F. Comments are requested on procedural considerations in conductingcold temperature testing and whether different cold temperature test procedurescould significantly affect the test data. Comments are also requested onthe extent of currently existing cold temperature test facilities and plansfor acquiring additional capability.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Alternatives for Improvement of Motor Vehicle Emissions</ITAG>a. <T3>Cold Temperature Vehicle CO Standards.</T3> As most CO air qualityviolations occur at temperatures below 68anddegrees;F, an obvious potentialapproach would be to establish separate colder temperature CO standardsfor new vehicles. Options to be considered include the level of stringencyand the temperature range over which standards would be specified. EPArequests comments that will assist it in evaluating the feasibility, needfor, and cost-effectiveness of various levels of stringency. Suggestionsfor alternatives to a specific standard at a specific temperature are alsosolicited. Finally, comments are requested on the practicality and desirabilityof some form of voluntary compliance program.b. <T3>More Stringent FTP CO Standards.</T3> Comments are requested on themerits of a more stringent overall CO standard for all vehicles in termsof the current FTP (including the current temperature range), in lieu ofspecifically regulating CO emissions at cold temperatures.c. <T3>Low Speed Warm Vehicle Operation at Cold Ambient Temperatures.</T3>Comments are requested on the premise that warm vehicle operation in verylow speed congested traffic may be a significant part of the CO nonattainmentproblem in some areas. Is there a basis to conclude that CO exceedancescan be better controlled by emphasizing control under warm vehicle operationat cold temperatures?d. <T3>Other Alternatives.</T3> Comments are requested as to whether otherfeasible motor vehicle alternatives exist to help CO nonattainment areas.C. Additional Information and Workshop Record Closing DatePersons interested in making persentations at the workshop are requestedto notify the Agency contact listed above at least two weeks prior to theworkshop so that a final agenda can be prepared. Suggestions for agendaitems or issues to be discussed should also be submitted at least two weeksprior to the workshop.Presenters should be aware that EPA intends to follow the general outlinein the ``Issues to be Addressed'' section, above. While consideration wasgiven to having interested parties present all their prepared commentsat one time, EPA believes it makes more sense to handle one issue at atime and hear all views. Therefore, presentations should be prepared forissues falling into any one of the following three general categories:<ITAG tagnum="14">1. CO nonattainment through the year 2000 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">2. Continued long-term compliance after the year 2000 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">3. Vehicle cold temperature CO emissions</ITAG>Any party may make presentations in any or all of the above three generalcategories. In addition, EPA will provide an opportunity for commentersto present opening statements and overviews of their overall position atthe beginning of the workshop.The record of the workshop will be left open for a currently undefinedperiod of time following the close of the workshop. EPA will establishthe closing date for subsequent written submissions based upon informationpresented at the workshop.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 12, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Don R.
