According to people familiar with the grand jury probe,federal prosecutors have subpoenaed documents from the Comexand from the New York Mercantile Exchange in connection withthe investigation. Prosecutors have also sought to talk tolawyers in the Comex's compliance department.</LP><TEXT>   The investigation arose after a lawyer on the Comex'sregulatory staff recognized a man who had applied underanother name for membership as a trader on the exchange; thatwould have given him free rein in the Comex's gold and silvertrading pits. The lawyer, who suspected the man to be anundercover FBI agent, told other officials. Comex traderssoon learned of the incident, which was previously reportedby this newspaper. After being confronted by exchangeofficials, the man withdrew his application.   Yesterday, a Comex spokesman said, &quot;Any suggestion thatthe exchange has obstructed justice is unfounded.&quot; Hedeclined to confirm whether or not subpoenas had been issuedto the Comex.   Ron Oppenheimer, general counsel of the New York Mercsaid, &quot;Our policy is to cooperate with law-enforcementofficials.&quot; He declined to elaborate further. An FBIspokesman declined to comment.   The New York Merc isn't believed to be a subject of thisinvestigation, the people familiar with the inquiry said. ButComex officials are understood to have shared with Mercofficials their belief that the FBI was conducting anundercover investigation of New York commodity trading, andto have warned them about a possible undercover operation onthe Merc, too.   Both the Comex, which is the nation's majorprecious-metals futures market, and the New York Merc, theworld's leading oil market, have federal mandates to policeand discipline improper trading on their floors.   The obstruction-of-justice investigation raises importantlegal and ethical issues about whether officials of theexchanges have an obligation to protect the identity of anFBI undercover agent or otherwise safeguard covert governmentoperations on the commodity exchanges, if they learn aboutthem inadvertently.   Three years ago, the FBI successfully planted undercoveragents on the floors of Chicago's two big futures exchangeswithout telling exchange officials there. That undercoveroperation led to 48 indictments and more than 30 convictionsand guilty pleas for illegal trading practices, as well anumber of acquittals.   The obstruction-of-justice investigation is beingspearheaded by Alan Cohen, chief of the Manhattan U.S.attorney's securities and commodities fraud task force, andby Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Ryan. Mr. Cohen said, &quot;Itwould not be appropriate for me to comment.&quot;   According to people familiar with the investigation, Ms.Ryan is understood to have met last week with attorneys PaulVizcarrondo Jr., who represents officials at the Merc, andRobert Morvillo, who represents Comex officials. Neitherattorney would comment. The people said that exchangeofficials haven't been interviewed or subpoenaed.   The investigation is still in its very early stages, andit's not certain that any criminal charges will result. Ifcharges are brought, it won't likely be for weeks or evenmonths.   But some lawyers said yesterday that the U.S. attorneywill have a tough time making an obstruction-of-justice case.&quot;To make a traditional obstruction-of-justice case, thegovernment has to establish that someone attempted tointerfere with a pending judicial proceeding, and ordinarilythat would not cover an FBI sting operation,&quot; said AaronMarcu, a New York attorney who is a former federalprosecutor.   Prosecutors are understood to believe that this case mightbe different, because even though Comex officials weren'ttold of an undercover FBI investigation on the exchange, theyhad been informed that there was a grand jury proceedingpending in a separate Comex investigation, long before theindentity of the suspected FBI agent was unmasked.   According to people familiar with the matter, the U.S.attorney's office has been looking into possible illegalactivities by two traders on the Comex. By revealing theidentity of the FBI agent, prosecutors believe, Comexofficials may have obstructed the grand jury's investigation,according to the people familiar with the case.   However, the people say, Comex officials believe theydidn't do anything wrong by revealing the identity of anapplicant who they believe misrepresented himself. The peoplesay the Comex's defense will likely be that, althoughofficials knew that there was a grand jury probe into twoComex traders, the officials didn't believe that they wereobligated to process a false application or to keep secretthat they believed the applicant may have been working forthe FBI. &quot;It's a freedom-of-speech issue,&quot; one person withknowledge of the matter said.   In May 1989, federal investigators from the CommodityFutures Trading Commission and other agencies seized recordsand subpoenaed as many as 50 traders. So far, the CFTC hasbrought civil charges against more than a dozen individualsand several firms for such infractions as trading ahead ofcustomer orders.   ---   Elyse Tanouye contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
