However, the last thing that any of the Arabian protagonists feel is humiliation because of having &quot;vouched&quot; for American fidelity. Ms. House's own observation of the Arabs' proclivity for conspiratorial thinking is an eloquently accurate pointer on this score. They may feel outsmarted, out-dealt or ignored, but not humiliated.    Beirut is the epicenter of Arabian political philosophy. Lebanon has been destroyed by the vicious, callous and self-serving territorial and political imperatives of the respective &quot;vulnerable,&quot; &quot;moderate&quot; and radical Arab states. The games of deception, blackmail, treachery, Islamic crusading and double-dealing on the part of those Arabs that have contributed to the crucifixion of Lebanon make the selling of missiles and spare parts to Iran a trivial matter.    The extent of any American-Israeli dealing in the Iran-contra affair is certainly not yet clear. The Arabs' &quot;worst suspicions&quot; about the U.S.-Israel relationship may be confirmed. Fine. That is important for Israel, the U.S., the West and for stability in the Middle East.    If the confirmation comes through to the Arabs via a slightly lopsided, prejudiced perspective -- colored by the sudden realization that they do not have the world monopoly on a silk-smooth-dealing doctrine -- well, that's fine.
