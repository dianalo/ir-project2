The long awaited announcement Wednesday in Ottawa was part ofPrime Minister Brian Mulroney's program intended to trim the budgetdeficit. Opposition leaders pledged to fight it, saying it woulddestroy the government-run service known as Via Rail.   ``They have turned the national dream into a nationalnightmare,'' John Turner, leader of the opposition Liberal Party,said. ``The last spike has become the last straw.''   Transport Minister Benoit Bouchard said the cuts to be made Jan.15 will allow the government to reduce its annual Via Railsubsidies, now at $640 million, to $350 million by 1993.   Via Rail President Ron Lawless said of a total of about 7,300employees, 2,761 will lose their jobs, mainly in 1990.   The cuts will leave Via Rail operating three weekly trainslinking central Canada with the East and West coasts; a major chunkof its existing service along the populous corridor between QuebecCity, Quebec, and Windsor, Ontario; a couple of regional routes,and eight remote services.   Mulroney attempted to ease the political impact by announcing agovernment commission would study all forms of passengertransportation in Canada preparing for the next century, but it wasnot clear whether rail service would be restored if the commissionrecommends it.   Bouchard said the commission will investigate the best ways tomove Canadians between the country's major cities and what such asystem could cost.   He also said privatization that would improve service would bewelcome. ``Every route is up for sale,'' he said at a newsconference.   The rail system played an important role in the East-Westdevelopment of Canada, the world's second-largest country, so theproposal to reduce service can touch emotional chords.   Among the services cut would be the Canadian, the domed Westernscenic train that is featured on many posters and postcards.   Ed Broadbent, leader of the socialist New Democratic Party andanother key opposition figure, said the cuts were a disgrace andwould affect the country's poorest regions the most.   Broadbent said public opinion could be mobilized to change theplan. ``I think the government could be persuaded to come to itssenses again,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
