But there was doubt yesterday that some Middle East members of OPEC said to be the leading violators of production quotas would agree to any special meeting of the oil ministers at this time. The United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq are understood to be accounting for much of the increased production; total OPEC output has gone beyond 18.5 million barrels a day -- some one million barrels over current needs, according to some estimates.    Nevertheless, several OPEC countries are pressing for some action to counter deterioration in the oil markets from the excess production. Ecuador, one of OPEC's smallest producers, is in the forefront of the move, although it is receiving support from Venezuela, Iran and others.    &quot;Everybody is worried,&quot; Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador's oil minister, said in an interview.    Nevertheless, world crude-oil prices generally strengthened, if only temporarily, on reports there might be a special OPEC meeting. Although Venezuela reduced export prices of some of its heavier grades between 52 cents and $1.02 a barrel for the first time since April, prices of crudes on spot and futures markets increased yesterday in Europe and the U.S. North Sea Brent was valued at 35 cents higher late in the trading day, with crude for August delivery settling at around $14.60 a barrel. On the U.S. futures market, West Texas Intermediate closed at $15.36, up 27 cents.    Reports about a possible emergency meeting were premature, however, OPEC sources said. Mr. Santos said no one has yet called for a meeting, but that he has been in contact with several other oil ministers regarding such a step.    &quot;This week and early next week, we will keep on talking among ourselves to determine a suggested course of action,&quot; he said. At the least, he said, &quot;If prices continue to weaken, the Committee of Five should look very carefully at the situation.&quot; The Committee of Five is OPEC's price-monitoring group responsible for tracking oil prices and calling a full ministerial meeting if warranted.    Although Ecuador produces only 300,000 barrels a day, it has been hurt by the oil-price slide. The government had based this year's budget on an expected oil price of $17 a barrel. But Ecuador received only an average $13.65 a barrel for its oil in the first half, Mr. Santos said. &quot;Now, the price is around $12.50,&quot; he said.    The Ecuadorian oil minister puts much of the blame on the United Arab Emirates, which recently announced it was not only rejecting its OPEC quota, but would produce 500,000 barrels a day more than the assigned allotment. &quot;That was a surprise for us,&quot; Mr. Santos said.    Consulting firms that track OPEC output suggested the United Arab Emirates now is nearing its newly targeted 1.5 million barrels a day. Iraq, which also excludes itself from the quota system because it hasn't been given an allotment equal to that of its war foe, Iran, is nearing last year's production peak of 2.8 million barrels a day.    The Paris-based International Energy Agency estimated yesterday that OPEC produced 18.4 million barrels a day in June. Most industry estimates, however, are higher. Petro-Logistics Ltd. of Geneva, Switzerland, yesterday revised upward its earlier estimates for June production to 18.9 million barrels a day, noting that, &quot;In effect, some countries are exporting as if there is no tomorrow.&quot;    PEL North America, a Washington-based oil consulting firm, forecasts demand for OPEC oil this month at slightly less than 18 million barrels a day, and that actual production will range between 18.5 million and 19 million barrels a day. This should add to the surplus that already exists in petroleum inventories.    Michael Barry, a PEL official, places the excess at 100 million to 150 million barrels, equal to two to three days of world oil supplies. &quot;Inventories are a very bearish factor in the market,&quot; added Edward N. Krapels, president of Washington-based Energy Security Analysis Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
