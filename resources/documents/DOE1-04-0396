Investigation of the thermal stability of titanium polonidesin a carbon dioxide medium has shown that titanium mono- and hemipolonidesare decomposed at temperatures below 350{sup 0}C. The temperature dependenceof the vapor pressure of polonium produced in the decomposition of thesepolonides in a carbon dioxide medium have been determined by a radiotensimetricmethod. The enthalpy of the process, calculated from this relationship,is close to the enthalpy of vaporization of elementary polonium in vacuo.</TEXT></DOC>
