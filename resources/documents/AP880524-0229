North and twoco-defendants in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case Tuesday disputed aprosecution claim that hundreds of statements they made to Congresswere not covered by immunity grants.   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh was ``completely wrong onthe law'' by claiming that fired National Security Council aideNorth, former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and armsdealer Albert Hakim made numerous statements during last year'sIran-Contra hearings that could be used as evidence against them,the defense said in a brief filed in U.S. District Court.   Walsh ``seeks to punish defendants for responding fully and ingood faith to congressional inquiries, when compelled to do so overvehement objection, and for relaying to Congress and the nationwhat occurred and why,'' the defense said.   North, Poindexter and Hakim testified under limited grants ofimmunity from prosecution. But Walsh contends that hundreds ofstatements they made were not covered by so-called ``use'' immunitybecause they were not in response to questions posed by theIran-Contra committees.   Walsh offered not to use any of the congressional testimonyduring the trial if the court decides other immunity issues in hisfavor.   The defense accused Walsh of trying ``to threaten the court witha lengthy inquiry into immunized testimony, and then to use thatthreat as leverage to strike a favorable bargain with the court.''   ``This tactic is unseemly,'' the defense lawyers said in a jointpleading.   North, Poindexter and Hakim are accused along with retired AirForce Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord of conspiring to defraud thegovernment by diverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to theNicaraguan rebels.   Secord testified without an immunity grant from Congress andtherefore is not part of his co-defendants' attempt to overturn theindictment on the ground that Walsh's investigation was tainted byillegal use of immunized testimony.   In its latest filing, the defense said, ``There is no claim thatdefendants uttered a single word, during the course of theircongressional testimony, that was outside the subject matter of thecongressional inquiry.''   North, Poindexter and Hakim did not waive their Fifth Amendmentprivilege against self-incrimination when they ``explained theiranswers; or sought to provide useful, related information to besure their answers were complete and accurate _ in short, the`whole truth' they had sworn to provide.''   The defense urged U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell toreject Walsh's argument, which would require the court to performthe difficult task of determining if each of the hundreds ofstatements was protected by the immunity grant.   These statements, the prosecution contends, includesPoindexter's testimony that he approved the diversion of funds butdid not tell President Reagan so that he could give the presidentdeniability if the operation were later exposed.   They also include Poindexter's statements that during AttorneyGeneral Edwin Meese III's November 1986 investigation, Poindexterdestroyed a presidential intelligence finding authorizing CIAinvolvement in one 1985 arms shipment to Iran.   Walsh also claims that North's statements the he destroyeddocuments in October and November 1986 could be used as evidence toprove charges that North obstructed Meese's inquiry.   In a separate filing Tuesday, Walsh's office said, ``It is clearbeyond doubt'' that North, Poindexter and Hakim waged a ``publicrelations battle'' during their congressional testimony.   ``In utter defiance of the questions put to them, they sought towin with speeches and arguments,'' the prosecution brief said.</TEXT></DOC>
