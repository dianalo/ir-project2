This would represent the largest sale by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative government in its privatization program.    Claude Taylor, Air Canada's chairman, welcomed the decision, saying, &quot;It is the best route to secure the future for Air Canada.&quot;    Mr. Taylor said proceeds would help finance the replacement of Air Canada's aging fleet of 34 Boeing Co. 727 aircraft. Air Canada said it hasn't decided whether to buy the new planes from Airbus Industrie, a European consortium, Seattle-based Boeing or St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp.    The government declined to indicate the value of the Air Canada share offering. Tony Hines, an airline analyst with McLeod Young Weir Ltd., said a 45% interest would be valued between 200 million and 500 million Canadian dollars (between $161 million and $403 million), depending on terms and conditions, and probably closer to 300 million dollars.    Canada's Deputy Prime Minister Donald Mazankowski didn't rule out an eventual sale of all Air Canada shares to the public. He said legislation would be introduced as soon as possible to permit the initial offering. Mr. Taylor said a share offering wouldn't be possible for at least four months after legislation is passed by Parliament.    The legislation will face opposition in Parliament, where the move was criticized by both the Liberal and New Democratic parties. One poll by Gallup Canada Inc. said 42% of Canadians favored the sale of Air Canada, and an equal percentage was opposed.    In announcing the planned sale, Mr. Mazankowski said Air Canada needs &quot;the same opportunities as its competitors&quot; to raise funds in capital markets. The offering is expected to be priced to attract demand from many individual Canadians, who will be favored over institutional holders. Mr. Mazankowski said he wants &quot;as many Canadians as possible&quot; to participate, especially the airline's employees.    A single shareholder, other than the government, won't be allowed to own more than 10% of Air Canada's publicly issued equity, and total foreign ownership will be restricted to 25%. The shares won't be offered in the U.S. or other foreign markets; foreigners could buy the shares on Canadian stock markets.    Air Canada said yesterday it had 1987 net income of 45.7 million dollars, a 13% increase from the year-earlier 40.4 million dollars, which included a 4.5 million dollar extraordinary credit. Revenue rose 8.5% to 3.13 billion dollars from 2.89 billion dollars. Despite the increases, the company said, its 1987 results were hurt by a three-week strike by ground employees last Christmas.    Air Canada, which is the world's 14th-largest airline, has reported profit for nine of the past 11 years. The 51-year-old carrier has two major competitors in Canada, Canadian Airlines International and Wardair. The two publicly held airlines recently urged the government to refuse Air Canada's request for 300 million dollars in new equity. In a brief statement yesterday, Canadian Airlines said it &quot;has always supported the sale of Air Canada.&quot;    A recent Economic Council of Canada report said that between 1964 and 1981, Air Canada spent 18% more than it would have if it weren't government controlled. The Economic Council, a nonprofit research group, said Air Canada had to buy more airplanes than it needed, to meet government-imposed service requirements.    The Conservative government has sold interests in many other companies, including aircraft manufacturing, telecommunications and fishing concerns, mainly through negotiated agreements. </TEXT></DOC>
