<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-94-0566 </DOCNO><TEXT>A report on the geological, geohydraulical, geohydrochemical, isotopehydrological,and geothermal results from the hydrogeothermal wells drilled since 1978in Baden-Wuerttemberg is made. Eight of these wells are in the molassebasin and tap the Malmkarst. Four are in the Upper Rhine Graben, of whichtwo, Bruchsal 1 and 2, were successful (discharge rate up to 30 l/s,temperature approx. 130/sup 0/C, and suspended solid content approx.130 g/kg). In the molasse basin, discharge rates up to 50 l/s with temperaturesof 40-56/sup 0/C and suspended solid contents of approx. 0.45-0.60 g/kgwere achieved. The results of the geothermal experiment in the Saulgauexperimental doublett and the gauging and evaluation of tidal influencein calculating aquifer-parameters are summarized.</TEXT></DOC>
