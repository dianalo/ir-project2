Meanwhile, the list of creditors against the cash-squeezedairline continued to grow as laid-off union workers preparedpetitions for back wages and benefits.   Braniff, which has lost nearly $1.6 million a week this year,filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Thursday and announcedplans to cut its work force to about 2,000 from 4,791. Officials atthe Orlando-based carrier say they plan to reorganize as a smallerairline.   On Friday, Braniff operated four flights linking its KansasCity, Mo., hub with Dallas and Orlando. Eight flights were rundaily on the weekend using 160-seat Boeing 727 aircraft, and 46flights were scheduled for Monday.   Braniff spokeswoman Sandy Smith said the most crowded weekendflight was Sunday from Los Angles to Kansas City, with about 73percent of the seats filled. On Saturday, only 13 percent of seatswere occupied on a flight from Dallas-Fort Worth to Kansas City.   From Kansas City, Braniff on Monday scheduled flights to andfrom Chicago; Dallas-Fort Worth; Los Angeles; Newark, N.J.; NewYork's La Guardia Airport; Phoenix; San Diego; San Francisco;Washington, D.C.; and Orlando.   From Orlando, round-trip flights were scheduled to Dallas and LaGuardia.   Before the bankruptcy filing, Braniff flew to 39 U.S. cities andNassau, Bahamas.   Ms. Smith said the carrier will not likely consider boostingservice until mid October. Braniff's $49 one-way fare endsWednesday, but $99 fares will be in effect until Oct. 31.   Teamster officials Monday held meetings in Orlando for the morethan 1,800 laid-off Braniff union workers, said Teamster businessrepresentative Bob Belans. Braniff employed about 2,250 Teamstermembers, mostly customer service agents, clerical workers and othersupport personnel.   Belans said the meetings were called to instruct workers on howto petition the bankruptcy court for back pay and benefits. Theairline withheld final paychecks to many laid-off workers.   The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 900Braniff employees, plans to establish some type of relief effortfor laid-off members who need food, clothing and other assistance,said union spokeswoman Ruth Hinsey in Orlando.   ``We have the work force now to support the flights and I can'tspeculate when we may need more,'' said Braniff spokesman DonMcGuire in Orlando.   He said the company has set up a toll-free telephone number toassist laid-off employees find job-training programs and otherresources.   Braniff, acquired last year in a leveraged buyout by a group ofinvestors led by PaineWebber Inc., lost $31.8 million on revenue of$293 million from February to July. The carrier's net worth _assets minus debts _ declined from $33.6 million on Jan. 31, 1988,to a negative $23 million July 31.   Braniff International Corp. filed for bankruptcy in 1982,shortly after industry deregulation, and emerged in 1984 as asmaller carrier. It relocated its headquarters from Dallas toOrlando in May.   Braniff hopes to settle the $1.5 billion in claims from thefirst bankruptcy filing by the end of the year.   A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 20 before Bankruptcy Judge C.Timothy Corcoran in Orlando on Braniff's $2 billion agreement toacquire 50 Airbus A320 jets, McGuire said.</TEXT></DOC>
