<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-06-0657 </DOCNO><TEXT>A series of organometallic compounds of tetravelent Neptunium was studiedby Moessbauer methods. Three of them will be presented here. Their molecularstructure is close to C/sub 3v/ symmetry. The data were parameterisedon the basis of an anisotropic paramagnetic relaxation model and willbe interpreted for each individual compound. In general it can be statedthat distortions from axially symmetric hyperfine parameters were observed,no magnetic ordering occured at all temperatures above 1.5 K and anisotropicrelaxation frequencies had to be introduced to fit the spectra.</TEXT></DOC>
