I do want to take great exception to one of the items in your table that states that reading a chest X-ray takes one minute. As a practicing radiologist, I can assure you that interpreting a film of the chest is a very complex task that takes much longer. The thought of missing an early carcinoma of the lung, among other things, is always with the radiologist as he carefully searches each square inch on the film.    Murray L.
