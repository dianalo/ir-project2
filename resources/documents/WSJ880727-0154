The liaison arrangement appears modeled after one set up early this month for Roofers Union Local 30-30B in Philadelphia.&quot;    The Philadelphia case differs in two very significant respects. First, a civil RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) lawsuit was filed immediately after a criminal prosecution was brought against the officers of Local 3030B. Evidence was introduced in the criminal trial showing that each of the 13 defendants (members of the local executive board) engaged in criminal behavior. Second, a trusteeship in the generally understood sense was not imposed by the court. Subsequent to the guilty verdict in November 1987, the local union itself removed the convicted officers from office and held a new election. The government did not seek the imposition of a trusteeship until after a verdict was rendered. Judge Bechtle decided to let the newly elected officers remain in office. In view of the gravity of the charges (e.g., use of violence over a long period of time, widespread bribing of judges), Judge Bechtle established what he termed a &quot;decreeship&quot; where the court-appointed liaison officer will monitor closely the activities of the new local union executive board.    The filing of a civil, rather than a criminal, RICO suit against the Teamsters is disturbing. Some individuals, who have never been indicted for, let alone convicted of a crime, are facing severe penalties based on alleged criminal behavior that occurred at times when they were not members of the board. This is a case of unprecedented dimensions that some assert is politically motivated. Those reading only headlines perceive that the government is proceeding against the entire Teamsters Union, not just the 18-member international executive board. In such a case, it is imperative that the government not be perceived as circumventing the defendants' right to a criminal trial.    Janice R.
