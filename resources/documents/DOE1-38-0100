Additionalchemicals must be added to the high-level wastes to produce an acceptableglass. To maintain the composition of the glass within the targeted compositionalregion, the chemical additions must be carefully controlled. The amountsand kinds of chemicals that will be required will vary from waste batchto waste batch because the composition and amount of waste will varyamong batches, and because the composition of the additives will varyamong additive batches. The RECIPE code was developed: to enable accuratecomputation of the amounts of additives required for a given batch ofwaste; and to determine whether a batch of slurry will indeed give anacceptable glass composition when mixed with the batch of waste createdfrom the additives. In addition, RECIPE can conduct computations necessaryfor determining the amount and type of additives required to return anoff-specification batch of feed or the melter contents to tolerance levels.This report provides the user with an overview of the glass-making processand RECIPE's role in it, and sufficient information that, when combinedwith the extensive documentation within the source code, the RECIPE codecan be used, maintained, and modified. 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
