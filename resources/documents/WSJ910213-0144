Inthe Gulf today, there is no doubt that the American-ledcoalition has the firepower, the will, and the justness ofcause to &quot;win.&quot; Sustaining the subsequent peace, however,will be an immense challenge.   America's war aims are limited and should remain so. Thepresident has made clear that he does not seek the militaryoccupation of a devastated Iraq. He seeks only Iraq's fullcompliance with the 12 relevant U.N. Security Councilresolutions. The postwar goal should be to establish a stablebalance of power in the region at a much lower level ofarmaments and with an extensive international presence formonitoring the situation and for discouraging futureaggression. A helpless Iraq could invite further instability,given the historic rivalries among Iran, Syria and Iraq.</LP><TEXT>   While the United Nations has understandably been left inthe wings during the fighting, it should return to centerstage in the postwar period. The Security Council, whichauthorized the war, is the proper vehicle for overseeing thetransition from war to peace. This would allay suspicions insome countries about American ambitions, while easing thefinancial, human and political burdens on the U.S. ofmaintaining the peace. It is through the establishedmechanisms of the U.N. that America's more ambivalent allies-- such as Germany and Japan -- can be persuaded to carrytheir fair share of the load. Pax Americana is a catchyslogan, but realism dictates the need to re-emphasizeinternational burden-sharing and renewed respect forinternational law and institutions.   Peacekeepers will be needed to patrol Iraq's borders withKuwait and Saudi Arabia -- and possibly with Jordan and Syriajust as they now do the border between Iraq and Iran. Whilethe personnel might be drawn largely from Arab countries,their mandate should come from the Security Council, not fromthe Arab League, which is badly polarized on these issues.This would ensure a global eye on developments and theapplication of the U.N.'s many years of peacekeepingexperience. The creation of an ad hoc U.S.-led Westernmultilateral peacekeeping force -- as was tried with suchtragic results in Beirut -- would be a mistake. A large U.S.land presence, especially in Iraq, would offer a temptingtarget for terrorism, while reinforcing the image of avictorious America forcing its will on Arab populations.   Peacekeeping can help to prevent incidents and to monitordevelopments in the area, but tough arms limitations willalso be needed to make sure that Iraq and its neighbors donot reacquire the tools for another round of war. Iraq's SCUDattacks on Israel and Saudi Arabia underline the need toeliminate surface-to-surface missiles from the region. Onepossibility worth further study would be to extend theSoviet-American INF treaty, which bans medium andintermediate range ballistic missiles, to all states in theregion.   While coalition bombing of Iraqi nuclear and chemicalinstallations will buy time, without internationalinspections there will be no assurance that thesecapabilities will not be rebuilt. The International AtomicEnergy Agency, a U.N. organization, has been inspecting Iraqinuclear facilities for years, but the inspection systemclearly has not been thorough or dependable enough toreassure its neighbors of Iraq's peaceful intentions. Thesewill need to be supplemented with additional effectiveverification and confidence-building measures in the future.   The determination of war crimes, reparations and thehealing of the wounds of war will also require extensive U.N.involvement. The &quot;other&quot; U.N. -- its humanitarian anddevelopment side -- should be utilized to bolster stabilityby giving the people of the region a greater stake in thepeaceful evolution of their societies and, over time, agreater voice in their future. Despite the oil wealth of theregion, U.N. agencies will need to play a leading role inaiding refugees, providing humanitarian assistance, spurringeconomic development and rehabilitating the ravagedenvironment. Decisions will need to be made about thecontinuation of the economic sanctions and arms embargoimposed by the Security Council, as well as whether toprosecute the growing list of Iraqi violations ofinternational law.   The U.S., of course, should play a central role in all ofthis. Encouraging U.N. involvement does not mean shirkingAmerica's global responsibilities as the world's mostpowerful nation or abandoning bilateral ties with friends inthe region. But it does mean entrusting the internationalcommunity, through the Security Council, with a much greatershare of the power and the responsibility for shaping thefuture of the Persian Gulf region. The U.S. veto power willprovide an assurance that fundamental U.S. security interestswill be protected, but the emphasis in policymaking mustshift to finding a consensus solution that all of the majorpowers and affected states can live with.   Wars are terrible, but until we can find a way toeliminate them completely, the fact is that they create newrealities and open up new avenues for cooperation andinstitution-building. The ultimate test of whether the Gulfwar is successful will not be measured in levels ofdestruction, but in whether a new level of political dialogueand arms restraint can be introduced into the world's mostexplosive region. If so, then President Bush's welcomeconception of a new world order will have taken a great stepon the road from rhetoric to reality.   ---   Mr. Whitehead, a Reagan deputy secretary of state, headsthe United Nations Association of the USA.
