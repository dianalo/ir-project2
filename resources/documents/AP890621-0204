Manuel Antonio Noriega, the government said Wednesday.   The military will be included in the government delegation,Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter said in a letter to Jorge BaenaSoares, secretary-general of the Organization of American States.   The talks among the government, military and opposition wereproposed last week by an OAS mission, which has made two trips toPanama since the government annulled a May election that foreignobservers said the opposition won handily. The government hadinsisted that Noriega, the country's de facto leader, was ``notnegotiable.'' But Wednesday's Foreign Ministry statement, whichincluded excerpts from Ritter's letter, made no mention of Noriega.   Ritter's letter was apparently an effort to circumvent a deadlockcaused by Noriega' insistence the military had nothing to do withpolitics. Noriega had said talks to resolve the crisis should bebetween the government and the opposition.   Acting President Manuel Solis Palma's government reiterates ``itsdecision to take part in a dialogue between Panamanians to tryovercome the grave problems confronting'' the nation, Ritter'sletter said.   The government will be represented by ``the executive branch,which includes the Defense Forces,'' it added.   In the letter, Ritter indicated the OAS should help draw up anagenda for the talks ``on the basis of a concensus among thosetaking part ... to serve as a basis for discussion of the Panamaniannation's problems.''   Opposition groups demanding that Noriega step down said last weekthey were willing to take part in the talks.   Noriega was indicted in 1988 by federal grand juries in Floridaon charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. Efforts by theUnited States to oust him, including economic sanctions againstPanama, have failed.   Noriega had the legislature, which he controlled, fire PresidentEric Arturo Delvalle in February 1988, a day after Delvalle tried tofire Noriega. The legislature then named Education Minister SolisPalma acting president, but the U.S. has insisted on recognizingDelvalle as Panama's legitimate president.   The crisis deepened when the government claimed its candidateCarlos Duque of the National Liberation Coalition won thepresidential election May 7.   Opposition groups and foreign observers including several fromthe United States, said there was widespread fraud in the electionand that the opposition candidate, Guillermo Andara of theDemocratic Civilian Alliance, won by a 3-to-1 margin.   As the crisis grew, a government-controlled election boardannulled the election. The government had planned to install the newpresident on Sept. 1.   The OAS, called in to try solve the crisis, sent a delegation oftop diplomats late in May, then a second one last week, to try andget the government, the military and the opposition to negotiate.   The delegation, headed by Baena Soares, included foreignministers Diego Cordovez of Ecuador, Mario Palencia of Guatemala andSahadeo Basdeo of Trinidad-Tobago.</TEXT></DOC>
