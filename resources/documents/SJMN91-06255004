Demand for high-skilled labor was to increase as the service economyevolved.;   One possible outcome was a serious skills gap. Another was anupward push on wages, as employers competed for scarce human resources.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SLOW GROWTH IN INCOMES MEANS BLEAK OUTLOOK FOR '90S  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     It was laid out, along with other projections, in the well-known &quot;Workforce2000&quot; study published in 1987 by the Hudson Institute in Indianapolis for theDepartment of Labor.;   Workforce growth has indeed slowed -- from nearly 3percent annually through the '70s to 1.7 percent on average for the '80s and aprojected 1.3 percent for the rest of the '90s.;   But personal income growthhas slowed as well, leaving the country's hourly and salaried workers with ableak outlook for the remainder of the decade.;   &quot;We have in the '90s verylittle opportunity to raise our standard of living,&quot; said Audrey Freedman,labor expert with the Conference Board, a business-backed researchorganization.;   Most forecasters would agree with Freedman. But experts partcompany on what can be done about it. And recent controversy has centeredsquarely on &quot;Workforce 2000&quot; -- the report that has spawned numerous businessconferences and underpins the Bush administration's emphasis on educationreform.;   &quot; 'Workforce 2000' stimulated people to think about certain thingswhich I think were very appropriate. We're chagrined by what they left out,&quot;said Lawrence Mishel, director of research at the Washington-based EconomicPolicy Institute.;   The institute was so chagrined that it recently publishedits own adversary report, &quot;The Myth of the Coming Labor Shortage.&quot;;   &quot;Thelabor shortage view of the near future, in most respects, is either wrong ormisleading,&quot; Mishel and co-author Ruy Texiera say in the report.;   &quot;What Ithink is they want to get some press,&quot; counters Arnold Packer, co-author of&quot;Workforce 2000.&quot; Packer is currently executive director of the U.S. LaborDepartment's Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills.;   ButPacker agreed with the generally bleak outlook for real income gains duringthe remainder of the century.;   &quot;With business as usual, there will be noimprovement in real incomes for the majority,&quot; he said.;   &quot;Workforce 2000&quot;projected a continued shift from manufacturing to service employment.;   &quot;Thenew jobs in service industries will demand much higher skill levels than thejobs of today,&quot; the report said.;   At the same time that skill demands arerising, the U.S. workforce will grow more slowly. And it will become &quot;older,more female and more disadvantaged,&quot; the report said. The estimate in&quot;Workforce 2000&quot; that 15 percent of net workforce entrants from 1987 through2000 would be white males has been widely quoted.;   Critics such as Mishelsay that figure is misleading because it is a net figure. White males comprisethe majority of the workforce that is approaching retirement. As they retire,they are replaced by more white males. In fact, white males will be 32 percentof total workforce entrants, Mishel says.;   But the most salient piece of newinformation is what has happened to job formation since 1985.;   The evolvingservice economy hasn't produced many higher skilled, higher paying jobs, argueMishel and Texiera. Instead, real income has dropped for most of the U.S.workforce as higher paying manufacturing jobs have been replaced bylow-paying, low-skilled service jobs.;   &quot;The fact is there are good jobs andlousy jobs in service, and we have specialized in creating lousy ones,&quot; Mishelsaid.;   As a result, most Americans have suffered pay declines in real terms,he said. He cites an index for real compensation per hour, based on Bureau ofLabor Statistics data. The index was 104.4 in the fourth quarter of 1987. Itwas 100.1 for the fourth quarter of 1990, a four percent drop.;   The currentrecession and the overall lackluster performance of the U.S. economy affectedthe &quot;Workforce 2000&quot; forecasts, Packer said. But he adds that the report'srecommendations -- including better skills training and improved serviceproductivity -- haven't been acted on.;   &quot;We said, 'Here are three possiblepaths for the economy.' We then discussed primarily the middle path, whichwould have had real income growth and productivity growth. In fact, theeconomy even up until the recession was running between low and middle,&quot;Packer said.;   &quot;Achieving the middle involved that six recommendations befollowed, including a big improvement in the skills of the American workforce.Nobody has taken steps to do that,&quot; he said.;   The commission effort he headsattempts to enlist the federal government, educators, labor and business in ajoint training effort.;   But detractors at the Economic Policy Instituteargue that business itself is part of the problem. National policy should spurservice productivity growth and distribute the income pie more equitably, theysay.;   &quot;Employers who have access to low-wage workers are less likely to useinnovative ways of technology,&quot; Mishel said.;   He recommends raising theminimum wage and instituting a training tax on employers that is rebated ifthey train their existing workforces.;   The service sector would be moreproductive if work were restructured to give employees more responsibility,Mishel said.;   All sides in the debate agree on the need for workforcetraining, for more productive service industry and for speed.;   &quot;Frankly, Ithink I'll be in a debate with them (the Economic Policy Institute) in a monthor so,&quot; Packer said. He said he will ask: &quot;Given the choice of public policybetween improving the high schools or giving firms a subsidy for transformingtheir workplace, where would they spend the public money?&quot;;   The AFL-CIOrefers to real income declines in its Solidarity Day platform, which was theagenda for its recent protest march.;   The labor group wants tougher tradeprotection, job protection during strikes, national health care, and morefederal investment on education and public infrastructure.;   Audrey Freedmanwatches the debate from her vantage point as analyst for the Conference Board.She is pessimistic for the short term but relatively optimistic for the longerhaul.;   &quot;The real source of real wage gains for the whole economy isproductivity gain, and we're not doing so well there,&quot; she said.;   Americanfamilies made up for the slowdown in real earnings growth by putting more ofthe family to work -- but that response has limits.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DIANA KUNDE, Dallas Morning News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Dallas  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910911  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,059  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, September 11, 199100255004,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
