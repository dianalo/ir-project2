(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A company with ties to the Iran-Contrascandal and one of its former executives pleaded guilty Thursday tocharges of selling military equipment abroad without U.S.permission.   Fourway Industries Inc. of Woodbury, which manufactures militaryparts, pleaded guilty to two counts of a 27-count informationbefore U.S. District Judge Anne Thompson in Trenton.   Jacobo Farber, who sold his majority interest in the firm inOctober 1986, pleaded guilty to five counts of the information.   In addition, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said the company andthree employees were indicted in San Diego in an alleged conspiracyto divert weapons parts to Iran.   By pleading guilty to the New Jersey charges, Forway and Farbersaid that from May 1983 to April 1985, the corporation manufacturedand exported military equipment without registering as an exporterwith the State Department, Alito said.   Both also admitted violating federal law requiring peopleexporting military parts on a special U.S. Munitions List to obtainlicenses for each shipment of military parts, Alito said.   Forway Industries made headlines in March when it was learnedthat retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and his businesspartner, Albert Hakim, tried to buy one-third interest in thecompany in 1986 with funds allegedly skimmed from the sale ofAmerican weapons to Iran.   Secord and Hakim face federal charges they conspired to divertIranian arms sales profits to the Nicaraguan Contras. They wereindicted in March along with former national security adviser JohnM. Poindexter and former White House aide Lt. Col. Oliver North.   The bid fell through in November 1986 just as news of theIranian arms sale broke.   Forway Industries, which employees 80 people in two red brickbuildings near downtown Woodbury, manufactures and distributesmilitary spare parts.</TEXT></DOC>
