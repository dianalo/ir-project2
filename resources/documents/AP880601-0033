ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson says he does ``not foreseeconfrontation'' at the Democratic National Convention although heis considering challenges on a range of issues from platform planksto the status of ``super delegates.''   In an interview Tuesday, Jackson's convention manager said thecandidate expects to ``have a significant impact on the platformitself, not just some minority reports.''   Ron Brown, a Washington lawyer and party activist, said therewas ``great concern among Democrats over what Jesse's coreconstituency does in the general election.''   Black voters, who provided the base of Jackson's support inprimaries and caucuses, have voted overwhelmingly Democratic inrecent presidential elections. But there now is concern within theparty over whether those voters will turn out in large numbers ifthey believe Jackson was shortchanged at the party convention inJuly.   After meeting Sunday with black supporters, Massachusetts Gov.Michael Dukakis, the likely party presidential nominee, said: ``Idon't see any deep divisions, philosophically, ideologically, onthe issues. I don't see any of that. We're going to have as uniteda Democratic Party as we've ever had.''   Campaigning in New Jersey on Monday, Jackson said, ``I do notforesee confrontation. We can effectively negotiate on mutuallyrespectful terms.''   But he also held out the possibility of floor fights overplatform issues.   Brown said Jackson has ``become in effect the leader of theprogressive part of the Democratic Party'' and he added that theenthusiasm his supporters would show for a Dukakis candidacy woulddepend ``not only on what Jackson does and how he is treated but heis perceived to have been treated.''   Brown also said Jackson expects to play ``a strong role'' in theselection of the party's vice presidential nominee, although hedoes not anticipate having veto power over that choice.   When asked whether he would accept second place on a Dukakisticket, Jackson said, ``I've earned consideration.''   While saying he did not believe Jackson expected to have a vetopower over the vice presidential candidate, Brown said he thoughtselection of Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia ``would not be a greatsignal'' to Jackson supporters.   On the other hand, Brown said, Jackson ``has not indicated heexpects to have a blackball of any candidate _ that's not a viewI've heard expressed by him at all.''   By limiting their count to only elected committed delegates, theJackson campaign is arguing that Dukakis will not have a delegatemajority when the convention convenes in Atlanta in July.   ``We count `super delegates' as uncommitted until they casttheir vote on the ballot for president,'' said Brown. Superdelegates are party and elected officials who became automatic,uncommitted delegates outside the primary and caucus process.   The role of super delegates in choosing Democratic presidentialnominees will be one of the major issues raised by the Jacksonforces at the convention, Brown said.   ``We want to get the party to look at the general fairness orlack thereof of the process,'' he said.   ``There ought to be some nexus between the popular vote anddelegate strength,'' added Brown. ``Who said the purpose of superdelegates is to flock to the front-runner?''   Many of the 1988 super delegates have been flocking to Dukakis.   Even though Jackson finished first or second in 36 primaries andcaucuses this year, ``not a single governor, not a single senator,not a single state party chair _ with the exception of the Districtof Columbia _ has declared support for him,'' Brown said.   He said a Jackson challenge to the role of super delegates wouldbe more likely to apply to future conventions than the 1988gathering.</TEXT></DOC>
