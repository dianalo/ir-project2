(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A printing plant worker disabled by mentalillness was able to legally buy the AK-47 assault rifle he used tokill seven former co-workers without revealing his mental problems,authorities said Friday.   Police said Joseph T. Wesbecker was armed with severalsemiautomatic weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition Thursdaymorning as he went from floor to floor at the Standard Gravure Corp.   Wesbecker killed seven people and injured 13 before killinghimself. Three of the injured were in critical condition Friday.   Standard Gravure employees met with grief counselors when theyreturned to the plant Friday morning and several hundred laterattended a Mass at the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Assumption.   President Bush on Friday lamented the loss of life in therampage, but said he still opposes legislation to ban possession ofsuch weapons.   Bush in March banned the import of foreign-made assault riflesinto the United States, including the Chinese-made AK-47. Howeer,possession of the weapon is not a federal offense and Bush has takenno steps toward proposing curbs on U.S. manufacture of such weapons.   Wesbecker bought the AK-47 on May 1 at Tilford's Gun Sales inLouisville, said Police Chief Richard Dotson.   Gun shop owner Jack Tilford said Wesbecker answered all eightquestions properly on a federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms gun purchase form.   ``He passed all the tests and obligations for purchasingfirearms,'' Tilford said Friday.   One of the eight questions asked: ``Have you ever beenadjudicated mentally defective or have you ever been committed to amental institution?''   The form shows Wesbecker answered `no' to that question. Tilfordnoted that gun shop owners have no way to check the validity ofanswers to that question.   Lt. Jeff Moody, police homicide commander, has said thatWesbecker had spent time _ voluntarily _ in mental institutions,including Our Lady of Peace in Louisville. Police would not revealwhen he had been hospitalized.   Wesbecker, 47, was a pressman at the plant from 1971 until thecompany placed him on permanent disability leave last Feb. 2 becauseof mental illness, police said.   Relatives told police that Wesbecker was a manic depressive whohad attempted suicide three times.   Bill Curley, agent in charge of the Louisville ATF office, saidfederal law prohibits firearms purchases only by people who havebeen committed to a mental health facility under court order.   Moody said four other guns were found during a search ofWesbecker's home, as well as the Feb. 6 issue of Time magazineturned open to a detailed article on similar shootings across theUnited States in the past two years.   Bush, during a interview with out-of-town reporters, was askedabout Thursday's rampage.   ``It is terrible and the loss of human life is horrible. But Ihave seen no evidence that a law banning a specific weapon is goingto guard against it ...,'' he said. ``If you have somebody who isderanged, and I don't want to prejudice this poor soul, but if hewas deranged, I'm afraid you're going to have incidents like this.''   Standard Gravure officials hired 15 counselors to help workerswhen they returned to the plant Friday morning.   ``All of these people can be classified as victims,'' said MarkAhearn, vice president of development for Seven Counties Services.``We don't need people holding back their pain. Swallowing it won'tdo them any good.''   Standard Gravure President Michael Shea said almost 90 percent ofthe company's 360 employees were counseled in offices that had beencleaned up overnight. Bullet holes in walls and ceilings were theonly physical reminders of the tragedy.   ``Until it strikes home like it has for us, you don't realize howtraumatic something like this can be,'' Shea said. ``I'm pleased tosay that, so far, the counseling has gone very well.''   Pressman Tom Noonan said the workers were split up into groups,with some receiving one-on-one counseling.   ``You just vented your feelings,'' Noonan said.   Outside the three-story building, some workers talked toreporters.   ``I'm thinking seriously about looking somewhere else for anotherjob. My nerves are shot,'' said pressman Steve Pate. ``If I go backin there, I'll be waiting for someone else to do the same thing andI can't handle that.''   Forklift operator Bernard Williams said he was going to take aweek's vacation.   ``I'm not ready to come back because of everything that'shappened. Things like this could happen again,'' Williams said. ``Ijust don't feel like I can go in there and work.   ``There are a lot of workers who have been traumatized by this.It's a shame that management treats people like dogs. They shouldtreat employees like human beings instead of just a number.''   Shea refused to comment on complaints about working conditionsand specifics on improved security measures being implemented at theplant. He said full production would resume Monday.   He also would not disclose Wesbecker's weekly disability pay orwhether those payments were about to be stopped by the company, aclaim co-workers have made in trying to explain the reasons forWesbecker's rampage.   Many of the workers joined several of the victims' families at anhourlong Mass conducted by Archbishop Thomas Kelly. They hugged andwiped away tears during the service, which was also attended byMayor Jerry Abramson and other local, state and federal officials.   ``All of us gather in deep, profound sorrow. We come together topray for those who are suffering pain and grief,'' Kelly said duringthe service attended by about 300 people.   Three of the wounded were in critical condition Friday at HumanaHospital-University of Louisville, including one man shot in thechest and leg who was back in surgery Friday afternoon.   The bloodshed started in the plant's executive offices on thethird floor, moved down to the basement, then up to the first floor.   Wesbecker reportedly had made threats against the company, whichprints newspaper inserts and Sunday newspaper supplements, but Sheasaid he did not know of any threats.   Wesbecker's weapons included the AK-47, two MAC-11 semiautomaticmachine pistols, a .38-caliber handgun, a 9mm automatic pistol and abayonet, said Dotson. Wesbecker carried a duffel bag full ofammunition.   The two MAC-11s were purchased in February, also at Tilford's.   Wesbecker was divorced twice in the last 11 years. He and hisfirst wife had two sons, 22 and 26. Wesbecker and his second wife,Brenda, were also divorced, but they had been living together since1987, Moody said.</TEXT></DOC>
