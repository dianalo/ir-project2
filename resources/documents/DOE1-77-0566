It is postulated that new approaches toforest energy development that provide for a more interactive relationshipbetween R and D establishments and technology users will have greatersuccess in bringing about innovations in this sector. The experienceof charcoal production, charcoal stove, and forestry development underthe Sudan Renewable Energy Project, demonstrates the positive resultsof just this sort of interactive innovation strategy. The SREP, in itsa priori commitment to user participation, uncovers valuable resourcesof indigenous technical knowledge and skills, which play an integralpart in the design and dissemination of these forest energy technologies.The project's success provides an empirical justification of the importanceof technology users to the innovation process.</TEXT></DOC>
