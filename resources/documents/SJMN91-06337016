RAPE TRIAL  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Circuit Judge Mary Lupo welcomed the remaining 37-member jury pool, whichboth sides were ready to cut to six jurors and three alternates.;   At theoutset, the selection was delayed when Lupo told a potential juror she hadreceived information about his &quot;extra-curricular activities involvingbetting.&quot; At the man's request, he was questioned privately about thereports.;   Lupo also was considering final motions, including a crucialdecision on whether prosecutors may call as witnesses three women who claimSmith attacked them in the 1980s.;   If allowed to testify, their storiescould lend credence to the claim of Smith's 30-year-old accuser that he rapedher March 30.;   Smith, a 31-year-old medical school graduate and nephew ofSen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., could get up to 4 1/2 years in prison ifconvicted.;   Prosecutors argue that Smith's alleged victim thought she wassafe leaving a bar late at night with a member of America's most famousfamily.;   Defense attorneys say the woman, whom they depict as mentallyunstable, consented to sex, then cried rape in a bid for vengeance andattention.;   Prosecutor Moira Lasch disclosed July 22 that the three womenhad come forward with allegations against Smith. Under Florida law, suchevidence is admissible if it shows a specific pattern of behavior by thedefendant.;   One of the women, a medical student, alleged Smith raped her athis Washington apartment in 1988, while she was drunk. Another, now a doctor,said she talked Smith out of attacking her at his home in 1988. The third, aformer girlfriend of Smith's cousin Matthew &quot;Max&quot; Kennedy, said she fought offSmith at his parents' home in New York in 1983.;   Under the law, suchevidence cannot be used to prove a defendant is of &quot;bad character orpropensity.&quot; Court rulings also say judges shouldn't allow such evidence if itis likely to inflame the jury and become the major feature of the trial.;  Cable's Courtroom Television Network planned gavel-to-gavel coverage of thetrial and CNN planned extensive live coverage.;   Both said their livecoverage actually would be delayed for several seconds on tape to allow themto delete the woman's name if it's mentioned in court and to alter herfeatures electronically when she testifies.;   ABC, CBS and NBC said theywould report on the trial in their regular newscasts.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  West Palm Beach, Fla.  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911202  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  471  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, December 2, 199100337016,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
