In the confusion, some of them jumped into a U.N. jeep at thecurb and ordered the bewildered driver: ``Follow that caravan!''   When the string of vehicles screeched to a halt at the nextstation and the observers again jumped out, the U.N. driver peeledoff and returned to his employers, hoping they hadn't missed him.   ``There are so many observers in this little country, you findthem in the soup,'' said a Latin American diplomatic source whorequested anonymity. ``But that is good. We'd rather have too manythan too few.''   Foreign observers are swarming all over Nicaragua in suchprofusion that the Foreign Ministry felt compelled to call a newsconference to explain who is doing what.   There are observers for the electoral process leading to generalelections Feb. 25; observers to make sure the anti-Sandinistarebels known as Contras disband; observers to a regional accord notto arm guerrillas; and self-appointed observers of foreigncontributions to political parties.   A 625-member force approved by the U.N. Security Council is thelatest addition to the battalions of observers in Central America.They are to verify that Contras don't slip across the border fromHonduras into Nicaragua.   ``Observing elections has become an industry,'' said Britishgovernment observer David Browning of Oxford University. ``Butwho's observing the observers?''   There are observer teams from the OAS, the United Nations, jointcommissions from both organizations, the European Parliament,former President Jimmy Carter, one U.S. government foundation andone private U.S. foundation.   Apart from that, there are individuals and groups representingthe political spectrum descending on Nicaragua in droves. U.S.congressmen come down singly or in clusters.   ``It seems like we get one every weekend,'' said a Westerndiplomatic source. ``I don't know the last time we had a fullweekend off.''   OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares headed hisorganization's mission to observe the first Sunday of registration,Oct. 1. He and his retinue visited 35 voter registration stationsin five communities within 12 hours.   The confusion over the jeeps happened at one of those stations.   In Nicaragua's severely depressed economy, observers are goodbusiness. They need housing, food, transportation. They need officespace, drivers and secretaries.   Housing in the Managua area, the center of operations for allthese groups, is scarce. The laws of demand and supply take over.   Property rental agents are delighted. But the observer staffmembers are not.   ``I was shown the same house three times in one day, by threedifferent agents,'' said a U.N. observer. ``Every time the (rental)price was different _ each time it was higher.''   The observers' first job was to watch over voter registrationduring the first four Sundays in October. It ended Oct. 22. TheUnited Nations and the OAS released reports calling theregistration process largely free and fair.   Now their job is to keep watch over the campaigning and ensureevery one of the 21 legally registered parties in Nicaragua has achance to spread its message freely.</TEXT></DOC>
