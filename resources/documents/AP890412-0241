Ueberroth's deal to buystrikebound Eastern Airlines from Texas Air Corp. remained in doubtwhen a Tuesday midnight deadline passed without a final agreement.   Ueberroth met with Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo at U.S.Bankruptcy Court Tuesday evening. At 9:15 p.m., the meeting brokeup and the two hastily walked out of the courthouse. Ueberroth saidhe did not know what would happen next.   Lawyers for Eastern's unions remained until 11:30 p.m., whenJudge Burton R. Lifland told them to return to his chambers for aconference at 8:30 a.m. Wednesday. Ueberroth's agreement to buyEastern from Lorenzo expired at 12:01 a.m. under an agreementbetween the two sides.   Asked about the midnight deadline, Lifland said: ``It's not mydeadline. There was an earlier deadline for certain things that Isaid, and it was met.'' He declined further comment.   The Machinist union members, pilots and flight attendantsreached five-year contracts with Ueberroth on Monday. But the theagreements are contingent on a trustee operating the airline untilit comes out of bankruptcy, the negotiators said.   Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection on March 9, five daysafter the strike by Machinist union members began. The pilots andflight attendants honored the Machinist picket lines, crippling theairline. Jack Bavis, head of the Eastern pilots, said the unions'would not go back to work with Lorenzo in interim control.   ``They're not going to do it for the guy they hate the most,''he said. ``They'll do it for Peter. If he's there, we're there.''   Several lawyers involved said they expected that if a trustee isnamed, it would be former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, who waspresent for the meeting on Monday. Carlucci declined to identifyhis role then and was not present Tuesday.   Lorenzo, according to several sources, refused to go along withappointing a trustee, throwing the whole deal into doubt.   ``They went ballistic,'' a source said Tuesday, describingLorenzo's lawyers' reaction.   By the end of the night, no one was knew what would happen next.   ``I don't think any one person has the whole picture,'' saidJames L. Linsey, a lawyer for the pilots.   The day began with the parties meeting at a Manahattan hotel andas the day wore on, the lawyers and principals return to court, thesite of Monday's talks.   Ueberroth and his partner, J. Thomas Talbot, arrived in lateafternoon, Lorenzo in the early evening.   Dozen of lawyers filled the marble hallways of theturn-of-the-century courthouse as a series of meeting againunfolded. Tension built and at several times shouting could beoverheard in the halls.   The climactic meeting ended at 9:15 p.m. Ueberroth, Talbot,Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes were together in a roomacross from Lifland's chambers. When they emerged, they put ontheir coats to leave but Lifland summoned them.   Lorenzo entered the judge's chambers but Ueberroth did not, andwhen an aide of the judge asked Ueberroth to join, the formerbaseball commissioner said ``I'm not going in,'' and waved his handthrough the air in resignation.   Lorenzo and his lawyers then walked out. Ueberroth held aprivate discussion with Talbot and their lawyers, and thenUeberrroth's side walked out.   ``I'm not optimistic,'' Ueberroth said in an elevator as he left.   The participants described the meetings as a four-way gamebetween Ueberroth, Lorzeno, the unions and Eastern's creditors. Forthe deal to work, all four sides had to be in agreement.   ``Unless you have all of these constituencies, you don't have aplan,'' said David Boies, an Eastern lawyer.   Under their five-year deals with Ueberroth, the three Easternunions get 30 percent ownership of the airline in exchange forabout $210 million in concessions.   But the creditors committee is concerned with the deal. JoelZweibel, an lawyer for the committee representing the unsecuredcreditors, said the group wanted its financial advisers to reviewit.   ``We have some very serious reservations ... no one has made aneffort to make a showing that Eastern will be viable after thistransaction is consummated,'' Zweibel said.   One condition of the proposed buyout that has raised concern isthe transfer of $79 million in Eastern assets to Texas Air,``without equivalent value to Eastern from Texas Air,'' thecommittee said in a resoltuion passed Tuesday and given to theparties.   The committee also said it was concerned whether there was aneconomically viable business plan for the reorganized Eastern andover the financial structure of the buyout, in which Texas Airwould receive $200 million for its Eastern stock and Eastern wouldincur $100 million in new debt.   Zweibel said the creditors had not received a response fromLifland to their statement.   When asked whether the creditors were open to renegotiating thetentative agreement between Ueberroth and Texas Air, he said,``Anything can be renegotiated.''   Meanwhile, a federal judge in Miami said late Tuesday he wouldmake public his opinion Wednesday at 8`55 a.m. EST whetherEastern's pilots are striking illegally.   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month asked U.S.District Judge Edward B. Davis to issue an opinion on whetherEastern's pilots walked off the job in support of strikingMachinists or whether the pilots were actually striking to furthertheir own contract aims.   If Davis finds the pilots in violation of the Railway Labor Act,the appeals court could order the pilots back to work. Such aruling could have a major influence on whether Texas Air agrees tosell Eastern.   Also, Martin Shugrue, a former president of Texas Air'sContinental Airlines, has been hired as a consultant by Ueberroth,said a participant in the discussions. The source said Shugrue mayplay a major role in running Eastern should Ueberroth succeed withhis bid.   Under Ueberroth's agreement with the unions, the Machinistsunion would give up about $150 million in wage and benefit cuts, aunion source said Tuesday. The figures are smaller for other unionsbecause after Lorenzo bought Eastern three years ago, the pilotsand flight attendants accepted pay cuts but the Machinists did not.</TEXT></DOC>
