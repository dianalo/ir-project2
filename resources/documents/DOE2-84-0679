As world energyawareness intensified during the 1970's, the DOE was created and becamethe agency responsible for the majority of U.S. international energyactivities. Within the DOE, the Office of Fossil Energy is the principalcoordinator of fossil energy international activities which include notonly coal programs, but also oil, gas and shale R and D. In this paper,several case examples, are presented showing just how the U.S. benefitsfrom international R and D collaboration projects and emphasizing theincreasing contribution of this program to both the U.S. economy andenergy security. U.S. energy policy encourages effective internationalcollaboration in Ra and D focusing on opportunities to enhance the competitivenessof U.S. technology and industry and to improve long-term national energysecurity. Furthermore, the U.S. government is actively encouraging thelong-term reduction of U.S. and international dependence on oil by supportingresearch which could lead to the development and substitution of otherenergy forms.</TEXT></DOC>
