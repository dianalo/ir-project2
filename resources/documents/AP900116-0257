LOUIS, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Trans World Airlines Inc. has sold 11jumbo jets for $210 million to two leasing companies in an effortto raise cash and reduce its large debt, company officials saidTuesday.   It's the second time in less than a month that the airline hasannounced the sale of assets. On Dec. 18, TWA said it planned tosell its Chicago-London route and related assets to AmericanAirlines for $195 million. That deal must be approved by thefederal government.   The news has angered many employees who believe TWA owner CarlIcahn is slowly dismantling the airline, which is $2.7 billion indebt and lags behind other major carriers in capital investment.   But industry analysts say selling airplanes and leasing themback from the leasing companies is quite common.   ``Most airlines are doing it to raise cash and take advantage ofhigh values for aircraft right now,'' said Paul Turk, an analystwith Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting firm in Arlington, Va.   But with only 74 of its 213 aircraft owned outright, TWA has oneof the lowest ownership percentages in the industry, Turk said.   TWA spokesman Don Morrison said the airline will use half of the$210 million from the sale of eight Lockheed L1011s and threeBoeing 747s to boost its cash reserves to nearly $1 billion.   The airline will use the other half of the proceeds to trim its$2.7 billion in long-term debt, Morrison said.   TWA sold the eight Lockheed jets to Potomac Leasing Inc. It soldthe Boeing jets to a unit of American Express Co.   Icahn has assured employees, in a letter last month, that hedoes not intend to dismantle TWA.</TEXT></DOC>
