These had inserts of {approx} 2 kilobases({lambda}-S-1.2 and {lambda}-S-1.3) and both were both homologous witha previously isolated clone ({lambda}-S-1.1) for mature SAP-1. The authorsreport here the nucleotide sequence of the longer two EcoRI fragmentsof S-1.2 and S-1.3 that were not the same and the derived amino acidsequences of mature SAP-1 and its prepro form. The open reading frameencodes 19 amino acids, which are colinear with the amino-terminal sequenceof mature SAP-1, and extends far beyond the predicted carboxyl terminusof mature SAP-1, indicating extensive carboxyl-terminal processing. Thenucleotide sequence of cDNA encoding prepro-SAP-1 includes 1449 basesfrom the assigned initiation codon ATG at base-pair 472 to the stop codonTGA at base-pair 1921. The first 23 amino acids coded after the initiationATG are characteristic of a signal peptide. The calculated molecularmass for a polypeptide encoded by 1449 bases is {approx} 53 kDa, in keepingwith the reported value for pro-SAP-1. The data indicate that after removalof the signal peptide mature SAP-1 is generated by removing an additional7 amino acids from the amino terminus and {approx} 373 amino acids fromthe carboxyl terminus. One potential glycosylation site was previouslyfound in mature SAP-1. Three additional potential glycosylation sitesare present in the processed carboxyl-terminal polypeptide, which theydesignate as P-2.</TEXT></DOC>
