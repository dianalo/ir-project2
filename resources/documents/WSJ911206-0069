But since August 1990, the Palestinian-born Chicagoinvestor has attended three White House meetings withPresident Bush to discuss Middle East policy.   Mr. Othman's political access coincides with theremarkable ascendance of a little Texas oil company on whoseboard he serves alongside George W. Bush, the president'soldest son. That company, Harken Energy Corp. -- though ithad never drilled a single well overseas or in water --recently won the rights to drill potentially lucrativeoffshore wildcat wells in a contract bestowed by thegovernment of Bahrain.</LP><TEXT>   When the Harken deal was announced in January 1990, itattracted only perfunctory notice. More recently, a number ofpublications have written about the case, raising questionsabout whether Bahrain might have chosen Harken in partbecause a presidential son sat on its board.   Now, George W. Bush is emerging as a principal adviser tohis father. He was a lead player in the campaign to oustWhite House Chief of Staff John Sununu, and was cited by hisfather yesterday as among those who will play &quot;key roles inthe reelection effort.&quot; Thus, the issues surrounding theHarken deal take on fresh importance.   The White House says there is nothing questionable in thisstory of petroleum, politics and the presidential son. &quot;Thereis no conflict of interest, or even the appearance ofconflict, in these business arrangements,&quot; says spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater. The matters had been reviewed anddisclosed, he said, adding, &quot;They are legitimate businessundertakings.&quot;   Indeed, an investigation by this paper has not revealedevidence of wrongdoing or influence-peddling by George W.Bush or anyone else connected to Harken. Yet what does emergeis a complex pattern of personal and financial relationshipsbehind Harken's sudden good fortune in the Middle East,raising the question of whether Bahrainis or others in theMiddle East may have hoped to ingratiate themselves with theWhite House. Even more intriguing, there are numerous linksamong Harken, Bahrain and individuals close to thediscredited Bank of Credit andamp; Commerce International, abanking empire that used Mideast oil money to seek ties topolitical leaders in several countries.   The mosaic of BCCI connections surrounding Harken Energymay prove nothing more than how ubiquitous the rogue bank'sties were. But the number of BCCI-connected people who haddealings with Harken -- all since George W. Bush came onboard -- likewise raises the question of whether they mask aneffort to cozy up to a presi- dential son.   Among those relationships:   -- Sheik Khalifah bin-Salman al-Khalifah, the primeminister of Bahrain and a brother of the country's rulingemir, is identified on an October 1990 shareholder list asone of the 45 investors who own parent company BCCI Holdings(Luxembourg) S.A. The emir played a role in approving theHarken transaction.   -- Sheik Abdullah Bakhsh, a major Harken shareholderrepresented by Mr. Othman on the company's board, has been aco-investor in Saudi Arabia with alleged BCCI front manGhaith Pharaon, and used Khalid bin-Mahfouz, until recently aprincipal BCCI shareholder, as his banker.   -- Harken's investment bankers helped BCCI gain itsfoothold in U.S. banking, and they also arranged for a Swissbank to help rescue Harken from its debt woes in 1987 -- aSwiss bank that was at the time a joint-venture partner withBCCI.   -- Harken's consultant on the Bahrain deal counts KamalAdham, a principal owner of BCCI, as a close friend and hashad a long acquaintance with BCCI's Mr. Pharaon.   As a candidate and later in the White House, PresidentBush vowed to avoid even the appearance of any conflicts ofinterest in his administration. He instructed Secretary ofState James Baker to cable all U.S. embassies to warn againstthe appearance of preferential treatment for Bush familyinvestments overseas. The president has also moved todistance himself from the BCCI scandal, denouncing a formeraide who recently went to work as a lawyer for BCCI's Mr.Adham, and who resigned in the ensuing furor.   George W. Bush, a managing partner of the Texas Rangersbaseball team, declined to be interviewed. He did providebrief responses to written questions through an intermediary.Asked whether his involvement with the Dallas energy companylent it added credibility in the Arab world, he said to &quot;askthe Bahrainis.&quot;   Every individual involved denies any influence peddling.Mr. Othman, George W. Bush and people involved in setting upthe White House meetings on the Mideast say the president'sson had nothing to do with Mr. Othman's being included amongthe Arab-Americans invited. &quot;Not by any stretch of theimagination,&quot; Mr. Othman says.   And Harken investor Mr. Bakhsh rejects any suggestion thathis links, past and present, to Messrs. Pharaon andbinMahfouz mean he is in any way associated with BCCI. Hesays through his New York lawyer that he bought Harken stock(in 1987) because it looked like a good investment in adepressed industry.   Harken officials say they resent any suggestion theircompany somehow has ties to BCCI. They dismiss thecircumstantial links to it as purely random and say they wereshocked to learn of them. And, in fact, BCCI has proved adeptat insinuating itself into centers of influence without theknowledge of those occupying the seats of power.   Harken says it won the Bahrain drilling deal purely onmerit, through painstaking geological research and deftnegotiating. It says Mr. Bush played no role in clinching thedeal.   As for Bahrain, it says it chose tiny Harken partlybecause it didn't believe a large company would be so fullycommitted to the project. Other Harken officials, whiledenying that the Bush name played any specific role,acknowledge that having him on their board is an asset.&quot;You'd have to be an idiot not to say it's impressive,&quot; saysAlan Quasha, former Harken chairman and its second-largestshareholder. (The largest, with 24.5%, is a HarvardUniversity investment fund.)   Mr. Bush's affiliation with Harken came at the end of afailed attempt to follow in the footsteps of his father. Likehim, George W. launched a career in the oil business inMidland, Texas, and like his father he chose a Spanish namefor it: Arbusto Energy Inc. &quot;Arbusto&quot; is Spanish for &quot;bush&quot;;the president's company was Zapata Petroleum Co.   Among George W.'s investors was James R. Bath, a Houstonaircraft broker who had a flourishing aviation business withsheiks of the Saudi peninsula. Mr. Bath owned a piece of aHouston bank in which Mr. Pharaon, the BCCI front man, hadbeen a controlling shareholder.   Mr. Bath also invested money in the U.S. for Mr.bin-Mahfouz, the Saudi banker who would go on to become aleading shareholder in BCCI. According to Mr. Bath's personalfinancial statements, produced in unrelated litigation, Mr.Bath invested $50,000 with George W. Bush, becoming a 5%partner in Arbusto. Mr. Bush says he was aware Mr. Bath wasrepresenting Saudi investors but that at the time &quot;had neverheard of BCCI.&quot;   In the oil-patch depression of the mid1980s, Mr. Bush'scompany merged with another concern, becoming Spectrum 7Energy Corp. But its fortunes didn't improve. &quot;We lost a lotof money in the oil business,&quot; says Philip Uzielli, adirector of Spectrum 7 and friend of Mr. Bush. &quot;We had a lotof dry wells. . . . Things were terrible. It was dreadful.&quot;   Finding a buyer wasn't easy. But in September 1986, HarkenEnergy swapped some of its own shares for the shares ofSpectrum 7. Mr. Bush's cut was worth roughly $600,000.&quot;Getting Harken stock at that point turned out to be verygood,&quot; Mr. Uzielli recalls. In addition to becoming a Harkenstockholder, Mr. Bush became a director and a consultant at$120,000 a year, later reduced to $50,000. (In mid-1990, Mr.Bush sold two-thirds of his Harken holdings at a significantprofit; his remaining stake could still be worth millions ifHarken hits a gusher in Bahrain.)   What looked like a dull investment soon looked brighter.The company needed a cash infusion, and Mr. Bush, whoseconsulting contract listed &quot;equity placements&quot; among hisduties, was there when Harken officials got together withLittle Rock's Stephens Inc., one of the largest U.S.investment banks outside of Wall Street.   He needed no introduction to Jackson Stephens, havingknown him since the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign. Mr. Stephens'swife, Mary Anne, would soon become Arkansas co-chairman ofthe Bush for President campaign, while Mr. Stephens woulddonate $100,000 to Team 100, a GOP group that collected moneyfor the campaign. Stephens Inc. kicked in another $100,000 tothe Bush dinner committee last May.   But on that spring day in Little Rock, cash for Harken wasthe topic. Ultimately, Stephens put a rescue plan in motion:Union Bank of Switzerland, which ordinarily didn't invest insmall U.S. firms, would make an exception, giving Harken $25million in exchange for a stock interest.   At the time, UBS was a joint-venture partner with BCCI ina Geneva-based bank. And although Harken officials, includingMessrs. Bush and Quasha, say they were unaware of it, Mr.Stephens was also well acquainted with BCCI. In fact, hesuggested to BCCI in the late 1970s that it try to take overwhat is now Washington, D.C.'s biggest bank company, FirstAmerican Bankshares Inc., according to court records producedin connection with the takeover attempt. Mr. Stephens wasamong the defendants in that suit, aimed at preventing aFirst American takeover by BCCI founder Agha Hasan Abedi,BCCI principal Kamal Adham and Abdullah Darwaish, chieffinancier for the royal family of Abu Dhabi. Mr. Stephensdeclined to be interviewed for this article.   The Harken financing Stephens was arranging hit alast-minute snag. To comply with U.S. banking laws, the dealassumed a complex new structure, and UBS decided to unloadits shares to a third party at the first chance, according toMr. Quasha. UBS says it planned to sell the shares all along.In any case, Stephens brought in a new patron: a real-estatemagnate from Jedda, Saudi Arabia, who bought most of UnionBank's Harken shares. He was Abdullah Bakhsh.   Mr. Bakhsh for several years was chairman of Saudi FinanceCo., a Luxembourg-based holding company for Swiss and Frenchfinancial enterprises. He sold his interest in 1983. Whobought it isn't clear, but corporation records in Geneva showthat by 1989 it had come partly under the control of theGokal family, Pakistani shipping magnates who were early BCCIshareholders and who, according to BCCI's auditors, havefailed to service more than $700 million of borrowings fromBCCI.   Mr. Bakhsh has had business dealings with some of the mostprominent people in Saudi Arabia, including, according to afriend, former Saudi oil minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani andcurrent oil minister Hisham Nazer. One of his co-investors inthe U.S. says he believes the sheik has also invested withmembers of the Saudi royal family.   But Mr. Bush, Mr. Quasha and other Harken officialsevidently knew little about their new partner. Mr. Quasha dida background check and says he found that Mr. Bakhsh was avery private person of great integrity who had alreadyreceived regulatory approval for other U.S. investments.   Mr. Bakhsh, though listed as Harken's third largeststockholder with a 17.6% stake, has met with companyofficials on only a few occasions, and George W. Bush saysthrough his intermediary he has never spoken to him. Instead,Harken officials deal with him through Mr. Othman, who sitson the Harken board.   In the wake of the company's new Persian Gulf backing camea much bigger Gulf breakthrough. It might be called the DreamDeal.   Bahrain, a small emirate with strong ties to Saudi Arabia,hadn't made a significant new oil find since 1932. Buthigh-tech seismic surveys detailed a large geologicalformation under the sea, between two of the greatest oil andgas fields on the planet. The company picked to drillexploratory wells would have to put up a lot of cash -- $12.7million just for the first of several wells. But it would geta lucrative share of any oil found. The payoff could total inthe billions.   Amoco, vitally interested, started negotiating with theBahrainis in 1987. (Three other companies also entered intotalks, according to Bahrain, which didn't identify them.) Asnegotiations advanced, Amoco grew hopeful of a contract.Then, in January 1990, it heard startling news: The contracthad just been awarded to tiny Harken. &quot;We were disappointed,&quot;says Patricia Wright, an Amoco spokesman. &quot;We thought wemight get this one.&quot;   Why did Harken get it instead? &quot;It was not some sort offix,&quot; says Mr. Quasha, the former Harken chairman.   Harken says George W. Bush didn't play any role inclinching the deal, and even expressed doubts that Harken hadthe financial resources for it. Mr. Quasha also points outthat all the connections in the world won't help Harken findoil in Bahrain, which the Bahrainis know as well as anyone.&quot;I don't see where they gain from dealing with a relative ofGeorge Bush's who futzes up.&quot;   Bahrain says the Bush connection couldn't have been afactor. &quot;We were not aware when Harken was chosen of anyprominent American or Arab who was connected with thecompany,&quot; says Bahrain's oil minister, Yousuf Shirawi.   However, Monte Swetnam, Harken's exploration chief, says,&quot;I'm sure they were aware&quot; of Mr. Bush's involvement with thecompany. &quot;I talked about our exploration advisory board andour board of directors. George's name comes up twice. Itwasn't a secret.&quot;   So, then, why Harken?   Harken officials, in extensive interviews, maintain thatBahrain wanted a small company that would devote fullattention to the project, a point Bahraini Oil MinisterShirawi confirms. To find one, he turned to a longtimefriend, Michael Ameen, a Houston oil consultant who hadworked in the Mideast for Mobil Corp. and Arabian AmericanOil Co. (Aramco).   Mr. Ameen represents yet another BCCI notation in theHarken story. As the head of government relations for Aramco,he says he had close-up dealings for years with the Saudiroyal family and its advisers, including Mr. Adham, the BCCIprincipal, who is also a former Saudi intelligence chief. Mr.Ameen was close enough to the Pharaon family that he recallsmeeting a young Ghaith on his graduation from college.   Mr. Ameen had been a friend for 25 years of Mr. Bakhsh,the large Harken shareholder. But he says that when facedwith having to recommend to Bahrain one small oil company outof the hundreds to choose from, he chose Harken out of pureserendipity. Within 10 minutes of discussing the matter byphone with Bahrain's oil minister, Mr. Ameen says, he got acall from one of Harken's investment bankers at Stephens inLittle Rock.   Before long, Mr. Ameen was leading Harken delegations toLondon and Bahrain, where, according to the company, Harkenofficials displayed keen knowledge of the region's geologyand disarmed the Bahrainis with their open negotiating style.   In the midst of Harken's talks with Bahrain, Mr. Ameen --simultaneously working as a State Department consultant --briefed the incoming U.S. ambassador to Bahrain, CharlesHostler. Mr. Ameen ultimately received a fee of about$100,000 from Harken.   Ambassador Hostler, a San Diego real-estate investor whois a $100,000 Republican contributor, says through an embassyofficial that he never discussed the Harken deal withauthorities in Bahrain. Harken officials say they met withhim only after their contract was secured. Mr. Hostler doessay that he has long known, and from time to time givenfinancial counsel to, Mohammad Hammoud, who was described inrecent Senate testimony as a &quot;flexible front for BCCI.&quot; Mr.Hammoud is also listed as a significant BCCI shareholder.   Once negotiated, the Harken contract was reviewed andapproved by several Bahraini officials, including, lastly,Sheik Isa bin-Sulman al-Khalifah, the ruling emir. Hisyounger brother, Prime Minister Sheik Khalifah bin-Sulmanal-Khalifah, appears in BCCI records as a shareholder, alongwith Mr. Adham, several members of Persian Gulf royalty, andothers.   &quot;His highness the emir has no personal opinions&quot; aboutHarken or anyone else associated with the transaction, saysMr. Shirawi, the oil minister. &quot;There is a possibility he's ashareholder, but we never heard of it,&quot; a Bahrain embassyspokesman says. If the prime minister does have BCCIholdings, the spokesman points out, the shareholding isn'tlarge.   The drilling deal went through even though Harken admittedit couldn't begin to finance the exploration on its own.Bahrain agreed to let Harken bring in a partner. It was thehottest ticket in town; two dozen oil companies expressedinterest in coming into the deal. Harken chose BassEnterprises Production Co. of Fort Worth, Texas, a companycontrolled the politically active billionaire Bass family.Members of the Bass family have contributed more than$200,000 to the GOP in recent years. A Bass company officialdeclines comment.   At the signing ceremony in January 1990, a celebratorydelegation from Harken traveled to Bahrain, including Mr.Quasha, Mr. Othman and another Harken executive. The firstwell broke ground last month and is scheduled for completionby the end of January.   Within six months Mr. Othman saw his political status, aswell as his company's position, enhanced. His name was addedby the White House to a select list of 15 Arab-Americanschosen to meet with President Bush, Mr. Sununu and NationalSecurity Adviser Brent Scowcroft in the White House two daysafter Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.   Mr. Othman and others involved in setting up the WhiteHouse meeting say his three invitations are explained by hismembership in the Arab-American Council on the Middle East, agroup of business and political leaders who are close toousted Chief of Staff Sununu. &quot;Talat was recommended to us bymany people in the Arab-American community,&quot; says oneadministration official. Mr. Othman was most recently presentat a White House gathering last month of President Bush andArab-American leaders.   &quot;George W. Bush has nothing to do with it,&quot; Mr. Othmansays of the White House meetings. &quot;This is an invitation fromthe White House.&quot;   ---               Who's Who in the Harken Deal                                                                                                          AT HARKEN                                                                                                          ABDULLAH TAHA BAKHSH -- A Saudi investor who controlsabout 17% of HArken's stock, he has extensive businessinterests in Saudi Arabia and the U.S.                                                                                                          GEORGE W.
