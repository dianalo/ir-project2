The industrywas perceived to have good potential for energy conservation. However,only a low percentage of firms were reporting to the task force involved.It was felt a study of this situtation would disclose the reasons forthe reluctance of the processors to involve themselves in energy conservationand would present the opportunity to estimate the potential energy savingsfor the future. The survey showed two main causes for this reluctance.Most small or medium size firms perceive that a program would take toomuch time and would require too great a capital investment. Those firmswhich have tried a program seriously have found this not to be the case.Estimates show that about 3/4 of the potential savings of 25%, on anannual basis for 1984, comes from procedural methods, or by capital expenditurewith less than two years pay-back. The other aspect that arises is therelatively low percentage cost of energy compared to other manufacturingcosts involved in plastic processing. Information on conservation techniquesincluding new energy efficient designs and methods, is presented. Thefinal estimate of possible energy conservation in the industry amountsto nearly 4 million GJ for 1984. This report also develops a guide toassist processors in developing energy saving programs. This is a simple,inexpensive approach relevant to the size of the majority of processorsin Canada. A number of technical article reprints are included for easyreference. These deal with the new energy efficient machines and theyalso outline, in detail, methods of conservation that processors canuse in their operations. 9 figs., 14 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
