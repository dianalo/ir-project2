(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart says histelevision ministry will end this month unless he receives an influxof donations to overcome ``pornographers'' who are trying to knockhim off the air.   ``If for whatever reason this week, you close the door in my faceor you pass me by, ... Feb. 26 will be the final telecast for thisministry,'' Swaggart said in his taped television programdistributed for broadcast this past weekend.   ``It's either the pornographers or us. They will have their wayand eliminate Jimmy Swaggart from television. That's what theywanted to do,'' Swaggart said.   Swaggart did not give any figures of how much money he needed. Aguard who answered the phone Sunday said he could not contactSwaggart, and a message left at his office this morning seekingfurther comment was not immediately returned.   In the latest edition of Penthouse magazine, a New Orleansstripper said she performed sex acts for Swaggart while he watched.The allegations leveled by Catherine Mary Kampen, strongly denied bySwaggart, were similar to those of Debra Murphree, a New Orleansprostitute, that led to Swaggart's ouster last year from theAssemblies of God.   In a tearful confession to his congregation last February,Swaggart said he had sinned, but did not reveal specifics. He wasdefrocked by the Assemblies after refusing to stay away from thepulpit for at least one year.   Swaggart has not released any hard figures on the ministry'sfinancial problems. However, in the past year there have beenlayoffs at the ministries, cancellation of his weekly televisionshow by three major cable networks, and an exodus of students fromJimmy Swaggart Bible College, which many faculty members left toavoid being defrocked with Swaggart.</TEXT></DOC>
