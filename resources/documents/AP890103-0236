DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan said Tuesday he has decidedagainst any oil import fee or other action to curb oil imports butconceded that ``the free world will become increasingly dependent onoil supplies from potentially insecure sources.''   The president said he acted on the recommendation of CommerceSecretary C. William Verity who reported that import restrictions``would not be cost effective and, in the long run, would impairrather than enhance national security.''   Verity's report was the outcome of an investigation requested inDecember, 1987, by the National Energy Security Committee, thepresident said.   He said Verity concluded that ``there has been a substantialimprovement in U.S. energy security'' since the last similarinvestigation in 1979.   In a message to Congress that accompanied his statement, thepresident urged lawmakers to deregulate natural gas prices, permitexpanded oil exploration in Alaska and the outer Continental Shelfand liberalize the depletion allowance for oil and gas producers.   Reagan said that declining domestic oil production, rising oilimports and growing free world dependence on potentially insecuresources of supply raise a number of concerns, includingvulnerability to a major supply disruption.   ``The investigation found that the maintenance of U.S. access tosufficient supplies of petroleum is essential to our economicsecurity, foreign policy flexibility and defense preparedness,'' hesaid. ``Given these factors, the secretary of commerce found thatpetroleum imports threaten to impair the national security.''   He said that, in deciding not to recommend any importrestrictions, Verity took into account the administration's programto improve energy security.   In particular, Reagan cited decontrol of oil prices andelimination of allocation controls as actions his administration hastaken to strengthen the domestic oil industry.   ``The Strategic Petroleum Reserve contains over 555 millionbarrels, compared to 108 million barrels eight years ago,'' he said.   ``Today the nation is far less vulnerable to an oil supplydisruption than in 1973 or 1979.''   Despite these improvements, important energy security concernsremain, the president said, citing rising oil consumption, decliningU.S. crude production and rising oil imports.   ``In addition, projections show that the free world will becomeincreasingly dependent on oil supplies from potentially insecuresources.'' he said.   The president also called on Congress to streamline nuclear powerlicensing procedures and sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves at ElkHills, Calif., and Teapot Dome, Wyo.</TEXT></DOC>
