Does he bring us anything new? Not much. Those familiar with the story will find Mr. Gay's &quot;Freud: A Life for Our Time&quot; (Norton, 810 pages, $25) amateurish and boring. Those unfamiliar with it would do better reading Ronald W. Clark's &quot;Freud&quot; (Random House, 1980).    While Mr. Gay seems to have read everything about psychoanalysis, he has understood nothing. Inasmuch as he makes no attempt to translate psychobabble into English -- which is the only way to separate the wheat of Freud's keen intelligence and insights from the chaff of his parochialism and prejudices -- this is not surprising. In addition, Mr. Gay has not had the burdensome benefit of having to earn a living by &quot;practicing&quot; psychoanalysis, an endeavor that would have forced him to confront the nature of the analysand's &quot;sickness&quot; and the analyst's &quot;treatment.&quot; After all, Freud was a physician who made a living treating patients. It is reasonable to want to know what ailed the patients, and what Freud did for/with/to them. We have his description: &quot;. . . talking people into and out of things -- which is what my occupation consists in.&quot;    There are fundamental issues at stake here that Mr. Gay does not consider, or even recognize. He accepts at face value, for example, that Freud's patients were ill -- suffering from diseases called hysteria, neurasthenia and so forth; and that Freud treated them -- with catharsis, psychoanalysis and so forth.    In addition, Mr. Gay presents Freud's persistent resentments and vengefulness like a defense lawyer restating for the court his client's misdeeds in euphemistic language designed to make him look innocent. This is not the way Mr. Gay, the historian, wrote before he chose to accept baptism by immersion in the mind-numbing waters of a psychoanalytic institute.    For example, Mr. Gay characterizes Freud's essay on Leonardo da Vinci as &quot;extremely controversial&quot; and then claims that Freud remained &quot;very fond of it, partly because he was very fond of Leonardo.&quot; But Mr. Gay makes no reference to the following sentence from the same essay, which makes Freud look foolish: &quot;It {the slowness with which Leonardo worked} was this too which determined the fate of the Last Supper -- a fate that was not undeserved.&quot; Was the deterioration of the Last Supper, a fresco, the fate it deserved?    At least Mr. Gay is honest enough, in this instance, to acknowledge that Freud's entire &quot;psychoanalysis&quot; of Leonardo rested on the mistranslation of an Italian word into the German text that served as Freud's source -- and that &quot;this gaffe,&quot; though first pointed out in 1923, was &quot;never acknowledged by Freud . . .&quot;    In his efforts to excuse Freud, Mr. Gay makes him, in his old age, the victim of a seduction, of all things. &quot;Bullitt,&quot; writes Mr. Gay, referring to William C. Bullitt, Freud's collaborator in their psycho-assassination of Woodrow Wilson, &quot;proved an able agent of seduction from the straight path of psychoanalytic reserve and respect for complexity.&quot;    Unfortunately, this, too, does not jibe with the facts. Bursting at the seams with excitement over this project, Freud writes to Arnold Zweig (in 1930): &quot;I may not say what it is; it is an analysis, too, but for all that highly contemporary, almost political.&quot;    As if blaming the Wilson book on Bullitt's &quot;seduction&quot; were not absurd enough, Mr. Gay abandons all historical objectivity and calls it &quot;an extended exercise in wild analysis.&quot; That is not how Freud viewed it! The fact is that Freud systematically used the vocabulary of psychoanalysis as a weapon with which to smite his enemies.    Interestingly, the picture Mr. Gay presents of Freud is virtually the mirror image of the picture Roy Porter presents in his recent &quot;A Social History of Madness.&quot; According to Mr. Porter, Freud's &quot;self-portrait {in &quot;An Autobiographical Study&quot;} is tendentious in the extreme. He conjures up the myth of the crucified hero, battling against all odds . . . of the dedicated man of science selflessly pushing forward the frontiers of knowledge.&quot; Mr. Gay has bought this myth and thinks it is a real treasure, perhaps because it has cost him so dearly.    That Freud was a great man is incontestable. What made him great is contestable. As Mr. Gay acknowledges, Freud &quot;likened himself to Hannibal, to Ahasuerus, to Joseph, to Moses.&quot; In short, Freud was a religious leader, like Moses; or, more modestly and perhaps more aptly, like Mary Baker Eddy, with whom Stefan Zweig had bracketed him even while Freud was still alive; or, more contemporaneously, like our gurus and televangelists with whom American analysts must now compete. Indeed, how else are we to interpret Freud's choice of the term &quot;cause&quot; for his enterprise?    Practicing medicine is not a cause. A cause is what gives meaning to our life -- Judaism, Christianity and Islam for the old-fashioned; communism, Nazism, Zionism, psychoanalysis and all the rest of the &quot;real&quot; and ersatz religions for us moderns. Mr. Gay's &quot;Freud&quot; is his panegyric to his Messiah. It will make the faithful happy, and the skeptical scornful.    ---   Mr. Szasz is professor of psychiatry at the State University of New York Science Center in Syracuse. </TEXT></DOC>
