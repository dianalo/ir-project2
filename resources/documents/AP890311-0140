REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Communist rebels on Saturday claimedresponsibility for the killing of a prominent supporter of U.S.military bases, and the military said nearly 160 Moslem insurgentssurrendered.   The communist New Peoples Army said in a statement that itsguerrillas shot businessman Remigio Nepomuceno, 43, in Angeles Citylast Wednesday because he committed ``crimes against the people,''including murder and rape.   Nepomuceno's family owns an electric company and a school and isinvolved in real estate and financing in Angeles City, home of theU.S. Clark Air Base 50 miles north of Manila.   Police believed Nepomuceno was slain because he helped organizeseveral rallies in support of the bases. The rallies coincided withleftist demonstrations urging the government to close the U.S.facilities.   The rebels said Nepomuceno's support for the bases was not themotive for the killing.   ``We in the NPA respect the political beliefs of other peopleeven though these are opposed to our position,'' the statement said.   They accused Nepomuceno of killing a student activist, forcingwomen into prostitution, raping three women and serving as a channelfor funds to anti-Communist vigilante groups.   There was no comment from the victim's family or police on theallegations. Nepomuceno comes from one of the most prominentpolitical families in the Angeles area and no criminal charges werepending against him.   Also Saturday, the military said 159 Moro National LiberationFront guerrillas and supporters surrendered Saturday on the southernisland of Tawi-Tawi, 650 miles south of Manila.   Air Force chief Maj. Gen. Jose de Leon, who accepted thesurrender, promised government assistance to the rebels toreintegrate themselves into national life. The rebels turned overabout 50 weapons.   Two weeks ago, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos accepted thesurrender of nearly 900 Front guerrillas and supporters on Joloisland, which is near Tawi-Tawi.   Both islands are strongholds of the Moro National LiberationFront, largest of three Islamic groups which have been waging anearly 20-year insurgency for self-rule in Moslem areas of thesouthern Philippines.   President Corazon Aquino promised autonomy to Moslem areas whenshe took power three years ago after the overthrow of FerdinandMarcos. But few steps have been taken and a bill to establish an``autonomous region'' in the south has been stalled in Congress.   In the past, both Communist and Moslem rebel groups have accusedthe military of faking surrender ceremonies for propaganda purposes,rounding up civilians to take oaths of allegiance before televisioncameras.</TEXT></DOC>
