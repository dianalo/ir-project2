Three people were killed and 50 people were injured in the crashof the new model jet Sunday.   State prosecutor Jean Volff said Michel Hasseline and hisco-pilot, Pierre Mazieres, told police investigators ``theinstruments on board the plane indicated an altitude of 100 feetabove the ground at the time of passing over the aerodrome.''   Volff told reporters preliminary investigations indicated thejet passed at ``30 feet altitude, which is completely outside thetechnical norms when it is carrying passengers.''   According to Volff, Hasseline told investigators he realized hisaltitude when his ``attention was captured by a high-tension powerline over the forest.''   The pilot also repeated Wednesday that the ``engines respondedlate'' to emergency efforts to gain altitude, Volff said.   At the time of the accident, Bernard Labalette, an amateur pilotwho was among the 1,000 spectators at the air show, told reportersthe A320 ``was about 65 feet above the ground'' just before itclipped some trees and crashed in a forest at the end of the runway.   Transport Ministry officials said the flight recorder on the jetindicated that Hasseline, a veteran pilot, was flying at only 30feet at the time of the crash. They said that was too low to besafe.   Hasseline was quoted in the French press Monday as telling arescuer he ``wanted to increase the power, but the aircraft did notrespond.''   Volff said no criminal charges will be brought against the pilotand co-pilot pending outcome of the investigation.   Transport Ministry officials in Paris defended the reliabilityof the new, sophisticated jet.   Ministry officials told reporters Monday no evidence emergedfrom the preliminary accident investigation to justify removing theplane from service.   British Airways and Air France, each of which has two of thecompletely computerized new jets, suspended flying the A320s forone day after the accident but resumed service following theministry statement.   The aircraft leasing company GATX-CL air of the United Statesannounced Wednesday it had ordered 10 of the A320s from theEuropean consortium Airbus Industrie, which makes the plane.   Airbus spent nearly $2 billion over four years developing itsnew competitor in the lucrative international commercial air market.   The order was the first to be announced since the crash.</TEXT></DOC>
