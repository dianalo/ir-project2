Asked whether he expected the president to take a direct hand insuch a development, Peres told reporters, ``Yes. I think theoccasion will really be in the summit meeting to have the Russiansadopt the needs of the Middle East and not the Middle Eastsbumitting to ideas that were born in Moscow.''   ``I expect to have a sort of an international opening that willnot necessarily impose a solution or control the sitaution but willreally permit the people of the Middle East to negotiate freely,''he said.   ``I expect it to be raised,'' he said. ``I don't know if it canbe solved in one jump, but I am convinced it will be continued.''   Peres also said that in meetings with Soviet officials inEurope, ``The Soviets went the longest possible way to convince usthat they are serious in their support of peace, that they are notenemies of Israel, that they are looking for an occasion to improvethe relations.''   Earlier, emerging from an hour-long meeting with Secretary ofState George P. Shultz, Peres said U.S. officials told him theSoviets had increased to 1,400 the monthly exit permits given toJews wishing to emigrate.   Peres said he had told the Soviets at meetings last week inSpain and in Hungary that ``they have to do more and in a moredetermined fashion'' to boost the flagging peace initiative.   ``I told them that their fear of the Arab reaction isexaggerated because the Arabs need peace talks no less than wedo,'' he said. The Soviets have expressed concern privately thattheir radical Arab allies might be angry if they joined the peaceprocess.   Syria, a close ally of Moscow's, rejects the Shultz plan but themore moderate Jordan has said it welcomes Soviet participation.   Peres said he had been told in his talks here that the Sovietshave expressed concern about the proliferation ofsurface-to-surface missiles in the Mideast in the wake ofrevelations that Saudi Arabia had bought such rockets from China.The United States and Israel have criticized the clandestine Saudipurchase of the intermediate-range CSS-2 missiles.   Reagan has warned Israel and Jordan against rejecting the peaceplan.   Neither side held out much hope that Reagan would be able tobudge the plan initiated earlier this year by Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz.   ``There are several new ideas, but they're minor and we don'texpect great progress,'' said a senior Israeli official, who spokeon condition of anonymity. He declined to discuss the ideas, sayingthey were not meaningful in the short run ``but incremental in thebig plan.''   Peres explored these ideas with Shultz at a meeting Monday andwas to continue discussions with him at two sessions today. Shultzwill bring Peres' ideas to Jordan and Egypt when he visits theregion on his fourth peace shuttle of the year starting June 3.   Peres supports the Shultz plan, which calls for Arab-Israelipeace talks to be held under the auspices of the five permanentmembers of the U.N. Security Council _ the United States, SovietUnion, China, England and France.   But his rival in Israel's fractious governing coalition, PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir, has rejected the formula out of concernthat the five powers would pressure Israel into relinquishing landsit captured from the Arabs in the 1967 Mideast war.   General elections scheduled in Israel for November are expectedto serve as a referendum on the plan.</TEXT></DOC>
