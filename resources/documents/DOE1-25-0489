The highestpercentage of the mortality of irradiated rats after all the three doseswas observed in groups with lower (30 to 50, 50 to 70%) and higher (130to 150%) values of serum proteins. Maximum numbers of surviving ratswere found in the central region (90 to 110%) of the variation intervalof the values of serum proteins examined.</TEXT></DOC>
