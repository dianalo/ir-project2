Long-distance rates, which have fallen almost 45% since1984, are stabilizing as evidenced by recent price boosts oncertain consumer and business services by market leaderAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.</LP><TEXT>   There also is a growing reluctance by MCI CommunicationsCorp., ATandamp;T's principal nemesis, to cut price at the expenseof profits.   MCI yesterday posted an 18% gain in second-quarterearnings, but its stock was hammered after revenue growthfell below expectations. Net income was $177 million, or 67cents a share, compared with $150 million, or 56 cents, theyear before. Revenue rose 17% to $1.87 billion from $1.59billion.   MCI's shares dropped $1.875 to $36.50 in nationalover-the-counter trading after trading as low as $36.125during the day.   MCI said revenue growth was strong in the residential andbig business sectors but slower in the general businesssector.   Daniel Akerson, MCI's chief financial officer, said thatduring the second quarter, the company was preparing to rollout MCI Vision, a product that offers to small andmedium-sized businesses some voice and data transmissionservices previously only available to big businesses. Alsoduring the quarter, he said, MCI froze hiring in the springto avoid sizable layoffs after MCI acquires Telecom USA. Theacquisition is expected to win regulatory approval soon andcould be completed this summer. Telecom USA's major strengthis in the general business sector.   Mr. Akerson, who heads the effort to combine the twocompanies, said MCI still won market share in the generalbusiness segment but was &quot;willing to accept a slower rate ofgrowth to facilitate the integration&quot; with Telecom USA. &quot;Wedidn't have a product as competitive or as targeted as wehave today,&quot; Mr. Akerson said, referring to MCI Vision.&quot;Without the right weapon -- or product -- and a full team onthe field, then you might hold for a quarter.&quot;   ATandamp;T is expected to post lower second-quarter earningstoday. Nonetheless, Sprint's and MCI's results could pose asticky timing problem for ATandamp;T. The company has been tryingto convince the Federal Communications Commission that theindustry is sufficiently competitive and that itsclassification as &quot;dominant&quot; carrier should be dropped infavor of looser regulation.   On Tuesday, Sprint, which has traditionally been thetelephone industry's biggest price discounter, posted a $42million second-quarter operating loss. This caused its parentUnited Telecommunications Inc.'s second-quarter net to drop55% to $40.6 million, or 18 cents a share. Revenue rose 12%to $2.07 billion.   United Telecommunications' stock is still reeling from theSprint debacle: Yesterday, its shares closed at $27.25, down$2.25 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,after falling 24%, or $8.75, to close at $29.50 on Tuesday.   United was also the volume leader, with more than 11.8million shares traded Tuesday and 10 million sharesyesterday. MCI led in volume in over-the-counter tradingyesterday with about 13 million shares traded.   Sprint and MCI are pushing to cut costs, but costs may bethe least of their problems, said Jack B. Grubman, analyst atPaineWebber Inc. He said ATandamp;T's size and market presencemakes it easier for the company to cut costs while keepingmarketing outlays high.   &quot;In a starvation diet, the fat lady wins,&quot; said Mr.Grubman. &quot;This is going to squeeze competitors to death.&quot;   Robert B. Morris III, analyst at Goldman Sachs andamp; Co.,noted that &quot;Sprint has its eye on one ball -- cost-cutting --while the industry has moved into an intensified mode ofmarketing and sales.&quot;   ATandamp;T and MCI have moved aggressively on Sprint'sbread-and-butter accounts: consumer and small business. Towin these accounts over, ATandamp;T and MCI have fueled their salesand marketing with new pricing promotions and advertisementsabout quality and service reliability aimed at consumer andbusiness customers for domestic and internationallong-distance calls.   &quot;Right now our goal is to stabilize our market share,&quot;saidVictor A. Pelson, senior vice president and group executiveof communications services at ATandamp;T. &quot;We're on track withregard to residential and business customers.&quot;   ---   Mary Lu Carnevale in Washington contributed to thisarticle.</TEXT></DOC>
