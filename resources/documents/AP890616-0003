Wind and rain forced the opening ceremony to be moved to acovered section of the complex and prevented a fireworks display.But people crammed shoulder-to-shoulder to get a first-day look atthe more than 100 shops, restaurants, nightclubs and street vendors.   Police estimated that about 200,000 people visited through theday.   Mayor Andrew Young's speech capping the opening ceremony wasdrowned out by demonstrators blowing whistles and chanting,``Atlanta keeps the homeless underground.'' Six people were arrestedand charged with criminal trespassing, police said.   About an hour before the complex opened, Superior Court JudgeIsaac Jenrette refused to stop the developers from using theUnderground Atlanta name. He ruled that a company that claims itholds rights to the name filed a lawsuit too late.   Underground Atlanta adds entertainment and nightlife to adowntown that had lost most of its fun spots to the suburbs.   First-day visitors appeared to be enjoying themselves, and manysaid they'd be coming back.   ``The shops are fantastic. I've done my Christmas shoppingalready,'' said Sharon Brewer of Tuscon, Ariz., who was in Atlantato visit a friend.   But even the most enthusiastic merchants acknowledged success isuncertain.   An original Underground Atlanta, located beneath downtown streetviaducts, opened in 1969. Hurt by nearby subway construction and theperception that it was crime-ridden, it closed in 1982.   Young made reviving Underground a priority of his administration,and with a combination of private investment, millions of dollars ofmunicipal funds and the issuance of $85 million in revenue bonds,the project thrived. Developed over three years by The RouseCompany, the new Underground is located on and around the old site.   Advocates for the homeless say many of the city's street peoplewere displaced by the Underground construction, and that publicmoney used for the complex could have gone to providing affordablehousing.   When Young was drowned out by the demonstrators, he angrilydefended his administration's actions on behalf of the poor.Dignitaries on the stand, including Gov. Joe Frank Harris, rose toapplaud the mayor but the protesters shouted even louder.   Young, a liberal Democrat who was prominent in the civil rightsmovement, said later he was not angry with the hecklers but insistedhe didn't deserve their ire.   ``You protest when you can't get people to take you seriously ortalk with you,'' Young said. ``I meet with the homeless, we have ahomeless task force, we put all of the resources we possibly can indealing with the problems of homelessness.   ``Maybe this helps in the sense that it puts homelessness on thenational media,'' he added. ``But you're not going to be able toresolve the problems of homelessness unless we keep successfulprojects like this going that create jobs.''   Murphy Davis, a partner at the Open Door Community, anorganization that aids the homeless, said of the demonstration, ``Ithink it's a hard thing for a lot of people to understand _ whydisrupt a good time? But there are a lot of people in this city whonever have a good time because the basics of life are denied tothem.''   Ms. Davis said that if Underground Atlanta provides jobs to thepoor, they are likely to be paid the minimum wage, which she said isnot enough money to live on.</TEXT></DOC>
