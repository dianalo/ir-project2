Supreme Court.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>In recent times, the US Supreme Court has seldom ventured into the labyrinthof intellectual property law.andP;  For this reason, if no other, the Court'sdecision earlier this year in James Stewart, et al.andP;  vs.andP;  Sheldon Abend wasbound to attract the interest of anyone who stands to gain or lose fromjudicial pronouncements in this area.andP;  But the fact that the subject of thislawsuit is a well-known film-Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 thriller Rear Window,which starred Stewart and Grace Kelly-didn't escape the notice of the generalnews media, either, and so the story was given prominent play for a couple ofdays.andP;  Even as the public's interest in the case waned, though, lawyers weregetting down to the serious business of figuring out exactly what the Courtwas saying and what the implications might be.andM;The decision concerns a narrow and rather technical issue.andP;  To what extentdoes the 1909 US copyright law regarding the formerly necessary renewal Ofcopyrights continue to apply, in the face of changes effected by the morerecent copyright law that went into force on January 1, 1978?andM;In resolving this question, however, the Court not only demonstrated thatthere may be more life left in the 1909 statute than many had suspected, butit also was obliged to spell out exactly what Congress intended when it wrotekey sections of the present law.andP;  Perhaps mOst importantly, the Justices hadto grapple with the troublesome concept Of derivative works, clearly definingtheir legal status for the first time.andP;  (Derivative works are works ofauthorship-including computer programs-that in some way incorporatecopyrighted elements of pre-existing works of authorship.)andM;In short, though the news stories may have lasted but a few days, this courtdecision turns out to be a juicier one than would appear on the surface,deserving of a closer look.andP;  First, however, we'd best run through a quickrefresher in copyright law.andM;Starting January 1, 1978, the law grants copyright protection to individualauthors during their lifetimes plus an additional 50 years from the date oftheir deaths (for jointly-created works, the 50-year period starts from thedeath of the last surviving author).andP;  Works made for hire-that is, workscreated by employees in the course of their employment-are protected for 50years from first publication or 75 years from creation, whichever is shorter.andO;That's it.andP;  Period.andP;  There's no renewal to worry about, because none ispossible.andP;  At the end of the applicable statutory period of protection, thework goes into the Public domain, and anyone can use it.andM;Under the previous 1909 law, things weren't that simple.andP;  Copyrightprotection began to run from the date of publication-meaning, in essence, thedate of first public release-for a period of 28 years.andP;  UnPublished works hadno federal copyright protection, but instead were covered by state laws; thiswas the common law COPYright to which you may occasionally still seereferences.) Within one year of the end of this initial 28-year period, itwas necessary to apply for renewal of the copyright.andP;  Renewal granted anadditional 28-year period of protection.andM;As you might imagine, a good many works ended up in the public domain afterthe first 28 years because the owners of their copyrights neglected to applyfor renewal.andP;  Once a work enters the public domain, it stays there; thecopyright can never be regained.andP;  (This is true under the present law aswell.andP;  There still are ways a copyright can be lost, but failing to apply forrenewal is no longer one of them.)andM;The 1909 law had one other wrinkle that was to become important in Stewartvs.andP;  Abend.andP;  The effect of the statute was to create two separate copyrightsfor works of authorship, covering two distinct time periods.andP;  At the end ofthe first copyright term, any licenses that had been granted for use of thecopyrighted work automatically lapsed, and so had to be renewed.andP;  Moreover,if in the meantime the author died before the time arrived for renewal of theinitial 28-year copyright, ownership then automatically passed by law to hisor her heirs, who exclusively possessed the right to renew the copyright forthe second 28-year period.andM;Even though this dual copyright scheme mandated by the 1909 law seems aliento the relatively streamlined system provided by the newer law, Congresscouldn't very well ignore the millions of pre-1978 copyrights still inexistence.andP;  What it did, roughly, was to carry over into the present law theessence of the 1909 enactment, to continue to cover these older copyrights.andO;in doing this, it made some major changes with respect to their renewal.andO;Pre-1978 copyrights still in their original 28-year terms are allowed afurther 47-year renewal upon expiration, but application still has to be madeto the Copyright Office in order to receive it.andP;  However, copyrights alreadyin their second 28-year terms as of January 1, 1978 were granted automaticextensions for 75 years from the dates of the original copyrights.andM;Clearly, it would be convenient if we simply could ignore works covered bypre-1978 copyrights, but we can't, especially in light of Stewart vs.andP;  Abend,because the ancestral versions of many software systems-including, need Iadd, UNIX-date from before that time.andP;  So now, let's examine this decision.andM;It all begins  way back in February 1942, when a writer named CornellWoolrich-I've never hear of him either-published a story titled &quot;It Had to BeMurder&quot; in Dime Detective Magazine.andP;  Publication, you'll remember, is themagic date that starts the first copyright term going under the 1909 law.andO;Woolrich had sold the magazine only the fi st publication rights to thestory, cannily retaining all other rights.andP;  Then, in 1945, Woolrich assigneda producer the rights to make film versions of several of his stories, &quot;ItHad to Be Murder&quot; among them, agreeing that he would renew the copyright atthe proper time, and would assign the producer the motion picture rights forthe second copyright term also.andM;Our story now shifts to 1953, when a production company formed by Stewart anddirector Hitchcock acquired the film rights for &quot;It Had to Be Murder&quot; fromthe original producer.andP;  Under the title Rear Window, the movie versionappeared in 1954 to considerable success.andM;All the while, the 28-year clock was ticking away.andP;  The initial copyrightterm was due to expire in February 1970.andP;  But in 1968 Woolrich died-a yearbefore the start of the period during which renewal was permitted.andP;  He lefthis property to a trust for the benefit of Columbia University, to beadministered by Chase Manhattan Bank.andP;  The following year, the bank dulyrenewed the copyright, assigning the rights for &quot;It Had to Be Murder&quot; toSheldon Abend.andM;In 1971, Rear Window was shown on ABC-TV Abend notified Stewart, Hitchcock,and the film's owner that he was now the owner of the short story rights, andthat the television display of the motion picture without his permissioninfringed his copyright.andP;  A lawsuit filed by Abend in 1974 was dismissed inreturn for payment to him of $25,000.andM;Not long after, though, the judiciary intruded into the scenario.andP;  In 1977the New York-based Second District Court of Appeals came out with a decisionthat appeared to cook Abend's goose.andP;  In a case called Rohauer vs.andP;  KilliamShows Inc., the judges ruled that the owner of a derivative work-which thefilm Rear Window unquestionably was--could continue to use it even if theoriginal grant of rights in the preexisting work on which it was based hadlapsed.andP;  Armed with this piece of judicial weaponry, Stewart et al.andO;proceeded to re-release their film for theatrical showing, and to issue it onvideocassettes as well.andM;This time, Abend did not drop his lawsuit.andP;  The trial judge ruled againsthim, chiefly relying on Rohauer.andP;  Abend appealed, not to the Second Circuit,but to the San Francisco-headquartered Ninth.andP;  This panel of appellate judgesdecided that the Second Circuit's Rohauer decision was wrong.andP;  They reachedthis conclusion on the basis of a contrary ruling the Supreme Court hadhanded down in 1960, before Rohauer, and, accordingly, decided in favor ofAbend.andM;The stage was set for a review by the US Supreme Court, for we now had asituation known to lawyers as a &quot;split in the circuits&quot;-which is a way ofsaying that two high federal tribunals had produced conflicting legalprecedents.andP;  And this time, the Supreme Court did step in (it doesn't always,unfortunately) .andM;What emerged was a 5-1-3 decision, meaning that five justices endorsed thedecision, one went along with the result without adopting the majority'sreasoning, and three dissented vigorously.andM;The majority justices briskly got down to what they regarded as the heart ofthe matter, and ruled that the 1909 law's provisions with regard to renewalsof pre-1978 copyrights remain in force.andP;  This means that since Woolrich haddied before the renewal period for &quot;It Had to Be Murder,&quot; there was nolegally effective way he could have kept his promise to assign the filmrights under the renewal copyright.andP;  The 1909 law limited the renewal rightto the author if living, then the widow or widower, then any survivingchildren, and then, finally, the executor or next of kin.andP;  Because Woolrichhad left no spouse or children, under the law the renewal right belonged tohis executor, Chase Manhattan.andM;This law, the majority pointed out, was intended &quot;to give the author a secondchance to control and benefit from his work,&quot; and &quot;to secure to the author'sfamily the opportunity to exploit the work if the author died before he couldregister for the renewal term.&quot; The justices observed that this permits theauthor, originally in a poor bargaining position, to renegotiate ...andP;  oncethe value of the work has been tested.&quot; The justices could find nothing inCongress' amendment to suggest that it intended to change the rules forpre-1978 copyrights.andM;Nor could the majority find reason to sympathize with the film folks, sayingthey had been &quot;deprived of nothing.andP;  Like all purchasers of contingentinterests, [they took] subject to the possibility that the contingency maynot occur.&quot;andM;From there, the majority proceeded to dispatch Rohauer.andP;  In its concern forthe owner of the derivative work, &quot;who had a great deal to lose if the workcould not be published or distributed,&quot; the Second Circuit had disregardedCongress' intentions, the majority found.andP;  It rejected the dissenters'contention that a derivative work is a new work standing independent of thepre-existing work, saying &quot;So long as the pre-existing work remains out ofthe public domain, its use is infringing if one who employs the work does nothave a valid license or assignment for use of the preexisting work.&quot;andM;Finally, the majority disposed of the film group's argument that even iftheir use of  It Had to Be Murder&quot; was unauthorized, it constituted a &quot;fairuse&quot; within the meaning of the copyright laws.andP;  We looked at this concept insome detail last time, and that discussion won't be repeated here.andP;  Sufficeit to say, the majority pointed out the obvious: the film group's use of theshort story was commercial in character and clearly impinged on Abend'spotential for marketing new versions of the story.andP;  In short, it failed tomeet the fair use criteria specified in copyright law.andM;Well, aside from the fact that Stewart and his co-defendants will have to dobusiness with Abend if they want to continue to market their film, what arewe to make of this Supreme Court ruling?andM;I've seen some rather hysterical forebodings expressed, which I don't believeare warranted.andP;  For one thing, the circumstance that gave rise to thiscase-namely, the death of an author before an agreed-upon renewal andreassignment could take place-isn't likely to have occurred in a huge numberof instances.andP;  But it's clear that an owner of a derivative work had betterkeep tabs on the legal status of the license or assignment he or she holdswith respect to the pre-existing work.andM;Beyond that, is it now possible to get a reading on the attitudes of theindividual justices with respect to copyright infringement controversies? Ihaven't been able to discern that it is.andP;  Justice Brennan, who was part ofthe five-justice majority in this case, recently has retired, so that groupof justices no longer makes up a majority.andP;  And the remaining members don'tseem to form any cohesive blocs.andP;  In the Court's last major decision in thearea of copyright infringement, Sony vs.andP;  Universal City Studios (the casethat says it's OK to tape copyrighted material off the TV), two members ofthe Stewart vs.andP;  Abend majority dissented.andP;  Besides Justice Brennan, onlyJustice O'Conner has been with the majority each time.andP;  (Justice White, whowas part of the majority in the first case, could not buy the majority'sopinion in this one, although he voted for the same result.) And only theChief Justice has been among the dissenters in both cases.andP;  The crystal balldoes seems murky.andM;Glenn Groenewald is a California attorney who devotes his time to writing andlecturing on computer law.andP;  He also has served as an administrative lawjudge.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
