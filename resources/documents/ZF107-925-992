 Fortunately, the publisher does not haveto create the entire system.andP;  There are composition toolkits, collections ofprecompiled software modules that do much of the hard work for compositionand pagination.andP;  By combining a toolkit with suitable input/output routines,data-massaging code and a user interface, the user can obtain a degree ofcustomization far greater than any commercial publishing product affords.andM;The Versacomp product, sold by One-for-One, is one such product that has beenin the field for many years.andP;  (See Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  19/20, p. 29 and Vol.andP;  17,No.andP;  22, p. 30.)andP;  It is a cross between a programming language and atypesetting package, with a focus on batch pagination according touser-defined rules, and is aimed mainly at specialty shops that setdirectories and technical manuals.andM;In previous issues, we have reported on the Stonehand and Deucalion Resourcesproduct (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  10, p. 24; No.andP;  11, p. 29; and No.andP;  13, p. 11).andO;These are OEM composition engines, whose pricing and licensing terms areoriented toward firms that want to offer complete publishing systems.andO;Deucalion's Tomahawk engine is the basis of CText's latest newspaper system,while the Stonehand engine is part of Crosfield Lightspeed CLS 2.0.andM;FutureComp toolkit.andP;  FutureComp, from Quality Software, is a programmer'stoolkit that is being pitched more to sophisticated end users than to OEMs.andO;FutureComp contins modules for area composition, pagination and output devicecontrol.andP;  It is also has utilities for maintaining width tables andhyphenation dictionaries, device-independent routines for getting charactersor database records, proofing on laser printers and so forth.andP;  An applicationdeveloper can use these functions just like any subroutines, by setting upthe required parameters and accepting the results that are returned.andM;The toolkit is written to be portable to a variety of computer platforms; allthat is required is that the computer support a C compiler.andP;  So far, QualitySoftware has prepared versions for MS-DOS and for Xenix.andP;  An OS/2 versioncould readily be built, because the Microsoft C compiler supports both MS-DOSand OS/2 at the flick of a switch.andP;  In addition, some of Quality Software'scustomers have done their own ports, as we discuss below.andM;Functionality.andP;  FutureComp's composition routines provide most of thestandard functions: multiple fonts and sizes, character-pair kerning andglobal white space adjustment, ligature formation, tabs and leaders,interword spaceband control and line justification.andM;* Hyphenation is by dictionary with backup algorithm.andP;  A 30,000-wordhyphenation dictionary is supplied with the system.andP;  In addition, the usercan create and use any number of supplementary dictionaries and can specifythe order in which they will be searched.andP;  We were told that the backuphyphenation algorithm is similar in concept to Knuth's Tex hypernationroutine.andM;* Justification.andP;  FutureComp uses the industry-standard justification method:it packs words into the line using the optimum spaceband until the measure isoverfilled at a natural word break.andP;  (What constitutes a natural break isuser-definable.)andP;  At that point, it tests whether the line would fit usingthe minimum spacing; if not, it drops the final word and tries the maximumallowed interword space.andP;  If that fails, the program attempts to find ahyphenation point in the final word and fits as many syllables on the line asit can.andM;Once the line ending has been determined, the program figures out whatinterword spacing will justify the line.andP;  If the necessary spacing exceedsthe maximum allowed, the program invokes letterspacing to the degree that ispermitted.andP;  Finally, if letterspacing does not bring the word spacing intothe allowable range, a loose-line flag is set.andM;The applicant program may be able to take remedial action.andP;  For example,FutureComp can suppress hyphenation ladders; but the application programmight decide to override the limit if the line is too loose.andP;  Alternatively,the application might try reworking earlier lines or even earlier pages (seewidow/orphan control, below).andP;  Or it might print a warning message.andM;Although the justification process can be run nonstop, it can also be calledon a character-by-character basis.andP;  The line-packing routine reports threevalues for the current length of the line, based on the minimum, maximum andideal word spaces.andP;  These values include the effects of kerning and tracking,but not letterspacing.andP;  Thus, the application can perform special processingat any point.andM;* Area composition.andP;  FutureComp operates by pouring text into a number ofblocks (rectangular areas, or frames) on the page.andP;  The programmer can defineany number of blocks and switch among them at will.andP;  However, there is noautomatic flow from block to block; the programmer must determine when eachblock is full, close it and open a new block to implement multicolumnsetting.andM;The block parameters include a left and right indent, which can be changedline by line if desired.andP;  To implement hung punctuation, for example, theprogrammer could readjust the indent values based on the first and lastcharacters of each line.andP;  This approach, we suspect, would require settingeach line twice, once to find where the last character falls and once to setthe interword spacing; the program supports this process with an &quot;erase toprevious mark&quot; command--a sort of multilevel undo function.andM;For setting tabular matter, there are several approaches the programmer couldtake: creating new blocks for each tab column, setting multiple lines withzero lead, and so on.andP;  The tools are there, but the programmer must put themtogether.andP;  For example, if a tab column contains a block of text that breaksinto multiple lines, it is up to the programmer to reset the baseline to thetop of the tab row before moving to the next column.andP;  If table elements arevertically centered within rows, it is up to the programmer to figure out howto do this.andM;* Vertical justification.andP;  At any point where a leading command is issued,the program actually outputs three values: the user-defined minimum, maximumand ideal leading.andP;  These values can, of course, be changed at any point inthe composition process.andP;  When a page is completed, the verticaljustification operation applies leading in proportion of these values.andM;* Widow/orphan control.andP;  The program does not actually have to output eachpage as it is finished, but can keep several pages open in the &quot;page wheel,&quot;a first-in-first-out buffer in memory.andP;  If the user program detects a badpage break, Future-Comp can back up to any previous page that is still open;the program can then change any of the composition or VJ parameters and trythe pages again.andP;  The number of pages that can be held open depends on theamount of memory in your computer.andP;  Whenever the page wheel gets full, theoldest page is pushed off the wheel and sent to the output device.andM;* Output sorting.andP;  Before sending a page to the output device, Future-Compcan sort the lines by y-coordinate.andP;  This step obviates hardware reverseleading in the typesetter.andM;* Graphics.andP;  FutureComp has no graphics functions of its own, but it canreserve a fixed amount of space for a graphic.andP;  There is a command to passthe contents of an external file to the output device.andP;  Thus, an externallyprepared graphics file can be merged with the output coding stream, althoughFutureComp does not &quot;know&quot; anything about what's the file.andP;  (Actually, itknows one fact: what device the graphic is supposed to be printed on.andP;  Forexample, an EPS file can be sent to a PostScript printer, but the same filewould print gibberish on a Triple-I VideoComp.andP;  FutureComp's device driverprevents that from happening.)andP;  Most FutureComp functions aredevice-independent, but graphics are explicitly device-specific.andM;Floating illustrations can be handled like widows and orphans, by backing thepage wheel up and recomposing the page.andP;  It is, of course, up to theprogrammer to figure out how to make this process work.andM;Extensible language.andP;  FutureComp provides a way to add user-defined functionsto an appliction program.andP;  The line-justification routine can be told toreserve any pair of characters as user-command delimiters.andP;  When the routineencounters a user command, it treats it as a call to a user-suppliedsubroutine of the same name.andP;  For example, suppose that the curly braces hadbeen set as the delimiters; upon finding [AltChar] in the current line, thejustification routine would hunt for and perform a subroutine name AltChar.andO;The subroutine can do anything the programmer wants--modify the input textstream, substitute a different hyphenation dictionary, make an entry in across-index file, etc.andM;SGML and other uses.andP;  One application for this capability is to support SGMLstyle tags.andP;  Each tag is interpreted as a call to a subroutine, which in turncan load composition parameters from a style sheet (possibly located in anexternal file) and perform any other tasks that may be required.andP;  Anotherapplication is database typesetting; the database would output user commandsto identify specific fields an distinguish various record types.andP;  It is alsopossible to emulate the command language of a different typesetting system.andM;Making it work.andP;  Before FutureComp can be put to use, it must be embedded inan application program; writing and debugging that application is the user'sresponsibility.andP;  The application would typically be written in C (all of thecomposition toolkit routines have C interface definitions) but could bedeveloped with any compiler that can link the FutureComp modules.andP;  Forexample, the version of FutureComp that runs on the PC platform was compiledwith Microsoft C 5.1; the Microsoft linker can accept object files fromMicrosoft's Pascal or Basic compilers, so a user could choose to develop anapplication in either of those languges.andM;This is clearly not a job for a programming novice or HyperCard hacker.andP;  Onthe other hand, someone who already knows C and has a clear understanding ofhis own job requirements (and a basic understanding of the mechanics ofcomposing lines and pages) would be able to get results with a fewexperiments.andP;  Quality Software supplies several examples of workingapplications to get the programmer started.andM;For users who don't have programmers on staff, Quality Software will do theapplication development work.andP;  It can be billed on the basis of time andmaterials, or a fixed-priced contract can be negotiated.andM;Modules.andP;  The FutureComp software comprises three chunks of code.andP;  Thecomposition engine, QComp, contains routines to define page dimensions,column sizes, and composition parameters; to justify lines, skip over tabsand set rules; and to perform widow/orphan checking, vertical justificationand page output.andM;The QSio module contains a collection of useful routines fordevice-independent file input and output.andP;  It understands about reading andwriting individual characters, lines of text, database records and fields.andO;It manages its own input file cache and handles messy details likeend-of-file detection and error trapping.andP;  It also provides useful routinesfor time- and date-stamping pages, converting text strings to numbers and soforth.andP;  QSio is mainly provide as an aid to writing portable applications.andO;The user's application need never rely on the operating system to providespecific services; it can call on QSio.andP;  The problem of making QSio work in aspecific system is part of Quality Software's porting job.andM;The third code chunk is the typesetter driver.andP;  QComp outputsdevice-independent code in its own OCL (output command language) format.andP;  Theuser determines the destination printer at output time by selecting which OCLtranslator to use.andP;  Quality Software hs written OCL drivers for PostScript,PCL (the HP LaserJet language), Triple-I's UPF and 500BIL (with PII to comesoon) and Autologic's ICL.andP;  The firm says that other drivers will be writtenwhen customers require them.andM;The MS-DOS version on Future-Comp can run in as little as 128K of memory byleaving out the hyphenation dictionary.andP;  (It supports both small- andlarge-memory models in the Microsoft C compiler.)andP;  Ina 640K computer, itshould be possible to develop a fairly sophisticated application.andM;Screen preview programs have been written by third parties for Post-Scriptand PCL output languages.andP;  Post-Script previewers have been introduced byPipeline Associates, Lincoln Associates and TeleTypesetting (see Vol.andP;  18,No.andP;  16).andP;  Quality Software mentioned that a firm called Theta Systems haswritten a PCL previewer called SoftJet, but we were unable to locate thatcompany.andM;Market strata.andP;  Quality Software is selling FutureComp in three distinctpackages: Proline, Laserline and Portline.andP;  The standard, full-serviceproduct is Proline, which is priced at $11,500.andP;  Proline includes allfunctions described above, the typesetter driver of your choice (plus PCL andPostScript drivers, which are always part of the package) and 30 days of freetechnical support and software maintenance.andP;  After the 30 days are up, anannual maintenance contract costs 15% of the purchase price.andM;LAserline is a low-end version of the product and is priced at $695.andP;  Itcontains the same composition functionality, but includes only the PostScriptand PCL drivers.andP;  Furthermore, Quality Software cannot offer much technicalsupport at this price level.andP;  Like any vendor selling a product at adesktop-publishing price, it will offer telephone advice to help theprogrammer understand FutureComp's functions.andP;  But Quality Software viewsLaserline primarily as the &quot;trial size&quot; product; its purpose is to stimulatedemand for Proline and to allow users to prototype applications at low cost.andM;Programmers who want to do their own port to other computers can buy thePortline version, which includes the source code to the Future-Comp modules.andO;Pricing depends on the target computer; we were told that a single-sitelicense for a Vax would cost $25,000.andP;  This price includes extensive support,but does not grant the right to resell the resulting software.andM;Who is this for?andP;  The effort of writing and debugging an application programrepresents a considerable up-front expense, even with much of the compositionfunctionality already supplied in FutureComp's modules.andP;  It will beworthwhile if the resulting code can be used many times.andP;  It will also bevaluable to certain very specialized parts of the publishing industry: thosewhose requirements exceed what any vendor's system can offer.andP;  STronglyoriented toward batch production systems, it seems mainly useful for settingdirectories and databases.andM;It is also useful for a shop that has a mainframe-based system but wants tooffload some of its production work to PCs or workstations.andP;  A shop might dothis to accommodate an unusual job from a good customer, or to handleseasonal overloads.andP;  By writing the FutureComp application to emulate thecommand set of the maintenance system, such a shop would not have to recodeits text files to gain additional peakload capacity.andM;Quality Software, Inc., 60 Lewis St., Newton, MA 02158;
