 Here they've managed toget all the way to introduction day (June 26th) for the new line of PS/1computers, and all they've had to contend with is a few normal leaks inplaces like PC Week, Infoworld, and the New York Times.andP;  Nothing like theincredible obsession with the &quot;Peanut&quot; home computer in 1983 and 1984,preceding the introduction of the PCjr, which led to such spectacles as puffyinterviews with IBM execs on Good Morning America and other network morningshows.andP;  The problem is that very lack of interest in reporting on the PS/1may also indicate that the world isn't waiting breathlessly for what IBM hasto offer this time around.andP;  And therein lies the quandary that faces IBM whenit tries to attack the socalled home market for personal computers: given thePCjr fiasco, almost nothing it does could possibly meet the expectations setsix years ago, so it is almost genetically impossible for IBM to get criticalsuccess and most people believe that critical success is key to commercialsuccess.andM;By the time you read this, you should already have a pretty good idea of whatthe PS/1 line of computers is -- four models built around the same chassisbut packaged with different options to provide a price range from $1,000 to$2,000 (with the color monitor and a hard disk being the maindefferentiators).andP;  The basic, standard features of all the models in the lineinclude a 10-megahertz 80286 processor, one megabyte of memory, a 1.44megabyte 3,5-inch floppy disk, VGA color, 2400-bps modem, mouse, and systemsoftware (pre-installed on hard disk models.)andP;  The ROM boots the machine intoa graphical menu that lets you choose among four activities without usingDOS.andP;  And the computer comes with Prodigy (including a special bulletin boardcalled User Club), Microsoft Works, and another on-line service calledPromenade, which is a special service provided by Quantum Computer Services(which already provides America Online, Tandy's PC Link, and Commodore'sQ-Link).andP;  While die-hard techies may not jump up and down about the PS/1line, they are definitely interesting computers, for the following reasons.andM;HARDWARE: The hardware itself has been designed to be assembled anddisassembled by monkeys.andP;  The monitor plugs directly into the CPU(reminiscent of the early Amstrad PCs), so there is only one power cord.andP;  Themodem is pre-installed, so all you have to do is connect it to the phone lineand figure out how to defeat call waiting (put &quot;#70,&quot; before the local phonenumber in your dialing sequence).andP;  The entire system comes in components thatplug together in various ways externally.andP;  There are no standard connectorsinside the computer, although you can get an expansion box if you wantconnectors.andP;  The entire CPU-plus-monitor set is very small and reasonablyattractive (although IBM's notion of attractive design is still veryindustrial).andM;SOFTWARE:  The software system has also been carefully designed.andP;  If you havea hard disk, the software is pre-installed.andP;  The computer has a special ROMthat starts up to a graphical screen, which gives you four choices: going toDOS, going to a simple filing system for keeping track of your otherprograms, going online to Prodigy, or going directly into Microsoft Works.andO;(The Promenade software, which is designed more for user education andentertainment than the Prodigy User Club, will eventually be integrated intothe communications choice, but the software isn't finished yet.)andP;  The idea isthat, since IBM has taken the trouble to integrate so much into this package,it might as well integrate the software (which may sound obvious to you andI, but is a revolutionary idea inside IBM).andP;  The result is very simple touse, but it does't fit into any standard notion of graphical interfaces sinceall the components were designed independently and use different metaphorsfor operation.andP;  In other words, it doesn't take long to figure out that thePS/1 computers are still pretty much DOS computers.andM;DISTRIBUTION:  The distibution for the PS/1 computers is substantiallydifferent than for the PS/2 line.andP;  IBM isn't withholding the product from anyof its authorized dealers, but through reduced margins and other actions, itis strongly discouraging its most business-oriented dealers from carrying theproduct.andP;  While IBM won't be specific, the dealer margin on the PS/1 lineseems to be substantially less than for PS/2, perhaps even in the 20-25%range (instead of 35-40%).andP;  As well, IBM has signed up three upscalemass-market retailers -- Sears Roebuck, Dayton-Hudson, and Dillards -- totest the product in selected stores in three cities in the Midwest.andP;  What IBMwants is to refine what is now seen as a slightly different channel ofdistribution into a clearly differentiated channel: a consumer-electronicsstyle distribution channel with more end-user support and training.andM;GESTALT.andP;  Apart from hardware, software, or distribution, what's mostinteresting about these computers is not so much how they fare in thestandard feature wars, but how they reveal the process that has brought IBMonce again to offer a special computer for use at home.andP;  First, the plaintruth is that IBM believes (and always has believed) that a home market doesexist.andP;  Indeed, every time that I've seen one of their top executives addressan industry conference about IBM's strategy, they have inevitably split thetotal market into four pieces -- large business, small business, education,and home.andP;  So the fact that it failed the first time it tried to enter thehome market was only a temporary setback, just like the first time it failedin the workstation market, and the minicomputer market, and other marketsthat it has tried to enter.andM;The problem with IBM's first attempt was that the company never went furtherthan saying to itself that such a market exists and that it needed to build ahome computer for this market.andP;  This time around, the company spent someserious time and money trying to get to know and understand people who usepersonal computers at home.andP;  (&quot;Do you know,&quot; said one of its executives tome, &quot;that our studies show that it takes an average of two and a half hoursfor an experienced user to get one of our computers to do something?&quot;andP;  Canyou believe that it took IBM nine years to figure that out?)andP;  And itdiscovered something interesting in the process (which most of us have knownintuitively for a long time): that people who use personal computers at homewant personal computers, not home computers.andM;The truth is that not one of the computers that have been successful as homecomputers -- the Commodore 64, the Apple II, the Tandy Model 1000, even theshortlived but successful Atari 400/800 -- were designed to be homecomputers.andP;  But the PCjr was designed as a home computer, somehowfundamentally different than the business computers (in IBM's mind) that thecompany was already selling in the form of the PC and PC-XT.andP;  And that sent amessage -- well supported by the ticket keyboard and the limitedexpandability of the machine -- that the PCjr was not a real computer.andP;  Aswell, price has clearly not been a key issue since people have boughtmillions of cheap computers like the Commodore 64 (which usually sells for$500 or so complete) and nearly as many millions of expensive computers likethe Apple II (which usually sells for $1,500 or so complete).andP;  One of IBM'sgreat strengths is infinite patience.andP;  So, once the company got over itsacute embarrassment (yes, even IBM executive bleed) it started over with anew product that was designed as a variation on its personal computer line,instead of as a different kind of computer.andP;  Instead, the idea was to packagethe same technology differently for home use: make it easy to set up,install, and learn to use; make it reasonably inexpensive without giving awaymajor features; make it available from a variety of both computer andconsumer outlets so customers can choose whether they want more or lessknowledgeable salespeople; and -- most important -- design into it standardfeatures that are important to use in the home but that aren't usually foundin so-called business computers.andM;You can already hear the critics getting warmed up: the keyboard isn't afull-size extended keyboard; the computer doesn't have slots; it just has a10-megahertz 286; it only comes with one megabyte of memory.andP;  But you can'tmake an under $2,000 computer that will melt techies' hearts -- it's just notpossible to make money at that price point and also put the latest andgreatest technology in a machine, at least not for a branded company likeIBM.andP;  So IBM has taken the next-best route -- make it serviceable and give itfeatures that so-called performance machines don't usually come with like themodem and applications software.andP;  Personally, I'm willing to bet that IBMwill strike a resonant cord with customers this time around in much the sameway that Prodigy hit a resonant cord, despite its critics.andP;  Perhaps customerswill be attracted by the notion that this computers is easy to set up, fullyfunctional out of the box, backed by a special unit of IBM, and possibly evenfun to use.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
