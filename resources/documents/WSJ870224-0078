Young andamp; Co. said it and an investor group acquired 18% of the common shares of Sorg Inc., and plan to seek the rest.    A combination of Young and Sorg would create the largest financial printer in the world, said Jack R. Hubb, president of Young.    Young, a unit of Service Resources Corp., said it and SDI Limited Partnership, New York, hold 403,600 of Sorg's 2.2 million shares outstanding. Based on yesterday's closing stock price, the value of the Sorg shares that aren't owned by the Young group is about $41 million.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Sorg closed at $23, up $4.25. Service Resources closed at $20, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Service Resources provides back-office services for law firms, investment banks and other companies.    Young said it plans to attempt to negotiate a merger with Sorg &quot;on a friendly basis,&quot; but would consider a hostile takeover if necessary. Young also said that in the event a merger is completed, it may sell some shares in the merged companies to the public.    A Sorg spokesman declined to comment.    Young said that if its merger talks with Sorg aren't successful, it might make a tender offer to purchase Sorg's stock, or acquire additional shares in the open market, solicit proxies to take control of Sorg's board or enter into agreements with other shareholders.    But Patrick Rooney, chairman of Service Resources, Young's parent company, said he is &quot;very friendly with the people at Sorg,&quot; and indicated that a hostile takeover is unlikely.    Late last year, Young failed in a bid to acquire Pandick Inc., also a financial printer, for $28 a share, or $305 million. Service Resources had said it planned to sell Young, but Mr. Rooney said the parent company changed its mind after restructuring the unit.    In 1986, Young had pre-tax earnings of about $1.4 million on revenue of about $135 million, Mr. Rooney said. Service Resources, the parent, had a nine-month net loss from continuing operations of $1.6 million on revenue of $20.5 million, excluding Young's revenue. Mr. Rooney said Service Resources expects to post full-year revenue of about $160 million, including Young's.    In the fiscal year ended May 31, Sorg earned $1.6 million, or $1.05 a share, on sales of $66.5 million.    Young said SDI, the New York investors group, acquired a number of Sorg's shares &quot;in order to facilitate&quot; a merger between Young and Sorg and &quot;to realize gains&quot; from the sale of its shares either to Young or another buyer.    Young said there isn't a formal agreement between Young and SDI, but that &quot;there is an understanding&quot; that SDI would tender its shares to Young in the event of a hostile tender for Sorg and &quot;vote its shares . . . in support&quot; of Young in such a move.    Leonard Toboroff, a New York attorney, is general partner of SDI Limited Partnership, Young said. </TEXT></DOC>
