Woolworth Co., the New York-based retailer, said it expects to post about a 20% rise in domestic sales for the four weeks ending Saturday.    Brisk sales of apparel, shoes and Easter paraphernalia played a large part in the increase.    &quot;We are more optimistic than ever about first-quarter profit, which we expect to report in just over two weeks,&quot; said Harold E. Sells, chairman and chief executive officer.    For the 13 weeks ending May 2, the company estimated that it will have a domestic sales gain of at least 6% from last year. Foreign sales for the 13-week period are expected to rise nearly 14%.    In March, domestic sales fell 4.4% from March 1986, largely because of this year's late Easter holiday. </TEXT></DOC>
