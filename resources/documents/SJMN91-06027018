She nolonger wants to be just like her mother; rather, she finds all sorts of waysin which she absolutely does not want to be like her. And by her criticism of,and distance from, her mother, she shows it. It hurts.;    Teen-age girls canbe expected to cause some heartache as they grow toward independence. But now,on top of that, their mothers are downright scared by the dangers of teen-agesex, substance abuse and risk-taking that are facts of life among teens.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TEEN DAUGHTERS NEED PARENTAL LOVE, TALK  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Family  </MEMO><TEXT>     It's not that the adolescent years are easy for mothers of boys, says AnnF. Caron, a Greenwich, Conn., educational psychologist. But mothers of girlsworry more; the old fears about girls' vulnerability, and pregnancy, are stillin full force. Caron is author of &quot;Don't Stop Loving Me&quot; (Henry Holt, $19.95),a book of advice for mothers of teen-age girls.;    Independence thwarted;  Atprecisely the time girls need some guidance in learning how to make gooddecisions, Caron says, many a mother develops a campaign to prevent that.;   &quot;She becomes so worried that she wants the daughter to check in with her allthe time. She wants to know everything about the daughter, almost to the pointof immersing herself in the daughter's life, which doesn't leave room to makedecisions,&quot; Caron says.;    &quot;The mother should be the guide, but when thedaughter goes out at night, they have to reach a point&quot; where mother trustsdaughter.;    She recommends &quot;vigilant trust.&quot; The mother should know what'sgoing on among young people in the community (often it's tempting not toknow), so she can talk to her daughter about it. Mothers also need to know thesigns of substance abuse and sexual activity, and they need to trust theirdaughters unless there is a clear sign that trust has been broken. If it isbroken, there are consequences, but then mothers must give trust again.;   Family ties important;  When there is dialogue between mother and daughter,there is the basis for trust. But when a daughter is constantly finding faultwith her mom and telling her to quit interfering, it can seem impossible.&quot;Mothers will give up -- 'She doesn't care about us, so I don't care abouther,' &quot; Caron says.;    It's not always apparent, but teen-age girls want verymuch to be close to their families, Caron says. Research from the '80s showsthat even as they yearn for some independence, girls do not want to be leftalone. &quot;They want to share their feelings and thoughts,&quot; Caron says. (Boyswant to stay close, too, she says, but they are expected to be moreindependent, and so they are.);    As much as they want to communicate, girlswill not respond well to interrogation. And interrogation is the style manymothers have with their teen-agers, Caron says. &quot;So many times it comes downto, 'Where have you been?' 'Who have you been with?' &quot; rather than the sharingtype of talk between friends.;    Talking like friends;  Mothers need to learnhow to talk to their daughters as if they are making friends with a newneighbor or colleague. &quot;She should share some of her life, (such as talkingabout) a conversation she had today,&quot; Caron says. Then the daughter can talkabout everyday things in a non-threatened way. &quot;As it becomes moreconversational, it opens up the door,&quot; she says.;    Caron remembers one womanwho disliked shopping. But shopping was what the woman's daughter wanted to domost.;    By shopping with her, &quot;she ended up having a really fascinatingconversation with her daughter about her daughter's social life&quot; and shelearned things her daughter never would have revealed under questioning. &quot;Herdaughter mentioned that at some unchaperoned parties, kids were going upstairsto have sex. These were 15-year-olds,&quot; Caron says.;    When you really talk toa teen-ager, you may not like what you hear. But in a dialogue, Caron says,mothers and daughters learn to understand each other's concerns and find waysto best get through the tough years.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARY JO KOCHAKIAN, The Hartford Courant  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910127  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5L  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  698  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday January 27, 199100027018,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
