 Upgrade from previous version, $40 plus $5 shipping.andM;Requires: IBM AT, PS/2, or compatible, 1MB RAM (2MB recommended), hard disk,DOS 3.1 or later, 80386- or 80386SX-based PC and 2MB RAM required for 386enhanced mode operation.andP;  EGA or VGA graphics adapter and mouse stronglyrecommended.andM;In Short: Though far from perfect, Windows 3.0 is a practical choice,offering a poerful graphical operating environment 16 millions of DOS PCusers without forcing them to give up standards applications.andM;Since it was introduced some five years ago, Microsoft Windows has been asmuch an expression of technological evangelism as a practical product.andO;Though it promised to bring the consistency and usability of the graphicaluser interface to the PC, the limitations of the PC hardware base and thedrag of existing standards have held back its progress.andP;  So, although Windowshas shown a steady growth in popularity that has accelerated rapidly over thepast year or so, it has not taken the PC world by storm.andM;Windows 3.0 may change all that.andP;  For the first time, Windows offers apoerful, productive, and cooperative graphical environment that takes fulladvantage of today's PCs while remaining compatible with existing DOSapplications.andP;  The jump in functionality cannot be underestimated.andP;  Bychoosing to run Windows 3.0 in protected mode, Microsoft has in a singlestrke eliminated the memory barriers that have been the greatest drag on theuse of Windows as a comprehansive operating environment, as well as on theperformance and function of Windows applications.andP;  And by improving Windows'color and driver handling, it has unleashed the power of m odern videotechnology, making ready for the colorful graphics and multimediaapplications of the future.andP;  Best of all, the new Windows bursts upon a fieldof over a thousand applications, many of which already support the newversion and its advanced features.andP;  The new freedom from memory constraintswill bring an explosion of advanced products to the PC, including many thathave existed only on the Macintosh.andP;  Though Windows 3.0 is still a far cryfrom the Macintosh system in overall usability (see the sidebar &quot;The UserInterface Faceoff: Windows versus Macintosh,&quot;) its improvements are enough tobring real benefits to a huge installed base of 286 and 386 users.andP;  Windows3.0 may just be the catalyst that finally pushes PC users to the graphicalinterface in real numbers.andM;A NEW LOOKandM;What a contrast in appearance Windows 3.0 presents!andP;  On first sight, it'shard to imagine that this attractive desktop of subtle colors,three-dimensional buttons, and multicolored icons is the same program as theflat, brightly colored Windows 2 desktop we're used to seeing.andM;By doubling the number of basic colors from 8 to 16, the standard EGA and VGAdisplay drivers offer two pure shades of gray, as well as six additionallow-intensity colors.andP;  The results are eyecatching: colors are clear andsoft, gray and finely brushed, and dithering is less intrusive.andP;  The newproportional system font (used for title bars, menus, and dialog boxes)completes the sleek, professional, and eminently readable appearance.andM;Te new look is more than cosmetic, however, Windows 2's utilitarian MS-DOSExecutive was justifiably maligned for its insufficiencies, to the pointwhere replacements and enhancements for it have grown to the status of acottage industry.andP;  With Windows 3.0, Microsoft has introduced a revampedmethod of managing programs and files--one that borrows heavily, though notcompletely, from the design of the OS/2 Presentation Manager.andM;When you first start Windows 3.0, you're greeted by the Program Manager,which helps you organize your applications into an easily customazable,icon-based desktop within a desktop.andP;  Within the main Program Manager window,you'll find one or more program groups.andP;  Each group has its own window: youcan size, tile, cascade, or even iconize them, though you can't move themoutside the main Program Manager window.andP;  This ability to treat documentwindows within an application as flexibly as you'd treat application windowson the desktop is new to Windows 3.0.andM;MANAGEABLE ICONSandM;Each group window, in turn, contains one or more application programsrepresented by icons; double-clicking on the icon of your choice starts theprogram.andP;  The programs may reside either locally or on a network drive; a newbrowse facility lets you can through your directories for executable filesyou want to run.andP;  You can assign a descriptive label of up to 40 charactersto each icon.andM;One of the nicest features of the Program Manager is that you can move orcopy program icons from one group to another simply by dragging them from thesource window to destination program group.andP;  An icon may be part of more thanone group as a kind, making it easy to set up groups oriented by task orproject rather than applications type.andP;  You can even set up an icon to startan application and open up a specific file.andP;  A menu function lets you arrangethe icons neatly on the desktop.andP;  You can choose to save the appearance ofthe desktop automatically when you exit Windows.andM;By default, you start out with Main, Games and Accessories groups, plusWindows and Non-Windows Applications if you've chosen to have Windows searchyour disk for applications during setup.andP;  But you can organize your desktopinto as many or as few groups as suits your needs (see the sidebar &quot;TheIntelligent Desktop: Making Program Manager Work For You&quot;).andP;  Whateverarrangement you choose, it does not affect the underlying structure of yourdisk, so you can set up groups freely without rearranging yoursubdirectories.andM;As with Windows 2, you can reduce any running application to an icon on thescreen and put it aside for future use.andP;  In addition, Windows 3.0 offers amenu-based way to select any open application.andP;  Double-click on the screenbackground or press Ctrl-Esc from any application (including full-screen DOSapplications), and you'll see the Task List, which lists your runningprograms and lets you select any one of them.andP;  The Task List also lets youcascade or tile the open windows, to arrange the icons, or to shut programsdown--very helpful when your Windows desktop gets crowded.andM;FILE DISAPPOINTMENTandM;A new File Manager complements the Program Manager, but though it's animprovement over the old MS-DOS Executive, its mix of graphical andtext-based operations is still too awkward to be really useful.andP;  Much like acharacter-based DOS shell, File Manager starts out with a directory treedisplay that shows the overall organization of your subdirectories asbranches from the root.andP;  You can use the Plus and Minus keys or menu commandsto expand and collapse branches of the tree.andP;  Double-clicking on anysubdirectory displays the files in that directory.andM;Depending on the amount of free memory you have, you can keep several filewindows open at one time, tiling them for side-by-side comparison oriconizing them for future reference.andP;  Unfortunately, you can have only onedirectory window at a time, an arbitrary and rather confusing limitation.andO;Though it should be easy to bounce around between the multiple listings,getting all the files up on screen at once requires too many mouse clicks tomake it practical as a time-saver.andM;Though the familiar menu commands are available for the tradition-minded,Windows 3.0's File Manager now lets you copy or move groups of filesgraphically, by clicking and dragging them from window to window.andP;  The movecommand is reasonably well designed, enabling you to move files across disksas well as between directories; it even moves entire directories with alltheir subdirectories and files.andP;  A new search command makes it a good dealeasier to find files wherever they may be on your disk.andP;  But still missing isa convenient way to view their contents or perform detailed comparisons:you'll need to rely on third-party utilities for those functions.andM;As in the old MS-DOS Executive, you can start programs by clicking on eitherthe executable program files or the data files associated with them.andP;  But youcan now associate file extensions with particular applications using themenus; you no longer have to edit the WIN.INI file manually.andP;  You can alsodrag data files on top of an application's .EXE file listing to start up theprogram with that data file loaded.andM;SNAPPY ACCESSORIESandM;In the midst of all these changes, Microsoft hasn't forgotten the Windowsaccessories.andP;  All of these useful little programs have been brought up to thenew look of Windows 3.0, including its help files and printer support.andP;  Inmany cases, they have been significantly enhanced as well.andP;  The WindowsNotepad, for instance, can now edit files up to 50K--much more than before.andO;The Clock shows the time in analog or digital format.andP;  The Calculator nowoffers statistical and scientific functions, octal and hexadecimalarithmetic, and a full complement of logical operations.andP;  The Terminalprogram now sports XModem and Kermit file transfer capabilities (though theKermit facility unaccountably fails to accept wildcards that would let yousend more than one file in a batch).andP;  And Write now reads Word for Windowsfiles.andM;To better handle the graphics demands of the new environment, Microsoft hasreplaced Windows Paint with a version of ZSoft's popular PC PaintBrushprogram.andP;  This full-featured program is a big step up.andP;  It has a substantialrange of drawing tools, supports full color as well as black-and-whiteimages, and reads and writes .PCX files as well as the Windows bitmappedformat (.BMP).andP;  With it, you can design or modify icons, paste capturedWindows screens from the Clipboard (PrtSc captures the screen), and creategraphics to paste into Windows documents.andP;  You can also save Clipboardcontents directly in the Windows .CLP file format.andP;  Moreover, the 64K limiton Clipboard contents no longer applies.andM;Another useful addition is Recorder, a basic macro recorder that lets youcapture a sequence of keystrokes and mouse actions in a file for playback.andO;This can be useful for simple tasks such as inserting frequently used text orautomating the steps of a routine.andP;  Macros can be nested up to five levelsdeep, and you can store several macros in a single file.andP;  Unfortunately, ifyou make a mistake, you'll have to rerecord the macro, because there's no wayto edit the missteps out of the file.andP;  Moreover, if you move your iconsaround, all your recorded mouse actions will be invalid.andP;  For these reasons,Recorder is no substitute for a full-scale macro language such as TheSoftbridge Group's Bridge, or the Agent capabilities of Hewlett-Packard'sNewWave environment.andM;GREATER CONTROLandM;Windows 3.0 gives you more facilities for customizing its appearance.andP;  Theredesigned icon-based Control Panel, which lets you set the options forscreen colors, fonts, printers, keyboard and mouse actions, and so on, allowsyou to fine-tune your desktop to a greater degree than the old Windows 2Control Panel.andM;Color selection, especially, is much improved.andP;  Instead of painstakinglyselecting the colors for the workspace, screen background, menu bars, andtitle bars individually, you can now choose from an array of predefined colorschemes ranging from Arizona (earth tones) to Wing Tips.andP;  If these don't suityou completely, Windows' new color palette manager (of which more later)makes it far easier to find the right colors.andP;  You can copy any predefinedcolor scheme and modify any element by selecting from a range of standardWindows colors in the palette; you can add any custom color (created bymixing hue, saturation, and brightness, or red/green/blue with sliders) tothe palette as well.andM;With Windows 2, the basic screen background came one way: plain.andP;  WithWindows 3.0, you can incorporate patterns or entire bitmapped images (calledwallpaper) to spice up the appearance of your screen.andP;  Microsoft thoughtfullyincludes a range of patterns and wallpaper bitmaps to experiment with, andyou can design your own wallpaper using the Paintbrush accessory or any otherpaint program.andP;  Though this option is not much of a productivity builder (andthe screen can become confusing if your background is too fancy), it's a lotof fun; with a bit of artistry, you can make your Windows 3.0 desktop allyour own.andM;EASIER SETUPandM;Windows is also much easier to install and configure than it used to be.andP;  Thenew Setup program, after an initial stage, is Windows-based and useson-screen windows to step you through the process of copying files andsetting up printers.andP;  It can even search your disk and install your existingDOS applications for you, though you may prefer to turn this option off andset up specific applications manually.andM;In the past, once the Windows system has been installed by the setup program,it was impossible to reinstall new device drivers for new displays orkeyboard layouts except by reinstalling Windows.andP;  Windows 3.0 happily fixesthis problem by providing a Windows Setup utility to change the display,mouse, keyboard, or network driver within the Windows environment.andM;Printer setup is also much improved.andP;  You can now install several printers onthe same printer port, facilitating use on networks and with printers thatsupport multiple emulations.andP;  And you can easily assign a printer's output toa file; Windows will then prompt you for a filename each time you print.andP;  Thenew Print Manager, clearer and easier to use than before, has been greatlyenhanced to handle the chores of network printer queues as well as localprinters.andM;HELP FOR HELPandM;Windows 3.0 comes with an excellent help system.andP;  You can either call helpfrom any Windows program that has a help option, or run the help program(WINHELP .EXE) from the File Manager or Program Manager.andP;  You can getcontext-sensitive help by pressing F1.andP;  The help window is a separate taskthat can be treated like any other; you can even iconize it for futurereference.andM;Once the help program is started, large pushbuttons let you select topicsfrom the master index, browse through items in a series of related topics tofind any particular topic, or retrace your path through the help topicsyou've already covered.andP;  You can click on any word marked with a dottedunderline to get a definition of that term; phrases marked with a solidunderline jump to a more detailed explanation.andM;A search option lets you jump to any particular item directly, and you canset multiple bookmarks anywhere in the help system for quick return to atopic of interest.andP;  You can also supplement the help text with your ownnotes.andP;  Annotated screens are marked with a paperclip icon that you can clickon to read the notes.andP;  Finally, if you want a hard copy of the help text, youcan print it.andM;BREAKING THE BARRIERandM;Though the outward changes in Windows 3.0 are indeed dramatic, its mostimportant enhancements are underneath.andP;  With the appearance of Version 3.0,Windows is finally able to break through the 640K barrier to make full use ofthe extended memory in 286- and 386-based machines.andP;  With this improvement,Windows becomes far more than a graphical user interface and programswitcher: it's a full-fledged operating environment that can really make useof the memory resources of your PC.andM;On 286 machines and on 386 machines with less than 2MB of RAM, Windowsnormally runs in standard, or 286 protected mode, which allows Windowsprograms to view all the memory installed in your machine as a single,segmented address space up to 16MB in size.andP;  This alone brings substantialperformance benefits to all Windows applications because they needn't discardand reload memory segments so frequently.andP;  The extra memory space lets youfit multiple large applications into memory at once, speeding them up; italso allows developers to create complex programs that would never fit insidethe 640K limit of real-mode operation.andP;  Standard mode supports the protectionfeatures of the 286 chip, which offers multiple tasks a degree ofhardware-based protection from one another when running and helps preventsystemwide crashes.andM;TAPPING THE 386andM;Standard mode requires a 286 or 386 PC with at least 1MB of memory, of whichat least 256K must be configured as extended memory.andP;  If you have a 386machine and at least 2MB of RAM, Windows 3.0 can be run in 386 enhanced mode,which, while slower, offers a number of useful features.andP;  For one thing, 386enhanced mode opens up more memory--as much as your 386 system will hold--forapplications to use directly.andP;  It also supports the powerful virtual-memorypaging feature of the 386 chip.andP;  This fast, hardware-controlled scheme allowstemporarily unneeded memory contents to be written to the hard disk in small4K pages, effectively making the hard disk a transparent addition to yourphysical memory.andP;  Finally, 386 enhanced mode supports the virtual 86 mode ofthe 386 processor, which lets you multitask standard DOS applicationsalongside Windows applications (see below).andM;For backward compatibility with unmodified Windows 2 programs, Windows 3.0offers real mode, which you can specify by using the /R switch on the commandline when starting Windows.andP;  In real mode, Windows 3.0 runs exclusively inconventional memory and uses both small-frame and large-frame expandedmemory, just as its predecessor did.andP;  Though real mode offers a solidfoundation for the transition period from Windows 2 to Windows 3.0 and makesWindows usable on machines with limited memory resources, the need for itwill diminish as software developers introduce Windows 3.0--capable versionsof their products.andM;NO MORE TEARSandM;The inability to run smoothly with standard DOS applications has always beenone of Windows' weakest points.andP;  Setting up .PIF files was a process fraughtwith complications; even when correctly done, using Windows in this way wasall too often an act of faith.andP;  Windows was simply not able to handle allthat the DOS world threw at it.andP;  Using Windows required commitment, somethingnot all users were willing or able to do.andM;Thankfully, the ability to integrate DOS applications into your graphicaldesktop is one of Windows 3.0's most valuable assets.andP;  When operating instandard mode, Windows 3.0 now runs DOS applications in full-screen mode,which leaves most of the machine and almost the entire 640K conventionalmemory space available to the DOS application.andP;  Consequently, there are fewerlimitations on what kinds of programs can be run--and fewer things to gowrong--than in Windows 2.andM;In standard mode, you cannot multitask DOS applications.andP;  When you switchaway from a DOS application, it gets swapped to disk and is held in a stateof suspended animation until you switch back to it.andP;  Similarly, your Windowsapplications come to a stop when you're working with a DOS application.andO;Still, the ability to use Windows to context-switch between DOS applicationsis a worthwhile benefit.andM;THE 386 ADVANTAGEandM;But Windows 3.0's true power isn't seen unless you're in 386 enhanced mode,which lets you take advantage of the virtual 86 mode of the 386 processor tomultitask DOS applications alongside Windows itself.andP;  This powerful featurecreates a protected &quot;virtual machine&quot; with its own 1MB address space for eachDOS application.andP;  Because each program (including Windows) thinks it owns themachine, even ill-behaved DOS applications can coexist in relative harmonywith each other and with Windows.andM;Since the job of switching from program to program is handled by the memorymanager on the 386, it's quite fast; unlike standard mode, it's not necessaryfor Windows to read in the application swap file from the disk in order tochange contexts.andP;  A nice extra benefit is that you can assign a hotkey to anyapplication and use it to bring the application immediately to the foregroundeven if you're running another DOS application in full-screen mode at thetime.andM;Virtual 86 mode also makes it possible for Windows to run any DOSapplication, whether text-mode or graphics-based, in a window.andP;  This can beuseful for cutting and pasting text, but since windowing slows down screenperformance a great deal, particularly with graphics, you'll probably preferto use the applications in full-screen mode.andP;  If your goal is to multitaskDOS applications, Windows 3.0 is no substitute for DESQview 386.andP;  While youcan select foreground and background time slices for your DOS applications,Windows 3.0's options are less versatile (though also less complicated) thanDESQview's.andP;  In any case, Windows itself is still treated as a single task,and Windows applications are multitasked non-preemptively, as they alwayshave been.andM;With these improvements, setting up DOS applications is far easier than itwas in Windows 2; for the most part, the default settings let you simply runDOS or your application from Windows 3.0.andP;  This makes PIF (ProgramInformation Files), the ancient bane of the Windows 2 user, now mostlyunnecessary, though they can be important for controlling backgroundprocessing, video performance and memory usage, and handling potentialkeyboard conflicts.andM;BETTER NETWORK SUPPORTandM;Windows has always coexisted with networks, but it never really cooperatedwith them.andP;  Until Windows 3.0, you had to log on to the network and map allyour drives and printers before starting Windows.andP;  Windows 3.0 comes withnetwork drivers so that you can perform these tasks from within Windows.andO;Included in the package are drivers for Novell's NetWare 2.10 or 386, 3Com's3+Share and 3+Open, Banyan's VINES 4.0, and IBM's PC LAN program, as well asgeneric drivers for Microsoft's own MS-NET and LAN Manager--based networksoftware.andP;  Drivers for the other network systems will almost certainly bemade available as needs develop.andM;The Windows Setup utility detects your network during installation andinstalls the proper driver; you can also install a driver after the fact.andO;Once the driver is installed, you can use the Control Panel to log on and offthe network, attach and detach servers, and change your user ID and password.andO;Print Manager passes along print jobs to the network print queues; with somenetworks you can even use it to check the status of the queues beforesubmitting the job.andP;  And File Manager lets you log onto network drivesindividually as needed, avoiding the need to read in the listings for all thehundreds or thousands of files on a network server.andM;Windows 3.0 also makes it easier to install a shared copy of Windows to runfrom a network server.andP;  It is now configured to let you share the Windowsprogram files while retaining custom user settings in a local hard disk orpersonal network directory.andP;  You can improve performance by puttingapplication swap files or 386 enhanced mode paging files on a fast local harddisk; alternatively, you can run Windows on a diskless workstation by puttingthese files on the network server.andM;APPLICATIONS GALOREandM;For applications developers, Windows 3.0 means momentous opportunities.andP;  Theprovision of a full-fledged graphical environment for the PC, freed of thememory and performance limitation of previous verions, for the first timemakes possible a new generation of bigger, smarter, more complex Windowsapplications.andP;  The variety of vendors that have shipped Windows 3.0applications or announced the intention to create them makes it clear that wecan expect an explosion of new and significant Windows software in the nextseveral months.andM;The most notable candidates will be major Macintosh programs that can now beported over to the PC under Windows 3.0.andP;  Microsoft itself has alreadybrought Powerpoint, its high-end presentation graphics program over toWindows 3.0, and the addition of Persuasion from Aldus, Powerpoint's chiefcompetitor on the Macintosh, will soon revolutionize a field dominated on thePC by text-based solutions.andP;  PageMaker 4.0, already out on the Macintosh,will rely on the increased headroom that Windows 3.0 offers, as does theupcoming Windows version of Ventura Publisher.andM;Down the road, we can expect to see a Windows version of Macromind Director,a sophisticated set of multimedia presentation tools.andP;  And something likeHyperCard has come to Windows with Asymetrix's Toolbook and Spinnaker's Plus,offering nearly unlimited possibilities for customized personal applicationsfeaturing graphics, sound, and animation.andP;  (Indeed, a runtime version ofToolbook is included in every Windows 3.0 package).andP;  With all these options,the PC will be much more competitive with the Macintosh on the latter's ownturf.andM;Windows 3.0 makes new PC products possible as well.andP;  Microsoft's Project andDelrina Technologies' Perform are just two of the sophisticated packages thatrely on Windows 3.0's improved environment to do things that would beimpossible or impractical under Windows 2.andP;  We can expect more of these inthe future, along with improved versions of existing Windows programs (suchas Word for Windows and Excel) that will extend well beyond the versionsavailable today.andP;  With user demand for Windows running high, even Microsoft'sbiggest rivals--Borland, Lotus, Ashton-Tate, and WordPerfect--are jumpinginto the act.andP;  Windows 3.0 versions of Quattro Pro, Paradox, Lotus 1-2-3,WordPerfect, Multimate, and dBASE, among others, should be here by early nextyear.andM;Finally, Windows 3.0 opens up doors for Hewlett-Packard's NewWaveenvironment, which implements compound documents in a true object-orienteddesktop.andP;  The Windows 3.0 version of NewWave is the first version of thisexciting new technology that fully implements its Agents, which let youexecute processes across multiple applications.andP;  Improved memory managementhas actually cut NewWave's memory requirements from 4MB to 3MB.andM;DEVELOPERandM;ASSISTANCEandM;Though programming for a graphical environment is always a complex job,Windows 3.0 does make some things easier for developers.andP;  The use ofprotected-mode memory unshackles them from the limitations of bankswitchedexpanded memory, simplifies debugging, and makes meticulous performancetuning less important; it also improves the performance of DDE operations.andO;The new Multiple Document Interface offers richer support for userinterfaces, including pop-up as well as pull-down menus and the ability toiconize document windows within main application windows.andP;  Since Microsoftsupplies an API for the Windows 3.0 help system, any Windows program can giveon-line assistance to the user in a uniform way.andM;On the other hand, the new look of Windows 3.0 makes the design of certainitems, such as dialog boxes, more difficult.andP;  Hopefully, the softwaredevelopment tools supplied by Microsoft and other vendors will keep pace withthese additional needs.andP;  It is far too time-consuming to create such complexuser interfaces from scratch, and the tools supplied with previous Windowssoftware development kits have had some major deficiencies.andM;COLOR IT LOGICALandM;Windows 3.0's new color palette manager is of the greatest importance inpresentation graphics, desktop publishing, and other applications that dependon color.andP;  This feature ensures a consistent programming interface betweenWindows and color devices, allowing Windows applications to use color withoutsubstantially interfering with the on-screen colors displayed by otherapplications.andM;Since the screen is shared by all running applications, changes made by aprogram to the palette registers on the graphics adapter affect not only theapplication's workspace, but the entire screen.andP;  Windows 3.0 gets around thiseffect by offering a device-independent method of addressing the screen thatrelies on one or more logical palettes, each of which specifies the colors tobe drawn in a device context.andP;  When the application draws, it does notspecify a color explicitly but instead uses the logical palette entries.andP;  TheWindows screen driver then takes care of matching the requested colors withthe colors in the system palette, which actually controls the screen display.andO;The palette manager always satisfies the requests of the foreground windowfirst to ensure that the active application will have the best color display.andO;It then matches the inactive applications as best it can.andM;In addition to the standard 16-color EGA and VGA drivers, Microsoft alsosupplies a 640 by 480 by 256-color driver for the Video Seven series ofhigh-resolution VGA graphics cards manufactured by Headland Technology.andP;  Ifyou have one of these cards installed in your PC, you can now display a muchwider range of colors without dithering--a feat considerably important inpresentation graphics programs and other applications that produce coloroutput.andM;Though high-resolution drivers have always been available for Windows,including this driver in the Windows 3.0 box sets a compatibility standardfor third parties to meet; hence it should make 256-color screen displays amore practical and reliable option for many people.andP;  Headland, which wrotethe driver in collaboration with Microsoft's Windows 3.0 development team,says that its driver code will be incorporated into Microsoft's Device DriverDevelopment kit for other graphics board vendors to use.andM;Other important facilities should show up in Windows in the next year or so.andO;Microsoft says the next version of Windows will have multimedia extensionsthat will endow the system software with facilities for handling high-qualitysound from CD-ROM XA disks.andP;  Microsoft's new TrueType scalable fonttechnology, which will give Windows (and Apple's Macintosh) many of the sameadvantages of Display PostScript and should finally make true WYSIWYGdisplays possible, may well be incorporated into the same release.andM;HEAD TO HEAD?andM;With all this power, it is reasonable to wonder if Windows 3.0 will steal thefire from the OS/2 Presentation Manager.andP;  After all, Windows 3.0 breaks the640K barrier, offers an advanced graphical user interface with expanded colorsupport, and in the future will offer scalable font technology, just likePresentation Manager.andP;  In fact, Windows 3.0's 386 enhanced mode offerspage-mode virtual memory and DOS application support that OS/2, being a286-based operating system, can't yet match.andP;  OS/2 has heftier RAM and diskappetites (though Windows 3.0 is not frugal in these matters, either).andP;  Aboveall, it suffers from the lack of software, printer, and device support thatcomes from being in a state of rapid change.andM;Yet OS/2 still offers notable technical advantages (see the sidebar &quot;Windows3.0 May be Neat .andP;  .  .  But OS/2 Is Even Better&quot;), and there is good reasonto believe in IBM and Microsoft's assertions that OS/2 will be the strategicoperating environment for critical systems of tomorrow.andP;  Moreover, thesuccess of Windows 3.0 in the next year will enhance, not detract from, thesuccess of OS/2 in the future.andP;  The big move is from the character-based tothe graphically based environment.andP;  Developers will find that with some care,they can leverage what they know about and what they have written for oneenvironment into the other.andP;  And users will be able to take advantage oftheir experience with Windows 3.0 to move easily to Presentation Manager,which offers a similar user interface.andM;TEETHING TROUBLESandM;Converting to Windows 3.0 won't be all roses.andP;  Though the program's longgestation period has left it remarkably bug-free for such a complex programand has given application and system software developers a head start, such aradical jump in technology can't help but come with its problems.andM;The new standard set by Windows 3.0 requires all drivers to be rewritten.andO;Though Windows 3.0 includes a comprehensive set of printer drivers, itsscreen drivers support resolution only up to 640 by 480 pixels.andP;  You'll needto get new drivers from your video board manufacturer if you want to use 800by 600 or 1,024 by 768 resolutions under Windows 3.0.andM;Similarly, count on upgrading your network drivers and shells: Novell andmost other vendors have released new versions to support Windows 3.0'snetworking features.andP;  In Novell's case, you can load the drivers directlyinto extended memory; otherwise you may face a RAM crunch.andP;  Windows 3.0 isincompatible with current versions of QEMM-386 and 386MAX, so you can't usethem to load your drivers into high memory.andM;Another thing to be wary of is Windows 3.0's acute sensitivity to minorhardware variations.andP;  The product comes with an impressive-looking list ofcertified compatible hardware, which names just about every major vendor inthe industry.andP;  But this masks the basic fact that the level of compatibilitywe've grown used to in the DOS world may not be enough for Windows 3.0.andP;  Ourexperience at PC Magazine has uncovered a number of hardware glitches,notably with 486 machines and with some hard disks that rely on the OnTrackDisk Manager to support disk partitions over 32MB.andP;  Most of theseincompatibilities will be gradually cleared up as hardware manufacturersadapt to the new environment, but brace yourself for a certain amount oftrouble in the transition period.andM;These caveats aside, Windows 3.0 is an easy choice to make.andP;  Windows hasbecome a mature product with a large installed base and a family ofapplications that can effectively replace and go far beyond traditionalcharacter-based technology.andP;  By exploiting some of the power of the 80386microprocessor, Windows offers an attractive upgrade from DOS with solidbackward compatibility.andP;  The time to move is now.andM;OUR CONTRIBUTORSandM;Brian Carr is the head of Brian Carr Computer Consulting Corp.
