Leaders ofthe four-month uprising in the occupied lands called for a ``day offirebombing'' later this month.   The army said five of those deported today were from the GazaStrip and three from the West Bank.   Israel deported four West Bank Palestinians on Jan. 13, sparkingprotests of the action as a violation of the Geneva Conventionsgoverning the treatment of citizens in occupied zones.   The army said deportation orders had been issued for 12 otherPalestinians from the territories occupied by Israel in the 1967Middle East War. The Palestinians ordered deported may appeal.   Israel has deported more than 1,000 Palestinians since 1967.   Six of the 12 ordered deported are from Beita, the site of aclash between Israeli teen-agers and Palestinians. Two Arabs and anIsraeli girl died in the melee.   Also today, Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip shutteredtheir stores and stayed home from jobs in Israel under PLO orders.   The army, meanwhile, promised the Supreme Court it would give 48hours notice before destroying more homes in Beita.   An army statement said the eight Palestinians who were deportedto Lebanon today were ``leading organizers and instigators of therecent violent public disturbances'' in the occupied territories.   The statement said those from Beita who were slated forexpulsion had played ``an active part in the attack'' on theIsraeli teen-agers, who were on a hiking expedition.   The army says it has destroyed 13 houses of villagers accused ofinciting the clash. Villagers claimed 23 houses hadbeen knockeddown.   The latest underground leaflet circulated in the occupied landspraised Beita for ``showing settlers a lesson'' during the incidentand called on Palestinians to raise money for ``the heroicvillage.'' As before, the leaflet was signed by the PalestineLiberation Organization.   The leaflet also congratulated Palestinians for refusing to meetwith Secretary of State George P. Shultz during his Middle Easttour. ``Your uprising stopped Shultz from his fake plan, and hewent back to his country as a big failure, without any of ourpeople having met him,'' the leaflet said.   Business came to a virtual standstill in towns and cities in theWest Bank and Gaza today as residents observed a commercial strike.   In Bethlehem, the central market was closed and tourist shopslining Manger Square were shuttered. No Arab taxis or buses wereoperating into or out of the town where Christians believe Jesuswas born.   A complete strike was also observed in Gaza City and the rest ofthe coastal strip, Palestinian reporters there said. Nablusresidents reported all stores in the city were closed, as werebusinesses in Arab east Jerusalem.   Residents of Bethlehem, Nablus and Gaza City said more than halfof the Arab workers who normally travel to jobs in Israel stayedhome.   The latest leaflet called for further commercial strikes onThursday and Saturday and for more days of protest honoring Arabskilled in the last four months. Israeli troops or settlers havekilled 141 Palestinans since violence broke out Dec. 8, accordingto U.N. figures. One Israeli soldier and one civilian have beenkilled during that time.   The leaflet called for a ``Palestine Molotov Day,'' referring tothe Molotov cocktails, or firebombs, often thrown by rioters atIsraeli targets.   ``(The day) is Palestine Molotov Day, as an answer to theauthorities position to give settlers the right to shoot at anyMolotov throwers.'' The leaflet designated April 21 as ``PalestineMolotov Day'' and called for a general strike the same day.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin was quoted last month as sayingIsraeli civilians could shoot at firebomb throwers if they had noother way to extricate themselves from a life-threatening situation.   The leaflet also told Palestinians to boycott Israeli products,especially during the monthlong Moslem holiday of Ramadan, whichbegins next weekend.   Debate continued today over the clash in Beita.   In a Supreme Court hearing on an appeal brought by the IsraeliCivil Rights Association, officials promised to give 48 hoursnotice before destroying any more homes in Beita and to givevillagers ``a reasonable amount of time'' to appeal.   Nili Arad, a state prosecutor, said the army had no immediateplans to destroy more homes in Beita. But she stressed that thearmy probe of the clash was not over and might turn up moresuspected inciters.   Ms. Arad said army policy was to provide a warning beforedemolitions unless an incident was considered ``particularlygrave.'' She said the Beita clash fell into that category.   The army is expected within a few days to release its findingson the Beita clash.   On Sunday, Jewish settlers and right-wing legislators criticizedthe army for saying Tirza Porat, 15, had been accidentally killedby a shot from a gun carried by a Jewish settler who was guardingthe teen-age hikers. They insisted she was shot by an Arab thatsome saw pointing a rifle from a rooftop.   Rabin told a weekly Cabinet session Sunday that an army autopsyshowed Miss Porat was apparently struck by a bullet from the M-16rifle of Romem Al Dubi, one of two settler guards who accompaniedthe teens on their hike near Beita.</TEXT></DOC>
