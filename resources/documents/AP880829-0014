KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two senators conclude in a new book that VicePresident George Bush endorsed the sale of weapons to Iran. Theysay he did so either out of loyalty to President Reagan or becausehe, too, ``was consumed'' with the idea of freeing Americanhostages.   Noting that the issue remains important ``because of Bush'squest for the presidency,'' Sens. William S. Cohen, R-Maine andGeorge Mitchell, D-Maine., say the central question is ``exactlywhat were his thoughts about the propriety of the covert actionitself, and what steps, if any did he take to satisfy himself aboutthe potential consequences to the United States if it wentforward.''   For those questions, they have no answers.   The two Maine senators were members of the Senate Iran-ContraCommittee which, with its House counterpart, conducted hearings inthe spring and summer of 1987 into the affair.   Bush has said that although he was generally aware of the secretsale of arms to Iran he was not involved in the implementation ofthe plan.   The two senators note that Bush has often said he was ``out ofthe loop'' on the operation and was not aware that it involved armsfor hostages until he was briefed by Sen. David Durenberger,R-Minn., then chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, onDec. 20, 1986, ``almost a month after the affair had becomepublic.''   In their book, ``Men of Zeal: A Candid Inside Story of theIran-Contra Hearings,'' the two senators recall testimony anddocumentary evidence indicating that Bush was present at manymeetings in which the secret arms sales were discussed.   They quote at length from a July 29, 1986, memo written byBush's aide, Craig Fuller, describing a meeting between the vicepresident and Amiran Nir, an Israeli government terrorism expertwhich essentially described the operation in arms-for-hostagesterms.   Mitchell and Cohen recount the early appearance of the issue inthe presidential race, noting that former Secretary of StateAlexander M. Haig Jr. and other presidential contenders continuallypressed Bush on the issue.   Haig, they noted, repeatedly asked this question: ``The Americanpeople are entitled to know what position he (Bush) took duringthis storm that imperiled our nation's interests. Was he thecopilot in the cockpit, or was he back in economy class?''   The two senators say, however, that the nature of the vicepresidency itself may have distanced Bush from the Iran-Contraaffair.   ``Once elected, the president and his top advisers relegate thevice president to the role of understudy, to be informed ofpolicies and events rather than actively involved in shapingthem,'' they write.   ``When the vice president seeks election to the presidency, theperception of the vice president as working at the president'sright hand is at war with his distance from real decision-making inthe White House.''   Bush has refused to disclose the substance of his discussionswith the president about the secret arms sales.   ``It is possible that in those conversations, Bush cautioned thepresident against selling weapons to the Iranians,'' they said.   But they say that whatever doubts may exist about the nature ofBush's role, Adm. John Poindexter, the former national securityadviser, ``was convinced that the vice president supported theinitiative.''   They quote from a Poindexter memo on Feb. 1, 1986, stating thatwhile some top officials still disagreed with the arms-for-hostagespolicy, ``President and VP are solid in taking the position that wehave to try.''   ``Vice President Bush considered himself to be on the peripheryof this major foreign policy decision _ in Haig's terms, more of apassenger than a copilot,'' Mitchell and Cohen said.   ``But we think it fair to say that, even if he were a copilot,his position would have remained the same,'' they said.   They note that in his heated exchange on the issue with CBSanchorman Dan Rather last Jan. 25, Bush said: ``I went along withit _ because you know why, Dan ... when I saw Mr. (William)Buckley, when I heard about Mr. Buckley being tortured to death,later admitted as a CIA chief. So if I erred, I erred on the sideof trying to get those hostages out of there.''   The two senators' conclusion: ``The vice president endorsed theweapons sale to Iran either out of loyalty to the president orbecause he, too, was consumed by the passion to obtain the freedomof the hostages.''</TEXT></DOC>
