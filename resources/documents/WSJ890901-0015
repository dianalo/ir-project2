The long-awaited ruling raised as many questions as it answered. It wasn't immediately clear, for instance, whether the award was stiff enough to deter future attempts by owners to prevent players from auctioning themselves to the highest bidder in a free and open market. &quot;I hope so,&quot; said Donald Fehr, head of the players union. &quot;But in the next round of bargaining {for a new labor agreement}, it's a good bet that players will ask for specific protection against collusion.&quot;    Mr. Fehr noted that the damages awarded by arbitrator Thomas Roberts could grow substantially in future hearings. Mr. Roberts assessed damages only for loss of salary, Mr. Fehr said. Still to be determined are whether players will collect more for the presumed loss of signing bonuses and other incentives, or for a player's lost opportunity to become a free agent, he added. Attorney's fees and interest also haven't been added in.    While the arbitrator didn't give the union all that it asked for, Mr. Fehr insisted that this was a &quot;substantial&quot; award that vindicated the union's position. He anticipates even larger damages in the separate collusion case filed on behalf of free agents after the 1986 season. In that year, far more big-name players were eligible for free agency than in the post-1985 bidding. According to someone familiar with the filings in the arbitration cases, the union has asked for as much as $100 million in damages in the 1986 case. In the 1985 case, the union asked for as much as $25.5 million.    Barry Rona, executive director of the owners' Player Relations Council, wouldn't comment on the substance of the ruling, but noted that the owners are &quot;sensitive to the fact that this is an issue we will have to address&quot; in future collective-bargaining talks. Mr. Rona said owners will seek a &quot;new baseball partnership based on a system of player compensation that is fair for all involved and in the inherent long-term interests of the game.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
