The House passed the Hate Crimes Statistics Act 383-29 onWednesday after overwhelmingly rejecting an attempt to removeattacks on homosexuals from the hate crimes list.   Peri Jude Radecic, a lobbyist for the National Gay and LesbianTask Force, said the action fell short of a step towards gay civilrights but was nevertheless encouraging.   ``Members of Congress have recognized that anti-gay andanti-lesbian violence is not acceptable in our society,'' she said.``They are on record as not condoning it.''   The measure passed by the House requires the Justice Departmentto collect and publish data on the incidence of crimes motivated byprejudice based on race, religion, ethnicity or homosexuality.Homicide, assault, robbery, burglary, theft, arson, vandalism,trespassing and threats would be tabulated.   The FBI publishes an annual Uniform Crime Report on a variety ofcrime based on information from some 16,000 state and local lawenforcement agencies. However, the report does not currentlyinclude a national count of hate crimes.   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of the House Judiciarysubcommittee on criminal justice, described a hate crime as ``anact of violence which is accompanied by an additional motive: anattempt to intimidate a larger group or class of people.''   ``It is important to document that cross burnings are more than`arson' and that swastikas painted on synagogues are more than`vandalism','' said Rep. Barbara Kennelly, D-Conn., sponsor of thebill.   Conyers, Kennelly and others said comprehensive national figureson crimes motivated by intolerance would enable law enforcementauthorities to spot trends in bigotry, develop enforcement andeducational strategies, and concentrate manpower in the rightplaces.   House debate centered on the inclusion of hate crimes committedagainst people on grounds of their sexual orientation, a provisionthat was not in a similar bill passed by the House in the lastCongress.   Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., argued that the provision wouldelevate homosexuals ``to a position higher than other people whoare in perhaps worse circumstances.''   He asked why the bill did not require separate data on crimesagainst octogenarians, child abuse victims, bus passengers andpolice officers killed in the line of duty. ``They are not includedhere and they're all protectable groups of people,'' Gekas said.   ``We are not talking about ... crimes committed againstpassengers on a bus,'' countered Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., one oftwo acknowledged homosexuals in Congress. ``There is nocenturies-old tradition of hatred against bus passengers,policemen, the handicapped or the young.''   Studds and others said hearings produced substantial evidencethat ``gay-bashing'' is frequent and on the rise, and in fact isthe most prevalent form of hate crime. They said deleting thatcategory from the bill would imply that violence against gays isacceptable.   The Gekas amendment was killed when the House voted 384-30 for asubstitute amendment that changed a phrase in the bill but had nosubstantive effect. The successful measure, sponsored by Rep. JohnMiller, R-Wash., replaced the phrase sexual orientation with a morespecific reference to homosexuality.   Supporters of the bill include the American Civil LibertiesUnion, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, several religiousgroups and organizations representing police officers,psychologists, homosexuals and women.   The Reagan administration opposes the measure, contending itsdata-collection requirements will be difficult and expensive tomeet, and be burdensome to law enforcement authorities.</TEXT></DOC>
