The proposed amendmentwould also incorporate revised 10 CFR 50 Appendix G limits. Included arechanges for: andbullet; Revised fluence projections which reflect results of measurementsand flux reduction achieved in refueling cycle 8. andbullet; Revised damage predictions which reflect the results of measurementsand the application of Regulatory Guide (R.G.) 1.99, Revision 2. andbullet; Revised Pressure-Temperature (P/T) limits developed followingthe requirements of 10 CFR 50 Appendix G. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendment dated December 2, 1988. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed change to the TS will incorporate the guidance provided inRevision 2 to Regulatory Guide 1.99, ``Radiation Embrittlement of ReactorVessel Materials,'' which became effective May 1988 and was discussed inGeneric Letter 88-11, ``NRC Position on Radiation Embrittlement of ReactorVessel Materials and its Impact on Plant Operations.'' Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revisions tothe TS. The proposed revisions provide up-to-date pressure/temperaturelimits for the operation of the reactor coolant system during heatup, cooldown,criticality, and hydrotest. These limits provide protection against pressurizedthermal shock of the reactor vessel, thereby cntributing to safety. Theproposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences of anyaccidents, no changes are being made in the types of any effluents thatmay be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowableindividual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly,the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significantradiological environmental impact. With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed changeto the TS involve systems located within the restricted area as definedin 10 CFR part 20. It does not affect non-radiological plant effluentsand has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant non-radiological environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed amendment. The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 23, 1989 (54 FR 3167). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice. Alternative to the Proposed Action Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement for the Maine Yankee Atomic PowerStation, dated July 1972. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact </ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.
