In accordance with the CooperativeAgreement, the Phase 1 40% Completion Review was held at the Barbertonfacilities of Babcock and Wilcox on April 28, 1988. Representatives ofDOE, EPA, the State of Ohio, B and W and Consol were in attendance todiscuss Phase 1 progress. Consol has essentially completed technologytransfer activities regarding the pilot process simulation tests. Onlya report remains to be completed. Detailed design activities continuedwith the instrumentation of the bypass and humidification chamber. Designof the Coolside sorbent and ash recycle system was emphasized. Consolcontinues to prepare a report on the waste characterization and run-offsimulation studies which are complete. The Environmental Monitoring PlanOutline was issued to the DOE in April, 1988. Under Phase 2 -- Construction,Shakedown and Start-Up, the humidifier lance parts were completed andfinal assembly was started. Erection of the bypass system flues and humidificationchamber was completed. Installation of the instrumentation for the humidifieris under way. Electrical transformers and switchgear are the items ofcritical importance in maintaining the schedule. 7 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
