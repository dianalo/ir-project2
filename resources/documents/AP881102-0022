The London-based human rights organization said in a report thattorture continued against suspected opponents despite thegovernment's signing in August of the U.N. Convention AgainstTorture.   Amnesty said it has reports that five Turkish prisoners,including a 13-year-old diabetic boy, died after torture in thefirst half of 1988.   The victims, Amnesty said, were among more than 250,000 Turksarrested for political reasons since 1980. Several thousandpolitical prisoners were still held, it added.   Amnesty said it has received more than 20 reports of prisonersbeing tortured since Turkey ratified the U.N. convention.   ``Torture continues, despite Turkey having signed and ratifiedthe United Nations Convention,'' the report said.   ``Torture is widespread. Anyone arrested for political reasons isat grave risk ... Young men and women are tortured in front of eachother. Parents are tortured in front of their children. Women heldhostage for their husbands are tortured.''   The report said torture methods include electric shocks,kickings, beating on the soles of the feet, sexual assault,suspension by wrists or ankles, and deprivation of food, drink andsleep.   Amnesty spokeswoman Daphne Davies said copies of the report werebeing sent to tour operators offering vacations in Turkey ``to givethem a full picture.''   The report said that under the elected government that took overin 1983, political prisoners were still being tried by militarycourts. It said state security courts, intended to replace militaryjustice, did not conduct fair trials. The preceding military regimehad seized power in a 1980 coup.   Of the political prisoners, Amnesty said ``some were convictedfor no more than expressing their opinions, many others because theyconfessed to crimes of which they were innocent to escape the agonyof torture.''   ``Most of these prisoners did not receive a fair trial. Some weresentenced to death. Today almost 200 people await a decision onwhether they will go to the gallows,'' the report added.   Among individual cases, Amnesty said Ibrahim Cicek, a member ofthe banned Revolutionary People's Union, said in a letter fromprison that he and two friends were doused with water and made tohold hands at an Istanbul police station in October 1987. Then anelectric current was turned on, passing through each of them andresulting in what he described as ``a choir of screams.''   The report said the diabetic teen-ager, Emin Ozkaya, died inhospital in January after detention at a police station in Finike,in southwest Turkey.   Immediately after the military coup, violence between rivalpolitical groups decreased but human rights abuses worsened, thereport said.   ``Tens of thousands of men and women were taken into custody.More than 30,000 were jailed in the first four months after thecoup. During the following years, Amnesty International receivedthousands of allegations of torture including reports of over 100deaths as a result of torture,'' the report said.   ``People from most sectors of... society were put on trial,teachers for their lessons, writers for their books, journalists forarticles they had written, trade unionists for organizing workers,Kurds for separatist activities, religious leaders for theirsermons, students for attending seminars. Even lawyers have beenarrested and imprisoned for defending their clients,'' it said.   Amnesty said its sources of information include victims, theirrelatives, lawyers, journalists and medical, legal and human rightsaassociations with which it established contact during fact-findingvisits to Turkey.</TEXT></DOC>
