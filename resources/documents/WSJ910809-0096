In reality,politicians are always begging central bankers to spike thepunch.   In today's Washington, everyone from Congress to the WhiteHouse to the media is begging America's central bank, theFederal Reserve, to pour quarts of vodka (money) into theweak U.S. economy. If a little inflation results, they imply,the party will be worth the hangover. The rest of us arelucky that Wayne Angell is clean and sober at the Fed.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Angell called this week to explain why he supportedTuesday's modest Fed easing in the money supply, even thoughhe'd opposed a similar move only last April. His thinkingmatters because he's recently earned a reputation as theFed's hard-money governor. This is ironic, because only a fewyears ago he was feared as an easy-money man.   Mr. Angell hasn't changed, but Washington's policyfashions have. Reaganomics no longer controls the field;something else (Darmanomics?) does, a combination of highertaxes, higher spending, expanding regulation, and pleadingfor easy money to dull the resulting pain. The specter of the1970s is haunting the Bush economy.   Fiscal policy is frozen by last fall's budget accord. Sothe debate at the Fed is the most significant in town. Therestraint of Mr. Angell and (some of) his fellow Fedgovernors has been the only thing holding out hope of lowerinterest rates and a sustained economic recovery. In a sense,Mr. Angell is official Washington's last supply sider.   A voluble Kansan, Mr. Angell was irked to read thefinancial press describe the Fed's easing this week as anattempt to stimulate &quot;the real economy.&quot; Not at all, he says;this is Phillips Curve thinking, the discredited but stillpopular theory that faster economic growth requires atradeoff with higher inflation. &quot;I think it's just theopposite,&quot; Mr. Angell says: Low inflation creates anenvironment in which the economy can grow even faster.   Mr. Angell adds that if Americans who remember the 1970sget a hint that the Fed will tolerate faster inflation, theirexpectation will immediately be built into higher long-term(three-year to 30-year) bond prices. Such a rise could swampthe still fragile recovery that the easy-money crowd claimsto want. Mr. Angell's goal is to get long-rates as low aspossible, since those are the rates that affect home-mortgageand other big-ticket purchases.   The one-time wheat farmer has credibility because in Aprilhe issued a lonely dissent from the Fed's last easing. &quot;Ifelt we still had some inflation numbers that were not whatwe wanted,&quot; he says. &quot;It was by and large a timing question.&quot;   This week those numbers looked much better. He predictsthat the annual increase in producer prices is now headingdown to 3% or less. The prices of gold, the dollar andcommodities -- his other lodestars -- also seem stable.   So when Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan called this week todiscuss easing, Mr. Angell was ready to assent. His judgmentwas well borne out in the stock and long bond markets, whichrallied with the Fed move. The same markets had reactedcoolly to April's easing.   A few analysts claim to be &quot;uneasy&quot; about this week's Fedeasing too. &quot;They're moving ahead of the markets,&quot; warnsLarry Kudlow of Bear Stearns. But Mr. Angell's assentsuggests that at least the Fed is not playing patsy toeasy-money politicians. To put it another way, the officialslobbying the Fed for faster growth to re-elect President Bushare too obtuse to understand that Mr. Angell is offering thebest way to do it.   Mr. Angell is especially impatient with those who say alittle inflation -- 4% or so -- is really no big deal. At 4%inflation, the U.S. price level doubles every 18 years. &quot;Do Iwant to tell people who put their savings in U.S. financialassets that we're going to cheat them out of half of it every18 years? Is that an acceptable stewardship?&quot; he asks. &quot;Howcan I say it is acceptable policy to cheat anyone out ofanything?&quot;   This doesn't mean he dislikes economic &quot;growth.&quot; For thenext six months he forecasts 2% real growth, which is betterthan many expect. His point is that the goal of monetarypolicy is to keep inflation in check; it's the job of otherpolicies to promote growth.   Those policies include reducing the cost of capital byending the double tax on dividends, or by cutting -- he evensays the now taboo words -- the capital-gains tax. He sayssuch changes are needed to increase the supply of capital andcreate the growth that will raise real wages. &quot;I never worryabout capitalists,&quot; Mr. Angell says. &quot;I worry about workers.&quot;   Mr. Angell's prairie roots have given him a populist edgesorely lacking in most Republicans these days. In his grandFed office, amid the computer screens and financial books,hangs a photograph of a plains landscape and a &quot;one-discplow&quot; as evocative as a Wyeth painting. The plow was inventedby his grandfather, who also took the photograph.   Such roots teach the lesson that inflation is badeconomics, but also bad politics because it destroys theconfidence of the middle class. It's a lesson otherRepublicans might relearn.</TEXT></DOC>
