That compares with last year's net of $384 million, or$1.19 a share. Revenue grew 2.4% to $4.99 billion from $4.87billion.</LP><TEXT>   For the first half, net income fell 8.2% to $535 million,or $1.65 a share; sales rose 4.7% to $9.41 billion.   Kodak apparently expects similar sluggishness in thesecond half. Kodak officials told analysts yesterday thecompany would be &quot;challenged&quot; to meet the previous year'ssecond-half earnings levels. That would require the imagingand information units to &quot;take advantage of the expectedrecovery in the U.S. economy,&quot; Chairwoman Kay Whitmore said.   Despite that outlook, the latest results cheered mostanalysts, who had estimated earnings might be as low as $1.02a share. In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange,Kodak common stock was quoted at $40.875, up 25 cents.   Analysts had low expectations for the quarter partlybecause Kodak had indicated it would aggressively increaseresearch and development spending as well as film advertisingbudgets in hopes of gaining market share later. But sales andadministrative expenses were up 7% from a year earlier, asmaller increase than expected. &quot;It shows that management isbeing a little more flexible and a little more bottom-lineoriented,&quot; said Smith Barney analyst Peter J. Enderlin.   Of Kodak's four operating units, the health unit, whichmakes pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, posted thebiggest gain. World-wide sales jumped 13% to $1.21 billionwhile profit rose to $175 million from $151 million a yearearlier.   The big surprise, though, came in its core imagingbusiness, where sales fell 3% to $1.89 billion and profitslid to $409 million from $481 million a year earlier.   Kodak said camera sales world-wide were down&quot;substantially,&quot; while domestic 35mm film sales were flat,and color film sales were down slightly world-wide. Kodakattributed the drop to cautious dealers who are reducingtheir inventories while waiting for an economic recovery.   The troubled information unit, which sells data storageand retrieval equipment and photocopiers, posted a modestprofit of $19 million on revenue of $1 billion. While that'slower than the previous year's net of $36 million on revenueof $1.03 billion, it's a big improvement over recentquarters. Last quarter the unit earned a paltry $1 millionand in the quarter before it had a $28 million loss before acharge.   In Kodak's chemicals unit, sales rose 5% to $958 million.But the gain was offset by higher costs, causing net incometo fall 14% to $151 million.</TEXT></DOC>
