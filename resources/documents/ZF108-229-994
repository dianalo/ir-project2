 TrueType lets fontdesigners write their own 'hint' algorithms for drawing andscaling fonts instead of using Adobe's proprietary scheme.andP;  It ismore elegant but will not be available until late 1990.andP;  Laserprinter users will have more font types to choose from, butensuring interoperability will be difficult.andP;  Users should stickwith PostScript until the future of the new font technologies isclear.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     FontsDesktop PublishingLaser printersCompetitionPage Description LanguagesUser NeedsPurchasesGuidelinesMarket Analysis.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By David StromandM;and Diane BernardandM;The font strategies announced by IBM, Microsoft Corp. and Adobe Systems Inc.andO;last week drew the battle lines between three major font-scalingtechnologies.andM;While buyers can expect a rich selection of less costly fonts to emerge overthe next year, these fonts will be difficult to implement and manage --especially early on.andP;  The result is that most users will stick with the triedand true -- Adobe's PostScript.andM;In a nutshell, IBM plans to include Adobe's Type 1 font algorithm in itsSystems Application Architecture (SAA) and future OS/2 releases, whileMicrosoft plans to add TrueType, a font-scaling technology jointly developedby Apple Computer Inc., to future versions of Windows and OS/2 (see relatedstory, Page 1).andP;  Added to this confusion is Hewlett-Packard Co.'s recentinclusion of Agfa Compugraphic Division's Intellifont to its new LaserJet IIIprinters.andM;Adobe's Type 1 font algorithm is an intricate part of PostScript, the defacto page-description language in the Macintosh and PC world.andP;  PostScript,however, has been plagued by lackluster printing performance.andP;  And only lastweek did Adobe loosen its hold on the keys to its Type 1 kingdom bydistributing the font-algorithm specifications.andM;Agfa's Intellifont is included in HP's latest incarnation of its printercommand language, PCL version 5, which could prove an important beachhead forPC users.andP;  However, Intellifont is at a disadvantage because it does not yethave an installed base.andM;TrueType has the edge in architectural elegance, but it won't be availableuntil later this year.andP;  This technology lets font designers write their ownalgorithms, called &quot;hinting,&quot; for drawing and scaling fonts, which frees themfrom the proprietary schemes of Type 1 and Intellifont.andM;Apple officials have said that TrueType will be part of Macintosh System 7.0-- the next version of Apple's operating system -- and Microsoft plans toinclude TrueType (and a standard set of fonts) in OS/2 version 2.0 and in afuture version of Windows.andP;  This has an attractive simplicity, if all worksas advertised.andM;Confusion for Printer UsersandM;For laser printer users this means more font faces and more confusion.andP;  Typevendors, such as Bitstream Inc., have stated that they will make their fontscompatible with all three technologies.andM;Moreover, users will have to work harder to ensure interoperability betweentheir printers and graphics software.andP;  Owners of HP printers who areinterested in printing Type 1 or TrueType fonts, for example, will needspecial printer cartridges.andM;A further complication arises since neither IBM, Microsoft, HP nor Adobe havedevised plans for managing printers shared via a LAN.andM;As usual, IBM and Microsoft are serving different masters and leaving theuser to mediate between the two.andP;  By the end of the year, TrueType will bepart of Microsoft's OS/2 version 2.0.andP;  However, IBM's version of OS/2 willsupport both Type 1 and TrueType.andP;  Details on how this will work, or whetheradditional third-party software will be required for LaserJet printers, werenot made clear at last week's announcements.andM;A third implication for users is that the added competition will bring aboutlower prices for fonts and printers, and improve links to phototypesetters.andM;The bottom line for users: Stick with PostScript until the smoke clears.andO;Before these new font technologies can be tested, new operating-systemversions and printer drivers must be made available.andP;  Don't expect to seeanything concrete before the end of this year.andM;----------Additional analysis by David Dean, who writes a monthly column on fonts forPC Publishing magazine.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
