The changes to the Technical Specifications (TS) are required to reflecta revised safety analysis that includes the use of fuel designed and fabricatedby Advanced Nuclear Fuels Corporation (ANF). Fuel designed and fabricatedby ANF has not been previously utilized for Millstone Unit 2.Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission willhave made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended(the Act) and the Commission's regulations.The Commission has made a proposed determination that the request for amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulationsin 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordancewith the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety.As part of the licensee's submittal dated November 15, 1988, the licensee/(orNNECO) has addressed the various technical issues related to the ``No SignificantHazards Consideration'' criteria of 10 CFR 50.92. The licensee has statedthat the proposed changes to the TS would not:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously analyzed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">ANF reviewed all SRP Chapter 15 accidents and transients to determinewhich events need to be reanalyzed for Cycle 10, assuming a mixed coreor a core containing only ANF fuel. As a result, ANF reanalyzed all ofthe nonradiological events currently in Chapter 14 of the Millstone UnitNo. 2 FSAR. On the basis of this review, NNECO concludes that there isno significant increase in the probability or consequences of any of theseevents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With respect to calculated consequences, ANF specifically reanalyzedthe impact of the events on relevant key parameters associated with theplant response to the event (i.e., assessments of consequences were notrestricted to dose assessments). The parameters analyzed all relate tothe boundary performance during the accident. In all cases, the valuesof the relevant parameters remain below applicable acceptance criteriaand there are no impacts on the protective boundaries. NNECO thereforeconcludes that the proposed amendment does not involve a significant increasein consequences of any event previously analyzed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Specifically, both large- and small-break LOCA safety analyses wereperformed to support the proposed amendment. The results of the large-breakECCS analysis indicated that the limiting break size is the 0.6 [doubleended cold leg guillotine (DECLG)] break. The maximum peak clad temperature(PCT) for the DECLG, including consideration of end-of-cycle coastdown,is 2176anddegrees;F. This PCT value remains within the ECCS acceptance criteriaof 10 CFR 50, Appendix K. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The small-break LOCA analysis indicated the limiting break size, withsymmetric steam generator tube plugging, is the 1.9% break. The PCT forthis case was calculated to be 1811anddegrees;F with a maximum local claddingoxidation of 4.17%. The results for asymmetric steam generator tube pluggingat the limiting break size are similar to the results for symmetric tubeplugging, with the PCT being slightly higher for the symmetric tube pluggingcase. Again, these values remain well within the Appendix K ECCS acceptancecriteria.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The steamline break analysis involved a calculation of the expectedasymmetric thermal hydraulic and neutronic core characteristics resultingfrom this accident. Specifically, fuel response was evaluated against fuelfailure criteria for four scenarios, assuming both availability of off-sitepower and loss of off-site power. The hot zero power (HZP) scenario withloss of off-site power was determined to be the most limiting in this analysisfrom an MDNBR standpoint. In no scenario evaluated, however, does fuelfailure occur as a result of penetration of the MDNBR safety limit. AnHZP scenario with off-site power available was determined to be the mostlimiting in the analysis from the standpoint of centerline melt. However,again this case does not represent a significant increase in consequencesas there remains margin to the fuel centerline melt limit (maximum LHGR).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, a non-LOCA transient event analysis was also performed insupport of Millstone Unit No. 2 operation with ANF reload fuel, and a dispositionof events for Cycle 10 provided in the SAFETY ASSESSMENT. All anticipatedoperational occurrences were shown to result in no significant increasein either DNB, fuel centerline melt, deposited enthalpy, or radiologicalconsequences. The postulated accidents were also shown to meet all appropriateacceptance criteria. With respect to the fuel centerline melt, depositedenthalpy and radiological consequences, the rod ejection and rod withdrawalfrom subcritical accidents show increases in consequences due to the increasein rod worth related to the increase in shutdown margin and also due tothe increase in the allowable radial peaking factor. However, . . . . theseincreases are not significant in that they do not challenge the acceptancecriteria for deposited enthalpy, fuel centerline melt, or off-site dosesdue to fuel failure. With respect to DNB, the increases are not significantin that they do not violate the 95/95 acceptance criteria. In total, therefore,NNECO concludes that the proposed change does not involve a significantincrease in consequences of any accident previously analyzed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With respect to probability of an accident previously analyzed, thereis no change in the probability of occurrence of any design basis accident.Further, there are no changes or failure modes associated with the proposedamendment that will increase the probability of an accident to the pointwhere it should be considered within the design basis. Therefore, in thisrespect, no significant hazard consideration is involved.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany previously analyzed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As a result of the proposed use of ANF fuel and the proposed amendment,there will be no change to plant response. The plant will respond for allevents in a manner similar to that previously analyzed. . . . The onlychanges identified in the reanalysis of Chapter 14 events relate to theimpact of certain transients on parameters related to boundary performance.There are no changes to the basic trends the transients follow.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thus, there are no failure modes associated with the proposed changethat could represent a new unanalyzed accident.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, there is no change in the probability of occurrence ofany design basis accident. There are also no changes or new failure modesassociated with the changes that will increase the probability of an accidentor transient to the point where it should be considered to be within thedesign basis. Therefore, NNECO concludes that the proposed changes do notcreate any new or different kind of accident from those previously analyzed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Involve a significant reduction in any margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As discussed above, the accident reanalysis performed to support theproposed change included all nonradiological events currently in Chapter14 of the Millstone Unit 2 FSAR. The analysis specifically focused on theimpact of these accidents and transients on key parameters related to protectiveboundary performance. On the basis of this review, NNECO is able to concludethat the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction inany margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Specifically, as discussed above, the proposed changes do involvesome nonsignificant changes in consequences. This is reflected in the changein some parameters relative to Technical Specification bases. However,these changes are largely due to (a) methodology differences between theaccident analyses performed by the previous vendor, Westinghouse, and thatof the new vendor, ANF; (b) changes to or deletion of an LCO or LSSs, resultingin a corresponding change in Technical Specification bases; and (c) minorclarifications. However, in all cases where there are increases in thelimiting value of a parameter, the value remains below the applicable safetylimit and therefore does not affect the ability of the boundary to performits function.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The changes in boundary parameters, discussed above, may be summarizedas follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The limiting large break LOCA resulted in a PCT of 2163 anddegrees;F.The PCT for a 12 anddegrees;F reduction in primary coolant temperature resultedin a PCT of 2176 anddegrees;F. These values do not involve a significantreduction in margin for any acceptance criterion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The limiting small break LOCA resulted in a PCT of 1811 anddegrees;F,with symmetric steam generator tube plugging. The PCT with asymmetric pluggingwas slightly lower. These values do not involve a reduction in any acceptancelimit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Fuel response was evaluated for the steam line break events.In no scenario evaluated was fuel failure calculated to occur as a resultof exceeding the MDNBR acceptance limit or the maximum LHGR.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The rod ejection and rod withdrawal from subcritical accidentsresult in increases in relevant parameters due to the proposed increasein rod worth and the increase in the allowable radial peaking factor. However,as discussed above, there is no reduction in margin of safety because theparameters do not exceed existing acceptance criteria for deposited enthalpy,fuel centerline melt, or for off-site doses due to fuel failure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Accidents with DNB criteria may show consequence increasedue to the need to rely on statistical methodologies. However, there isno reduction in the margin of safety because the 95/95 acceptance criteriais met in all cases.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In summary, the proposed amendment does not involve any significantreduction in a margin of safety and, therefore, does not involve a significanthazard consideration.</ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed and concurs in the licensees ``No SignificantHazard Consideration'' findings; therefore, based on the above considerations,the Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment requestinvolves no significant hazards considerations.The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing.Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L StreetNW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene are discussed below.By February 23, 1989, the licensee may file a request for a hearing withrespect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operatinglicense and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceedingand who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file awritten petition for leave to intervene. Request for a hearing and petitionsfor leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filedby the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board,designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety andLicensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and theSecretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issuea notice of hearing or an appropriate order.As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) Thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above.Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendments under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party.Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards considerations. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held.If the final determination is that the request for amendment involves nosignificant hazards considerations, the Commission may issue the amendmentand make it effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearingheld would take place after issuance of the amendment.If a final determination is that the amendment involves significant hazardsconsiderations, any hearing held would take place before the issuance ofany amendment.Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards considerations. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received. Should the Commission take thisaction, it will publish a notice of issuance and provide for opportunityfor a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to takethis action will occur very infrequently.A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitions arefiled during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to John F. Stolz: (petitioner'sname and telephone number), (date petition was mailed), (plant name), and(publication date and page number of this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice). A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry and Howard,One Constitution Plaza, Hartford, Connecticut 06103.Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or theAtomic Safety and Licensing Board designated to rule on the petition and/orrequest, that the petitioner has made a substantial showing of good causefor the granting of a late petition and/or request. That determinationwill be based upon a balancing of the factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v)and 2.714(d).For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated November 15, 1988, which is available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L StreetNW., Washington, DC, and at the Waterford Public Library, 49 Rope FerryRoad, Waterford, Connecticut 06385.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 18th day of January 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">David H.
