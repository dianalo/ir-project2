The plea offer was made at a meeting briefly attended by U.S.Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, according to the papers filedlast month by Richard A. Hibey.   ``The attorney general started the meeting by advising us thatthe president was aware that the meeting was taking place, and whatwould be conveyed to us during the conference had the president'sfull knowledge and approval,'' Hibey said.   On Oct. 21, 1988, three days after the meeting, the deposedPhilippine leader and his wife were charged in a racketeeringindictment with stealing more than $100 million from theircountry's treasury and using the money to buy artwork, real estateand jewelry in the United States.   Marcos died Sept. 28. The trial of Mrs. Marcos and co-defendantsincluding Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi is scheduled to beginMarch 14 in U.S. District Court.   The plea offer was made by then-U.S. Attorney Rudolph W.Giuliani, who is now the Republican candidate for mayor, andAssistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella, the papers said.   The president's personal attention in a criminal case isunusual, but the White House does get involved in sensitive mattersthat have implications for foreign policy, government officialssaid.   Justice Department spokesman Dave Runkel and Reagan's spokesman,Mark Weinberg, declined to comment on the case because it ispending in the courts.   After Thornburgh left the meeting, Giuliani described a``non-negotiable proposal with respect to the disposition ofproposed charges against our clients,'' Hibey said.   Giuliani said he would go forward with the indictment unless theMarcoses agreed to his proposal by the end of the business day ofOct. 20, 1988, according to Hibey. He did not provide any detailsof the government's proposal.   LaBella declined to comment on Hibey's account.   Published reports at the time of the indictment, citingunidentified sources, said the offer called for Marcos to forfeitmillions of dollars worth of real estate, artwork and jewelry inreturn for a recommendation that he be spared prison.   Hibey's statement was filed in connection with a pretrial motionseeking thousands of confidential government documents that Mrs.Marcos' lawyers say they need to defend her.   Another Marcos attorney, John Bartko, who was also at themeeting, said in a separate statement that Mrs. Marcos' lawyerswere seeking documents that might show prior U.S. knowledge of theMarcoses' allegedly illegal behavior; knowledge that the Marcoseshad substantial assets other than those in the indictment; and U.S.participation in the overthrow of the Marcos regime.   In response papers, LaBella called the motion ``a witch's brewconcocted to stultify this prosecution in a bewildering search for`evidence' that is irrelevant to this fraud case.''   U.S. District Judge John Keenan has not ruled on the request.</TEXT></DOC>
