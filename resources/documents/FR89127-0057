This standard will facilitatethe interchange of documents among different document systems.Prior to submission of this proposed standard to the Secretary of Commercefor review and approval as a FIPS, it is essential to assure that considerationis given to the needs and views of manufacturers, the public, and Stateand local governments. The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views.This proposed FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section,which provides information concerning the applicability, implementation,and maintenace of the standard; and (2) a specifications section, whichdeals with the technical requirements of the standard. Only the announcementsection of the standard is provided in this notice. Interested partiesmay obtain a copy of the technical specifications from the Standards Coordinator(ADP), Technology Building, Room B-64, National Institute of Standardsand Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975-2816.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments on this proposed FIPS must be received on or beforeApril 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Written comments concerning the adoption of this standardas a FIPS should be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology,ATTN: Proposed FIPS for DAP/ODA, Technology Building, Room B-154, Gaithersburg,MD 20899.Written comments received in response to this notice will be made partof the public record and will be made available for inspection and copyingin the Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, Room 6628, HerbertC.

The DAP isa functional subset of the ODA standard and facilitates the interchangeof documents among different document systems by specifying the constraintson document structure and content according to the rules of the ODA Standard.Several levels of DAPs are being developed by the standards community;level 3 applies to ``desktop publishing'' functionality used in documentprocessing systems.Developed by international standards organizations, the ODA Standard specifiesrules for describing the logical and layout structures of documents aswell as rules for specifying character, raster, and geometric content ofdocuments, thus providing for the interchange of complex documents. Theforms of the interchanged documents may be formatted form (i.e., for presentationsuch as printing, displaying), processable form (i.e., for further processingsuch as editing) and formatted processable (i.e., for both presentationand further processing). The ODA Standard was developed primarily by theInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the ConsultativeCommittee on International Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT). The ImplementationAgreement for this DAP was reached by vendors and users of computer networksparticipating in the NIST Workshop for Implementors of Open Systems Interconnection.<T3>Approving authority. </T3>Secretary of Commerce.<T3>Maintenance agency. </T3>U.S. Department of Commerce, National Instituteof Standards and Technology.<T3>Cross index. </T3>a. International Organization for Standardization(ISO) 8613-1988, Information Processing_Text and Office Systems-OfficeDocument Architecture (ODA) and Interchange Format Standard.b. Stable On-going Implementation Agreements for Open Systems InterconnectionProtocols, NIST Workshop for Implementors of Open Systems Interconnection,to be published.<T3>Related documents. </T3>Related documents are listed in the ReferenceSection of the Document Application Profile.<T3>Objectives. </T3>The primary objectives of this standard are:_To promote interchange of documents between systems of different manufacturers,_To facilitate the use of advanced technology by the Federal Government,_To stimulate the development of commercial products compatible with theODA Standard and with the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Standards,_To contribute to the economic and efficient use of document processingsystem resources, and_To avoid the proliferation of vendor-unique solutions.<T3>Applicability. </T3>The ODA Document Application Profile (DAP) is intendedto be used by Federal Government agencies when acquiring document/textprocessing systems. This FIPS applies to systems ranging from relativelysimple wordprocessors to more complex document processors, such as ``desktoppublishing'' systems. Each system acquired by Federal agencies shall includeappropriate system-to-DAP and DAP-to-system translators, such that incomingdatastreams are interpreted correctly and that outgoing datastreams aregenerated correctly. Use of the DAP is independent of the communicationsused to transfer documents produced by these systems; that is, the DAPmay be used within the existing framework of communication protocols.<T3>Specifications. </T3>Document Application Profile (affixed).<T3>Implementation. </T3>This standard is effective (six months after dateof publication of final document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>). For a period of twelve (12) months after theeffective date, agencies are permitted to acquire alternative softwarewhich provides equivalent functionality to the Document Application Profile.Agencies are encouraged to use this standard for solicitation proposalsfor new document processing systems to be acquired after the effectivedate. This standard is mandatory for use in all solicitation proposalsfor new document processing products acquired twelve (12) months afterthe effective date.<T3>Waivers. </T3>Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads ofFederal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal InformationProcessing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate suchauthority only to a senior official designated pursuant to section 3506(b)of Title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only when:a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishmentof the mission of an operator of a Federal computer system, orb. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is notoffset by Governmentwide savings.Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the informationdetailed above. Agency heads may also act without a written waiver requestwhen they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot bemet. Agency heads may approve waivers only by a written decison which explainsthe basis on which the agency head made the required finding(s). A copyof each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portionsclearly identified, shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards andTechnology; Attn: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building, Room B-154;Gaithersburg, MD 20899.In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authorityto approve waivers shall be sent promptly to the Committee on GovernmentOperations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on GovernmentalAffairs of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.When the determination on a waiver applies to the procuremnet of equipmentand/or services, a notice of the waiver determination must be publishedin the <T3>Commerce Business Daily </T3>as a part of the notice of soliciationfor offers of an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made afterthat notice is published, by amendment to such notice.A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approvingthe waiver and any supporting and accompanying documents, with such deletionsas the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5 U.S.C. 552(b),shall be part of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency.<T3>Where to Obtain Copies. </T3>Copies of this publication are for saleby the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce,Springfield, VA 22161.
