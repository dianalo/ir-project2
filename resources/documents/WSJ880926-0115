But the very fact this strategy-steering committee of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is meeting, with all five members present, is likely to have a firming effect on oil markets today, analysts said.    Prices dropped Friday on a sharp sell-off on rumors the committee might not go ahead with its Madrid meeting and that even if it did, Saudi Arabia's oil minister wouldn't be there. On the U.S. futures market, West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery closed Friday at $14.18 a barrel, down 47 cents, as a result of the rumors. That followed earlier, smaller declines of 10 cents to 20 cents a barrel for North Sea Brent prices on European spot markets.    The rumors were baseless. Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, is attending the meeting in the Spanish capital. And so are the four others -- the ministers from Nigeria, Algeria, Venezuela and Indonesia -- along with their aides.    But, having failed to keep the site of their meeting secret, the ministers generally evaded the press at yesterday's opening, which was held at Indonesia's embassy in Madrid. Official OPEC sources said the ministers didn't want to work under pressure.    The word from ministerial aides was that the initial session centered on the world oil market report, a formal welcome of Venezuela's new oil minister, Julio Cesar Gil, who is attending his first OPEC meeting, and the selection of issues to be further discussed at today's meeting. These issues are excess production by some OPEC members; output that is outside the quota system, including that from Iraq and from the so-called Neutral Zone shared by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait; the definition of &quot;crude oil&quot; for establishing individual-country ceilings, and a fresh look at possible joint efforts with non-OPEC exporters in trimming the glut.    In Vienna, Gonzalo Plaza, a senior OPEC official, said that the price committee will resume deliberations today. He said the meeting likely won't last longer than the scheduled two days because Mr. Gil of Venezuela is due in Washington on Wednesday. </TEXT></DOC>
