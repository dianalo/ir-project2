In fact, Jack isn't here yet because Mr. Workinger's flight from Baltimore is 20 minutes early. It would have been even earlier if the plane hadn't waited several minutes for a gate.    As airlines build more time into their schedules to leave room for things that can go wrong between here and there, an unexpected side effect emerges: when everything goes right, planes can come in too early.    On a recent afternoon at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, for example, nearly three dozen United Airlines flights were projected to arrive 10 or more minutes ahead of schedule.    Agreed, this isn't a big problem, and outraged passengers aren't inundating the airlines with complaints about early flights. Congress isn't even likely to hold hearings in an effort to solve the problem. But passengers and people greeting them are finding they have to make adjustments because increasingly, some flights are arriving ahead of schedule.    Things went so well for American Flight 115 the other day that the airline had to keep moving up the projected arrival time and change gates to accommodate the premature landing. Families awaiting the flight scurried to keep up. But with an eight-minute walk from the first announced gate to the last, the plane won the race.    Passengers and those picking them up aren't the only ones left scrambling. At peak travel times, airlines often don't have gates or workers available to handle premature arrivals. &quot;A trip getting there too early is as much of a problem as one getting in too late,&quot; says one airline official. </TEXT></DOC>
