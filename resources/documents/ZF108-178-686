who saw the potential of PCsback in the late '70s.andP;  A 1974 computer science grad, he made his livingfirst as a COBOL programmer, then as an early IMS user, later becoming an IBMQuery-By-Example convert.andP;  But after-hours he explored dBASE II on his PC.andM;Tarbox admits sharing his DP colleagues' opinion that PC database managementsystems (DBMSs) simply weren't ready for prime time.andP;  &quot;They lacked thenecessary tools to perform mission critical tasks.andP;  They didn't offertransaction logging or rollback/rollforward.andP;  They didn't even try to enforcereferential integrity.andP;  We all know that some early PC DBMSs, billed asrelational, really weren't.&quot;andP;  What differentiates Tarbox from his colleaguesis that Tarbox didn't write off PCs forever as toys.andP;  He sensed their latentpower, keeping an eye on their evolution as serious database managementplatforms.andM;Tarbox established Canaan Analytics (New Castle, Delaware), a smallconsulting firm specializing in systems for banks, brokerages, and otherfinancial instiutions.andP;  He usually provided mainframe- and/or PC-basedsolutions to clients' needs.andM;When Tarbox purchased the SQL Server SDK (Software Development Kit) lastJanuary, he had &quot;reasonable expectations that an array of front ends would beforthcoming.&quot;andP;  His primary interest was in Microsoft's Excel as a front end,preferably in Windows.andP;  (LAN Manager-based SQL Server applications can haveeither DOS or OS/2 workstations attached to the server.)andM;His programming team includes Dave Hart, a veritable &quot;whiz kid&quot; whose firstarticle (an in-depth look at Microsoft Windows) was published in Bytemagazine at age 17.andP;  Hart, a C programmer, wrote a custom interface allowingthe Presentation Manager version of Excel to work against SQL Server.andP;  (As ofpress time, Microsoft had also written such an interface, but hasn't made itavailable commercially).andP;  &quot;It wasn't that hard.&quot;andP;  Hart said.andP;  &quot;SQL Servercomes with sample code showing you how to interface to Windows, PM, or OS/2text made.&quot;andM;Tarbox was motivated to explore the database server market, when a clientwanted &quot;to access, capture, store, and retrieve financial and other data offthe wire services--real time and in a LAN environment.&quot;andP;  The client wantedits money management analysts to be able to query the database about avariety of criteria, and to find stories or data about a certain companywithin a certain time frame.andM;Tarbox realized that OS/2 might be just the operating system for thismultiuser application.andP;  &quot;DOS supply isn't suitable for multiuserapplications, he explained.andP;  &quot;A database engine needs to be multi-threadedfor high perfurmance.&quot;andP;  Multithreading operating systems offer significantadvantages over operating systems like DOS, A DHMS taking advantage of OS/2'smultithreading can run two or more separate routines on a single databasesimultaneously.andP;  Tarbox sensed that OS/2 might provide a PC-1 based solutionto his client's problem, a problem that traditionaily would have been tackledwith nothing smaller than a minicomputer.andM;The alternativesandM;During the summer of 1988.andP;  Tarbox explored ORACLE which he perceived as oneof the first &quot;real relational DBMSs on a PC.&quot;andP;  Because his client wanted theMicrosoft Windows interface, ORACLE was abandoned in favor of SQL Server.andO;&quot;The Sybase engine [the engine on which the AshtonTate/Microsoft SQL Serveris based] represented a mature product,&quot; Tarbox said.andM;The solutionandM;Hart and Tarbox worked together to create a system their client's financialanalysts use for making decisions on investments for the organization's largeportfolio.andP;  The analysts can access data stored in a database with plannedmulti-megabyte capacity using either Excel or Focus.andP;  Focus, a reputable DBMSin its own right, &quot;has a great report writer,&quot; said Tarbox, whose expertisewith Focus goes back over 10 years.andP;  Focus is also a convenient front-end fornon-Presentation Manager OS/2 workstations.andM;Both Tarbox and his programming team have been pleasantly surprised at howclean SQL Server 1.0 is.andP;  &quot;I was amazed at how few bugs there were,&quot; saidHart.andP;  Both developers rave about the system's high performance.andP;  (No onewanted to see well-paid financial analysis sitting around twiddling theirthumbs as they waited for a system to retrieve data.)andM;SupportandM;Tarbox is unhappy that Ashton-Tate's technical BBS for SQL Server isavailable only to Gold Resellers and selected developers.andP;  Although the BBSmay eventually be available to all SQL Server users, there's an alternative.andO;Microsoft's On-Line has recently been enhanced to include SQL Server support.andO;Tarbox recommends that developers get an On-Line account.andP;  &quot;Microsoft'ssupport has been invaluable.&quot;andP;  He also gives 3Com thumbs-up for superbtechnical support.andP;  &quot;We called once when we were right in the middle of aninstallation.andP;  We were in a jam, and even though we hadn't signed up forextended support, the tech support staff walked us through our problem.&quot;andM;Future needsandM;Like almost everyone else using SQL Server, Canaan Analytics wants to seemore front ends.andP;  Tarbox is especially eager for object-oriented front endswith a QBE/DBE (Query By Example, Database By Example) interface.andP;  &quot;What I'dlike to see in the future is something like Moshe Zloof's DBE model.&quot;andO;concludes Tarobx.andP;  Moshe Zloof, currently at Ashton-Tate, is often viewed asthe guiding light behind QBE and DBE's graphical user interfaces.andP;  Taxbox'sallusion to Zloof reflects the frustration he shares with many SQL Serveradherents at the slow delivery of the powerful front-end tools that will easethe application development process.andP;  But does he regret to decision to jumpon the SQL Server bandwagon?andP;  No way.andM;PricesandM;Ashton-Tate/Microsoft SQL Server 1.0 sells for $2,495 from Ashton-Tate, 20101Hamilton Ave., Torrance, Calif.andP;
