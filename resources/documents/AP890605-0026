U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel is presiding over the``summary trial'' to encourage an agreement in the class-actionsuit representing about 14,000 people who live within five miles ofthe Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald, Ohio.   Eight jurors were selected for the trial this morning, and thecourt was briefly recessed before opening arguments were to begin.The trial was expected to last about a week, with final argumentsset to begin next Monday.   The residents charge that the plant, owned by the EnergyDepartment and operated from 1951 to 1985 by National Lead of OhioInc., contaminated the air, water and soil with uranium, radium andthorium as well as dangerous non-radioactive substances includingasbestos, chlorids and barium.   The plant processed uranium for use in the government's nuclearweapons. National Lead and its parent firm, National LeadIndustries, are named in the suit. Residents claim the plant 18miles northwest of Cincinnati caused them emotional stress andlowered property values.   The Energy Department denies the allegations but has begun acleanup program and admitted that more than 300,000 pounds ofradioactive uranium oxide dust escaped into the atmosphere throughfaulty air-filtering systems.   Cincinnati lawyer Stanley M. Chesley, representing theplaintiffs, said he considers the summary trial a useful tool forencouraging a settlement, which Chesley said the Energy Departmenthad been unwilling to negotiate.   ``We're finally going to hear the story of Fernald. We'refinally going to have it in a court of law,'' Chesley said. ``Wethink it's a wonderful opportunity to resolve a dispute.''   Energy Department lawyer Henry A. Gill Jr. declined to saywhether the department would be willing to settle the case.   The Energy Department contends that the companies are innocentbecause they were contractors following the government's orders.The department has conceded it told National Lead to emphasizeproduction, even if that meant ignoring some environmentalregulations.   Gill said he would not regard the verdict of the summary trialas final.   ``Absolutely not. It's, by its very nature, a non-bindingverdict. It's a settlement tool that some judges like to avoidusing,'' Gill said.   But Chesley said: ``It's not binding, but in my estimation, itbecomes very significant. I think this is the utmost conflictresolution method that we know about.''</TEXT></DOC>
