This policy was appealed to the Secretary of Agricultureon September 15, 1988. The appellants alleged that the process by whichthis policy was developed was flawed that provisions of the policy exceededstatutory limitations on recreation residence use of the National Forests,and that the appellants and the public were adversely affected by the policy.In a decision dated February 15, 1989, the Assistant Secretary of Agriculturefor Natural Resources and Environment remanded the policy to the ForestService for restudy and reformulation and stayed the implementation ofcertain provisions of the policy, as follows: (1) Those nonrenewal provisionsrelating to or requiring a showing of higher public purpose; (2) thoserequiring automatic permit renewal 10 years prior to expiration unlessnonrenewal has been established; (3) those requiring the offering of ``in-lieu''lots to permittees who have received notice of nonrenewal or termination;and (4) those weighted against consideration of commercial uses for siteswhen nonrenewal of the recreation residence use is contemplated. In addition,the Assistant Secretary required that the remaining features of the finalpolicy be designated as interim pending its reformulation following allapplicable process requirements. The reformulation period was establishedby the decision as 18 months.The policy adopted August 16, 1988, was issued as direction to Forest Servicepersonnel through amendments and interim directives to Forest Service ManualChapters 2340 and 2720 and Forest Service Handbook 2709.11_Special UsesHandbook. In compliance with the Assistant Secretary's decision, the agencyis revising that direction in FSM 2340 and 2720 specifically identifiedand/or affected by the decision, removing section 33.2 of the Interim Directiveto Chapter 30 of FSH 2709.11 which deals with calculation of annual feeswhere nonrenewal has been established, removing the Interim Directive toChapter 40 of FSH 2709.11 which gave direction on continuing recreationresidence use, and revising Exhibit 1 of Chapter 50 of FSH 2709.11 whichdisplayed the term special use permit (FS-2700-18) to delete those provisionsconcerning renewal and nonrenewal of permits and the offering of in-lieusites in cases of nonrenewal of permits.As of the date of this notice, the policy and procedures governing recreationresidence use that remain in effect are deemed to be interim policy andshall not remain in effect beyond September 30, 1990. As directed by theAssistant Secretary, the Forest Service has begun restudy and reformulationof the overall policy. The Agency will publish in the Federal Registerabout July 1, 1989, an Advance Notice of Proposed Policy, seeking the adviceof the public on revisions to the interim policy. With this advice, theAgency will prepare and publish for public review and comment a draft reformulatedpolicy by October 31, 1989. Following analysis of public comment on thedraft policy, a final policy will be prepared and will be published inthe Federal Register with a notice of its adoption by July 1, 1990. Copiesof the Federal Register notices containing the draft and final policieswill be mailed to each recreation residence permittee and to individualsand organizations known to have an interest in this policy.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: May 22, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James C.
