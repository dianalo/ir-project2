Ross Perot, for a lucrative contract to runthe Texas Medicaid program, state officials said Thursday.   National Heritage Insurance Co., an EDS subsidiary that has runand maintained the Texas Medicaid program since 1977, was competingagainst Perot Systems Corp. for the contract, which involves theprocessing of $1.1 billion a year in Medicaid claims.   Under the contract, EDS will get $25 million a year foradministration, and up to 5 percent of that could be retained asprofit. The previous contract allowed up to 10 percent for profit.   George Newstrom, an NHI senior vice president, said theDallas-based company could earn up to another $4.9 million a year ifit saves the state money in Medicaid claims. However, because itshares in the risk of the program, it also could lose up to $4.9million annually, he said.   The contract is for four years, and it has two two-yearextensions at the state's option.   H. Ross Perot founded the computer company EDS in 1962 and soldit to General Motors in 1986, joining the GM board in the process.He formed Perot Systems after breaking with GM in a dispute overmanagement of the automaker.   The state Department of Human Services staff said the bidsubmitted by Perot Systems did not meet technical requirements, saidSteve Svadlenak, associate commissioner for budget and economicanalysis.   When representatives of the companies submitted their bids, theoffer by EDS included 11 boxes of documents. Perot's was in twomanila envelopes.   When informed of omissions in the proposed bid, Svadlenak said,Perot Systems said it could not meet the requirements because it didnot have access to the existing computer system used by EDS.   The department staff found EDS complied with state requirementsregarding access to potential bidders.   The bid by Perot Systems marked the company's first formal effortto compete with EDS since a Virginia judge ruled in October Perotcould go after the same data processing business as his old companyas long as he does not enter into contracts that provide for profitsuntil after next December.   The current EDS contract expires Aug. 31, 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
