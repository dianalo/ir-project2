 They are covered under high-resolution output.andP;  In the case ofOptronics, which makes both a high-resolution recorder and a color scanner,we put it in the former category.andP;  We haven't tried to include all colormonitors because there are too many of them.andM;Array Technologies  (5312)andM;Array will show a PC version of its color scanner that it claims is muchfaster than the one shown here last year, and it will demonstrate calibrationof a scanner, monitor and output to a CIE color space (see story elsewhere inthis issue).andP;  It will also announce scanner drivers for Letraset ColorStudioand Time Arts Oasis.andM;Barco  (1146)andM;Barco Inc., which is a different division from Barco Graphics, willdemonstrate a new version of its Calibrator monitor, first shown at Siggraphin August.andP;  The main feature of the new unit is its AKB circuitry, whichprovides increased long-term stability and improved gray-scale tracking.andM;Barco Graphics will not appear.andM;Barneyscan  (828)andM;Color Imaging Systems (CIS) is Barneyscan's name for its line of imagescanning and enhancement software.andP;  Its latest scanning program, QuickScan2.0, shipped last month but never exhibited, boasts an improved userinterface and a selection of advanced prescan features, includingidentification of highlight and shadow ranges, selection of target dot valuesin highlight and shadow ranges, control of image cast, selection of maximumdensity range for the printing system, automatic exposure setting based ondensity and dot values for optimum scanning, and interactive tone curvecontrol.andP;  It also has enhanced connections to Barneyscan's CIS XP(retouching) and CIS Color Access (color separation) programs.andM;CIS Color Access will be shown for the first time in its released form.andP;  CISGallery, a program for archiving color images, was announced last spring;largely redesigned since that announcement, it, too, will debut in itsreleased form.andP;  Barneyscan will also show its transparency and slidescanners.andM;Bell andamp; Howell Quintar  (115)andM;Two new products designed for fast output from a PC will highlight Bell andamp;Howell Quintar's display.andP;  The Q-Script 2 board uses an AMD29000 processorand Phoenix's PostScript emulation to drive both monochrome and colorprinters.andP;  It will be shown driving a Mitsubishi thermal transfer colorprinter.andP;  The Q-Script 2 will list for between $2,000 and $2,495, dependingon the speed of the processor.andM;Q-Print, comprising an accelerator board and software, enables applicationsrunning under Microsoft Windows to print much faster to monochrome or colorprinters or film recorders.andP;  It also lets the user mix fonts from differentfoundries on the same page.andP;  Q-Print lists for $695.andM;Coddbarrett Associates  (2818)andM;Coddbarrett will demonstrate its TintPrep system for producing tints andseparations of line art.andP;  It is used primarily for four-color work fornewspaper inserts, comic books, circulars and other mechanical colorapplications.andM;Computer Presentations Inc.andP;  (312)andM;CPI will demonstrate its new facilities for scanning, image processing, fileconversion and data compression.andP;  They are part of two packages: ColorLab,for $595, and ImagePrep, for $295, running under Microsoft Windows 3.0.andP;  Theywere previewed at PC Expo but are getting their formal introduction here.andM;ImagePrep imports 1- to 24-bit images in a wide range of formats and capturesimages from the screen.andP;  They then can be converted or processed to lowerbitplanes.andP;  Other functions available include dithering and conversion togray scale.andP;  Data also can be compressed to user-definable levels, althoughwe haven't seen any results to judge the quality.andP;  CPI says it can compressdata seven times in 55 seconds, which requires 65 seconds to decompress, orto 46 times in 42 seconds, which takes 51 seconds to decompress.andM;ColorLab provides some similar features to ImagePrep, but it is designedspecifically for the Sharp JX-300 and IX-450 color scanners.andP;  It runs in PCs.andO;Color image enhancement features available include adjusting brightness andcontrast and global or local RGB adjustments.andM;CPI also will appear in the booths of Sharp, Mitsubishi, Aldus, VenturaSoftware, RasterOps, Micrografx and Truvel.andM;Ilford Photo  (5210)andM;Ilford may have one of the most interesting new developments: its firstdigital color imager.andP;  Called the Digital Photo Imager, it is based onliquid-crystal light-valve imaging and photographic media.andP;  It is driven by ahost computer through a SCSI interface; it wasn't clear at press time ifPostScript input would be demonstrated, but Ilford said it has planned tooffer a PostScript interpreter with the machine.andM;It prints continuous-tone, 24-bit color images on photographic media: paper(up to 8&quot; x 11&quot;) for color prints, overhead transparencies or 35mm film forslides.andP;  It can produce multiple copies of the same image at a rate of 180prints, 120 overheads or hundreds of 35mm slides per hour.andP;  The maximumresolution is 2,550 x 3,500 pixels per image.andP;  Developing and drying take 3.5minutes for paper, 6 minutes for overheads and 6 minutes for slides.andM;Pricing hasn't been announced, but it is expected to be less than $60,000.andO;Beta testing will begin soon, with regular customer shipments scheduled forthe middle of 1991.andM;Iris Graphics  (5126)andM;Iris will feature the SmartJet 4012 color printer that was introduced atSiggraph in August.andP;  It is smaller in format (12&quot; x 18&quot;), easier to use andless expensive than earlier Iris machines.andP;  It uses the same technology asthe larger 3000 series, including the same controller and thecontinuous-stream inkjet.andP;  Among the new features are an automatic paperloader and the ability to calibrate itself--a feature the 3000 doesn't have.andO;There might be an additional new feature or two, but we couldn't confirmanything at press time.andM;The base list price is $39,000.andM;Also in the booth will be the larger 3024 machine.andM;Itek Colour Graphics  (5118)andM;Itek Colour Graphics, one of the premier suppliers of quality color scanners,will show a new interface to the Macintosh for its 310 input scanner.andP;  Theinterface is used in conjunction with Itek's Picstore device for storinghigh-resolution images.andP;  Picstore, which was shown at Drupa linked only to anAutologic typesetter, was developed by Highwater Designs, a UK developmentfirm.andM;Picstore connects to a 310 input scanner and to a Macintosh IIfx or IIcx.andP;  Itallows high-resolution color input data from the scanner to be stored and alow-resolution version sent to the Mac for positioning, sizing and cropping.andO;Sizing and cropping instructions are sent back to Picstore for modificationof the high-resolution data, after which the image is transferred viaEthernet to the RIP for output.andM;Picstore is based on a 68020 CPU with 2 MB of RAM and a 760-MB disk.andP;  The Macinterface will be available in January.andP;  Pricing hasn't been announced.andM;Itek also will give a U.S.andP;  debut to its 320 input scanner, which supports alarger format than the 310 and supports batch scanning of multiple images,each with a different setup.andP;  It will be connected to a 420 output unit.andM;KYE International  (5321)andM;For users of MS-DOS, Kye will introduce the Genius Trackball, the 9&quot; x 6&quot; and12&quot; x 18&quot; digitizing tablets and color hand-held scanners.andP;  Also on displaywill be the Genius line of high-performance mice.andM;Marstek  (5218)andM;The Mars Color 105, a new 400-dpi color hand scanner for PC and Macintosh, isMarstek's latest product.andP;  Also on display will be the recently introducedMars 800, which uses a 400-dpi scan unit to produce 800-dpi images with 64levels of gray, and other scanning hardware and software.andM;Mitsubishi International  (634)andM;As the exclusive worldwide distributor for Shinko Electric's graphicsperipherals, Mitsubishi International is introducing a B5-size (7.2&quot; x 10.1&quot;)version of Shinko's 300-dpi CHC-745 thermal transfer color printer.andP;  It isavailable with SCSI or Centronics parallel interfaces.andM;Oce Graphics  (2742)andM;Oce has begun shipping, though it never officially announced, an enhancementto its OceColor Adobe PostScript printer ($8,990) that lets the user choosewhether or not to rotate screens in order to avoid moire effects.andM;Pre-Press Technologies  (5505)andM;Pre-Press will demonstrate two new products, never before shown.andM;SpectrePrint Pro 2.0 is a more powerful engine for color correction andseparation than the earlier version.andP;  It also has an easier user interfaceand a lower price: $2,995 instead of $6,000.andM;For retouching, Pre-Press will unveil SpectreTouch, a 24-bit virtual-memorypainting environment for working on images up to 8k x 8k.andP;  It provides 8-bitmasking, image masks and boundary masks, and handles type.andP;  It usespressure-sensitive brushes, maintains a history of what has been done, andsupports changing a small portion of an image and applying the changes to thefull image later in a batch process.andM;A nice feature is what Pre-Press calls &quot;intelligent tracking&quot; to aid inmaking circles perfectly round.andP;  SpectreTouch keeps up with the operatorwhile drawing a circle, using all points along the path, rather thanconnecting a limited number of points with straight lines if the operatorgoes too fast.andM;The program gives the user control over the flow of ink and the opacity ofthe brush.andP;  The price hasn't been set yet, but it won't be more than $795,Pre-Press said.andP;  Availability is scheduled for January 1.andM;Pre-Press also will show SpectreScan QX (for Quark Xpress) for scanning,SpectreSeps QX for separations and the Spectre5000 (Leaf) scanner.andM;Quantel  (238)andM;Quantel will feature the Copyline, Open Interface and Perspectivecapabilities introduced at Drupa.andP;  Copyline is the company's first seriouseffort to handle body text, not just headlines.andP;  Text is held as a separatelayer from Paintbox graphics.andP;  Text can be imported and placed, but notedited, or it can be brought in as raw text, handamp;j'ed using Quantel's ownalgorithm, and displayed using Bitstream fonts.andM;Open Interface is a means of connecting to other systems.andP;  Perspective is afast, accurate facility for image distortion and 3D effects.andM;Scantronix  (5023)andM;Scantronix, which sells and services graphic arts equipment, will build onits line of high-end color system connections by introducing an interfacebetween the Macintosh and a Crosfield color scanner.andP;  The company hopes torelease it around the time of the show.andM;Screaming Color  (5304)andM;Riplink is a Macintosh software product for transferring color and page filesbetween desktop publishing programs on the Mac and high-end color systems,such as Crosfield, Hell, Scitex or Screen.andP;  Developed by Screaming Color, aprepress color trade shop, it looks like an alternative to the link productsbeing offered by the traditional vendors.andM;Seiko Instruments  (2742)andM;Seiko will feature its ColorPoint PS, a PostScript color printer with a RISCprocessor.andP;  Two models are available: one for 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; output, the otherfor 11&quot; x 17&quot; pages.andM;Shima Seiki USA  (5506)andM;We saw the Shima Seiki color design system at a couple of shows last year,and don't expect any radical changes this time.andP;  It was designed for thecreation of original art or for the retouching of scanned images importedfrom prepress systems.andP;  Both the hardware and the software have beendeveloped by Shima.andP;  The system can be configured to have 8k x 8k of framememory, which allows for extremely fast and interactive manipulation ofimages.andP;  It uses a cordless pen and tablet to select from an extensive set ofretouching tools.andM;Sony Corp. of America  (2628)andM;Sony will show its line of still-video cameras with accessories, such as theMVC-500S with wide angle and 7 x zoom lenses.andP;
