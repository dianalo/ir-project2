He said soldiers peppered the Kaw Moo Ra camp rebel camp, justacross the Moei River from Thailand, with mortar shells.   The officer, speaking with the condition he not be identified,estimated that about 1,200 Karen guerrillas are defending the campagainst about 3,000 soldiers.   Government forces began shelling Kaw Moo Ra on Thursday, twodays after overrunning the major rebel base of Wangkha, 1{ miles tothe south.   Wangkha was the fifth Karen strongold to be captured by armyunits since the government launched an offensive in December.   A government spokesman told a news conference Friday in Rangoon,the Burmese capital, that at least 43 rebels were killed in thebattle for Wangkha. He said 35 soldiers were killed and 95 wounded.   The Burmese government has said 600 guerrillas and 177 soldiersperished in the battle for Maela _ the last camp to fall beforeWangkha.   The five captured camps are in a 75-mile arc hugging the borderalong Thailand's Mae Sot district.   Kaw Moo Ra is 140 miles east of Rangoon and across the borderfrom the Thai town of Mae Sot.   Thai officials say the government offensive has disrupted thecross-border black market trade that provided the Karens with fundsfor their insurgency. The Karen National Union has an estimated4,000 combatants and is the largest of a dozen ethnic groupsbattling the Burmese government.   Karens began their revolt in 1949, a year after Burma achievedindependence from Great Britain, saying the government reneged onits promise of more autonomy for ethnic minorities.   The Karen rebels gained unexpected support when thousands ofstudents joined them after the bloody crackdown by the governmenton student-led campaigns for democracy.   On Thursday, Burmese government spokesman Kyaw Sann said 3,056students have returned home from border areas and legal actionwould be taken against those who remained with the rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
