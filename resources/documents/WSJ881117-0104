George Bush faces a more interesting fiscal challenge than any president since George Washington took office with the national debt in default and U.S. government securities selling for 15 cents on the dollar. Our current fix is hardly that acute. But things could slip out of control unless decisive action is taken. The 1982 slump multiplied federal red ink two and a half times over. The next recession could send the deficit toward the half-trillion-dollar level, pushing interest rates skyward and deep-sixing the economy.    To avoid that, Mr. Bush must act immediately to reform federal spending. This is not the hopeless task that many believe. He holds a card that his antagonists in the Congress cannot counter. As president, Mr. Bush can lead a popular drive for a constitutional convention to draft a balanced-budget amendment. Polls show that overwhelming majorities of both parties support this reform. All that stalls it is lack of visible leadership at the national level. As president, Mr. Bush could dispel the whispers about conspiracies to gut the Constitution that have confused the balanced-budget drive at the state level. The only group in America with something to fear from an Article V convention are the members of Congress whose powers it would curtail. Mr. Bush should capitalize on this fact to push Congress into proposing its own balanced-budget amendment, including provisions limiting taxes and granting the line-item veto.    Mr. Bush holds another strong card that Mr. Reagan chose not to play. The U.S. now spends $150 billion a year defending our allies. Relative to gross national product, we spend 50% more than NATO and 500% more than Japan. This extra burden hinders our industrial competitiveness and is a major cause of our budget woes. Accordingly, Mr. Bush should seek early agreement with Mr. Gorbachev for conventional-force reductions. Pending success of these talks, the president should make continued military subsidies dependent on concessionary financing by the allies. The wealthy countries whose defense we shoulder, especially Japan, should purchase non-negotiable U.S. government securities bearing interest at 5% or less.    Mr. Bush should go beyond his campaign pledge of a flexible freeze to realize substantial savings in domestic spending. Farm and business subsidies should be phased out over four years. The Medicare deductible should be raised to $200 to better reflect inflation since the program began in 1966. Civil service and military-retirement ages should be raised, and the windfall portion of Social Security benefits should be counted as ordinary income for tax purposes.    Mr. Bush should also raise spending where it is needed by taking prompt action to close the bankrupt Sandamp;Ls. Federal deposit insurance should be restructured along British lines, limiting coverage for any individual to a fraction of his total deposits.    Privatization should be used on a sweeping basis to speed crucial infrastructure repairs, including rebuilding bridges, replacing unsafe dams and expanding water-treatment facilities to meet EPA standards. And yes, privatization also should be employed to build prisons so that we can keep dangerous criminals off the streets.    A combination of constitutional budget reform, conventional-force reductions and modest domestic spending cuts would enable Mr. Bush to fulfill his campaign promises, including his pledge to control the deficit without raising taxes. He should. The problem is not a lack of revenue, but an inability of Congress to control spending. Adjusted for inflation, tax receipts have risen by over 22% since 1980. </TEXT></DOC>
