The feelingnow among the Afghan people and their guerrilla supporters is that``Americans are very good people, but they leave you in the middleof the road ... instead of showing friendship to the end.''   ``The end of the road'' for the guerrillas and several millionAfghan refugees still waiting in neighboring countries will bevictory in the form of a legal Moslem government acceptable to thepeople of Afghanistan to replace President Najibullah's communistsruling in Kabul, he said.   The interruption of U.S. ammunition and weapons supplies just asthe Soviets beefed up the Kremlin-installed Afghan government inKabul caused military setbacks and loss of confidence, but ``at themoment there is no problem in the supply ... we are satisfied withthe continuation,'' said Safi, visiting Washington for talks withU.S. officials.   He is currently head of intelligence for the National IslamicFront of Afghanistan, one of the more moderate of seven guerrillagroups trying to achieve unity under the framework of theU.S.-backed Afghan Interim Government. The U.S. government has saidit will back the interim government in efforts to oust theNajibullah regime while also searching for a political solution.   On early U.S. visits, while his homeland was still occupied bythe Red Army, ``we were met by Congressmen, rich people, who wouldtake you to their private homes, doctors for our wounded,'' herecalled. Today, he said, ``there is still fighting in Afghanistan... there are lots of wounded, but no doctors interested, nohospitals.''   As for Najibulla, ``he will not survive,'' said Safi.   It was unrealistic, however, for U.S. officials to predictNajibullah's quick collapse in Kabul, or seizure by the guerrillasof the town of Jallalabad in Eastern Afghanistan, he said. ``It isfoolish to give a timetable. General Eisenhower, General Montgomerynever gave timetables,'' he said, naming successful U.S. andBritish commanders of World War II.''</TEXT></DOC>
