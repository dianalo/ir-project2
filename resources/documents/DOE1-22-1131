The averageconcentration of particulate matter at the Unit 5B breeching, when correctedto 12 percent CO/sub 2/, was 3.83 grams per dry standard cubic meter(g/dscm) for the fist survey and 1.99 g/dscm for the second survey. In1986 the Brandon Station was utilized for peak load requirements onlywhen other sources of power were not available. Particulate testing indicatedemissions were higher than the limit of 0.57 grams/dscm (corrected to12% CO/sub 2/) stipulated in Clean Environment Commission Order No. 1039.However, as annual electrical power generation was less than the 500,000megawatt hours specified, the Brandon Thermal Generating Station wasnot in violation of the Order. 6 figs., 8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
