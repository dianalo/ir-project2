The task force, appointed by House Democrats Byron Dorgan ofNorth Dakota and Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio, included a bipartisangroup of economists. The panel's view echoes a growing perception onCapitol Hill that using Social Security taxes to hide shortfalls inthe government's operating budget is flawed and allows a drain onthe economy.   The 1983 revisions to the Social Security law increasedretirement taxes on workers to build up a surplus that would protectthe Baby Boom generation when it retires early in the next century.According to recent calculations by the Congressional Budget Office,the Social Security trust fund surplus reduces the deficit by $56billion this year and will soon top $100 billion a year.   But because that money is covering the shortfall in the rest ofthe budget, the government-enforced savings is essentiallycancelled, the task force said.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>U.S., Soviets to Work Together Against Illegal Salmon Fishing</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States and the Soviet Union haveagreed to work more closely in efforts to curb illegal salmonfishing in international waters of the Pacific Ocean, the StateDepartment says.   Department officials said Tuesday that negotiators from the twocountries had decided that illegal salmon fishing on the high seasby other nations represented an ``irrational and wasteful harvestingmethod and that all efforts should be taken to prevent theunauthorized possession, harvest, transport and sale of salmon inthe North Pacific.''   American fishing groups have contended that illegal catches byforeign trawlers, sometimes under the guise of fishing for squid,have already resulted in depleted salmon runs in the PacificNorthwest and Alaska.   Soviet and U.S. negotiators, meeting last week in Washington,signed a memorandum of understanding in which the two countriesagreed to ``increase their bilateral cooperation in the field ofenforcing salmon conservation measures.''</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>Blend VA, Military Hospital Systems, Says Leader of Vets Group</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Disabled American Veterans say military andveterans' hospitals can save money and improve care by workingtogether more often.   The three military hospital systems and the VeteransAdministration system are in ``deep trouble'' because of years offinancial starvation in the face of growing patient demands, saidBilly E. Kirby, national commander of the group.   Lack of money has brought about losses of staff and beds and arationing of care, he said Tuesday at a joint hearing of the Houseand Senate Veterans Affairs committees.   In 1982 Congress permitted local installations to agree withtheir neighbors in another hospital system to share facilities _ forexample, to send over patients needing a CAT scan rather than buy asecond scanner. There are now 1,800 agreements involving 300installations.   ``Rather than settling for locally initiated ad hoc agreements,the more ambitious of which often encounter bureaucratic resistance,we propose the creation of a new nationwide VeteransAdministration-Department of Defense health care alliance,'' Kirbysaid.</TEXT></DOC>
