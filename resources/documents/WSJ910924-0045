Morgan andamp;Co. for a loan of more than $1 billion, in what would be thefirst international borrowing by the state-owned oil giant.   The talks haven't been disclosed, bankers say, becauseIslamic fundamentalists, who oppose the payment of interest,this year criticized the Saudi government for undertaking a$4.5 billion loan through Morgan to help pay for the PersianGulf War. The loan was the kingdom's first internationalborrowing in 20 years.</LP><TEXT>   A spokesman for J.P. Morgan declined to comment.   Loan talks are said to have bogged down over uncertaintyas to the use of the loan. Saudi Aramco, which was created inthe late 1970s with the nationalization of the Saudi oilindustry, has a large capital spending program over the nextdecade. But the company is already pumping large amounts ofoil to keep revenues up following a fall in oil prices.   Reflecting the need for additional revenue, Saudi Arabiais expected to propose at a meeting beginning today in Genevaof the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that thegroup increase total oil production to 24.5 million barrels aday, up from 23.5 million.   On the other hand, the kingdom still has war debts,including $3 billion owed to the U.S., and some Westerndiplomats have speculated that the Saudis would prefer tohave new borrowings for those purposes go through thestate-owned companies such as Saudi Aramco.   Western diplomats in Riyadh say the Gulf War may have costthe secretive Saudis more than $70 billion in pledges tocoalition allies and war-related expenditures such as weaponspurchases and housing Kuwaiti refugees. The kingdom also mayface several billion dollars in cleanup costs as a result ofthe Persian Gulf oil spill caused by Saddam Hussein's troopsin Kuwait.   &quot;The hangup is, does Saudi Aramco need the loan? They haveto determine what their financing needs are,&quot; said onefinancial executive with knowledge of the talks. Saudi Aramcois saying the loan is for general purposes, rather than anyspecific project, according to international bankers. ButMorgan's bankers are said to be seeking more information.   The financial excecutive added, &quot;There's a chance the dealcould fall apart. Whether it goes ahead, how much is soughtand what the rate is up in the air. Saudi Aramco may say theydon't need the money badly so they can get a cheaper rate.&quot;   The American bank &quot;has been very aggressive in pricingtheir Saudi loans,&quot; said one international banker. He wasreferring to the rate of 3/8% over the London interbankoffered rate that Saudi Arabia paid for the $4.5 billion loansyndicated by Morgan earlier this year.   Bankers said they were aware that Saudi Aramco has beeninterested in a loan of about $1.5 billion to buy oiltankers, refurbish chemical plants and add to capacity. Ifso, it would be natural for the oil giant to turn to J.P.Morgan. Besides the loan this year, the American bank helpedSaudi Aramco arrange a number of joint ventures recently,including a 35% equity stake in a Korean refinery. Also, J.P.Morgan's vice chairman, Rodney Wagner, is on the Saudi Aramcoboard.</TEXT></DOC>
