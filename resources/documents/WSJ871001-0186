When the company needed emergency imports of spare parts from its Singapore office, he says, &quot;We'd ask (Singapore) to send three different shipments of the same product. That way, we had some hope of one of them getting through customs in time.&quot;    According to one foreign shipping executive, graft was so entrenched that many customs agents didn't bother to hide their greed. He describes his encounter with an official at Jakarta's huge Tanjung Priok Port. &quot;He was a fat man with a gorgeous receptionist,&quot; the executive recalls. &quot;There was a safe behind his desk that went from the floor to the ceiling. It had a big dial right in the middle. Petty cash, he said. It was real Hollywood stuff.&quot;    But things have changed significantly over the past 2 1/2 years as a result of President Suharto's decision to rid Indonesia's ports of corruption. In April 1985, he ordered the replacement of the customs service with a private Swiss company, Societe Generale de Surveillance S.A., or SGS. &quot;Now goods move in about three days; it used to take as much as three weeks,&quot; the shipping executive says.    The Geneva-based SGS is the world's largest trade-inspection concern, with 145 branches, 152 laboratories and 20,000 employees world-wide. About 80% of its revenue comes from private contracts, but it has agreements with 25 developing countries -- including, most recently, the Philippines -- to verify the quality, quantity and price of exports and imports.    In Indonesia, &quot;Things had gotten so bad on the ports that the only way the president could improve things was to throw out the customs boys,&quot; says a Western diplomat. About half of the country's 13,000 customs officers were put on indefinite leave, where they remain. Most high-ranking customs officials were replaced.    By nearly all accounts, SGS has reduced import time, cut import costs and improved collection of tariffs and sales taxes on imports. But the fact that a foreign company has been granted major customs responsibilities still grates on the intense nationalism of this former Dutch colony. Even fervent Indonesian supporters of SGS say they hope a reformed and properly supervised customs service eventually can be returned to work.    The government has hired foreign consultants to assist in training new customs officers and to draft new customs regulations. About 30 officials have been selected as the &quot;new generation&quot; of customs leaders. Many are being trained overseas.    Currently, SGS inspects all import shipments valued at more than $5,000, except military and household goods. The inspections are made outside Indonesia, either at the factory or at the ship. Singapore and Hong Kong are two of the company's busiest operations.    Customs continues to play a small role, inspecting household goods and shipments valued at less than $5,000. An executive with a moving company says it is still routine to bribe customs officers to clear goods, which otherwise could sit for weeks. &quot;They're hungry for whatever scraps they can get these days,&quot; the executive says.    And importers say the number of shipments valued under $5,000 has risen, possibly because some importers want to avoid SGS's scrutiny. &quot;I've heard of $50,000 shipments being broken down into 10 parts,&quot; says another shipping-line executive.    Without providing details, SGS says it has compiled a list of companies that are likely to try to switch cargo or somehow beat Indonesian import restrictions. It says the companies often change names to escape being watched carefully.    Tiny Singapore is the Swiss concern's biggest headache. &quot;Attempts to switch goods after inspection are the worst here,&quot; says Michael Honney, managing director of SGS Singapore (Pte.) Ltd.    Some of the smuggling attempts in Singapore are creative enough for a Marx Brothers routine. In one incident in the upper floor of a big warehouse, inspectors watched workers close a crate full of knock-down kits for videocassette recorders. The crate was sent down on a freight elevator while the inspectors took a passenger elevator.    But the crate was halted en route, pulled off the elevator, and replaced with a look-alike, SGS officials say. The suspicious inspectors opened it and found fully assembled VCRs, which aren't allowed into Indonesia. The exporter apologized for the &quot;mistake.&quot;    Daniel Gauchat, senior vice president of SGS and chief executive office of the company's Jakarta liaison office, says SGS has accomplished what the government hired it to do. &quot;The key objective of smoothing the flow of trade has definitely been achieved,&quot; he says.    The company is roundly praised by multinationals and by big Indonesian concerns. Its main detractors appear to be smaller companies, some of which had regularly bribed customs agents to smuggle in restricted goods or had paid off officials to undervalue shipments.    The value of the SGS contract with Indonesia is a well-guarded secret, but it apparently is tied to the value of the goods inspected. Some estimates put the rate at between 0.5% and 0.8%.    Whatever the cost, detractors say the government would save money by putting customs officers back to work. But others note the surge in the collection of import and sales taxes since SGS took over. In the fiscal year that ended in March, revenue from import duties soared 58% from the previous fiscal year, to the equivalent of $585 million. Revenue from excise taxes increased 12%, to $647 million -- despite a 9% decline in imports and a general reduction in tariffs.    Still, SGS faces challenges to its work here and with other developing countries. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, or Unctad, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have been asked by an Unctad committee to &quot;discourage&quot; developing nations from using private surveyors. U.S. manufacturers and exporters have raised objections about delays caused by pre-shipment inspections. There is also grumbling about slow paper work, and there are reports of smuggling.    SGS says it has tipped customs about several of the reported cases. But it tries to minimize its role in thwarting smuggling. &quot;We aren't here as a fraud squad,&quot; says Mr. Gauchat. &quot;We're only interested in technical smuggling&quot; -- that is, false declarations and attempts to sneak in restricted items.    Whatever problems remain, most importers and businessmen here say anything is better than the corruption of the old days. &quot;I don't see how we can ever go back to things as they were,&quot; says the chemical company executive. </TEXT></DOC>
