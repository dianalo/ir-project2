On other markets, energy futures retreated; livestock and meatfutures rose sharply; grains and soybeans were mixed, andstock-index futures fell.   Analysts said the metals markets were primed for a technicalrally. And reports that seven independent oil-producing countrieshad offered to cut their oil exports if OPEC would do the sameprovided an impetus for the surge.   The oil-rich countries hope a drop in exports will reduce worldsupplies enough to force oil prices higher. Because higher oilprices would be viewed as inflationary, investment demand forprecious metals also could increase.   The non-OPEC nations made their offer of a 5 percent cut inexports contingent on the 13 members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries agreeing to a reduce their exports bythe same amount.   OPEC ministers were to meet Thursday in Vienna to discuss theoffer. Reports of disagreement among OPEC members, especiallybetween Saudi Arabia and Iran, caused oil futures to drop sharplylate in the day, but the metals ``ignored that completely,'' saidBette Raptopoulos, metals analyst for Prudential-Bache SecuritiesInc. in New York.   ``The metals are anticipating that the OPEC talks will continuein a positive vein tomorrow,'' she said.   Technical data suggested the metals rally would continue, saidRichard Levine, vice president of the precious metals and foreignexchange group at Elders Futures Inc. in New York.   Silver futures made an especially sharp move upward because,Levine said, the recent lack of volatility in the silver market hadmade it overdue for a strong move in either direction.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $2.50 to $3higher with the contract for delivery in June at $454.30 a troyounce; silver was 11.5 cents to 11.9 cents higher with May at $6.50a troy ounce. Platinum gained $6.50 across the board on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange, with July settling at $526.20 a troyounce.   Skepticism about an oil-export cut sparked a heavy round of lateselling in the energy futures pits at the New York MercantileExchange.   ``I think a lot of people are anticipating there's a chance thatOPEC will not agree to cut back on production,'' said Andrew Lebow,energy analyst with E.D.andamp; F. Man International Futures Inc.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 26 cents to 33 centslower with June at $18.27 a barrel; heating oil was .27 cent to .49cent lower with May at 51.77 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was.06 cent to 1 cent lower with May at 52.36 cents a gallon.   Higher cash prices linked to stronger demand supported livestockfutures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said Philip Stanley, ananalyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in Chicago.   Frozen pork bellies advanced on technical strength andexpectations for a seasonal increase in demand, he said.   Live cattle settled .10 cent to 1.17 cents higher with June at71.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .52 cent to .90 cent higherwith April at 80.75 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .65 centhigher with June at 49.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were.47 cent to 1.15 cents higher with May at 52.67 cents a pound.   Grain and soybean futures settled mixed on the Chicago Board ofTrade with much of the selling due to profit-taking after Tuesday'ssharp rise in soybean prices.   Soybeans finished mixed to lower following the AgricultureDepartment's denial of reports it had predicted unexpectedly largereductions in crop acreage under a government price-support program.   But the selling pressure was offset by light commission houseand fund buying, said Joel Karlin, an analyst with ResearchDepartment Inc. in Chicago.   Soybeans also got a boost from reports of rainy weather slowingthe Brazilian soybean harvest, which is more than half complete.   Corn was fractionally higher. Wheat retreated slightly onprofit-taking.   Wheat settled unchanged to 1{ cents lower with May at $3.10{ abushel; corn was \ cent to } cent higher with May at $2.01 abushel; oats were 1\ cent to 1{ cents higher with May at $1.67 abushel; soybeans were 1} cents lower to 3 cents higher with May at$6.75} a bushel.   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago MercantileExchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard andamp;Poor's 500 index settled .80 point lower at 264.</TEXT></DOC>
