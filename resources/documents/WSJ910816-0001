In a cease and desist order, the Office of the Comptrollerof the Currency directed Hibernia to correct violations ofU.S. banking laws turned up during the agency's recentexamination of the lead bank. Although the alleged violationsweren't specified, the order referred to laws governingtransactions between banks and affiliates.</LP><TEXT>   Sidney Lassen, who was named chairman after Hibernia'ssenior management resigned en masse last month after a stringof heavy losses, said the alleged violations concerned theway in which the holding company allocated certain expensesto its bank units, and added: &quot;If we violated anything, thoseviolations either have been corrected or are in the processof being corrected.&quot;   The directors of the lead bank signed the order withoutadmitting or denying guilt.   The issues raised by the order may impede Hibernia'sefforts to raise new capital. Among other things, thecomptroller's office implied that the bank's loan policieshave been deficient, and instructed the board to &quot;improve thebank's loan administration&quot; and enact procedures &quot;to reduceexisting unwarranted concentrations&quot; in the loan portfolio.   Regulators also ordered the bank to &quot;implement a writtenprogram, designed to improve and strengthen collectionefforts,&quot; and to involve board members more closely in loandecisions.   Also, the agency implied that some restatement of earningsmay be in order. Mr. Lassen said &quot;no decision has been made&quot;on whether any figures need to be restated.</TEXT></DOC>
