The group of businessmen and officials filed suit in U.S.District Court, fearing that a real estate boom in Las Vegas will behurt by an Aug. 4 emergency regulation issued by the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service. It is designed to leave desert tortoisesundisturbed.   Issued under the Endangered Species Act, the rule could severelyrestrict development on land inhabited by the Mojave population ofwild desert tortoises.   Covered by the regulation are portions of California,southwestern Utah and northwestern Arizona, as well as southernNevada including Las Vegas, the scene of substantial commercial andresidential growth.   In a decision last Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge StanleyHarris refused to issue a preliminary injunction against enforcementof the rule.   The federal government issued the regulation after an outbreak ofrespiratory disease among wild desert tortoise populations. Butthere is no scientific evidence that the disease affected tortoisesin Nevada, said the city of Las Vegas, which argued that theregulation should have been confined to areas affected by thedisease.   In his decision, Harris agreed that it would have been``significantly preferable'' to limit the geographic scope of theemergency rule. But he said nothing in the Endangered Species Actrequires the wildlife service ``to limit the chaos caused toproductive human enterprises ... based on geographic ... concerns.''   The wildlife service's rule ``calls a halt to an awful lot ofdevelopment activity because the Las Vegas area is within thehabitat'' of the desert tortoise, said Irwin Goldbloom, one of thelawyers representing the Nevada interests filing suit.   In an interview Tuesday, Goldbloom said some construction alreadyhas been stopped in the Las Vegas area because of the rule. He saidthe Nevada officials and developers will go to the U.S. Court ofAppeals in an attempt to overturn the emergency regulation.   One court filing in the case said the city of Las Vegas stands tolose $11 million a year in lost tax revenue, building permit feesand other income due to the regulation.   Del Webb Communities Inc., a developer, says the emergency rule``could lead to staggering interest costs'' and could jeopardizecompletion of construction projects.   Environmental groups have been pushing since 1984 to place thedesert tortoise on the list of endangered species.   The federal government stated in court papers that the emergencylisting ``will ... place additional constraints on ... industries... to help prevent ... extinction'' of the tortoises.   ``Given the longstanding consideration of the desert tortoise''for listing as an endangered species, the group of developers andofficials from Nevada ``should have been aware'' of that``eventuality,'' said Justice Department lawyers.</TEXT></DOC>
