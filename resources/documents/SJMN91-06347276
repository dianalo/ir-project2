Narasimha Rao, emphasized that their countries shared aninterest in asserting themselves internationally at a time when an ascendantWest is moving to shape the post-Cold War order.;   In an apparent gesture toBeijing, Indian officials arrested about 20 Tibetan democracy advocates beforeLi's arrival and imposed tight security in the capital.
