Komsomolskaya Pravda said 30 drunken Afghan cadets went to amarket in Tashkent to sell sunglasses, lighters and other items thatare hard to find in the Soviet Union.   Soviets objected to Afghans becoming black marketeers andfighting broke out when the Afghans began insulting the Soviets, thepaper said.   Police rapidly intervened and sent the Afghans back todormitories around Tashkent where they live, it said.   The Afghans gave their version of events to other Afghans livingin the dormitories, and they began smashing furniture and windows,according to the newspaper account. Another group of Afghans, manyof whom had been taking drugs, smashed a traffic police post, thepaper said.   The Afghans jumped on the hoods of passing cars and lay down onthe street, Komsomolskaya Pravda said. Twenty cars were vandalizedand four burned, according to preliminary information, the papersaid.   Komsomolskaya Pravda, quoting a report printed in Uzbekistannewspapers, said a 6-month-old child was killed ``as a result of therampages.'' It did not give details. Two people hurt in the riotingdied later of ``heavy trauma'' in the hospital, Komsomolskaya Pravdasaid.   Sixteen people, including seven Afghans, were reportedhospitalized, including one in critical condition.   Friction has been reported before between Afghans and residentsof Tashkent, a city of 1.8 million that is the capital of the Uzbekrepublic.   Tashkent residents last year told visiting Western journaliststhat some goods, such as tea kettles, had been taken off the marketbecause Afghans were buying them up and selling them for big profitsin their homeland.   The paper expressed the hope that Soviet-Afghan relationshipwould not be damaged by the incident. The Uzbek press report quotedby Komsomolskaya Pravda said violators ``of Soviet laws and ethicalnorms'' would be punished.</TEXT></DOC>
