Numerical simulations are reported, corroborating these predictionsin two and three dimensions. They lead to an interpretation of the Kosterlitz-Thoulesstransition, different from the standard one, of dipole dissociation.In three dimensions, the transition is interpreted as the first-orderliquid-gas one, across which the density is discontinuous.</TEXT></DOC>
