Palestiniansstaged a general strike in the occupied lands to mark nine monthsof rebellion against Israeli rule.   Eleven Palestinians, including two 9-year-old girls, were shotand wounded in clashes with troops in the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip, Arab doctors said.   Israel radio quoted Arab sources as saying a 2-week-old boy,Nihad Jaradat, died of tear gas inhalation after troops fired teargas in and around homes in the West Bank's Siir village near Hebron.   The military command said that there has been no army activityin Siir and that the fatality has not been reported to any Israeliauthority. Officials at Hebron's Alia hospital said they were notaware of the case.   In Nablus, 14 Arabs pleaded innocent to charges they took partin a stone-throwing protest in April that resulted in the death ofa Jewish girl who was shot accidentally by a Jewish guard.   Also Thursday, the army said two soldiers and an officer will betried in connection with the beating of a 17-year-old Gaza Cityboy, Fuad Tarazi, who died Feb. 9.   U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, meanwhile,said on Israel Television Thursday that Washington's invitation toIsraeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to attend a high-levelMideast meeting came too late.   Dukakis said in an interview that encouraging peace efforts,``has to be something the administration begins early in its tenureand works hard to achieve. That didn't happen with thisadministration and I think this is going to be a new administrationthat is going to do that.''   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir criticized the Reaganadministration for scheduling the meeting for for Sept. 26, fiveweeks before Israel's Nov. 1 election.   Leaders of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc accused Peres, head ofthe left-of-center Labor Party, of engineering the invitation toboost Labor's chances in the election.   Shamir said on Israel army radio the invitation was not a U.S.intervention in Israeli elections, but appeared to ``belong to the(Nov. 8) U.S. elections, and we were accidentally caught in it.''He did not elaborate.   On Israel radio, Peres denied he arranged the invitation andsaid both he and Shamir were told last month U.S. diplomats weretrying to work out such a meeting.   Thursday's general strike was called by pro-PLO uprising leadersto mark the nine months of the ``intefadeh,'' or uprising, begunDec. 8.   Compliance was viewed as a key test of their control because ofthe growing rift between the Palestine Liberation Organization andthe Moslem fundamentalist ``Hamas'' group, which called a rivalstrike for Friday.   The general strike was observed throughout the occupied lands,but in Gaza City, graffiti scrawled on walls in red called onresidents to comply with the Hamas strike call for Friday.   In the West Bank, Israeli troops fatally shot 36-year-oldMohammed Abu Salah in the head and seriously wounded another man inthe abdomen in clashes in Silat Harathiya, hospital officials said.   The army confirmed the casualties and said soldiers fired whenattacked by masked youths wielding clubs and knives.   Palestinian witnesses said the violence erupted when youthstrying to stop Arab workers from going to their jobs in Israelturned on the soldiers and began pelting them with stones.   In Nablus, a 13-year-old youth was shot in the arm and a19-year-old Arab was shot in the stomach, hospital officials said.The army confirmed the casualties and said one of the woundedhurled a firebomb at troops.   Several violent clashes erupted in the Gaza Strip, and eightPalestinians, including four teen-agers and two 9-year-old girls,were wounded by troops, hospital officials said. The army said itwas checking this report.   In Gaza City, riot police burst into Shifa Hospital and brieflyheld two children suspected of attacking troops with bottles andstones, the army said.   The death of Abu Salah brought to 260 the number of Palestinianskilled since the uprising began.   Five Israelis have also died, including 15-year-old Tirza Porat,who was killed April 6 during a clash between Jewish settlerteen-agers and Palestinians in the West Bank village of Beita.   The trial against 20 Beita residents opened in Nablus onThursday, and 14 pleaded innocent to charges of participating inthe clash. The other six will enter pleas later.   If convicted, they could face sentences of up to 20 years injail, lawyers said.   Miss Porat was killed when Jewish settlers she was hiking withclashed with Palestinians in Beita.   Many Israelis expressed outrage at the slaying, but the armylater found Miss Porat was shot accidentally by a Jewish guardduring the clash.</TEXT></DOC>
