(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state-sponsored deer hunt forchildren as young as 8 has drawn fire from animal welfare groupsand educators who claim it's too traumatic to allow kids to killthe likes of Bambi.   For the past four years, the state Game and Fresh Water FishCommission has held the hunt without controversy for about 160children, ages 8 to 15, who are accompanied by adults. Gameofficials and gun advocates say the event teaches youngsters tohunt and use firearms safely.   But this year, opponents ranging from the animal-rights groupFund for Animals to the Dade County School Board and PTA areprotesting the hunt, scheduled for this weekend in Camp Blanding, arural area south of Jacksonville.   ``Having children kill animals for fun is ridiculous,'' saidSharon Bailey of North Miami, who heads the Florida chapter of theFriends of Animals, a national anti-hunting group.   ``It twists the values of our children. I've taken 8-year-oldsto see Bambi. Even that upsets them,'' she said of the animatedDisney movie in which the young deer's mother is shot by a hunter.   Strong protests also have come from officials in Dade County,which includes Miami, where shooting incidents have left 37 youths18 years old or younger dead so far this year, 13 more than in allof 1987.   ``I'm outraged that we could be encouraging our students to useguns. We need to come to our senses about the use of guns,'' saidcounty School Superintendent Joseph Fernandez.   At a breakfast earlier this week in Palm Beach, author andactivist Cleveland Amory confronted Gov. Bob Martinez and demandedhe cancel the hunt.   ``Have you no shame?'' said Amory, who founded the Fund forAnimals. ``Have you no pity? It is high time for a brave governorto know what he is doing with this.''   But the governor ignored Amory's comments and later said thehunt should go ahead because it fosters closer relationshipsbetween parents and their children.   ``This is a highly controlled deer and hog hunt,'' said gamecommission spokesman Jim Huffstodt. ``There has never been anaccident. It's extremely popular. It is done to introduce youth tohunting and wildlife.''   In each hunt, there is a 40-deer limit.   George Rauback, a hunter from West Dade and a National RifleAssociation member, said the youth hunt teaches children to respectguns.   ``I learned to hunt with my father and older brother,'' Raubacksaid. ``This is a reasonable idea. It teaches hunting etiquette.The safe handling of firearms is always worthwhile.''   In addition to this weekend's hunt, another youth hunt isscheduled at Camp Blanding on Oct. 29-30, and three other hunts areplanned elsewhere in the state, including one for handicappedyoungsters set for Nov. 4-6.   State Rep. John Cosgrove, a Democrat, said it's wrong for thestate to sponsor the hunts.   ``I hunted as a teen-ager and understand the feeling that peoplehave for the outdoors. However, I feel that encouraging childrenunder 18 to bear arms in pursuit of animal kills is not a properfunction of the state,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
