<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-52-0005 </DOCNO><TEXT>Angle-integrated ultraviolet photoemission studies of carbon monoxidechemisorption on Cr(110) confirm the sequential population of two electronicallyinequivalent molecular binding states ({alpha}{sub 1}/sub -/CO and {alpha}{sub2}/sub -/CO) at 90 K. These are distinguished by differences in the CO4{sigma} binding energies ({Delta}E/sub B/ = 0.8 eV) and photoemissioncross sections. Work-function measurements indicate that the surfacedipole moment associated with {alpha}{sub 1}-CO is significantly lessthan that for {alpha}{sub 2}-CO. CO/O interaction data exhibit oxygen-induced{alpha}{sub 1}-CO site blocking and {alpha}{sub 1}/sub -/CO{yields}{alpha}{sub2}-CO binding mode conversion. These results support current models forthe CO binding geometries on Cr(110) and related binding states on Fe(100) and Mo(100).</TEXT></DOC>
