It is the ability to seamlessly integratetext, graphics, sound, and even video in documents shared across networks ofpowerful personal workstations.andM;It means overcoming geographic decentralization and making teamwork moreefficientandM;Darlene Yaplee, marketing manager of multimedia products at Sun Microsystems,says, &quot;An analyst simply clicks icons to pull up an image of a newspaperarticle in one window and a spreadsheet from a remote database in another.andO;He then drags that image and the spreadsheet into a text file.andP;  He appends avoice message to the document calling out important sections and drags thedocument to an e-mail icon for routing to another location.andP;  There, anotheranalyst incorporates sections of the document into her report without havingto re-key any material, and routes it via e-mail to another site.&quot;andM;It means winning the war against subservience to documents, particularlywhere hard copy results from computing platforms that don't cooperate.andM;Dr.andP;  John Busch, chief technical officer of Clarity Software, says, -Mebiggest problem is interoperability between organizations and betweendifferent functions within each organization.andP;  Those functions have alwaystended to require different types of computers.andP;  When my buddies in marketingdeveloped their documents on a Mac and my secretary did my drawings on a PC,I was stuck.andP;  I ended up making my reports by cutting and pasting papertogether, or collating from different documents.&quot;andM;It means personalizing leadership and re-establishing a context that promotesunderstanding.andM;Steve jobs, president of NEXT, Inc: &quot;Multimedia is not a market, but rather abasket of technologies, such as CD sound, photographic quality images,compressed motion video, etc.andP;  These technologies are much like the raw laserprinter engine was in  83, in that they are enabling technologies that willprovide the opportunity for a new market.andM;What is this new market? We believe that these multimedia technologies,together with very powerful networking, will be used to create a new marketcalled interpersonal computing.andP;  Interpersonal computing will extend personalcomputing, whose mission it has been to increase group productivity andcollaboration.andM;&quot;Interpersonal computing is the next revolution in our industry, followingthe first two revolutions of the spreadsheet in the early' 80s and desktoppublishing in the late'80s.andP;  The early'90s will see this new market blossom.&quot;andM;This month Personal Workstation begins a comprehensive look at the drivingforces behind desktop computing in the  90s.andP;  In this issue, we lead withmixed-media computing.andP;  This technology undergrids interpersonalcommunication, or rich e-mail PW's pick for the most important application ofthe  90s.andM;Not surprisingly, in this issue you'll find a unique conceptual view ofe-mail.andP;  We think you'll enjoy it, be intrigued by it, profit from it.andP;  Butdon't jump to that feature yet.andM;Also this month, check out Sun's mixed-media strategy.andP;  Look over Clarity'snew cross-platform approach to reconciling the worlds of PCs, Macs, and PWs.andO;Find out how Andersen Consulting is using a mixed-media strategy tostreamline one of the world's most complex and paper-intensive tasks.andP;  Andsee what's happening with multimedia pioneer Apple these days.andP;  Then read PWsperspective on e-mail, and watch the mixed-media roads converge at thatpoint.andM;Come back next month for a look at pen-based computing - particularly thefull 32-bit, preemptive multitasking operating system from Go Corp.andO;RISC-ready and poised to build on the rich interpersonal communicationsystems of the 90s, Go's PenPoint operating system is one of the most elegantmixed-media devices yet.andM;And in July, PW wpresents groupware.andP;  How do you define it? Can youarticulate its benefits to your organization? Between now and then, you maywant to look at Michael Schrage's Shared Minds: The New Technologies ofCollaboration, (Random House, 1990).andP;  If you haven't already seen the book,you win.andP;  Don't be surprised if one of your vendors gives you a copy! Schragesketches the conceptual framework for collaborative computing.andP;  In July, PWfully describes the topologies of groupware and provides the details you needto make it happen in your organization.andM;Not surprisingly, mixed-media computing plays a very important part in all ofthis.andP;  So turn the page and find out how mixed-media computing is moving fromglitz to grit in the  90s!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
