Justice Declan Costello ruled Friday that Irish fruit importer FII Fyffes PLC must accept Pernod's offer for its 20.04% stake under their oral agreement. The French drink group bid 285 million Irish punt ($421 million), or 450 Irish pence a share, for Irish Distillers. Pernod said FII's shares would give it control of 52.8% of Ireland's sole whiskey producer.    Pernod still faces several hurdles. FII has until Friday to appeal the ruling to the Irish Supreme Court. In addition, Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC, a rival bidder, has asked the European Community Commission to intervene, claiming it was excluded from the bidding process. Ireland's minister for industry and commerce, Albert Reynolds, must approve any bid.    Trading in Irish Distillers shares was suspended Friday afternoon at 414 British pence on London's Stock Exchange. </TEXT></DOC>
