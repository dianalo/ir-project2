(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Great Expectations: PCs and ProductivityandM;In recent years, U.S.andP;  companies have installed billions of dollars' worth ofcomputer and PC technology, which has changed the way Americans conductbusiness and propelled an unprecendented boom in the computer industry.andM;At the same time, though, growth of productivity has decline and the U.S.andO;economy has become less competitive.andP;  Computers have yet to prove theirbenefit in the worldwide race to boost productivity.andM;Nevertheless, America's commitment to computers and PCs continues to grow.andO;Investment in computers jumped an average of 24 percent a year in the 1980s,while investment in other types of business equipment actually declined.andP;  AndPCs are becoming an increasingly important factor within this explodingmarket.andP;  Today's PCs pack more power than the mainframes of just a few yearsago, and they're found just about everywhere: on the desks of executives,managers, secretaries, and technicians and on the laps and peripateticsalespeople, attorneys,a nd engineers.andM;Many people hoped and expected that the rapid growth in computer hardwarewould help fuel overall economic performance.andP;  But in fact, the nation'seconomic performance has been mixed during the computer boom.andP;  The good newsis that inflation has been tamed and that U.S.andP;  living standards haveimproved.andP;  The bad news is that productivity growth has slowed, the nationaldebt has ballooned, and the country has turned a huge foreign trade surplusinto an even bigger trade deficit.andM;The two sides of this picture are related, of course.andP;  Much of the increasein living standards came about because we bought more goods such as autos,tanks, and VCRs than we could produce, and we borrowed from foreigners to paythe bills.andM;Why haven't computers helped improve productivity, and why aren't PCs makinga bigger impact today?andP;  Well, they may be helping more than we know.andP;  A greatdeal of the improvement due to computer use has come in service industries,where productivity is notoriously difficult to measure.andP;  Another point toconsider is that managers don't always use PCs to the best effect.andP;  Sometimescompanies concentrate on using them to steal business from competitors, notto raise overall productivity.andM;Maybe we're expecting too much: computers and PCs cannot address all ourproductivity problems.andP;  It's unrealistic to expect them to compensate forcollapsing infrastructures and poor work habits.andM;The SlowdownandM;To understand the role PCs play in productivity, it's helpful to look at thehistory of America productivity since World War II.andP;  After the war, theUnited States assumed clear leadership of the world economy.andP;  We had espcapedthe devastation that ravaged Europe and Asia; our factories were intact andoperating at top capacity.andP;  Even more important, U.S.andP;  companies couldexploit new technologies developed during the war, testing their potential incivilian markets.andP;  The Great Depression of the 1930s, which had held back thedevelopment of new ideas, was finally laid to rest.andP;  It's no surprise thatthe 1950s and 1960s saw unusually rapid growth in productivity.andM;The first signs of a slowdown came in the late 1960s, as growth in mining andconstruction began to ease off.andP;  A virtual collapse in productivity growthfollowed in 1973.andP;  The problem spread from blue-collar, goods-producingindustries like manufacturing to white-collar service industries like retailand wholesale trade.andM;Slow productivity growth in the 1970s can be explained by the exhaustion ofpostwar growth opportunities, the energy crisis, and the onset of economicdisruptions such as inflation and recession.andM;After about 1979, however, the nation's continuing productivity woes becomemore difficult to explain away.andP;  Certain sectors of the economy haverecovered, but others remain mired in extended slumps.andP;  The recovery has beenstrangely concentrated in the goods-producing sector, where output per hourhas grown an average of 3 percent a year since 1979.andP;  During the same period,the service sector has seen almost no improvement in productivity.andM;Computers and PCs have played an odd and rather troubling role in therecovery of manufacturing.andP;  The biggest contributor to productivity growthhas been the manufacture of computer equipment.andP;  On the other hand, computershave been used heavily in service industries, where the productivity problemis now concentrated.andP;  Apparently we are getting better at making computers,but we still don't really know what to do with them once they're built.andM;Measurement ProblemsandM;Part of the dilemma may lie in the way we measure productivity.andP;  The standardmeasure is output per hour of work.andP;  The number of hours worked in theeconomy is not that hard to count, so the hardest task in assessingproductivity is measuring real output--the value of the goods and servicesproduced in a year, adjusted for inflation.andM;Inflation can be a sticking point.andP;  Although government statistical agenciescollect precise data on the dollar value of production, in many cases it ishard to know how much of a yearly increase in value is due to inflation.andO;Calculating the effect of inflation on tangible items such as cars and housesis difficult enough, but measuring its effect on the output of many serviceindustries is nearly impossible.andM;In the medical care industry, for example, the consumer price indexoverstates inflation and understates real output and productivity.andP;  Themeasuring process has not captured many of the tremendous technologicaladvances in medical care, such as new drugs and new monitoring instruments.andM;The situation is even worse in banking and financial services, one of thehottest areas of the economy in recent years.andP;  The Department of Commercedoesn't even calculate a price index for financial services; it merelyassumes that real output is always proportinal to the number of hours worked.andO;This approach categorically ignores any productivity increases in the entirebanking sector.andP;  All the investments that these industries have made incomputerizing their operations, from installing bigger and faster mainframesto building networks of automatic teller machines around the country tobuying thousands of PCs, do not show up at all in any official measures ofproductivity.andM;Many other service industries encounter similar problems.andP;  PCs have had adramatic effect on transportation industries, particularly the airlineindustry.andP;  It's hard to imagine the sheer volume of today's air travel marketwithout computerized reservation systems linking mainframes, PCs, andterminals around the world.andP;  The value of these systems is clear: UnitedAirlines recently sold 50 percent of its voting interests in the CoviaCorporation, developer and marketer of its Apollo system--generallyconsidered second best to American's Sabre reservation system--for $499million.andP;  But standard measures to a poor job of capturing the productivityimprovements they bring.andM;In &quot;Measurement Issues, the Productivity Slowdown, and the Explosion ofComputer Power,&quot; a study published this year by the Brookings Institution,Robert Gordon of Northwestern University and I looked at these and many otherexamples of poor measurement of productivity data.andP;  We concluded that thecontribution of the computer is indeed being understated, but that the errorsin measurement didn't account for the overall slowdown or the puzzle of theweackened service sector.andM;Independent sources of data for some industries find more improvement inefficiency than the standard numbers do, but still do not show the kind ofgrowth one would expect.andP;  A study of productivity in banking, for example,found that output per hour grew about 2 percent a year in the 1980s, aftergrowing at less than 0.5 percent a year from 1973 to 1979.andP;  That's animprovement, but only a small one.andM;Getting the Worst out of You PCandM;One problem is that companies are not properly using their computers and PCsto boost productivity.andM;It's not hard to find PC applications that don't contribute anything toproductivity.andP;  And PC vendors are little help: one expert at a largefull-line computer company was asked about the productivity benefits of hiscompany's machines.andP;  Instead of answering, he turned to the PC on his deskand spoke in great detail about the calendar he kept on it.andM;Keeping a calendar on a computer is handy, but a $4.95 pocket calendar may dojust as well.andP;  Thousands of PCs spend most of their time performing suchmarginal tasks, and thousands more never even get switched on.andP;  Instead ofserving as a tool to do real work, many of PC has been reduced to a high-techstatus symbol.andM;And even when companies attempt to use PCs for substantive work, the benefitsare often arguable.andP;  An executive at a large chemical company says thatPC-based word processing lets his company put reports through as many as 40preliminary drafts.andP;  But he's not at all sure that the extra drafts haveresulted in better reports or better decision-making.andP;  Such doubts have ledcompanies to question their levels of spending for word processing hardwareand software.andP;  &quot;If this stuff is so good,&quot; they ask, &quot;why do we still havetha same number of secretaries?&quot;andM;Similar problems can arise when the people who decide what computer equipmentto buy do not understand how it will be used.andP;  In &quot;Remedies for theBureaucratic Mentality in Private Industry,&quot; published in 1985 by the SAMAdvanced Management Journal, management consultant David Vondle argues thatthis results from a process he calls &quot;staff infection.&quot;andP;  As companies growand become more complex, staff groups begin to take over responsibility forkeeping records, managing personnel, and so on.andP;  Staff infection keepssupport decisions away from line managers, the people in direct contact withcustomers and/or workers.andP;  The line managers may know exactly what thecompany needs, but they have to plead with the staff groups for support.andM;The staff groups tend to make hardware and software buying decisions based ontheir secondhand imaginings of what the company needs, not on the real needsof the line managers.andP;  Afraid to dilute their authority, data processingdepartments often resist using PCs and cling to inefficient mainframes.andM;Paper Pushing, Not ProductivityandM;Offices and service industries often struggle with these problems more thanfactories do.andM;When offices are automated, managers will often resist dismissing employeesand simply increase the flow of paper their deparments produce, arguing thatall the new reports are helping the company.andP;  They have an incentive to dothis because companies often dispense salary and position according to thenumber of workers a manager supervises.andP;  True efficiency can mean careersuicide.andM;In manufacturing operations, on the other hand, the bottom line is ofteneasier to read, forcing companies to be more productive.andP;  The U.S.andP;  textileindustry, for example, has installed innovative equipment that spins andweaves fabrics many times faster than previous models could.andP;  When the newmachinery came in, plant managers had no choice but to cut back drasticallyon the labor required to produce a yard of cloth.andP;  Thus they kept theirindustry afloat in the face of stiff foreign competition.andM;Stories like the above are rare when one talks about PCs and productivity.andO;Instead, most companies tell horror stories about their computer operations.andO;And while anecdotes don't prove anything, they do suggest a general problem.andM;The revolution in computer hardware has lowered the cost of information.andP;  Theprice of a million calculations has fallen again and again.andP;  But the value ofinformation remains very difficult to assess.andP;  Maybe company reports reallyare better after 40 drafts, or at least after 5 or 10.andP;  No one wants to goback to the old days when entire documents had to be retyped every time asingle word was changed, but where do you draw the line?andM;I don't know, and neither do most company managers.andP;  When a department iscomputerized with no cut in personnel, the manager can rationalize theincreased costs by telling the boss about all the new statistics he canproduce.andP;  Maybe the new information is vital; maybe it isn't.andP;  We haven'tfigured out how to value and assimilate the mountains of informationcomputers lay at our feet.andM;Nor have we learned how to tell which information is worthless.andP;  A learningprocess always involves a good deal of trial and error.andP;  When a companycannot even decide whether or not its approach has paid off, it is going tohave trouble improving that approach.andM;PCs have changed the nature of the services many industries provide.andP;  Nowonder companies and government statistical agencies have trouble evaluatingthe changes and incorporating them into measures of productivity.andM;It takes time for productivity to improve in response to a new technology.andO;In fact, it often gets worse before it gets better.andP;  The learning process canbe surprisingly long.andP;  According to a study by Professor Kim Clark andcolleagues at the Harvard Business School, the newest and most up-to-datefactories are often not the most productive ones.andM;Every time a company introduces a new production process, its employees mustmove along a learning curve before they can make the new technology pay off.andO;PCs are hardly new, but the service sector is still learning how to use themeffectivelyandM;In some applications, the hardware has out-stripped the software.andP;  Thefinancial services sector, for example, has had difficulty developingsoftware to fit the operating procedures of individual banks.andP;  Interstatebanking regulations have allowed thousands of small banks to stay inbusiness.andP;  Because each of these banks has developed its own operatingprocedures, standard software packages are useless.andM;And the companies that write custom software for banks have had their ownproblems.andP;  Frank Reilly, a Washington, D.C., consultant to the bankingindustry, says the companies that have written packages for Washington-areabanks have had trouble remaining solvent.andP;  After they finish the programming,a seemingly endless series of bugs continues to soak up money, raising theoverall cost of development to the point where it becomes prohibitive.andM;Profit TakingandM;Mistakes can keep PCs from raising productivity, but even when individualcompanies do everything right, overall industry productivity may not rise.andO;That's because companies may use PCs to enhance their own profits at theexpense of their competitors, adding nothing to the output of the economy.andM;Competition is the life force of a market economy.andP;  Adam Smith's capitalisttheory postulates that the invisible hand of competition guides the economyfor the betterment of all, even though each person is motivated by a desirefor individual profit.andP;  But sometimes the invisible hand misses the mark.andO;Markets do not operate in all areas, and the lack of a market can distort theeconomy by burying costs in areas where the producers are not liable.andP;  Thereis no market in clean air, for example, so the invisible hand encouragesfactories and car owners to spew out air pollution.andP;  The polluters do notincur the cost of cleaning up the mess they make.andM;Sometimes companies see ways to make a profit, not by increasing the value ofgoods and services they produce, but by taking away profit from someone else.andO;In this kind of zero-sum game, one person's gain equals another's loss: thetotals remain the same, but the distribution changes.andP;  Companies fight overwho get the slices of the pie, rather than working to increase the size ofthe pie.andM;Computers have greatly increased the scope of these zero-sum redistributiveactivities.andP;  According to a data processing manager at a large Hartford,Connecticut-based insurance company, it's clear why PCs have not raisedproductivity in the insurance industry.andP;  His company uses its computers tocreate demographic profiles of potential customers and employs computer-aidedtelemarketing to steal customers away from its rivals.andP;  These marketers arenot looking for new insurance customers to expand their own business; theyare merely trying to get existing customers to switch their policies.andM;What's the Solution?andM;The mystifying reasons behind the PC's failure to boost productivitysignificantly are tied to the nature of what computers do.andM;Computers analyze and process information.andP;  Dazzling technological advancesallow them to do this much more easily and cheaply than they did just a fewyears ago.andP;  As information processing got less expensive, comapnies began todo more of it.andP;  But the temptation to do too much can be overwhelming.andP;  Ifit's so easy, why not provide more graphs, more tables, more three-colorcharts, and more desktop-published glossy reports and brochures?andM;David Vondle suggests that companies should assign values to theirinformation flows and use these values to assess the performance ofwhite-collar departments.andP;  What is it really worth to process shippinginvoices in a day instead of a week?andP;  What real benefits come from knowing abreakdown of sales by city for each month?andM;These questions go right to the heart of the problem, but the answers are notat all clear.andP;  What do you use to calculate the value of the knowledge?andM;Using the results of the valuations can be even harder.andP;  Any attempt tomonitor the activities of white-collar employees can be expected to run intostiff--and possibly legitimate--opposition from most employees and manymanagers.andM;So, are PCs helping or hurting productivity?andM;The move to PCs has obviously encouraged some wasted expenditures, but as PCprices continue to decline, the scope of that waste will decline as well.andP;  Atleast the cost of PC paperweights for status-hungry executives is less thanit was.andM;On the plus side, PCs can free line managers from the tyranny of staffdepartments and encourage companies to apply the technology to bottom-lineactivities such as lowering production costs, serving customers, and cuttinginventory.andP;  In this context, the PC learning process speeds up as linepersonnel quickly find out which approaches work and which do not.andO;Accountability follows naturally.andM;For the improvements to spread to the big picture, senior executives as wellas line managers must learn to understand computers.andP;  Today, the peoplemaking decisions about PC investments often have little knowledge of thetechnology.andP;  Conversely, those who recommend the technology often do notfully understand the company's overall strategy or the general needs of itsemployees and customers.andP;  Companies must invest in computer training forsenior executives so that they can understand the PC's strengths andweaknesses in pursuing the company's goals.andM;Research has a role to play, too.andP;  The United States remains the world leaderin pure science, resting on a still unmatched scientific establishment.andO;Unfortunately, we have not always done so well when it comes to applyingscience for commercial goals.andM;We need research aimed at developing organizational innovations to improvethe efficiency of white-collar activities, particularly using PCs moreeffectively.andP;  It would make sense to poll different companies' experienceswith PCs, and to try to isolate the factors that lead some organizations todo well while others struggle.andP;  We also need to work on developing basicmodels of how information flows and contributes to an organization's output.andM;Concern over how well PCs have paid back the enormous investment in them islegitimate.andP;  But most of the problems are symptons of the learning process,which, though it can seem agonizingly slow, is proceeding.andM;American companies are wrestling PC technology to the ground and learning howto shape it to fit real-world needs.andP;  Once the current problems are licked,PCs have the potential to make a major contribution to productivity in thefuture.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
