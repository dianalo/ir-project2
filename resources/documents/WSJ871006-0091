Iowa has a population problem. New state figures from the Census Bureau covering the 1980s show Iowa losing residents consistently from 1981 to mid-1986. No other state, neither manufacturing states of the Northeast -- Great Lakes industrial belt nor other Farm Belt states, can match Iowa's dubious record of nonstop population outflow through the first half of the decade.    Since births outnumber deaths in Iowa, as they do in every other state, the decline in total population reflects out-migration-the decision of a lot of Iowans to pick up and move elsewhere.    Iowa's own population watchers say the continuing exodus is a mix of older people looking for retirement homes in the sun, middle-aged wage earners fleeing a depressed farm economy, and most troubling, well-educated young adults who don't see a future in their home state.    &quot;It's a problem and we're deeply concerned,&quot; says Herbert Schulte, vice president of corporate planning for Meredith Corp., the large, Des Moines-based magazine publisher. &quot;We're willing to concede that a number of our state's retirees are seeking a warmer climate. What concerns us more is the out-migration of young people, particularly those on whom we've spent considerable money training for someone else.&quot;    IN THE SIX-PLUS YEARS between the last national census on April 1, 1980, and the date of the Census Bureau's latest estimates of state populations -- July 1, 1986 -- Iowa lost 2.2% of its population. That works out to 63,000 persons, more than the population of Council Bluffs, one of Iowa's medium-sized cities.    It's also a bigger percentage decline than in any of the other three states that lost population in this period. The other population losers in 1980-1986 were Michigan, Ohio and West Virginia. The District of Columbia also lost residents in this period.    While the short-term population flight from industrial states such as Michigan grabbed all the headlines at the height of the recession, Iowa remains the only state to lose residents in each year of the decade so far.    In Michigan in the early 1980s, you could chart the stream of unemployed auto workers heading for construction and oil-field jobs in Texas and Oklahoma. The biggest outflow came in the 12 months ending in April 1982, when 157,000 more people moved out of the state than moved in.    BUT MICHIGAN HAS DONE a demographic about-face. It hasn't been a population loser since 1984. And out-migration has slowed to a trickle; the net loss for the year ended April 1986 was just 3,300.    The improving industrial and service economy in the upper Midwest &quot;has diminished drastically the number of people leaving,&quot; says Laurence Rosen, Michigan's state demographer. &quot;We might even see some net in-migration. It's been a good year,&quot; he adds.    In Iowa, the trend is just the reverse. Out-migration is on the rise. Total net migration (the excess of persons leaving the state over those moving in) in the last three years is estimated at 15,000, 37,000 and 46,000.    (These migration numbers are obtained by analyzing names and addresses on federal tax returns. These data, which the Internal Revenue Service gives to the Census Bureau, are considered the best available source of interstate population shifts.)    AGRICULTURE GETS most of the blame for Iowa's runaway population. Farm employment has shrunk by one-quarter, or by 10,600 jobs, since 1980, according to the federal government's Bureau of Economic Analysis. Employment in the machinery sector, dominated by the farm implement manufacturer Deere andamp; Co., is off by one-third, or 22,400 jobs, in the same six-year period.    And the boom in services, real estate and transportation that has buoyed the economies of other states seems to have leapfrogged Iowa. Non-manufacturing employment there is up only 3% since 1979, compared with 20% for the U.S.    &quot;When you dig down, you find that the state's economy really isn't very diversified,&quot; says David Allardice, vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and principal author of a recent study of the Iowa economy.    Adds Kenneth Stone, professor of economics at Iowa State University: &quot;The fact that agriculture has taken such a hit explains an awful lot why people have left.&quot;    Boosters may point to Iowa's surprisingly low unemployment rate, 4.5% in July, well below the national average, as evidence that things aren't all bad. Prof. Stone says fleeing Iowans have even played a part there.    &quot;An awful lot of young people have left, looking for jobs, and that's gotten rid of our surplus labor,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
