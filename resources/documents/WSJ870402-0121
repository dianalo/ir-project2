In the year-ago quarter, the forest products concern earned $86 million, or 79 cents a share, on sales of $1.93 billion.    Georgia-Pacific said it agreed to sell warrants to purchase 1.8 million shares of Georgia Gulf common to Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. The shares were included in Goldman Sachs's secondary public offering of 4.8 million Georgia Gulf shares at $34.25 a share, Georgia-Pacific said. The remainder of the shares in the offering were held by General Electric Credit Corp., a unit of General Electric Co.    Georgia-Pacific received the warrants as part of its 1984 agreement to sell its commodity chemical operations to Georgia Gulf, an Atlanta-based chemical company. </TEXT></DOC>
