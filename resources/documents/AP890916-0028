Negotiators for the telephone company and the IBEW metintermittently Friday morning and afternoon, and union leaders saidthe company appeared to be pushing to reach a settlement bymidnight. But the talks at Boston's Park Plaza Hotel endedfruitlessly at 12:25 a.m.   Earlier in the day, ebullient union leaders addressing 700strikers at a rally outside New England Telephone Co.'s headquartersin Boston said the six-week strike had been significantlystrengthened by a Massachusetts ruling that the workers would beentitled to unemployment benefits starting next week.   Myles Calvey, head of the International Brotherhood of ElectricalWorkers Local 2222, estimated that unemployment payments for 12,000Massachusetts workers would cost the telephone company $9 millionper week.   Calvey and Steve Early, spokesman for the Communications Workersof America, said the ruling Wednesday by the state Division ofEmployment and training had caused the company to push for a rapidsettlement.   NYNEX reportedly made concessions on safety and insurance issuesthis week in its talks with the IBEW and the CWA, which togetherrepresent 62,000 striking workers at NYNEX companies in New York andNew England.   Workers walked out Aug. 6 after NYNEX asked them to start paying$10.27 a week toward health insurance. For nearly 20 years, thecompany had paid 100 percent of the insurance premiums.   Job security, safety, wages and benefits are also on thebargaining table, but both sides have said health care is the keyissue.   ``It was our hope that (the strike) would have ended sooner,''said Robert O'Brien, spokesman for NYNEX in New York. ``Our hope isthat we'll find a way out of this. We know our workers want to comeback to work.''   NYNEX is the only one of the nation's seven ``Baby Bell''regional telephone operating companies that still has not reached asettlement with its workers. Employees of Bell Atlantic, PacificTelesis and Ameritech struck last month but reached agreements.   Beginning next week, the more than 40,000 NYNEX strikers in NewYork also will be eligible for unemployment compensation, said Early.   Union leaders introduced a plan to help support 6,000 strikers inother New England states who are not eligible for unemploymentbenefits.</TEXT></DOC>
