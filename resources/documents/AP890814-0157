(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A mental patient accused of fatallystabbing a 9-year-old girl at a street fair after walking away froma state hospital was found competent Monday to stand trial.   Superior Court Judge Donald T. Dorsey accepted the unananimousfinding of competency by an examining panel made up of apsychiatrist, psychologist and psychiatric social worker.   The panel noted that David Peterson suffers from mental illnessand experiences delusions of persecution, but said the problems donot compromise his ability to understand the charges against him andto help in his own defense.   Peterson, 37, had been committed to the state's care in 1988after being found innocent by reason of insanity in the stabbing ofa neighbor in a rooming house.   Peterson, who kept his eyes lowered during the 10-minute hearing,was wearing a large bandage over his right hand and wrist. Hisattorney, Assistant Public Defender Chris James, said he believedPeterson had suffered the injury when he was arrested after the July28 knife attack.   Asked how Peterson has been acting since the slaying, James wouldonly say, ``He's a very sick young man.''   James waived a hearing on the competency issue, but said he wouldrequest that Peterson be re-examined before trial because competency``is a day- to-day thing.''.   The judge scheduled a probable cause hearing for Sept. 12.Peterson was arrested on murder and weapons charges.   Peterson walked off the grounds of Connecticut Valley Hospital inMiddletown on July 28, took a bus to downtown and bought a huntingknife. He then went to a crowded street fair, where he attacked9-year-old Jessica Short at random while her mother and severalother people looked on, police said.   The attack lasted less than a minute, ending when police officersand a bystander pulled Peterson away from the girl. She was stabbedrepeatedly in the face and chest and died less than an hour later.   Peterson is now being held at the Whiting Forsensic Institute,the maximum-security facility in Middletown for criminally insanemental patients. Dorsey ordered that bond remain at $750,000.</TEXT></DOC>
