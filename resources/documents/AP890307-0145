U.N. officials saidbaton-wielding troops clubbed 25 people in a Gaza Strip clinic.   The incidents occurred during widespread clashes betweenstone-throwing Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops in theoccupied territories after the deaths of three Palestinians onMonday.   In addition to the reported beatings Tuesday, at least 34Palestinians were shot and wounded, most in the occupied Gaza Strip,Arab hospital officials said. Ten of the gunshot wounds werereported in Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, where the medical clinicwas raided.   Army spokesmen confirmed the latest death and six of theinjuries, adding other reports were being investigated.   Also Tuesday, the army blew up the houses in Nablus of twoPalestinians accused of killing a soldier last month. ParatrooperBenny Meisner died Feb. 24 when a building block was dropped on hishead from the roof of a house.   Israel radio carried the sound of the explosions, and jeering andwhistling by protesting Palestinians could be heard in thebackground. Israel television said the two suspects confessed to thekilling.   In another development, Israeli newspapers reported Tuesday thatthe army detained five soldiers suspected of extoring tens ofthousands of dollars from Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip.   The reports said the soldiers allegedly held Palestinians atgunpoint while they frisked the men and searched their homes, takingtens of thousands of dollars, Israeli shekels and Jordanian dinars.   The military command said it was checking the reports.   In Nablus' market, 18-year-old Hakam Baker was fatally shot inthe neck and back by soldiers, hospital officials said.   An army spokesman, who cannot be identified by name undermilitary rules, said Baker fled from an army patrol, ignoring ordersto halt and warning shots fired in the air. He said the man had arecord of anti-Israeli activities and was wanted on unspecifiedcharges.   Baker was the 391st Palestinian to be killed since the uprisingagainst Israeli rule in the territories erupted in December 1987.Seventeen Israelis also have died, six of them soldiers.   The fatal shooting occurred as the army conducted a majorsecurity sweep in the narrow, winding alleys of Nablus' market,which has been a center of unrest.   The city of 120,000 people, the West Bank's largest, was putunder curfew, which restricts people to their homes. Troops withautomatic rifles stood guard atop buildings along the main road intothe city.   In the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian doctor said soldiers and borderpolice barged into a medical clinic run by the U.N. Relief and WorksAgency in the Jabaliya refugee camp. UNRWA supervises aid programsfor Palestinian refugees.   The physician at the clinic, who identified himself only as Dr.Ahmed, told The Associated Press by telephone: ``We treated 45 casesof beatings, regular bullets, rubber bullets, and there werehundreds of relatives gathered in front of the clinic.''   Some of the relatives threw stones at soldiers, who chasedPalestinians into the clinic, the doctor said.   Inside, the soldiers beat 25 people with nightsticks and brokeall the windows, a microscope, a telephone and some syringes, hesaid.   ``They beat some of the injured people we were treating,'' Dr.Ahmed said, adding three beating victims suffered factured skullsand were sent to a hospital.   An army spokesman said more than 1,000 people had gatheredoutside the clinic in Jabaliya and that preliminary reportsindicated some Palestinians were wounded by soldiers.   But he was unable to give a specific number or any detailsconcerning the actions of the soldiers inside the clinic. A radioreport said several people were arrested, including one UNRWA worker.   Doctors at Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City said they treated 37Palestinians for beating injuries, including some from Jabaliya.Among the wounded was a 2-year-old girl who suffered a broken leg ina clash with soldiers.   Among the deaths that spurred Tuesday's unrest was that ofMahmoud Yousef Masri, 32, who died in a Gaza prison after severaldays of intensive questioning.   An autopsy conducted by the prison authority revealed that Masridied of natural causes and was not physically abused, Israeltelevision reported.   The television said Masri had an ulcer condition and died in thecorridor of the prison, not the interrogation room as had beenalleged.   Justice Minister Dan Meridor told army radio Tuesday that he hadheard no claims of torture in the case, but the death was beinginvestigated.</TEXT></DOC>
