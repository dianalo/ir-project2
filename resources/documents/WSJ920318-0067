Bill Clinton of Arkansas and PresidentBush scored sweeping victories in critical presidentialprimaries in Illinois and Michigan.   With the wins, Mr. Bush effectively wrapped up the GOPnomination, while Mr. Clinton put himself on course to winthe Democratic nomination.</LP><TEXT>   But both men are still troubled by opponents who can't beexpected to win but can still cause trouble by staying in therace. Former California Gov. Jerry Brown, who finished astrong second in Michigan, will continue to stalk Mr.Clinton, while a demoralized Patrick Buchanan will scale backhis campaign and concentrate on challenging the president inthe June 2 California primary.   The results are an unalloyed triumph for Mr. Clinton,representing his first significant victories outside hisnative South. With most of the ballots counted, Mr. Clintonwas winning about half of the vote in both Illinois andMichigan. The one surprise was Mr. Brown's strongsecond-place showing in Michigan, where he won more than 25%of the vote.   The results were devastating for former Sen. Paul Tsongasof Massachusetts, though he vowed to continue the fight. Hemanaged to finish second in Illinois, with a little more than25% of the vote, but he came in a distant third behind Mr.Brown in Michigan.   &quot;There's no question that this is his {Mr. Clinton's}nomination to win,&quot; said Democratic pollster Geoffrey Garin,who predicted that the race will become a referendum on theArkansas governor. &quot;Bill Clinton now has a different job, tomake people comfortable with him as the likely nominee.&quot;   Apart from the presidential stakes, Illinois was the sceneof bitter fights among Democrats that put Sen. Alan Dixon'sseat in jeopardy and threatened the defeat of as many as fourincumbents in the House as a result of redistricting andscandal.   Sen. Tsongas and Mr. Buchanan conceded they would have toregroup in order to figure out what to do, and where to go,next. Both are running low in campaign cash to continue thefight.   Mr. Buchanan's campaign manager, Angela &quot;Bay&quot; Buchanan,who is his sister, conceded there was no chance the formerWhite House official, newspaper columnist and televisioncommentator could wrest the nomination from Mr. Bush. But shesaid it was still worthwhile to press the president to adhereto more conservative principles.   Mr. Brown, waging a low-cost &quot;insurgency&quot; campaign,targeted Michigan while doing no more than what he called&quot;raising the flag&quot; in Illinois. He will continue to picktargets of opportunity, turning his attention now to nextweek's Connecticut primary, where he says he will continuehis blistering attacks on Mr. Clinton's ethics and record inoffice.   National party leaders called on Mr. Brown to tone downhis anti-Clinton rhetoric, all to no avail, and Mr. Clinton'sadvisers began huddling to discuss ways to deal with thecontentious Mr. Brown, fearing he will damage theirgeneral-election prospects.   Mr. Buchanan had hoped to find an eager audience inMichigan, a state ravaged by recession. But he canceled anappearance in Detroit's St. Patrick's Day parade yesterdayand repaired to his hotel for what aides called a &quot;rest.&quot; Hetold supporters late last night that he would keep fightingbut conceded his campaign has been damaged.   For President Bush, the best news from yesterday's votingwas the way his campaign organization finally pulled itselftogether.   &quot;They put us in their sights, and their shots were righton target,&quot; said Frank Luntz, Mr. Buchanan's pollster. &quot;Forthe first time, they had the right message, and I complimentthem for it.&quot;   The Bush campaign pounded voters with television adspointing out that Mr. Buchanan owns a Mercedes-Benzautomobile because he said three U.S. cars he had ownedpreviously were all &quot;lemons.&quot; The ads didn't note that Mr.Buchanan also owns a Cadillac. The Bush message was alsoincluded in a mailing to Buchanan-leaning male voters. Thefliers showed a picture of Mr. Buchanan, next to a picture ofa lemon.   The Michigan strategy featured a second mailing exploitingMr. Buchanan's weak support among women. It featured a quotefrom Mr. Buchanan in which he said women are &quot;less equippedpsychologically to `stay the course' in the brawling arenasof business, commerce, industry and the professions.&quot;   &quot;He's gone,&quot; said Karl Rove, referring to Mr. Buchanan.Mr. Rove is a political strategist brought in from Texas tohelp the Bush campaign in Michigan. &quot;People are finding itless attractive to cast a protest vote,&quot; he said.   Buchanan strategists said their candidate doesn't like tolose and that he has been bruised by losing every contest toGeorge Bush. They hint that it is time for Mr. Bush to reachout for a reconciliation that would begin to bind the party'swounds. &quot;George Bush needs Patrick Buchanan,&quot; said Mr. Luntz.&quot;He says he's felt the pain. Now's the time for him to reachout to Pat.&quot;   Mr. Luntz noted that about 25% of the Republican votes arestill going to Mr. Buchanan in these primaries and that &quot;Bushwill need those votes to win.&quot;   Mr. Buchanan has always looked forward to a showdown withPresident Bush in California on June 2, but that's weeksaway. Given his performance yesterday, some observerswondered if he would really make a stand there. &quot;I'd have betthe bank Pat would have gone all the way to California,&quot; saidGOP strategist Ed Rollins, an old associate of Mr. Buchanan.&quot;Now I'm not so sure.&quot;   Mr. Clinton came into yesterday's contests with a 2-to-1edge over Mr. Tsongas in delegates, 766 to 364, and hecaptured the lion's share of the 295 up for grabs in the twoMidwestern contests. A candidate needs 2,145 delegate votesto win the nomination.   Mr. Tsongas flew out of Michigan late yesterday tocontinue the fight in Connecticut, in his native New England,where he needs to prove his viability all over again. Hiscampaign strategists are staking almost everything onConnecticut to prepare themselves for an even biggerchallenge, the New York primary on April 7.   &quot;Our intention at this point is to go to the convention,&quot;said Dennis Kanin, a longtime Tsongas adviser and campaignmanager. &quot;We don't have the money Clinton has. We think wehave something else -- a message.&quot;   After enjoying celebrity as a &quot;pro-business liberal,&quot; Mr.Tsongas -- as last night's returns show -- has yet to adaptthat message effectively to reach working-class Democrats. Hepermitted the better-financed Mr. Clinton to isolate him asan elite friend of Wall Street. But the Tsongas campaignhopes to turn the &quot;fairness issue&quot; around on the governor byfocusing more attention on Arkansas' own tax record in thepast decade.   Network exit polls showed Mr. Clinton received about halfthe vote from union households and three-quarters of theblack vote in both states. Mr. Brown had sought union supportin Michigan by blasting his opponents for their support ofputting the proposed U.S.-Mexico free-trade pact on a fasttrack. The exit polls show Mr. Brown picked up aboutone-third of Michigan's union vote. Mr. Tsongas picked up 10%of the union vote.   In contrast with Gov. Clinton, Messrs. Brown and Tsongasboth drew strength from voters in Michigan who said that themain attribute they looked for in a candidate was awillingness to tell the truth. Only 24% of such voters backedMr. Clinton, while 37% backed Mr. Brown and 34% chose Mr.Tsongas.   In the congressional races in Illinois, Mr. Dixon, whoangered party activists by voting for the nomination ofSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas last year, faced astiff challenge by Carol Moseley Braun, a black Cook Countyofficial and former state legislator who was drawing strongsupport from women.   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowskisurvived a challenge by former Chicago alderman and reformleader Dick Simpson. But with most of the vote in, Rep. MartyRusso, a Rostenksowki protege, was the projected loser in amatch with Rep. William Lipinski, who had the backing of theChicago Democratic machine.   In another bitter Chicago contest, Rep. Gus Savage, long acontroversial figure, was projected as losing to MelReynolds, a respected educator who received increasedattention after someone fired a gun into his car while he wascampaigning recently on the city's South Side.</TEXT></DOC>
