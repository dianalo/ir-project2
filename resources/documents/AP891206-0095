And for the first time this year, the quarter-to-quarter hourlywage gains made by workers outpaced the the growth in consumerinflation, the Labor Department said.   The department said overall productivity in the non-farm sectorof the economy increased at a revised annual rate of 2.5 percent inthe July-September period, more than double the anemic 1.1 percentannual-rate gain in the second quarter.   But in manufacturing, a sector weakened by slumping auto salesand other problems, productivity increased at a revised annual rateof just 1 percent after improving at an annual rate of 3.7 percentin the April-June period.   The poor manufacturing performance came as output rose just 1.2percent and hours worked increased a weak 0.2 percent, reflectingslackened demand for goods. The increase in output was the smallestsince a slight decline in the second quarter of 1986.   Because of the poor productivity gain in manufacturing and asignificant increase in wages, unit labor costs, a key determinantof future price inflation, rose at at an annual rate of 4.9 percentafter decreasing by 1 percent in the second quarter. It was thelargest increase in unit labor costs since the 1982 recession, thedepartment said.   That increase will likely translate into either higher pricesfor consumers for manufactured goods or lower profits for producers_ or both _ and also makes it more difficult for U.S. manufacturersto compete in overseas markets.   ``We're getting more upward wage pressure in manufacturing andwith the weak productivity numbers, that pushes up costs,'' theMichael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm.   Kathleen Stephansen, senior economist for Donaldson, Lufkin andJenrette, echoed the sentiments of most analysts in saying it wasunlikely the manufacturing sector would rebound until interestrates drop further, which she said could come soon if Novemberemployment data due Friday showed continued economic weakness.   The overall 2.5 percent annual-rate productivity gain in thenon-farm sector came as output rose at a rate of 3.7 percent in theJuly-September period while hours worked grew at a much slowerannual rate of 1.3 percent.   For the overall non-farm sector, the data on unit labor costswas more encouraging. Costs per good produced rose at a revisedannual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter after rising at arapid 4.5 percent rate in the April-June period.   The government said hourly compensation in the non-farm sectorgrew at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in the July-September period,an increase that translated into a real earnings gain of 2.8percent an hour when inflation is taken into account.   The hourly compensation for manufacturing workers increased atan annual rate of 5.9 percent. After inflation is factored intothat improvement, manufacturing workers received a real hourlyearnings boost of 3.5 percent at an annual rate in the thirdquarter.   For both the overall economy and the manufacturing sector it wasthe first time this year that workers enjoyed an increase in realhourly earnings _ wage gains minus the erosion of buying powercaused by inflation.</TEXT></DOC>
