But the winner in November is likely to be the candidate who is better able to appeal to the discontents -- neo-populists who are dissatisfied with things as they are and who feel the deck is stacked against them. &quot;Ultimately, this election will be decided by these voters who don't identify very closely with either Bush or Dukakis today,&quot; says Edward Rollins, who directed President Reagan's 1984 campaign.    Neither Gov. Dukakis, the product of affluent Brookline and Harvard Law School, nor Vice President Bush, the quintessential establishmentarian, instinctively understands the frustrations of a lot of middle-class Americans in the way that Ronald Reagan intuitively does. Thus, appealing to those voters isn't easy for either candidate.    Yet despite an almost certain surge in the polls following this week's convention, the task is more difficult -- though not impossible -- for George Bush.    To measure the feelings of the discontents, last week's nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll asked voters if they agreed or disagreed with the following three statements:   1) &quot;Government is pretty much run by a few big interests&quot;;   2) &quot;Unfair foreign competition is ruining this country's economy&quot;;   3) &quot;The political and economic systems in this country are stacked against people like me.&quot;    Thirty-seven percent of the likely voters in the poll agreed with all three statements. While these voters aren't anti-Reagan, they clearly want a new course. When asked whether the next president should continue along the path of Ronald Reagan or change direction, more than two-thirds opt for change.    In the overall survey, Mr. Dukakis had a 10-percentage-point lead, and among the non-discontented voters the race was dead even. But among those who agreed with all three of those assertions, the vice president was clobbered by two to one. Moreover, Mr. Bush's remarkably high negatives -- 43% of the likely voters overall have an unfavorable opinion of the vice president -- come disproportionately from this group. They see him as weak and ineffective and not caring about average folks.    In the weeks ahead, says Mr. Rollins, the GOP strategist, &quot;George Bush has to convince those rednecks in Texas and California that he really cares about people like them and that he understands their concerns.&quot;    For starters, Mr. Bush has to stop making goofy comments that play better with the yachting or country-club set than in Legion halls or Elks clubs. As long as George Bush talks about &quot;a bevy of quail&quot; or people going to &quot;debutante parties&quot; or being in &quot;deep doo-doo,&quot; it isn't easy to convince many working-class Americans that he identifies with them or that he's a tough leader. The vice president had the chance to send a message to these voters with his own vice presidential choice; his choice of Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, however, doesn't address those concerns. Mr. Bush will get another chance this week with his acceptance speech, a vehicle that Michael Dukakis earlier used quite effectively to assuage worries about himself.    Certainly the economic issue is critical to the voters who will determine this election. Mr. Bush is on high ground by stressing economic growth and optimism about the future; candidates from John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan have demonstrated that a can-do message is usually a winning one.    In his valedictory to the GOP convention Monday night, Mr. Reagan hit the theme squarely: &quot;It is the American people who endured the great challenge of lifting us from the depths of national calamity, renewing our mighty economic strength and leading the way to restoring our respect in the world.&quot;    But the vice president, to paraphrase a favorite Ronald Reagan joke, has the words down but not the music: He still must convince these voters that he understands what it's like to struggle and that he's tough enough to stand up to vested interests.    Some advisers are urging the GOP nominee to hit hard on some of the social issues -- capital punishment for drug dealers, abortion and school prayer. Certainly there'll be a concerted effort to depict Michael Dukakis as a softy on some of these cultural issues.    But political analyst Alan Baron, a Democrat, sees a sleeper issue that could help the GOP nominee with the discontents: a desire for divided government.    The Democrats are sure to retain control of Congress and the vice president will score points, Mr. Baron contends, if he &quot;warns of the dangers of unchecked power. These people are suspicious of government and many believe they're more protected with a divided government.&quot;    Mr. Baron warns, however, that Mr. Bush will make a big mistake if he tries to be something that he's not. He has to find a middle ground between sounding like a preppy patrician and a truck driver. &quot;Bush can't persuade these voters that he's a tough cop,&quot; he says. &quot;When he tries to talk tough or swear it just doesn't seem natural.&quot;    George Bush simply lacks his boss's ability to understand and talk the language of these voters. &quot;Ronald Reagan never talked over their heads and he echoed their feelings and frustrations,&quot; says Mr. Rollins, his 1984 campaign manager. &quot;They could see Reagan as a farmer or working in a shop or as their next-door neighbor.&quot;    Very few of these people today can see George Bush working next to them in a factory, or at their neighborhood barbecue. He has 12 weeks to convince them otherwise.    ---   Mr. Hunt is chief of the Journal's Washington bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
