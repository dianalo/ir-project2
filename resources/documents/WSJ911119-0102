With Cray currently responding to competition bybroadening its product line to offer a range of smaller, lessexpensive supercomputers, the Cray Y-MP C-90 is a throwback,operating at four times the speed of the company's previoussupercomputers and costing $30.5 million.</LP><TEXT>   The hefty price, more than $7 million above any of Cray'sprevious machines, raised questions among analysts about themachine's market potential in a time of government budgetcuts. Government-funded research laboratories anduniversities make up the bulk of Cray's customers. &quot;How manygovernment labs and universities are going to be able toafford that in the future?&quot; asked George Lindamood, acomputer analyst for Gartner Group.   Cray, which will introduce the computer at theSupercomputing '91 trade show here, said it has a fullproduction schedule for the machine's first year -- about sixor seven machines. But analysts said the key to gauging themachine's success will come in the second and third years,when Cray will be capable of producing twice as manymachines.   Still, for a company with about $800 million in annualrevenue, the new computer represents a &quot;sizeable chunk ofbusiness,&quot; Mr. Lindamood said. He expects the company tobroaden the supercomputer's appeal by introducing smaller,less expensive versions.   The top-of-the-line supercomputer, as a total system, is&quot;very competitive&quot; with Cray's primary rivals in Japanbecause of Cray's software and networking abilities, saysBarry F. Willman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co.With the new machine and other additions to its product line,Mr. Willman projects double-digit revenue growth in 1992,which Cray hasn't seen since 1988. Through this year's firstnine months, the Eagan, Minn., company reported net income of$53.4 million, or $2 a share, on revenue of $545.9 million.   The Y-MP C-90 features a new central processing unit thatcan perform one billion mathematical operations a second, orone gigaflop. With 16 CPUs contained in the computer, thesystem has a peak performance of 16 gigaflops. Charles M.Grassl, a senior marketing analyst for Cray, said the newmachine runs all existing Cray software. Customer shipmentsare expected to begin in January.</TEXT></DOC>
