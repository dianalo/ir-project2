MILLS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Environmental Protection Agency'sguidelines for what constitutes clean beach water need tightening,says an engineer for an environmental organization.   Diane M. Cameron of the Natural Resources Defense Council urgeda congressional panel Wednesday to set a ``zero health risk'' goalfor beach water.   ``NRDC believes that EPA's recommendation of 19 cases ofgastroenteritis per 1,000 marine swimmers as the maximum acceptablepublic health risk is clearly too high a threshold of risk,'' shesaid in testimony submitted to the House Merchant Marinesubcommittee on oceanography and Great Lakes.   ``Many states, including New York and Massachusetts, haveadopted EPA's swimmer health risk goal as their own, with theresult that many beaches deemed `safe' for swimming may actually belaced with sufficient pathogens to make hundreds of people each daysick with gastroenteritis and other diseases.''   Cameron said a zero health risk is achievable because it doesn'tmean zero pathogens. She also suggested developing a ``bathingbeach water quality index,'' akin to the familiar ``air qualityindex.''   However, officials argued that the current system for testingthe cleanliness of beach water is adequate and that the federalgovernment should not trample on states' rights.   EPA witness William R. Diamond said that ``in the past twodecades, programs to control water pollution established by (theEPA) under the Clean Water Act have virtually eliminated the threatof serious illness and disease from swimming at beaches.''   Diamond, who is director of the agency's criteria and standardsdivision in the office of water regulations and standards, said theEPA opposes a bill before the subcommittee which would setmandatory guidelines for testing beach water.   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Bill Hughes, D-N.J., would requirethe EPA to revise its criteria to ensure beach water testing on aweekly basis at minimum.   Currently, some states test their water less frequently, oraverage the results of repeated tests.   The bill would also require states to adopt the EPA's standards.They now are voluntary unless a state adopts them as part of itsown water-quality program.   James P. Burgess, an official with the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration called Hughes' bill unnecessary becausecurrent law covers ``a system by which EPA establishes nationalwater quality criteria and states develop state water qualitystandards is already in place,''   ``Second, NOAA believes that mandatory criteria and uniformtesting and monitoring procedures may be an unnecessary intrusionby the federal government into the responsibilities of individualstates,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
