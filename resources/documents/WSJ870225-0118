Under terms, the companies will develop computer systems combining Apollo's workstation systems and Concurrent's Series 3200 superminicomputers, Apollo said. The agreement includes provisions for joint marketing of the integrated systems, but the companies also may sell the systems separately, Apollo added.    The companies also signed a one-year contract under which Concurrent will purchase Apollo workstations for resale, Apollo said.    The contracts could produce sales of several million dollars for the two companies, Apollo said.    For the year ended Jan. 3, Apollo earned $9.3 million, or 27 cents a share, on sales of $391.7 million. </TEXT></DOC>
