CLIFFORD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal official investigating more than$220 million in losses from alleged fraud at savings and loans saysmuch of the crisis in the nation's thrifts can be traced to a ``newbreed of owner.''   ``Often they were real estate developers'' who took over a smallthrift, a move that ``provided them with a ready source of cash tofund their projects,'' James Cirona, president of the Federal HomeLoan Bank of San Francisco, said in testimony to be given today to acongressional committee.   Cirona was appearing for a second day before members of the HouseBanking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee at a hearing into thetroubled thrift industry, which saw a post-Depression record 217insolvent institutions last year.   On Thursday, Cirona, whose district includes California, Nevadaand Arizona, delivered a half-inch thick statement that said sinceAugust of 1987 his investigators had referred 5,384 cases ofpossible fraud or abuse to the U.S. attorney's office.   Many of the cases ``involve rather small amounts obtainedfraudulently by borrowers or depositors,'' he said.   ``However, we are particularly concerned by abuse by insiderswhich may often involve very large sums of money. For this reason wehave established a special system of `priority referrals' thatinvolves insiders or amounts in excess of $100,000.   ``We estimate that losses ... on these priority referrals, as ofSept. 23, 1988, amounted to over $220 million.''   The new breed of savings and loan owner, who entered the fieldfollowing deregulation in 1982, could find an ``auditor that wouldallow a thrift to guarantee a profit by investing in acquisition,developments and construction loans,'' Cirona said in today'sprepared testimony.   Others testifying on Thursday included Herbert Sandler, chairmanand chief executive officer of World Savings and Loan Association, asuccessful Oakland thrift that Sandler said deals only inresidential loans.   He said the savings and loan crisis was ``the greatest financialscandal in history in which in excess of $100 billion has beenwasted and lost.''   The problems could have been avoided if the ``fundamentals of thethrift industry'' _ dealing only in residential loans _ had beenfollowed, he said.   Sandler called efforts at deregulation of the industry bungledand that regulators had been repeatedly warned.   ``I could tell you stories that would make your hair curl,'' hesaid, bringing laughter from the nearly-packed hearing room and fromcommittee chairman Henry Gonzalez, who ran his hand over his baldpate.   Gonzalez, D-Texas, earlier told his own horror stories of failedthrifts, recalling a couple who lost $50,000 saved for theirchildren's education.   ``It would tear your heart out'' to hear such stories, saidGonzalez.   Gonzalez called for a full analysis of the crisis in the savingsand loans institutions where government bailouts exceeded $38billion in 1988 alone.   The hearing was needed to ``clean up the mess that is already outthere,'' he said, adding that more hearings would be held in othercities.</TEXT></DOC>
