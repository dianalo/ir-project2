As budgets shrink and use expands, PC costs will flare asa big issue on campus, says Kenneth C. Green of theUniversity of Southern California's Center for ScholarlyTechnology. He sees some benefits to a PC requirement:Students buy equipment and take it home later, easing schoolburdens such as amortizing costs. Dartmouth adopts a PCmandate after a federal aid rule states computer costs arepaid for only if PCs are a must for all students.</LP><TEXT>   Just a dozen or so schools require PCs, but many coursesdemand them. Harvard has no rule, but nearly all B-Schoolstudents compute. Stanford nixed the idea of a mandate asinequitable but provides PC clusters, as do others. At theUniversity of California at Davis, 20% of English classes arein computer labs so students can critique each other. NewJersey backs networking with a $5,000 grant to state collegesthat link with its chosen system.   Two-thirds of campuses have computer resale pacts, butonly 40% for software, says a 1990 USC study.                                                                                                          UP A TREE: The Sharper Image catalog stops using recycledpaper.   The upscale gadget outfit reluctantly returns tounrecycled paper in its latest catalog, citing printingproblems and cost. &quot;We try to be environmentally friendly,but it's just a question of economics,&quot; says marketing manSydney Klevatt, noting the paper can carry a 20% pricepremium, at a time when higher postal rates are also hurting.It plans to mail fewer catalogs, especially to people whohaven't bought much lately.   A glut of unrecycled paper may make the premium on &quot;green&quot;stock seem steeper. But few catalogers buck the trend. Why?&quot;Their customers want it,&quot; says Chet Dalzell of the DirectMarketing Association. Firms go to great lengths to explainwhy not all their paper is recycled. Smith andamp; Hawken offers afive-page list of green efforts, and aims for 100% recycledpaper. The 1990 score: over 50%. Says the American PaperInstitute's J. Rodney Edwards: &quot;Nothing is going to slow thetrend to using recycled paper.&quot;                                                                                                          SIDE DISH: Company cafes offer takeout food and sundriesto make ends meet.   Subsidized cafeterias, which may charge only a third ofwhat meals cost, move to close the napkin gap. Merrill Lynchin New York swaps a sit-down executive restaurant for a foodcourt with pizza, Chinese dishes and burgers. It now shows aprofit as daily diners more than triple. Ford Motor Co. inDearborn, Mich., helps cut waste by selling excess bakedgoods and take-home entrees such as lasagna and meat pies.Discount coupons and fliers aid sales.   Citicorp puts videotape rental machines outside two NewYork cafeterias as well as machines with aspirin, hosiery andsuch. Others sell gum, batteries and pens as they aim for&quot;zero subsidy,&quot; says Steve Zagor, a Coopers andamp; Lybrandconsultant. He says 69% of surveyed firms underwrite dining,down a bit from 1989. And while some 40% report fewer workersnow, companies are loath to cut programs and hurt morale.   Ford workers can order take-home tortes for $8.99 each.&quot;They're real well received,&quot; says Dale Vanderplow.                                                                                                          SEARCH THE JUDGE: Mead General's on-line databaseLexis/Nexis starts a service about Supreme Court nomineeClarence Thomas, its second &quot;news event file&quot; (the Gulf Warwas first). &quot;It's no longer enough to have the data,&quot; says aspokesman. &quot;You have to slice it and dice it.&quot;                                                                                                          PREP WORK: Tenneco helps inner-city students get ready forcollege with a summer program at the University of Houstonthat includes a $150 stipend, a $450 job if needed, andcourse work. Students who stick two summers get a $1,000renewable college scholarship. This summer, 305 studentsfinished the four-week program.                                                                                                          ROCKY MOUNTAIN TRY: The Colorado Society of CPAs, thestate bar association and assorted businesses support the&quot;Colorado Pledge.&quot; It says disagreeing parties will try tonegotiate rather than litigate.                                                                                                          AT-RISK PREGNANCY monitoring at home draws morehealth-care firms.   Tokos Medical, Santa Ana, Calif., led the way in 1985 withprenatal monitoring to help delay premature birth. Now,Healthdyne offers a service and Baxter International'sCaremark unit gets its foot in the door by buying uterinemonitor firm Orion Medical. Healthdyne's division crossedinto the black in January, says finance chief Donald Millard.Tokos chairman Bob Byrnes says its revenue may rise 40% thisyear, as close to 20,000 receive the service.   Most monitoring now is prescribed for high-riskpregnancies. Mothers wear belt sensors that daily gather datafor phone transmission to doctors. While there's a &quot;genuineneed&quot; for the data, there is also &quot;a great opportunity foroveruse,&quot; cautions Ken Abramowitz, a health-care analyst atSanford C. Bernstein. Studies show monitoring helps curb thedanger and the cost of early birth, which helped easeinsurance coverage. Monitoring for other maladies, includingsleep disorders, are eyed.   Tokos says its prenatal monitoring costs about $100 a dayand some 90% of its users are privately insured.
