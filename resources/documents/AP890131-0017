A patriot,seven rows of ribbons on his uniform, charged with crimes againstthe United States.   Barring new delay, Oliver Laurence North, 45, goes on trialTuesday, facing a dozen cover-up and tax counts stemming from hisrole in the secret sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of some ofthat money to the Nicaraguan rebels.   The jury will decide, in the end, whether this former lieutenantcolonel and junior staff member of the National Security Council wastrue to his government and his mission, or whether his deceits,principally to Congress, were the designs of a rogue operatingoutside of law and White House order.   Along the way, the nation may learn more about the worst foreignpolicy debacle of Ronald Reagan's presidency. And about how Northcame to run some of the administration's riskiest ventures from acluttered room, No. 392, in the Old Executive Office Building nextdoor to the White House.   Congress tried for months to unravel those mysteries. But, likethe 1987 commission headed by incoming Defense Secretary John Tower,congressional panels left many questions unanswered. Meanwhile, innationally televised hearings, a defiant Oliver North emerged fromhis shadowy world, one of pseudonyms and codes and furtive bordercrossings, to confront his legislative tormentors.   ``Ollie stood up there, took the heat, and the American people inevery bar in Chicago and every bowling alley in Texas and everylittle home said, `Hey, this guy believes in something, and I canidentify with it,''' said George Bush last December.   North's bravura performance, and his subsequent whirlwind of$25,000 speeches to cheering conservative groups around the country,revealed just one of his many sides.   He has always been ``Ollie'' to his White House co-workers andthe American right. But to his brothers and sisters, his high-schoolchums back in his hometown of Philmont, N.Y., he remains LarryNorth. To surviving members of his combat platoon in Vietnam, he is``Blue,'' leader of ``Blue's Bastards.'' In other travels, he hasbeen ``Paul,'' or ``Mr. Goode,'' or ``Mr. Johns,'' or``Steelhammer.''   Another code name may be most telling: ``Blank Check.'' That wasthe term assigned to the private, inter-office computercommunications network between North and his superior, formerNational Security Adviser John M. Poindexter. The Tower commissionfound that the creation of ``Blank Check'' coincided with theinitial shipment of anti-tank missiles to Iran, 14 months before thescheme blew up in the administration's face in late 1986.   According to Richard Allen, Reagan's first national securityadviser, North was brought to the NSC in 1981 ``to handle easels andcarry the charts.'' Yet he became, in a matter of months, the NSC'schief troubleshooter, responsible for Central American and terrorismissues, and played a vital role in some of the administration's mostdaring foreign exploits.   They included the invasion of Grenada in 1983; initial armsshipments by the CIA to the Nicaraguan rebels, also in 1983; themining of three harbors in Nicaragua in early 1984; a crackdown onthe death squads in El Salvador and the organization of freeelections there; the interception of an Egyptian airliner carryingthe hijackers of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro, and thebombing raid upon Libya in 1986.   Part of North's ascendancy, no doubt, can be attributed to hisown drive and fervor. ``If there was a loose ball,'' said retiredMaj. Gen. John Singlaub, a key player in North's efforts to aid theContras, ``Oliver North would grab it and run with it.''   As a youth, he was kept on a tight leash. His father, Oliver ClayNorth, an Army colonel who won a Silver Star in World War II, workedlong hours at a family wool mill before it fell victim to polyesterand he switched to teaching history.   His mother, Ann, would whistle for the kids to come in everyevening at 5 p.m. for dinner. Family ritual included a discussion ofworld events before the table was cleared. In school, he ran trackand was in the chorus, chess, drama and science clubs as well as thestudent council. The girls voted him best-looking.   North intended to follow his father, who died three years ago,into teaching, and enrolled at the state college at Brockport as anEnglish major _ not pre-med at Rochester as he later claimed _ andjoined the Marine Reserves as an officer trainee. After spending thesummer at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina he was a convert to theCorps.   His appointment to the Naval Academy came after his sophomoreyear at Brockport, and North had to start over as a plebe. Then,before he'd really settled in, he was in a car wreck, sufferingsevere knee and back injuries.   He boxed as a southpaw, and in the intramural ranks he made itinto the finals against a highly favored James Webb, later to becomea decorated combat veteran and a best-selling novelist. North wonagain, on points.   After his graduation, a review board threatened to dismiss himbecause of his auto injuries. North made the board look at the filmof his fight against Webb. He got his commission.   Soon after North and Betsy Stuart were married in a formalmilitary service, he was shipped out, in December 1968, to Vietnam.   He was ``all guns, guts and glory,'' according to Randall Herrod,a fellow ex-Marine officer whom North credits with saving his lifeon the battlefield.   Once, North was knocked off a tank rocked by enemy fire, and,despite broken ribs and a punctured lung, rose up to kill the enemygunner with a grenade. That got him a Bronze Star. Other awardsfollowed.   But North, in recounting his Vietnam experiences, has sometimesseemed to exaggerate his record. He has testified that hisdecorations included ``several'' purple hearts; military recordsshow two. He headed a platoon of 40 men, but said in court that hewas a company commander ``in the Special Operations Force.'' Again,no record of it. He has said in court that he was in Vietnam from1968 through early 1970 ``and then again in 1971,'' but the corpssays it has no record of an extended first tour or second tour.   North did return to Vietnam, on his own time when word arrivedthat Herrod had been charged with war crimes in the killing of womenand children. Herrod eventually was acquitted. While the casedragged, North was going off voluntarily to fight in the bush.   After tours at Quantico, Va., and on Okinawa, he wound up with adesk at Marine Corps headquarters. He worked 18 hours a day.Meanwhile, North and wife Betsy were going about the business ofraising their four children.   Something finally snapped. North wound up in Bethesda NavalHospital for 22 days, diagnosed as suffering ``delayed battlestress.'' Once again, he overcame his medical difficulties, and wascleared for duty.</TEXT></DOC>
