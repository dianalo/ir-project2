The time is right now -- at least for Continental Illinois Corp.    The big banking concern has just launched one of the most expensive corporate-image advertising campaigns its industry has ever seen. Continental, which collapsed and was bailed out by federal banking regulators in 1984, is spending $5 million between now and the end of 1988 on a series of upbeat print ads in this and other national publications, and plans to spend that amount again for all of 1989.    Unlike a 1986 campaign that acknowledged Continental's painful problems -- &quot;We work hard. We have to&quot; -- the current campaign emphasizes Continental's efforts to reposition itself as an all-business bank. The new slogan is &quot;a new approach to business,&quot; and the ads make much out of Continental's recent exit from consumer banking and its intention to focus solely on commercial customers.    &quot;It's almost like an announcement ad for a new corporation,&quot; says Pat Fallon, chairman of Fallon, McElligott, the Minneapolis agency that developed the ads, which are more colorful than most bank ads and somewhat boastful.    Some advertising executives believe the new campaign has a good chance for success. These days, past failures needn't make one shy, says Stanley Katz of Foote Cone andamp; Belding, an ad agency. &quot;This is the age of the comeback,&quot; he says. &quot;Nixon, after all, is getting respect.&quot;    Continental hopes the ads, which are running frequently in newspapers and magazines, will help put it back on equal footing with other big banks in customers' eyes, says Edward S. Bottum, Continental's vice chairman. &quot;Simply advertising with this intensity says something: The past is behind us. We're on the go.&quot;    Does Continental believe the 400,000 corporate executives, institutional investors and other financial types it is trying to reach now see the bank's previous problems as a non-issue? &quot;It's uneven,&quot; Mr. Bottum says. &quot;With some customers, you don't even bring it up unless they do. You go right into the sell mode.&quot; With others, especially those with deposits at Continental, the bank's health is still a concern.    Nevertheless, Continental decided that it had acknowledged the problems long enough. &quot;How long do you beat that?&quot; Mr. Fallon says. &quot;At some point, it's time to move on.&quot;    Thomas C. Theobald, the former Citicorp vice chairman, was named Continental chairman and chief executive officer a little more than a year ago and promptly decided to jettison the consumer business. To Mr. Theobald, Mr. Bottum says, &quot;the past is not particularly meaningful.&quot;    Continental's all-business focus is similar to that of J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. and Bankers Trust Co., both big New York banks that focus almost solely on commercial and investment banking business with large companies.    Both Morgan and Bankers Trust use print ads regularly to reinforce that image and to stress expertise in specific services. Sexy their ads are not: &quot;Assuming risks in global trading requires more than routine assumptions,&quot; a Morgan ads warns. &quot;Today, the most hospitable financial climate may not be close to home,&quot; a Bankers Trust ad says.    Continental, meanwhile, wants to exhibit the same savvy, but its ads are feistier. They suggest that other banks -- including rival First Chicago Corp., which bought much of Continental's consumer business -- are &quot;dangerously myopic&quot; in continuing to pursue both consumer and commercial business; the ad shows a horse with a head at both ends. Another shows a many-gadgeted Swiss army knife and asks: &quot;How many things can a bank do and still do all of them well?&quot;    Of course, that's a question yet to be answered at the new Continental. The new ads boast expertise in some areas, such as trading and distribution in financial instruments, that Continental is admittedly still building up. </TEXT></DOC>
