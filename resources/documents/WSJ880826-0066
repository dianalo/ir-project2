In a Security and Exchange Commission filing, Martin L. Kozberg and Arnold S. Leonard didn't indicate exactly how many shares they sold, however the entire group's stake was reduced by 10.85%.    In their agreement, entered into on Tuesday, Messrs. Kozberg and Leonard agreed for five years not to buy any additional Norstan shares or make any sort of acquisition proposal.    Norstan, a Minneapolis telecommunications concern, couldn't be reached for comment.    The group's two other members, Marc H. Kozberg and Michael D. Leonard, hold a remaining 41,000 shares, or a 1.05% stake, according to the filing.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Norstan was unchanged at $7.625 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
