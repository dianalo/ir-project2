Clark, a lawyer involved in the insider-trading scheme using Wall Street Journal stories in 1983 and 1984, was convicted of fraud, tax evasion and lying to regulators about the conspiracy.    A former partner in the New York law firm of Appleton, Rice andamp; Perrin, Mr. Clark was found guilty Friday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York of embezzling about $3.7 million from clients to invest in stocks. The bulk of the money belonged to Roger W. Wilson Jr., an actor.    Mr. Clark allegedly shared in profits from stock trades made through Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. accounts, where he was a longtime client of former Kidder broker Peter Brant. Mr. Brant got advance information about the timing and contents of Heard on the Street columns from a former Journal reporter, R. Foster Winans, whose insider-trading conviction was recently upheld by the Supreme Court. Money embezzled by Mr. Clark was used to trade in stocks mentioned in the columns.    Mr. Brant earlier pleaded guilty to two counts of securities fraud and was the government's star witness against Mr. Winans, who was convicted of mail, wire and securities fraud in the scheme.    &quot;I'm delighted (with the verdict). Justice was definitely done,&quot; said Carl H. Loewenson Jr., an assistant U.S. attorney and lead prosecutor in the case.    Although prosecutors dropped 38 insider-trading counts against Mr. Clark in September to expedite a trial on the other charges, they noted a clear connection to insider trading in Friday's conviction.    By proving that Mr. Clark made false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission, prosecutors said, they showed he participated in the scheme. Evidence showed that participants in the conspiracy traded in stocks on the basis of information leaked by Mr. Winans to Mr. Brant and that Mr. Clark made a profit of $473,000 on such trades.    Mr. Clark's attorney, the noted criminal defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey, said he would appeal the conviction.    Mr. Clark, 38 years old, a large, ruddy man, sat still with his hands folded on the table as the jury's verdict was read. He faces a maximum sentence of 75 years in prison and loss of his license to practice law.    Mr. Clark, who is currently living with his mother in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., declined to comment on the verdict.    It was the first jury trial for any participant in the scheme, which began unraveling in 1984.    The jury found Mr. Clark guilty of all but one of 17 counts of mail and wire fraud, lying to obtain a bank loan, federal income tax evasion and signing a false tax return as well as perjuring himself before the SEC. He was acquitted of one of nine mail-fraud charges. The one acquittal was related to another victim, Francesco Zangrilli.    Federal Judge John F. Keenan praised the jury's diligence, saying, &quot;Quite obviously, you gave the case careful thought.&quot;    Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Gage, one of the prosecutors, said, &quot;The real message of the case is that complex financial cases can be presented to a jury.&quot;    Prosecutors asked Judge Keenan to increase Mr. Clark's bail to $1 million, noting he was thought to have substantial assets and had at one time talked about leaving the country when his dealings were going sour. But Mr. Bailey said Mr. Clark effectively &quot;has no assets,&quot; as they are either locked up by the Internal Revenue Service or entangled in proceedings related to Mr. Clark's recent separation from his wife.    Mr. Bailey said, &quot;Mr. Clark couldn't afford to pay his defense fee. His mother paid it.&quot;    Judge Keenan increased bail to a $500,000 personal-recognizance bond, with $50,000 to be posted as security. It is expected that his mother will provide the cash. Mr. Clark's previous bail was $250,000.    Sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 7, 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
