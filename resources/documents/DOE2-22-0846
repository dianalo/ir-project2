The Thermal Systems AnalysisCode (TSAP) calculated the temperatures within the fuel assemblies asa result of the fuel decay heat. TSAP is a lumped-parameter network analysiscode capable of performing radiative and conductive heat transfer analysis.The reactor core was assumed to be devoid of coolant instantaneouslyfollowing a LOCA. The reactor core model consisted of individual fuel-pinassemblies containing 36 fuel pins surrounding a central cooling channel.This central cooling channel, or bayonet, is a secondary cooling loopwithin the reactor core. The bayonet cooling is a safety feature designedto keep the core from reaching temperatures at which the uranium dissociatesfrom the uranium-nitride fuel. TSAP calculated the fuel-pin temperaturesdue to decay heat transient. The performance of the bayonets within ageneric reactor core was compared to an actual design. Design guidancewas established based on the performance of the bayonets in the genericcore.</TEXT></DOC>
