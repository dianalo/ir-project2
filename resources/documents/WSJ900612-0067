The computer giant has racked up five years of lacklusterresults as competition has slashed profit margins on computerhardware. Growth in software revenue, once hailed as IBM'slikely savior, has slowed too. So IBM is increasingly turningto services -- both to generate fees and to increase demandfor its hardware and software.</LP><TEXT>   The new program won't be a quick fix. Most other companiesin the industry have the same idea, and IBM's credentials inso-called professional services are a mixed bag.   Still, customers, consultants and even some competitorssay the new IBM program, called Enterprise Alliance, willhelp IBM on its way. And IBM executives say they will be ableto use some of the ideas behind Enterprise Allianceprofitably in other areas.   &quot;It's a very smart approach,&quot; says Mel Bergstein, a seniorvice president in the consulting arm of Computer SciencesCorp., which offers systems integration and professionalservices.   Enterprise Alliance is simple in concept. IBM sends in asmall team to talk about a specific problem -- the difficultythat companies have in pulling together data stored indifferent types of databases on hardware from numerouscompanies.   Once the customer picks an instance of that problem thatit wants solved, a handful of IBM programmers produce aprototype of a piece of software -- usually in about a month.The people who run the part of the business that will use thesoftware then suggest changes, and IBM's programmers producea finished piece of software. The whole process takes aboutthree months. For its troubles, IBM collects a fee of$75,000.   But that's just the beginning. The customer could then askIBM to solve that sort of problem in other areas. Because theinability to pull together data from different sources is oneof the biggest problems in corporate computer operations, theprojects could be enormous. Even proceeding on their own,many customers, having been shown the way, will tackle theproblem more quickly than they would have otherwise. That, ofcourse, means buying more hardware and software -- and muchof the equipment will have those big blue IBM logos on it.   &quot;We're not doing this to get $75,000. We're doing this toget that relationship,&quot; says Bob Berland, an IBM vicepresident involved with Enterprise Alliance.   Marshall Balter, director of the program at IBM, saysseveral hundred people are already involved in the projectand the number will grow rapidly. IBM has completed only afew pilot projects under Enterprise Alliance, but Mr. Baltersays that number should hit 40 or 50 this summer. And, whileit's still too early to forecast precisely the program'simpact, initial reports are favorable.   &quot;I'm such a cynic when it comes to computer systems,&quot; saysJohn Gunn, executive vice president at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center, New York, site of one pilot project.&quot;It always takes five times as long to write as anybodybudgeted and costs 10 times as much as anybody hoped.&quot; But hesays that IBM finished on time and that the $75,000 fee wasone-half to one-third as much as it would have cost him towrite the software himself. &quot;Quite frankly, IBM surprised thehell out of me,&quot; he says.   Mr. Gunn says the software IBM wrote lets physicians atone site easily get all sorts of information -- lab reports,billing information, some medical records, pharmacy recordsand so forth -- even though that had proved difficult in thepast and even though not all the information is stored in IBMcomputers.   David Roberts, senior vice president of corporateinformation services at the Federal National MortgageAssociation, another pilot site, says, &quot;We've found theprogram to be very productive.&quot; He's cautious, saying that hedoesn't expect the association -- a reseller of mortgagesthat is commonly known as Fannie Mae -- to buy any morehardware or software because of the project. Still, he saysthat he may make the purchases more quickly than he wouldhave otherwise and that he's more likely to buy from IBM.   As IBM prospects for more business, potential corporatecustomers and some competitors say it will face significanthurdles. For one thing, while corporate customers areincreasingly trying to turn over their headaches toconsultants and systems integrators, many are leery ofdealing with a company that also makes hardware or software.They fear they could wind up buying a piece of IBM equipmenteven if it isn't the best available for the job.   &quot;That is a significant disadvantage for IBM,&quot; says JimFischer, managing partner of technology services at AndersenConsulting, one of IBM's biggest competitors.   In addition, companies that do systems integration workneed to really understand the problems at, say, the bank ormanufacturer that is doing the buying, and IBM is newer atthat game than some of its competitors.   &quot;This all boils down to how good the people are, and IBMhasn't yet developed the skills that they need,&quot; says JamesSutter, vice president of information systems at RockwellInternational Corp.   But at the same time, IBM has plenty of closerelationships with customers that it can use to build thebusiness. Mr. Sutter, for instance, says IBM &quot;certainly hasthe staying power and the presence&quot; to be a force in systemsintegration. In addition, access to capital is becomingincreasingly important for companies in this field as theprojects they undertake become larger, and IBM can beat justabout anybody at that game.   IBM also has plenty of experience with the technology.   IBM's computer guys &quot;are actually using a lot of theirsystems within their own manufacturing operations,&quot; says AceHall, general manager of General Dynamics Corp.'s datasystems division. &quot;They have real-life experience, whereasthe consulting people (at many other firms) don't have thatkind of thing.&quot;   Some corporate customers even like dealing with a hardwarecompany on systems integration. They say they think it givesthem additional say on future products.   &quot;I want to influence the products and services that IBMprovides as they go down the road rather than sitting backand hoping they provide what I want,&quot; says Mr. Roberts ofFannie Mae.   Somehow or other, IBM needs to become a bigger factor insystems integration and other service arenas. Market-researchfirms say systems integration is a $20 billion-a-year marketthat is growing some 20% annually. Yet the computer industryas a whole is growing less than half that fast, and IBM isfeeling pressure on all fronts.   IBM said in the late '80s that it wanted more than halfits revenue to come from software and services by the early'90s, but progress has been slow. IBM's revenue fromsoftware, maintenance services and its systems integrationbusiness with the federal government totaled $17.5 billionlast year, or less than 30% of its total revenue of $62.7billion. And that $17.5 billion wasn't much higher than the1988 figure.   Whatever happens, Mr. Berland of IBM says he hopesEnterprise Alliance will be &quot;a paradigm for the '90s.&quot; Mr.Balter says that, for one thing, IBM thinks the production ofsoftware ought to be faster, with ultimate users getting achance to see an early prototype and adapt it to their needs.The huge backlog of requests for software at corporations iswidely considered to be one of the biggest impediments to thegrowth of the computer industry. In addition, much of thesoftware misses the mark because there is often littlecommunication between the people writing it and those whowill use it.   Mr. Berland says he hopes Enterprise Alliance will also bean example of how IBM should approach its customers:Traditionally, IBM has dealt with data-processingdepartments, but under the new program, it is trying to dealmore with the people who actually run the corporatecustomer's business.   &quot;Many companies are talking about closer partnerships withcustomers,&quot; says Sam Albert, a consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y.,&quot;but this is a real demonstration of that. This couldpotentially mean a great deal of revenue.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
