The issue of third-country support for the Contras surfaced thisweek at the trial of Oliver L. North, the former National SecurityCouncil aide and chief architect of the Iran-Contra plan.   North's attorneys claim that a plan to protect state secretsduring the trial will prevent them from showing that formerPresident Reagan and other top administration officials offeredinducements to foreign governments in soliciting military aid to theNicaraguan rebels.   The congressional report said Saudi Arabia gave the lion's shareof the money _ $32 million _ to the Contras after Congress balked atappropriating military aid to the rebels in late 1984. Taiwan gave$2 million in that period.   The report detailed how U.S. officials from the NSC, the CIA and,eventually, the State Department sought financial assistance to keepalive the Contras' war against Nicaragua's Marxist regime. Somesolicitations to third countries were unsuccessful.   The Saudis were the first to contribute to the Contras in June1984 after the rebels had exhausted the last portion of U.S.assistance.   Before that, U.S. officials had been rebuffed in an approach toIsrael, and declined an offer by South Africa to donate money, saidthe report, which does not identify the countries by name. Officialslater confirmed the names.   Robert McFarlane, the former national security adviser, testifiedthat the Saudi ambassador agreed initially to contribute $1 milliona month through the end of the year.   In February 1985, the Saudis pledged another $24 million, meaningthe oil-rich kingdom handed over a total of $32 million to theContras between June 1984 and March 1985.   After the Saudis' first offer, McFarlane said he told Reagan andthen-Vice President Bush about contribution, and was informed ofReagan's ``satisfaction and pleasure that this had occurred.''   But other top White House officials had second thoughts aboutaccepting contributions for the Contras, the report said.   Secretary of State James Baker III, then the White House chief ofstaff, reportedly said it would be an ``impeachable offense'' forthe United States to act as a conduit for third-country funding forthe Contras, according to the testimony of Baker's predecessor,George Shultz. Baker later said he did not recall using thatlanguage, but was concerned about legalities.   Because of his objections to third country solicitations, Shultzwas not told of the contributions from Saudi Arabia, the report said.   But North arranged for the transfer of money to Contra leaderAdolfo Calero on June 25, 1984, the report said.   Later officials at the CIA and the Justice Department agreedthere would be no legal problem with third countries giving money tothe Contras so long as the United States did not appropriate themoney.   Former Attorney General William French Smith also said the donorscould not expect Washington ``to repay that commitment in thefuture,'' Stanley Sporkin, a former CIA general counsel, said.</TEXT></DOC>
