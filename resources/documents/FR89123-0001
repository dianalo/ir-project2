We received commentsfrom one Federal agency and one Federal employees' union. Key aspects ofthe proposal are summarized below along with a discussion of the recommendationsand OPM's decision.<ITAG tagnum="84">Key Provision</ITAG>_Amends 5 CFR 213.3102(t) to delete the requirement for a written agreementbetween the Office of Personnel Management and a Federal agency prior tousing this authority.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments Received</ITAG>_One Federal agency approved the proposed amendment as published._A Federal employees' union recommended that the words ``may qualify''be changed to read ``shall qualify'' in the sentence ``Upon completionof 2 years of satisfactory service under this authority, the employee mayqualify for conversion to competitive status under the provisions of ExecutiveOrder 12125 and implementing regulations issued by the Office.'' The unionfeels that, without this change, otherwise qualified employees who haveserved satisfactorily for two years and deserve to be converted by theagency may not be. OPM does not concur with this recommendation for thefollowing reasons: (1) This would not be in accordance with its policyof providing agencies with maximum flexibility in using this appointingauthority, (2) Executive Order 12125 specifically states ``may be converted''instead of ``shall be converted,'' and (3) FPM guidance provides protectionfor the employee by specifying that there should be substantial justificationfor not recommending conversion of an employee who meets the minimum servicerequirement and who has demonstrated successful job performance.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined by section 1(b)of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that these regulations will not have a significant impact ona substantial number of small entities because they affect only Federalagencies and employees.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 213</ITAG>Government agencies, Employees.<ITAG tagnum="21">U.S. Office of Personnel Management,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM amends Part 213 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations,as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 213_EXCEPTED SERVICE</ITAG>1.
