(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Navy learned a lesson whenGreenpeace anti-nuclear protesters halted the submarine launch of aTrident 2 missile in July, and it was ready for them this time.   In a high seas drama 50 miles off the Florida coast on Monday,Navy ships rammed and fire-hosed the 190-foot MV Greenpeace vesselwhile helicopters buzzed two small high-speed rafts. Sailors inmotorized rafts cut the fuel lines of one Greenpeace raft beforetowing both out of the launch safety zone.   With their vessels helpless, about 25 Greenpeace activists couldonly watch as the nuclear submarine Tennessee unleashed the Trident2, the Navy's newest, most powerful weapon, on a successful testlaunch.   The 44-foot missile shot out of a tube in the sub's deck, brokethe sea's surface, ignited and hurled a dummy warhead package to anocean target several thousand miles away.   ``We did a perfect launch, just beautiful,'' Vice Adm. RogerBacon, commander of the Atlantic Submarines Fleet, told reporters.   The success of the fourth Trident 2 test flight put the programback on track toward becoming operational next spring after twoexplosive failures in the first three tests.   Greenpeace spokesman Steven Shallhorn said today on ABC's ``GoodMorning America'' that the group believes the Navy acted in panic.   ``They are very, very desperate to save their Trident 2 missileprogram,'' he said. ``Because of the technical failures that theyhave it's a prime candidate to be cut when defense spending startsto be cut next year.''   Bacon also appeared on the ABC program and said he was concernedabout safety.   ``I warned that vessel over 50 times, most of the timespersonally, to remain outside of 5,000 yards from the submarine,''he said. ``They did everything just not safe, and I want theseoperations to be safe.''   Greenpeace, which said it was considering suing the Navy forMonday's action, had successfully used the MV Greenpeace and thetwo motorized rafts, called Zodiacs, to halt a launch from theTennessee in July.   ``We were more prepared today because we looked at what theytried to do on July 28, and we used the minimum force necessarytoday to clear the area,'' Bacon said.   The ``minimum force'' included three large ships, threehelicopters and eight motorized rafts. More than 900 sailors wereassigned to the task force that kept the launch area clear.   ``This is a terrible outrage,'' said Peter Bahouth, executivedirector of Greenpeace USA, in a statement. ``This is an unbridledact of aggression against a peaceful protest in internationalwaters.''   For many years, Greenpeace has attempted to stop nuclear testingat sea. In July 1985, this tactic of direct intervention turnedtragic when French secret agents sunk the Rainbow Warrior, aGreenpeace ship, off Auckland, New Zealand.   The ship was sent to protest French nuclear testing in the SouthPacific. Explosives were attached to the ship's hull. One crewmember was killed.   Greenpeace's protest Monday was over the United States' refusalto negotiate with the Soviet Union on a reduction of sea-basednuclear missiles.   The incident began at dawn as the Tennessee submerged for theTrident 2 countdown, and the MV Greenpeace moved inside the5,000-yard diameter safety circle around the sub.   Burnette said the Navy repeated warnings: If the protestersdidn't clear the area, the Navy would ``exercise its rights underinternational law and will forcibly remove you.''   The MV Greenpeace radioed back, ``You are doing your best butyou haven't sunk us yet; we are staying.''   Two submarine support ships, the Grasp and the Kittiwake, tookup positions on either side of the Greenpeace, shot water from firehoses into the smoke stacks to stop the engines and then bumped thevessel out of the safety area.   Greenpeace spokeswoman Shannon Fagan reported two holes, one athree-foot gash, were punched in the Greenpeace hull. The Navy saidit counted only one hole, about one foot in diameter.   Fagan said the Greenpeace was ```dead in the water'' for aboutan hour until the crew got one of the engines restarted. The shipthen limped toward port in Jacksonville, Fla.   The Navy plans five more submarine launches of the Trident 2. Ifall goes well, the Tennessee is scheduled to go on operationalpatrol next spring with 24 of the deadly missiles. Each is capableof propelling as many as 12 warheads to different targets more than4,600 miles away.</TEXT></DOC>
