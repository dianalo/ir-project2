The disclosure, in documents that United's parent, UALCorp. of Chicago, provided to securities analysts, appearedto chill somewhat the normally warm relationship Boeing haswith its largest domestic aircraft customer. United was alsothe first airline to order the 777 in October 1990, whenBoeing formally &quot;launched&quot; the program to build its firstall-new airliner in 11 years.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We've had no discussions with United regarding widebodyairplanes, so we don't know what they're planning,&quot; aspokesman for the Seattle airliner maker said.   Boeing had been prepared this week when United announced a$3.6 billion cut in its spending for new aircraft over thenext three years, reflecting an austerity brought on by arecord fourth-quarter loss. At the time, the airlinementioned only smaller Boeing 737 and 757 planes that itplans to delay taking, and noted that the focus of itsdeferrals was those models designed to serve shorter-haulmarkets. It didn't give any details about changes in ordersfor the widebody 747s, 767s and 777s made by Boeing, United'ssole supplier of new aircraft.   Yesterday, however, United said that its plans for 1995now call for keeping one of its aging, three-engine McDonnellDouglas Corp. DC-10 aircraft in operation for each of the777s being delayed. It didn't indicate when the rest of the34 new Boeing 777s in its original order would be received,or what plans it had for options on other 777s. It reiteratedthat none of the changes in its fleet plans representedcancellations of orders.   The Boeing spokesman said he didn't anticipate any changein plans to begin delivering the 275-passenger 777 in May1995. United, the only U.S. customer so far, is to receivethe first plane off the line in Everett, Wash. Of the sevencustomers who have ordered the plane, the largest are BritishAirways and All Nippon Airways with 15, and Japan Airlineswith 10.   The planes sell for between $104 million and $129 million,and Boeing's 89 firm orders for them account for more than10% of its $92 billion backlog of orders.   Some securities analysts who follow aircraft manufacturerssaid United's deferral of 777 deliveries wasn't a majorsetback for Boeing. &quot;Just taking the order of magnitude, withBoeing spending $1.5 billion a year to develop this airplane,any change {in deliveries} is of importance,&quot; said JackModzelewski of PaineWebber Inc. &quot;But I think the 777 is goingto be a successful program.&quot; He added that United's problemswith it probably represent &quot;a timing issue that's no bigdeal.&quot;   Paul Nisbet of Prudential Securities Inc. suggested thatUnited's delay in aircraft purchases, and an earlier deferralby American Airline's AMR Corp. parent, may have reflectedconcerns that corporate debt ratings could be hurt if theloss-ridden carriers didn't show some financial restraint infleet planning. &quot;I think maybe what they were doing was totake a preemptive stand,&quot; he said. He added that a delay inorders, primarily from McDonnell Douglas, may also be in theworks at Delta Air Lines, which alone among the top threeU.S. carriers hasn't slowed down deliveries.   Mr. Nisbet said he doubted that United's delays would leadto changes in 777 production, which Mr. Nisbet expects to be20 planes from May until the end of 1995, rising to around 50the next year. In fact, he said, the initial plan to deliver11 aircraft to United the first year &quot;made it hard to giveplanes to someone else who orders later.&quot; The analyst said heexpects more orders to come in for the big, longer-rangeplanes of Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Europe's AirbusIndustrie consortium, once McDonnell Douglas makes itsdecision this year whether to proceed with its latestproposed entry in the field, the MD-12.   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Boeing shares closedat $46.625, off 37.5 cents. UAL closed at $145.875, up 87.5cents.</TEXT></DOC>
