Over the weekend, the Tri-State Pontiac dealers launchedan aggressive advertising campaign that focuses on Japanesecriticism of the U.S. In particular, the radio and televisioncommercials cite in sneering tones remarks by Japaneselegislative leader Yoshio Sakurauchi that American workersare &quot;too lazy&quot; to compete with Japan.</LP><TEXT>   The campaign by the 100 New York, New Jersey andConnecticut Pontiac dealers is one of the most directattempts yet to fan heated words in the U.S.-Japan tradedebate into consumer reaction.   &quot;We're trying to throw cold water in peoples' faces,&quot; saysDonny Deutsch, executive vice president and creative directorof Deutsch Advertising, the New York agency that developedthe campaign. &quot;With all of the false and racist statementscoming out of Japan, it's time for people to wake up and seethat America builds quality products.&quot;   The commercial, which was cleared by General MotorsCorp.'s Pontiac division, states: &quot;A leading Japanesepolitician described American workers as follows: `A workforce too lazy to compete with Japan . . . America isbecoming Japan's subcontractor and has no one to blame butthemselves . . . the source of the problem is the inferiorquality of U.S. labor . . . 30% can't even read.'&quot;   As might be expected, the ads don't mention that about 40%of the Japanese cars sold in the U.S. come from U.S.factories. Instead, the spots conclude by saying: &quot;Wellexcuse us, but the new Pontiac Grand Am has better fuelefficiency, a larger engine and costs thousands less thaneither Honda Accord or Toyota Camry. . . . Maybe they {theJapanese} need some reading lessons.&quot;   Slamming Japan in a controversial manner is nothing newfor the dealers or for Deutsch Advertising. Pontiac dealerads created by the agency in 1989 railed about Japaneseinvestors buying America shortly after Mitsubishi Estate Co.bought a controlling stake in New York's Rockefeller Center.   Dealer ads are mostly independent from those that the automakers themselves run. A Pontiac spokesman said the onlycontrol the company has over dealer ads is to make sure theydon't make false claims about the cars.   Detroit's Big Three have typically shied away fromincendiary ads about their competitors. But a General Motorscommercial aired during Sunday's Super Bowl indirectlyreferred to Japanese remarks disparaging American workers.And Pontiac, seeking to tap the surge in &quot;buy American&quot;sentiment in a more traditional manner, will soon launchadvertising that compares Pontiac models with Japanese cars.   The message of Pontiac's ads: Buyers who want antilockbrakes will pay less on a Grand Am than on a Honda Accord ora Toyota Camry.   Mr. Deutsch insists that Americans need strong messages totake heed. &quot;I think that when you're in the position ofseeing market share slipping away, you have to do someaggressive things,&quot; he says. &quot;If you just tell Americans thatAmerican cars are better, they emotionally won't buy into it.You need to do something that will jolt their feelings.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
