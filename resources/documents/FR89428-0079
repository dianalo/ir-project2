Box 1270, Elkhorn City, Kentucky 41522has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1710 (cabsand canopies) to its No. D-1 Mine (I.D. No. 15-16288) located in Pike County,Kentucky. The petition is filed under section 101(c) of the Federal MineSafety and Health Act of 1977.A summary of the petitioner's statements follows:1. The petition concerns the requirement that cabs or canopies be installedon the mine's electric face equipment.2. Due to an uneven roof and a very soft bottom, the use of cabs or canopieswould result in a diminution of safety. The cabs or canopies would:(a) Strike and dislodge roof support;(b) Severely limit the equipment operator's visibility;(c) Strike or dislodge electrical cables creating an electrical fire hazard;and(d) Limit the equipment operator's seating position causing fatigue, therebycreating potential for an accident.3. For these reasons, petitioner requests a modification of the standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>Persons interested in this petition may furnish written comments.
