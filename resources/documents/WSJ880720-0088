But he plans to work hard to put him in the White House anyway.    &quot;This is the year to simply go for broke,&quot; says the 62-year-old delegate to the Democratic National Convention here.    Paul Korman, an officer of the United Auto Workers Union in Illinois, is much closer to the liberal stances of Jesse Jackson on tax and trade issues. But he, too, intends to go all out for Mr. Dukakis after Atlanta.    &quot;We make a mistake if we take any single issue, even labor, and blow it out of proportion,&quot; the 53-year-old delegate says. &quot;Compromise is going to be key to victory in November for the Democrats.&quot;    &quot;Harmony&quot; isn't a term normally associated with Democratic conventions. But when delegates depart on Friday, it probably will be the watchword of the Democratic campaign. The delegates assembled in Atlanta can smell success -- and want it so much that they are willing to overlook a great deal in order to win this fall.    Thus, they talk unity despite obvious ideological differences. Even though surveys show the delegates to be much more liberal than the general population, they don't appear intent on pressing their views on the campaign. They aren't necessarily excited by the Massachusetts governor; indeed many delegates hardly know him. But they are eager to give him the benefit of the doubt, so hungry are they to beat the Republicans. They act as if Mr. Dukakis were a blank canvas on which they could paint what they want to see. And what they want to see is victory.    To explore their sentiments, reporters for The Wall Street Journal spent several days with each of two widely disparate delegations, North Carolina and Illinois. In addition, the Journal asked Democratic pollster Peter Hart to convene a focus group of 11 delegates from the two states to further explore their views.    Neither state is a natural Dukakis stronghold: Mr. Dukakis finished third in each one's primary, trailing Sen. Paul Simon and Mr. Jackson in Illinois, and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and Mr. Jackson in North Carolina. Moreover, Illinois has voted Republican in the last five presidential elections, while North Carolina went Democratic only once, for son-of-the-South Jimmy Carter in 1976.    Yet members of both delegations are optimistic about the ticket's prospects. In Illinois, Democrats say, Mr. Dukakis is slightly ahead of Vice President George Bush. In North Carolina, Mr. Dukakis and his running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, face an uphill climb, but Democrats believe they will nonetheless fare far better than other recent tickets.    Such optimism is new for the Democrats. In 1984, many left San Francisco downcast, realizing that the chances of unseating President Reagan with former Vice President Walter Mondale were almost nil. But now, everything has changed.    &quot;This is different than San Francisco because we were under the impression we were going to lose,&quot; says Illinois Democratic Party chairman Vincent Demuzio. This time, adds Rep. Richard Durbin of Illinois, &quot;We're going home calculating victory.&quot;    A strong desire to put aside differences to achieve victory continually surfaced at the hour-and-a-half focus group. Among the widely diverse group were Mr. Daniels, the conservative banker; Mr. Korman, the UAW official; Harvey Gantt, the black former mayor of Charlotte, N.C., and Thomas Lyons, a longtime white ward committeeman from Chicago. The group included two House members from two dissimilar districts: Rep. Durbin, from rural, downstate Illinois, and Rep. David Price, from a fastgrowing high-tech area in central North Carolina.    Delegates who are pledged to vote for Mr. Dukakis in tonight's balloting are far from the only ones sounding the unity theme. Most of those pledged to Mr. Jackson are right in tune. &quot;I think there's going to be unity,&quot; says Carol Mosely Braun, an Illinois state legislator and a Jackson delegate. &quot;There's powerful common interest in defeating the {Republican} opposition.&quot;    Adds Mr. Gantt, another Jackson supporter: &quot;The bottom line that you hear everybody say is that we're going to win this damn thing.&quot;    The new understanding between Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Jackson hasn't automatically erased all tensions, of course. Just yesterday, the Illinois delegation voted to name Mr. Jackson an honorary favorite son -- a title without substance but with enough symbolism to anger some of the delegates. &quot;I don't like it,&quot; says William Edley, a Simon delegate now pledged to Mr. Dukakis. &quot;He doesn't qualify for favorite-son status.&quot;    But most of the delegates both in the focus group and in individual interviews say they intend to play down their disagreements in the interest of triumph over Vice President George Bush, no matter what place they hold in the political spectrum.    &quot;Everybody is on the same wavelength this time. All of a sudden it's like this,&quot; says Illinois's Mr. Demuzio, clasping his hands together. &quot;Everybody's just waiting to come together to win.&quot;    Last evening, both the Illinois and North Carolina delegations helped vote down one Jackson-backed platform plank that would have increased taxes on individuals and corporations and another that would have barred the U.S. from being the first to use nuclear weapons. These planks generally gained support in the two delegations from Jackson delegates. But even this disagreement was notable for its lack of rancor as the Democrats looked ahead to the end of the convention and the fall campaign.    Even many Illinois and North Carolina delegates who will vote for Mr. Dukakis tonight admit that the Massachusetts governor is still something of a cipher to them. &quot;I feel more like an NEA delegate than a Dukakis delegate,&quot; says Karen Garr, a Raleigh, N.C., schoolteacher who is president of the state's National Education Association affiliate. &quot;But they are committed to him, so I am committed to him. I still don't feel I know enough about him.&quot;    &quot;Nobody knows too much about them,&quot; says Chicago Alderman Edward Burke, referring to Messrs. Bentsen and Dukakis. About Mr. Dukakis, he adds: &quot;All I see is somebody who was able to raise enough money to buy enough TV time to get himself the nomination.&quot;    Some find virtue in the lack of familiarity. Voters knew 1984 loser Mr. Mondale all too well, says Illinois investment banker Judith Calder, a suburban liberal. &quot;Mondale gave the store away,&quot; she says. &quot;He was everybody's baby. You can't do that, you can't be everybody's pal.&quot;    By contrast, these delegates say, the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket will sell far easier to the diverse voters of their states. They say the ticket runs less risk of getting tarred with the deadly &quot;special-interest&quot; label.    The way delegates from these states see it, Mr. Dukakis's Greek heritage may help in some of Chicago's ethnic wards, while Sen. Bentsen's Texas conservatism may help among rural white voters in North Carolina. Having Mr. Bentsen on the ticket &quot;will really be a plus&quot; in his region, says Mr. Daniels, the North Carolina banker. &quot;We can sell this.&quot; Many delegates also claim an asset on the Republican ticket. Says Ms. Garr: &quot;The biggest advantage Dukakis has over Bush is Bush.&quot;    But some delegates warn that Mr. Dukakis still has his work cut out for him. While his &quot;cool, calculating and sharp style&quot; may reassure Middle America, Mr. Gantt wonders if he will be able to mobilize the swing vote. &quot;The question is, does he have just enough passion to motivate somebody who might otherwise decide just to stay home?&quot; the former Charlotte mayor says.    &quot;The Dukakis dilemma,&quot; Rep. Durbin says, &quot;is, how do you put passion in a campaign without scaring away that segment of the electorate we need to win?&quot;    One way is by showing that Democrats are able to submerge their differences enough so that they are still capable of governing the country. To that end, several delegates express a willingness to put their ideals on hold for a while, if not entirely relinquish them, to help the cause.    Thus, Mr. Korman, the Illinois union man, isn't insisting that Mr. Dukakis hew to his own stands on trade protectionism and higher taxes on the wealthy. Mr. Daniels is overlooking Mr. Dukakis's reluctance to increase farm subsidies. And Ms. Garr, the teacher, is forgiving of the fact that the nominee won't support a doubling of federal education spending. &quot;I can be a happy NEA delegate and still make compromises,&quot; Ms. Garr says.    &quot;'Unity,' that's the important word,&quot; exclaims Margaret Jindrich, a 63-year-old delegate from the Chicago area. &quot;Nothing else should matter besides taking over the White House, and that's the way we Democrats feel.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
