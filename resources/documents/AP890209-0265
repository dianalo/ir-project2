The $1.16 trillion spending plan he sent Congress would boostfederal money in fiscal 1990 for cleaning up the environment, forAIDS research, for aid to the homeless and for education.   ``This budget represents my best judgment of how we can addressour priorities, consistent with the people's view,'' Bush said in anaddress to Congress. ``There are many areas in which we would alllike to spend more than I propose, but we cannot until we get ourfiscal house in order.''   Richard Darman, the president's budget director, said Bush wasmaking ``a very credible start'' toward the kinder, gentler societyhe has said repeatedly he wants.   Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate BudgetCommittee, said, ``The Bush administration has signaled an end tothe defense buildup and has indicated they're willing to flow somedefense expenditures into meeting domestic needs like education.''   Overall, the Bush plan rests heavily on the foundation laid downby former President Reagan's budget last month.   He embraces Reagan's call for cost-cutting in entitlementprograms, including $5 billion from Medicare and lesser amounts fromfarm price supports and federal employee benefits.   The Bush plan would reject a few of Reagan's least popularproposals, such as cutting the school lunch program and imposing anew fee for veterans' home loans, Darman indicated.   The vast majority of Reagan's budget was carried over by Bush,who as part of his no-growth ``flexible freeze'' policy, set aceiling for these hundreds of programs roughly equal to what Reaganproposed. But Bush appealed to Congress to join him in shiftingmoney between programs within this group so long as the totals stillmeet deficit-reduction goals.   Among the Reagan proposals lumped into this group areterminations of 82 popular domestic programs. Bush's documentallowed him to avoid specifically endorsing each one while stillclaiming the overall savings.   Bush claimed he met his pledge of no new general tax increase,but he did propose continuing two taxes that are scheduled to expireor decline _ the 3 percent federal tax on local and long distancetelephone calls and the 8 percent tax on airline tickets.   The Bush budget document says the federal deficit would bereduced to less than $91.1 billion next year, just slightly lowerthan the $92.5 billion in Reagan's proposal and within the $100billion fiscal 1990 limit of the Gramm-Rudman law.   The Bush White House estimates the deficit in the current fiscalyear, which ends Sept. 30, will be about $163.3 billion _ more than$2 billion higher than Reagan was estimating just last month.   The new president would trim back his predecessor's plan toincrease military spending faster than the pace of inflation.Instead, military outlays of $298.2 billion this year would justkeep up with inflation and increase to $300.3 billion. That wouldfree $2.6 billion for other programs, compared to Reagan's plan.   Bush proposed reducing the tax rate on capital gains to as low as15 percent on productive assets held more than two years. That'sless than half the current top capital gains rate. He predictedthat, rather than reducing federal revenues as many economicspredict, this move would increase them by $4.8 billion because therate cut would expand the economy and the tax base.   Although many in the Democratic-controlled Congress oppose thecapital gains proposal as a break for the rich that would cost moneyin the long run, many favor some areas where Bush says he wants toput the money.   Bush was proposing to increase subsidies for energy developmentand scientific research, under the theme of internationalcompetitiveness. Among his proposals:   _More than $300 million in new tax breaks for the oil and gasindustry; allowing new drilling in selected offshore areas and inthe Alaska wildlife refuge.   _Restoring a research and development tax credit for business.   _Urban enterprise zones, using special tax breaks to lurecompanies to depressed areas.   _Expanded support of research and science by endorsing Reagan'ssupport for the space station and shuttle and the proposedsuperconducting super collider physics laboratory.   Bush proposes to spend the $515 million set aside by Congresslast year to begin construction of the space station, to be in orbitin the late 1990s. Congress had put strings on the money by orderingthat the new president must first approve its use.   In seeking to make good on his campaign assertion that he is anenvironmentalist, Bush was promising more spending on the Superfundprogram for toxic waste cleanup, clean coal technology, clean waterand wetlands programs, and a greater emphasis on globalenvironmental problems such as the greenhouse effect.   Selected domestic programs would be increased as part of his``kinder, gentler nation'' theme, including:   _Increasing spending on the the Head Start preschool educationprogram by $149 million.   _A new merit award program for schools, increased subsidies forblack colleges.   _A renewed and expanded $3,000 tax deduction for adoptionexpenses.   _Rejection of Reagan's proposed $1.7 billion cut in the Medicaidhealth program for the poor.   _A child care tax credit of $1,000 for low-income families.   _$21 million to start a national program for youth in publicservice.   _Increased spending for the battle against drug abuse, $236million more than Reagan.   Bush's budget was released in a manner that discouragedcomparisons with Reagan's proposals. Instead, the president decidedto compare his figures with those of the current fiscal year, atechnique which makes his spending increases look larger because theold figures don't factor in inflation.   For example, Bush claims as his initiatives a 13 percent boost inresearch to find a cure for the AIDS virus and a 19 percent increasein the space program. But his figures are the same as Reagan's.   The Bush budget includes the $1.9 billion cost to taxpayers nextyear of his program to bail out the ailing savings and loanindustry. Reagan has proposed $2.1 billion.   Bush embraces Reagan's plan for upgrading aviation safety andadds $350 million to the $1.4 billion Reagan sought for cleanupsneeded at the government's nuclear plants.   He does not touch Social Security.   Bush planned to reveal further details of his spending planslater this month, and the 193-page document released Thursday doesnot sell itself as a comprehensive budget. ``It represents the newadministration's statement of priorities _ the outline of ablueprint for building a better America,'' it says in its preface.   The president's budget will be modified by the House and theSenate into a final budget resolution, which then serves as anoverall guide for legislation.</TEXT></DOC>
