True enough. But do companies have some responsibility for ensuring that they succeed? Our research and consulting activities with major corporations suggest that there are important actions companies can take to help prevent failure.    First, companies must clearly define what they expect from each manager and communicate those expectations. The expectations must not only address results that are expected, but also what the manager should do to preclude the fatal flaws named in your article. For example, if a manager has an &quot;inability to get along&quot; with co-workers and subordinates, specifically what has the manager done wrong (e.g., interrupts people in meetings) and what must be done to improve (e.g., solicit others' views)? Expectations should be reasonable, but the best companies expect their managers to perform somewhat above expectations. And rightfully so. But employees should not be asked to pull off miracles.    Second, managers must be provided regular feedback on their performance. Unfortunately, many managers translate the lack of feedback to mean they are doing a good job. &quot;Management by exception&quot; actually becomes &quot;management by punishment&quot; if the only feedback is negative. Senior executives we work with routinely complain they operate with almost no feedback, positive or negative, from their superiors. The numbers don't tell the whole story, particularly if the numbers aren't good. A constructive dialogue about performance is required.    Finally, companies must have effective performance management and compensation systems to ensure that performance is appropriately measured and rewarded.
