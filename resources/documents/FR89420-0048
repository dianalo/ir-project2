Increasing thedepth of the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River between Norfolk andWestern Railway Bridge and U.S. Routes 460 and 13 highway crossing at Mile17.5 from 35 feet to 40 feet over its existing 250- to 500-foot width andproviding a new 800-foot turning basin at the terminus of the channel improvementwill also be accomplished.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Comments and questions concerningthe proposed action should be addressed to Mr. Richard Klein (804) 441-7125;questions regarding the DSEIS should be addressed to Mr. Terrence Getchell(804) 441-7671.

The DSEIS will be prepared in connectionwith a General Design Memorandum which will document the engineering anddesign investigations required to complete plans and specification andactual construction. Authority for the work is provided by Section 201(a)of Public Law 99-662, enacted 17 November 1986. The feasibility report,published as House Document No. 99-85 dated 18 July 1985, recommended theimprovements which are the subject of the DSEIS.2. Deepening the channels constructing the turning basin and widening thechannel between Mile 15 and Mile 17.5 will be considered. Allowing thechannels to remain in the present condition will also be evaluated. Disposaloptions include use of Craney Island Rehandling Basin, direct pumpout intoCraney Island, ocean disposal and other upland locations, along the channels.3. The project was discussed with key federal and state agencies on 25October 1988. Significant issues included dredging methods, direct pumpoutinto the Craney Island Disposal Area as well as use of the Rehandling Basin,the contamination of channel sediments by polynuclear automatic hydrocarbonsand a design of a future monitoring plan related to the use of the rehandlingbasin.4. Further input from these agencies will be solicited both by letter andduring scheduled coordination meetings held by the Dredging ManagementBranch, Norfolk District. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has agreed toperform work under the fish and Wildlife coordination Act and has provideda wildlife resource report. Further environmental consultation and reviewwill be conducted in accordance with the National Environmental PolicyAct and other applicable laws and regulation, including endangered speciesand cultural resources.6. It is anticipated that the DSEIS will be available for public reviewand comment in June 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21">April 10,1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J.J.
