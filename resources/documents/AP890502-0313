The loss was blamed on disastrous investments in a nuclear powerplant and in non-utility-related real estate. A spokesman said thecompany's $20 million in tax writeoffs for the quarter were aneffort to cut its losses and begin recovering from bad investments.   For the quarter, the company lost $5.7 million on revenue of$95.3 million, compared with earnings of $13.9 million, or 40 centsa share, on revenue of $89.5 million during the first three monthsof 1988.   The company suspended sales of the over-the-counter stockTuesday morning, a few hours before it announced it was suspendingdividend payments on 35 million shares of common stock. Trading didnot resume Tuesday, and the stock closed at $8.25, down 25 cents.   Spokesman Ken Perry said trading will resume Wednesday morning.   El Paso Electric wrote off $15 million in investments in thePalo Verde nuclear plant near Phoenix, and $5 million in realestate losses during the quarter.   The utility said its board of directors decided to write off thePalo Verde loss because the company didn't get a rate increase itwanted. The PUC on Thursday granted it a rate increase of $15million _ $23 million less than the company sought.   The utility said it needed a $38 million rate increase over twoyears to pay for a sale and lease-back of its share in Palo Verde.After taxes, the company's loss from the plant was reduced from $23million to $15 million.</TEXT></DOC>
