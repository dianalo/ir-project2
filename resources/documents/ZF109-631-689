 the machine breaks new ground in severalrespects: it is more than twice as fast as Xerox's other 600-dpi printer (the4650) and by far the fastest 600-dpi machine in the market; it indicatesXerox's commitment to merge scanning, printing and copier technologies; and,at long last, it is the product in which Xerox swallowed its pride andconceded that at least some of its customers are demanding PostScript output.andM;At the Seybold exhibition, Xerox previewed the DocuTech Network Publisher,the online version of the machine, which is slated for release in 1991.andP;  (SeeVol.andP;  20, No.andP;  3 for a discussion of the Production and Network Publishers.)andM;What we did not report on earlier was GlobalView, the new Xerox softwareenvironment.andP;  It was introduced a few weeks before the Conference, where wehad our first chance to take a close look.andM;The Conference was also the launching pad for the DocuTech Publishing familyand a host of other products.andP;  The first member in the DocuTech family is theDocuTech Network Publisher mentioned above.andP;  The next two members areDocuTeam and DocuBuild, network applications based on ViewPoint that willeventually make their way into GlobalView.andP;  Xerox showed these newapplications driving the DocuTech Network Publisher on an Ethernet network.andO;Also introduced were document search and retrieval, natural languagetranslation and an upgrade to the XPS publishing system.andM;The amount of new products from Xerox was overwhelming.andP;  A 20-minutepresentation scratched the surface of only a majority of the new items beingshown in the booth.andP;  Without question, it was the largest publishing launchby Xerox in recent memory.andM;But will it be enough to change people's minds about Xerox, which has neversucceeded in becoming the publishing force it claims it will be?andP;  Let's firstexamine the new products.andM;GlobalViewandM;Xerox's new software environment, GlobalView, is the next generation ofViewPoint, the graphical computing environment that evolved from the XeroxStar of 1980.andP;  ViewPoint was the name associated with the Mesa processor ofthe 6085 workstation.andM;GlobalView is associated with a complete port of the ViewPoint softwareenvironment--system software and applications--from the Xerox 6085workstation (and Mesa processor) to the Sun Microsystems Sparc architecture.andO;The entire environment runs under Unix.andM;Xerox announced at this same show in 1987 its decision to make the Sun port.andO;Three years later, the work is nearly complete.andP;  By year's end, Xerox will beoffering a complete graphical user interface and about two dozen applicationsfor Sparcstations.andM;For a period of time, ViewPoint and GlobalView software will be available forthe 6085.andP;  But eventually Xerox will stop making workstations.andP;  The long-termdirection is for the Sparc architecture to be the primary developmentplatform for GlobalView software.andM;At the same time, a third-party developer figured out how to put a Mesaprocessor on a PC add-in card.andP;  The card, originally known as the BountyBoard, has been licensed by Xerox and is now officially called GlobalView forthe PC.andM;Emperor's new clothes: Mesa on a PC.andP;  The Bounty Board enables an AT orEISA-bus PC (80286, '386 or '486 processor) with OS/2 to emulate a 6085workstation.andP;  The PC card runs existing ViewPoint software from the MesaProcessor on the plug-in card.andP;  (Release 2.0 is the current level ofViewPoint software.)andP;  By next year, when Xerox has upgraded ViewPoint to thesame software as the Sparc (3.0, or GlobalView), the PC board will run thesame GlobalView software as GlobalView for the Sparc.andM;Performance of the PC card is affected by the disk controller and clock rateof the processor, especially for input and output.andP;  In rough terms, anAT-class machine is a little faster than the Model 1 6085.andP;  An 80386 machineis comparable to the Model 2 6085.andP;  An 80486 would obviously be faster, butXerox noted that a faster disk might improve performance just as much.andM;The PC board provides a complete multitasking, multi-user graphical desktopthat runs in an alternate screen of the 19&quot; display.andP;  Even though theViewPoint environment is self-contained, it runs as on OS/2 task, so the usermay hot-key between OS/2 and ViewPoint.andP;  In fact, because it supports threetotal screens at once, MS-DOS, OS/2 and ViewPoint can all be running at thesame time, with a hot key to switch among them.andM;The Mesa processor and some of the 4 MB of RAM on the add-in card are onlyused for running ViewPoint; OS/2 and MS-DOS run off the Intel processor.andP;  thePC's memory and disk drives may be allocated in a flexible manner between thedifferent environments.andM;What it switches screens, the board runs MS-DOS or OS/2 from the PC's nativeIntel microprocessor: 80286, '386 or '486.andP;  Thus, even though the board ispurchased to obtain a turnkey system, the customer still has the flexibilityof using the box for mainstream applications.andP;  And, as on the 6085, theadd-in card enables the user to partition part of the ViewPoint disk as a PCdisk, with translators for passing files between the PC and ViewPointenvironments.andM;The idea of putting a proprietary system in a PC case has been tried before.andO;Compugraphic used in the Integrator a proprietary display card that was notsupported by MS-DOS applications.andP;  Harris put the chip of the 8300 display adsystem on a PC card.andP;  Krohm put its composition system's Texas Instrumentschip on a PC card.andP;  All of these systems were perceived primarily asreplacement or add-on products for the installed customer base.andP;  The did notattract new customers because it was clear that these products were1970s-style systems in 1980s clothing.andP;  They didn't represent a true mergerbetween computers and publishing.andP;  And so, such products slowly faded fromview.andM;With the Xerox product, at least the turnkey system runs within themainstream environment, not exclusive of it.andP;  You buy the turnkey package,but it is a subset of your total system, and you can hot-key betweenenvironments.andM;GlobalView for the PC still has most appeal to the installed base of 6085customers.andP;  (If you don't have a PC to upgrade, it may cost more thanexpected, given how much memory and processing OS/2 requires, but it's stilla better bet than a 6085 Model 2.)andP;  But for the rest of the market, thisturnkey system should be evaluated on the basis of the applications Xeroxoffers with it, including the new DocuTeam and DocuBuild.andM;GlobalView for the PC is available now.andP;  The price of the package is $3,900,including the board, a 19% monochrome display, the ViewPoint 2.0 operatingsystem and the starter kit suite of ViewPoint applications.andP;  The new 3.0operatig system and applications will be offered as an upgrade in 1991.andM;Facelift: GlobalView on Sparc.andP;  To the end user, GlobalView is an upgrade,not an overhaul, of ViewPoint.andP;  It adds support for color and a few newfeatures (such as the ability to show all file levels within a directory),but its look, feel and functionality remain very close to what is avialabletoday on the 6085.andP;  Equally important, GlobalView files are compatibleregardless of whether they originate on the 6085, GlobalView for the PC or aSparcstation.andP;  Customers will be able to mix Sparcstations and 6085workstations on the same network.andM;But underneath, the GlobalView operating system, previously written in Mesacode, has been rewritten in C for Unix.andP;  The file structure and filesthemselves are Unix, so GlobalView files may be manipulated from the Unixcommand shell the same as other Unix application files.andP;  running in nativeUnix gives Xerox much more flexibility for the future.andM;Two limitations, at the moment, are GlobalView's dependence on Sparc hardwareand the Xerox windowing environment.andP;  On the hardware side, Xerox has a majorOEM agreement with Sun, and it is not in a hurry to make another port.andP;  Butbecause GlobalView is native Unix, Xerox is investigating the possibility ofrunning it on other Unix platforms, including both Motorola- and Intel-basedhardware.andM;Opening up: future directions.andP;  On the software side, Xerox chose to use itsown object-based graphical environment and windowing manager when making theport, because at the time the alternatives (Open Look, Motif, NextStep) werenot as robust or nearly as stable as development tools.andP;  Coupled with thefact that there was no clear market leader (and there still is not), Xeroxchose the safe road for its customers and stayed with its own technology.andO;Nevertheless, the port to Unix affords Xerox the opportunity to open itssystem to other software environments.andP;  Its initial approach is an X-Terminalwindow within GlobalView.andP;  This window turns the Sparcstation into an Xdisplay terminal--you may run any number of X applications, each in its ownwindow, within the overall X-Terminal window.andP;  You can, for example, runSun's OpenWindows within the GlobalView X-Terminal window--the paradigm isthe opposite of the PC card.andM;What you can't do is interact with other Unix graphical desktops--Open Lookor Motif.andP;  These may be open within the GlobalView X window, but thedrag-and-drop metaphor of Open Look, whereby objects may be grabbed with themouse and dragged into other windows, does not extend between GlobalView andX-based applications running inside of it.andM;The next step for Xerox will be a library of translators that facilitate fileexchange between GlobalView and other Unix environments.andP;  Xerox plans towrite the translators for the most common data formats, but it will alsooffer a toolkit with which third-party developers will be able to write theirown filters.andM;The next major step, though, is one beyond desktops into what Xerox calls&quot;rooms.&quot;andP;  Rooms refer to a computer environment that coordinates multipledesktops (just as a room may have many desks) all within the same screen.andO;Developed at PARC, room technology will provide the graphical interactionbetween different windowing systems that is lacking in the current GlobalViewproduct.andP;  The technology is being readied for delivery in the next release ofGlobalView, due out in mid-1991.andP;  When available, it could be offered as away to resolve the user interface debate in the Unix market.andM;The package today.andP;  Initially Xerox is selling GlobalView software bundled inthe Xerox 6520 workstation--a Sun IPC relabeled by Xerox.andP;  Display optionsinclude 17&quot; and 19&quot; gray-scale and 16&quot; and 19&quot; color monitors.andP;  Prices varyfrom $8,000 for the 17&quot; monochrome model to $12,000 for the 19&quot; color modelequipped with a 207-MB hard disk and 8 MB of RAM.andP;  Xerox is taking orders forthe 6520 now and expects to begin fulfilling them later this month.andM;Performance on the IPC is estimated at two to four times faster than the mostrecent 6085.andP;  Unlike the PC board, the Sparc version of Globalview is wed toa scalable architecture, not a single chip.andP;  Xerox will be able to offerGlobalView for a variety of Sparc machines, if it wants to, benefiting fromany future hardware improvements by Sun (or its clones).andP;  It goes withoutsaying that Sun will improve the speed of its machines more quickly thanXerox did with the 6085.andM;Because Xerox supports all of the products it sells, it is being cautiousabout offering GlobalView as a separate software package.andP;  Initially, it willbe available as separate software only ona special-bid, multiple-copy basis.andM;Database view: DocuTeamandM;Xerox describes DocuTeam as &quot;workgroup software for structuringdocument-based business processes.&quot;andP;  That description is vague, but it maycome as close to capturing the essence of this product as our explanation:network project management software that ties ViewPoint documents to anOracle database.andM;The closest things to DocuTeam in the publishing market today are Sherpa andInterleaf 5 and its Relational Document Manager.andP;  Sherpa is similar in itsconfiguration managementandM;software, which tracks and manages workflow and job status.andP;   InterleafandM;5 has the ability to treat a document as the user's interface todatabase-oriented software (RDM).andP;  Odesta's Document Management System isanother product that may be compare to DocuTeam; it, too, relies on arelational database to track events to documents.andP;  But the similarities andquickly.andP;  DocuTeam may have competitors in project management orcomputer-aided software engineering (CASE), but it has few, if any, rivals inthe publishing industry.andP;  We would even go so far as to say that somecustomers may justify the entire GlobalView system on the basis of thisproduct.andM;Total project management.andP;  DocuTeam is premised on the concept of a project.andO;There are four aspects to the software, each tied to common tasks in theproject life cycle: organizing, defining and planning, sharing, andmonitoring and reporting.andP;  Throughout all of these tasks, Xerox introducesthe concept of &quot;freeing the data from the document&quot;; that is, structuredcontent (text, tables and graphics) is actually stored at the component levelin Oracle.andP;  A document is really a collection of pointers to the sourcematerial.andP;  Each member of the team thus has two ways of interacting with theinformation: the conventional document method, in which the information isedited as if it were in a regular document; and the database method, throughwhich myriad different filtered views may be created using the database'squarying facilities.andM;For organizing the project, Xerox offers a hierarchical view of the documentsand tasks related to it.andP;  This view supplements the desktop's standad iconview.andP;  A folder of templates is supplied for getting users started; itincludes diagrams for the defining and planning stage.andP;  Users may createtheir own templates as well.andP;  The templates and hierarchical view are tiedtogether in the system's ability to tell you where you are at any moment inrelation to the project as a whole.andM;The project definition and planning software is impressive, consisting of afull set of graphical project management modules.andP;  DocuTeam takes astructured, top-down approach to planning a project that may then be viewedin graphical form.andP;  Team members can beak a project down into components andsubcomponents in a work breakdown structure (WBS) diagram.andP;  As one of thesestructures is created, so is an associated &quot;data attachment&quot; sheet, which isderived from fields in the Oracle database.andP;  Typical attachment informationwould include the milestone dates in a project.andP;  Changes to the diagram areautomatically reflected in the data attachment.andP;  Project Networks (PERT/CPM)template diagrams are also provided.andM;For graphics modeling of the project, Xerox offers entity relationshipdiagrams and data flow diagrams as well as the above-mentioned structurecharts.andP;  Techniques and symbology follow Schlaer/Mellor, Gane andamp; Sarson,Yourdon/DeMarco, Page/Jones and Ward/Mellor.andM;For presenting and analyzing, DocuTeam automatically creates Gantt, line, barand pie charts.andM;The sharing aspect is represented in a new icon: the shared library bookswith database.andP;  Documents in a shared library reside on the file server in ashared directory, with their contents also stored in Oracle running on a Vax.andO;DocuTeam takes care of all permission/access rights and file locking, and itdoes so bettern than most systems.andP;  Opening a file for editing locks it; apadlock icon appears next to the file in its directory.andP;  But the system makesfurther distinctions.andP;  A computer icon indicates that a local copy exists.andP;  Aplus sign (+) indicates that a newer version of the document has been createdbut not yet checked back in.andP;  And the &quot;show details&quot; feature lets you findout who locked a document, why and when.andM;The monitoring and reporting aspect is also well done.andP;  Even though Oracle isbeing used as the database engine, Xerox has done a superb job of making ittransparent to the user.andP;  Access to the database is granted through the&quot;quick queries&quot; function.andP;  Forget SQL; this series of fill-in-the blankfields covers literally hundreds of search combinations with no need toremember or see the query language syntax.andP;  The user fills in the desiredfields (say, status of project A and overall due dates); the engine initiatesthe query and reports the results back in a nicely formatted table that is initself a document that may be printed, electronically mailed to someone elseor used to generate presentation graphics automatically.andM;The myopic view.andP;  DocuTeam is impressive, but it has one significantshortcoming: it is of use only to ViewPoint (and shortly, GlobalView)customers.andP;  The only information it tracks is structured content createdwithin ViewPoint applications or translated into ViewPoint from otherapplications.andP;  The underlying premise that all members of the team will sharea common set of application software contrasts sharply with the approaches ofOdesta and Sherpa, which were designed to be application-independent.andP;  As itis, DocuTeam is an outstanding sales tool for GlobalView, but it isdissappointing that it is not being offered outside of GlobalView, where amuch larger pool of potential customers lies.andM;Xerox is taking orders for DocuTeam, which is already in the field at severalsites.andP;  Its price begins at $20,000 for 10 desktops; substantial discountsare offered at 30,60 and 100 units.andP;  (That pricing assumes that you alreadyhave a Vax and Oracle software.)andM;DocuBuild: structured editorandM;The second new ViewPoint application is DocuBuild, known to some by its codename Ojai.andP;  It was developed in San Diego by the publishing group that alsohandles the Xerox XPS.andP;  Unlike the basic ViewPoint editor, which was designedto handle broad office requirements but has been pushed into publishingapplications, DocuBuild was designed for high performance in demandingpublishing applications, especially technical publications.andM;DocuBuild is a networked compound document processor for creating andproducing structured documents.andP;  It contains built-in table, equation andgraphics editors.andP;  It addition to having a full formatter appropriate forcreating proposals, reports, manuals and the like, DocuBuild generates itscontent tagging in SGML syntax.andM;DocuBuild has several distinguishing characteristics that differentiate itfrom other products in the market.andP;  First, it uses a new token technology forwhich Xerox has applied for a patent.andP;  Second, it was built from the groundup with support for native SGML files.andP;  Third, it is by design a networkproduct for work groups.andP;  And, fourth, it style sheets make use of thespecial printing and finishing capabilities of the DocuTech printer,providing a complete, on-demand publishing system.andM;Token technology.andP;  DocuBuild has the unique ability to represent words in thedocument as tokens in a database.andP;  Any time a word is used more than once, itis represented in the document by its token, which points to the word in thedatabase.andP;  The token database is unique to each document--it is only a listof the words in the document, not a predefined dictionary.andM;The use of token technology has two advantages.andP;  First, it compresses thefiles, improving system performance.andP;  Because words are represented bytoekens, rather than as an ASCII text string, the document file may be asmuch as 25% more compact.andP;  In long documents, performance and storage areoften considerations--this technology should help establish DocuBuild ascompetitive in the high-volume publishing market.andM;The second advantage, a more significant one, is that the tokens are notlimited to any one data type.andP;  In the first releases of the product, tokensare used for text and graphics.andP;  But in subsequent releases, Xerox hopes toadd support for other data types--maybe video, sound or animated sequences.andO;In other words, DocuBuild has the foundation to support not just compounddocuments o text and graphics, but also multimedia documents of the futurethat are distributed and read on computers, not just on paper.andM;SGML support.andP;  DocuBuild's native content files conform to SGML syntax, andthe program makes extensive use of the content structure model of SGML in itsstyle sheets.andP;  For example, the style definitions relate to tags and theirlocation within the document's structure.andP;  It is therefore possible for asection head in the frontmatter to have a different style from an element,also tagged section head, in the main body of a book.andM;Xerox has licensed Software Exoterica's XGML Engine for use within DocuBuild,but the initial release takes a more manual approach.andP;  A valid Document TupesDefinition (DTD) is used to construct a sytle sheet.andP;  The style sheet is thenused as the basis for context-sensitive tagging and formatting.andP;  If the stylesheet was carefully prepared (and the DTD valid), and the author follows theprompts for tags, then any document that follows the style sheet should parsewithout errors.andM;Xerox supplies two sytle sheets prepared to conform to the CALS 28001 and ATA100 Rev.andP;  29 DTDs.andM;For editing, DocuBuild offers three views: manuscript and two variations oflayout.andP;  Typically, the user will work in the layout viewes, which areWYSIWYG representations of the page.andP;  One view displays the tags to the leftof the document; the other hides them.andP;  Icons within the text indicating thestart and end points of tags may be shown or hidden in either layout view.andO;The secreen recomposes and repaginates as the user types.andM;The manuscript view is the raw ASCII file in monospaced type with itsassociated coding shown where it applies in the content.andP;  It is the view ofan SGML document that scares most people, and few people would have reason touse it, except to edit underlying codes.andM;In the initial release, DocuBuild is accompanied by a batch parser (fromExoterica) running on a Vax.andP;  The parser will handle any valid, precompiledDTD.andP;  To validate the document, the user runs the file through the parser,reads the resulting error log and then uses DocuBuild or any other ASCIIeditor to fix the erros.andP;  This is the typical approach of WYSIWYG publishingvendors that are now offering SGML options.andM;Eventually, Xerox hopes to integrate the XGML Engine, which would allow forarbitrary DTDs and provide interactive parsing during editing.andP;  At thatpoint, DocuBuild becomes a native SGML editor with formatting capabilitiesmuch more sophisticated than those of SoftQuad's Author/Editor or IBM'sTextWrite.andP;  Arbor Text's The Publisher, which also uses the XGML Engine, willmost likely be the closest comparable product.andM;Special features and network support.andP;  There is a class of users who careabout SGML, but the larger market is those who do not.andP;  For the lattercustomers, DocuBuild is an authoring system that offers WYSIWYG editing andformatting based on content tagging.andP;  It adds several significant featuresthat the standard GlovalView editor lacks.andP;  And its network support maydifferentiate it from several competitors.andM;Compared to the standard GlobalView editor, DocuBuild adds:andM;* More filters.andP;  Interleaf, Venture Publisher, Microsoft Word, WorldPerfect,Multimate and Xerox XPS were added; the ViewPoint filters for WordStar, XICSand Xerox 860 were redone to incorporate tagging.andM;* Display of facing pages.andM;* Content in styles.andP;  DocuBuild allows content (stored text) to be part of astyle tag.andP;  This feature, common among code-driven commercial compositionsystems, is often lacking in desktop products.andM;* Multiple editing windows on the same document (open first and last pages inseparate windows).andM;* An integrated spelling checker and thesaurus.andM;As a networked application, DocuBuild expands ViewPoint's shared books intowhat Xerox calls shared publications.andP;  These are documents saved in shareddirectories on the file server.andP;  A shared publication may be made up of manydocuments.andP;  When a portion of a publication is opened for editing, it is&quot;checked out&quot; by the system, and every other user in the group can see thepadlock icon that indicates the file is locked.andP;  When the file is checkedback in, the lock is removed.andM;The system enables users to open copies of locked files for editing orviewing, and, as with all applications in ViewPoint Point 2.0, to view at thedirectory level who has the file, when it was checked out and so forth.andP;  (SeeDocuTeam, above, and Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  3, p. 37 of the Seybold Report on DesktopPublishing for a discussion of ViewPoint's file locking.)andM;One feature not in the first release is revision control.andP;  Xerox plans toincorporate a full, multiple-author edit trace feature in a future release.andM;Batch processing.andP;  One special aspect of DocuBuild is its job assistant, anicon-based programmable ticket that is used to initiate background tasks.andO;The job assistant uses seven underlying processes--moving, copying,paginating and printing files, generating a table of contents or index andrunning translators--as the basis for creating publishing-specific automatedtasks.andP;  Each of the processes may be run at specific times, on command orcontinuously.andP;  For example, one task might be an automatic filtering routinethat also prints out a proof and routs the translated file to anotherdirectory.andM;This type of batch background capability, while common on professionalpublishing systems, is still unusual among author-oriented systems.andP;  Nearlyall that have such a feature require programming or at the very leastcreating a batch file of commands.andP;  DocuBuild's job assistant is much more ofan everyday, end-user type of tool.andP;  Its icon and property-sheet approach isdesigned to allow nontechnical users to create their own batch processes thatrun unattended.andM;Xerox also intends to use the job assistant as a queue manager for theDocuTech printer, which does not have its own queue or spooling manager.andM;For those who want to do more, VP Agents--Xerox's customer programminglanguage (Cusp)--provide an outlet for customizing the system beyond thedefault icons.andP;  Even so, the appeal of the job assistant is such that wewould like to see Xerox add even more processes to the standard list oficons.andP;  That would bring its functionality in this area into line with theprogramming capability of its Unix competitors (Frame, Interleaf, ArborText),but at a much more intuitive level.andM;Style sheets and formatting.andP;  As a formatter, DocuBuild is much more robustthan the standard ViewPoint editor.andP;  Both are WYSIWYG, and both supportcompound documents, but ViewPoint is quite limited in both quality andfeatures when it comes to typography.andM;The underlying handamp;j is a complete rewrite that is more like XICS thatViewPoint.andP;  The user specifies the optimum space value, and the systemsupplies its own minimum and maximum based on the optimum.andP;  It then targetsthe optimum value for spacebands, hyphenating and letterspacing if needed.andM;The user controls the degree of hyphenation but not letterspacing.andP;  Theexception-word dictionary uses ranked hyphenation points, which the user mayedict.andP;  The user also sets the minimum length of hyphenated words, theminimum number of letters before a hyphen and the maximum permissible numberof hyphens in a row.andM;Style sheets are seprate, named property sheets that contain a collection ofstyle definitions, not unlike Ventura.andP;  But in DocuBuild, styles may beinherited from tags higher up in the hierarchy, and styles may be inheritedfrom other styles.andM;This feature enables the user to establish a basic set of styles and thenspecify the rest as overrides of certain attributes.andP;  Texet (nowCompugraphic's CAPS) was the first publishing system to offer this feature,and we have always thought it a powerful model for a network of writerscollaborating on a single structured publication.andM;The knowledge of the document's structure also enables DocuBuild to implementcontext-sensitive sytles.andP;  The style definitions relate to tags and theirlocation within the structure of the document.andP;  For example, a section headin the frontmatter may be formatted differently from a section head inChapter 1.andM;Also owing to the structure, DocuBuild automatically numbers virtually anycontent element, and it automatically updates cross-references.andP;  Itsautomatic table of contents may be built without inserting TOC markers: thecontents is created by specifying which levels of heads are to appear, andthe selected headings are extracted automatically.andP;  The indexing toolfeatures a new editable index that enables the indexer to modify the index(re-sort, change hierarchy of elements, etc.) before folios are extracted.andO;We weren't able to see it in action, but the indexing is a promising featurethat will warrant close attention when the product is released.andM;Unfortunately, the version of DocuBuild at the show was still a little flaky,and we were unable to get a clear sense of how it really works.andP;  At firstglance, we would say its overall formatting capability is in the realm ofVentura, but without some of the controls.andP;  It supports book-style pagination(including proper support of straddle elements, headings and footnotes), yetit allows for exception pages within a document.andP;  We will have to wait untilwe get the product to make more formal judgments.andM;Graphics.andP;  DocuBuild incorporates the graphics editors of ViewPoint--vector,raster, data-driven charts, Pro Illustrator and Expert--within the documenteditor, but in a slightly different way.andP;  In DocuBuild, Xerox calls theframes dynamic, because they are references to external objects rather thancomponents embedded within the document.andM;Each frame may have its own icon.andP;  Its content may be graphics, tables orequations created in DocuBuild, or the content may be generated by anotherapplication and translated into a format ViewPoint can interpret.andP;  Thegraphic content is always included by reference (following the SGML model),which means that it appears on the display or on output as part of thedocument, but the data is not actually copied into the document file itself.andO;The ViewPoint graphics editors may be used to edit graphics within a documentor, if they are separate icons, as objects outside the document.andM;Xerox has written graphics filters for PCX, TIFF, Sun Raster, MacPaint andCCIT Group IV raster formats and IGES 1 and 2 ang CGM draft mode vectorformats.andP;  All of the graphics translators are bidirectional; edits made to animported object may be translated back to the source system.andM;Xerox sees its dynamic frames approach as an architecture for integratingnon-Xerox applications with DocuBuild.andP;  At the moment, it establishes amechanism for including material created on non-Xerox applications.andP;  (Thissame statement could be made of any SGML software application.)andP;  As a nextstep, Xerox has stated its willingness to make pubic its ASCII text andvector and raster graphics interchange formats.andP;  It hopes to developbidirectional interchange with other applications, heading toward a live-linkfacility.andP;  In the long run, DocuBuild's data-independent token technologywould lend itself to incorporation of new types of media as well.andM;From a layout perspective, DocuBuild supports nested frames, allows frames inrunning heads and feet and puts frame callouts in style sheets.andP;  Frames mayfloat with an anchor to top, middle or bottom of the page, inside or outsidecolumn, on the same page or not.andP;  The style may be inherited globally or setindividually in each frame's property sheet.andP;  In addition, frames may beplaced inline or at exact xly positions on a page.andM;Fonts, output.andP;  One holdover from the ViewPoint environment is DocuBuild'sreliance on bitmap fonts and Interpress.andP;  The bitmap ViewPoint fonts providespeed, but they sacrifice flexibility in areas such as fonts sizes (discreteinteger values), variable set width (not supported) and rotation (90 degreesonly).andP;  They also are not PostScript fonts.andM;In the first release, Xerox is offering several bitmap fonts that haveAdobe-compatible widths.andP;  Documents are always formatted for Interpress, but,by using these special fonts and an Interpress-to-PostScript translatordevelop by Rank Xerox, users may print documents to PostScript devices withline ending intact.andM;Xerox has not declared whether it will support Sun's Folio font technology orgo elsewhere for outline-based screen fonts in the next release.andM;On the plus side, DocuBuild fully supports all of the features of the newDocuTech printer, including the ability to create imposition pages on sheetsthat will be folded; to specify different paper stocks for differentelements; and to enable finishing processes, such as stapling.andP;  This couplingof DocuBuild with DocuTech will be especially useful in targeting verticalmarkets that want on-demand publishing.andP;  One example is the market forbenefit booklets in health care.andM;The PC add-on.andP;  Xerox is also offering a PC version of DocuBuild.andP;  Ratherthan develop a product from the ground up, Xerox licensed the Spring editorfrom Borland and added to it DocuBuild's network and tagging functionality.andO;Running under MS-DOS, DocuBuild for the PC offers a manuscript view(monospaced with inline coding) of the document.andM;The PC product offers a lower-priced editing station that guarantees completedocument fidelity with the workstation-based product.andM;Room for one more?andP;  DocuBuild is entering a crowded market, but its use ofSGML and Xerox's new token and job assistant technology may sufficientlydifferentiate it from the competition.andP;  We like the product's underlyingstructure, which appears sound and able to support continued growth in boththe authoring and formatting aspects.andM;DocuBuild is currently being offered for the 6085 workstations and GlobalViewfor the PC (ViewPoint 2.0).andP;  The PC version requires an AT or better with theViewBoard, an 80-MB hard disk, an Ethernet card for XNS net, a keyboard andmouse and a 19&quot; monitor.andM;Xerox expects to begin taking orders for DocuBuild next March, withdeliveries slated for the second quarter of 1991.andP;  The price is $2,500, withquantity discounts.andP;  DocuBuild for the PC is $495, available in the sametimeframe.andM;Other productsandM;XPS update.andP;  The Xerox Vax-based XPS system is still alive and was recentlyupgraded to print graphics on non-Xerox devices.andP;  Release 4.3 supports mostPostScript printers and typesetters and the Autologic APS graphicstypesetters.andP;  Its style sheets fully support the advanced paper stock andbinding facilities of the DocuTech Network Publisher.andM;New application features are geared toward technical manuals.andP;  The XPS nowprovides looseleaf pagination (though without a page database), and itautomatically inserts change bars during an editing cycle.andM;DocuTran: automatic language translation.andP;  Part of Xerox's new strategy is&quot;partnering with the best.&quot;andP;  This policy explains why it went to Adobe forthe DocuTech interpreter.andP;  It also explains Xerox's relationship witySystran, the leading supplier of natural-language machine translationsoftware.andM;The ViewPoint editor supports more languages than any other word processor orpublishing program on earth.andP;  But translation between languages was alwayssomething humans did.andP;  With multiple, different-language versions of the samedocument becoming more common as more firms sell into global markets,customers are looking for ways to automate the translation process.andP;  Hencethe DocuTran translator, based on Systran's expertise.andM;(At Drupa [Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  20], we covered Intergraph's DP/Translator,automatic translation software for Integraph workstations, as our firstcoverage of an emerging market.)andM;Systran has been in the language translation business for more than 20 years,and Xerox has been one of its customers for 11 years.andP;  Its software, whichruns on IBM mainframes, offers 22 language pairs--including English to mostLatin-based languages plus Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Korean and Greek; sevenlanguages back to English; and four other common pairs.andP;  Xerox will beoffering a subset: English to French, German, Italian, Spanish andPortuguese.andM;Systran's modular software parses sentences and translates them in athree-step process that allows the use of multiple dictionaries (for singleworks, technical glossaries or idiomatic expressions) and incorporateslanguage-specific synthesis routines.andP;  Systran claims at least 80% accuracyon technical material.andM;Machine translation of natural languages is in some ways like optical chapterrecognition: it's not perfect, but if you have enough volume, getting you 80%of the way there in a fraction of time can quickly pay a large dividend.andP;  Inaddition to the savings in basic translation, part of the cost savings andfaster time is due to automatically translating a document's format as wellas its content.andP;  That leaves only the post-editing and final editing process.andO;Systran estimates that, on the average, its system is 40% less expensive andfour times faster than human translation.andM;Systran demonstrated its ability to handle Xerox ViewPoint (and GlobalView)documents at the show.andP;  It retains all formatting across translations,including charts, graphics, layout, font style and size.andP;  We were unable toput Systran to the test (we're best at German, but only Spanish was loadedfor the demo), but we hope to have some results at a later date.andM;DocuTran costs $7,500 for the first seat; subsequent seats bring the price aslow as $3,100 per seat.andP;  Assuming that it costs about $40 per page to havetranslation done outside at a service bureau, Systran estimates thebreak-even point to be about 250 pages a month.andP;  At 300 pages a month, itshould be cheaper to buy the system and do the translation in-house, evenwith the additional overhead of a staff person to do a post-editing step.andM;BASIS for seach and retrieval.andP;  Xerox also teamed with a leader fornetwork-based full-text retrieval.andP;  It has licensed Information Dimensions'BASIS, the leading search and retrieval software for VAX computers.andO;Initially, BASIS runs on the VAX, with access to the documents from the 6085or PC GlobalView workstations.andP;  Eventually, Xerox may put the BASIS engine onthe Sparcstation to eliminate the need for the VAX.andM;Document Search and Retrieval is available now.andP;  Its pricing is similar tothat of DocuTeam.andM;A first step .andP;  .  .andM;GlobalViwe is an apt name for Xerox's new environment.andP;  Xerox is aninternational company that serves the global market, and the compounddocument editor at the core of GlobalView supports more languages than anyother word processor or publishing system in the world.andP;  In its networkdesktop and work in collaborative applications, Xerox has demonstrated itsunderstanding of the need for computing environments that extend far beyonduser's own workstation.andM;In the launch of GlobalView, Xerox stressed that this product marks the firststep in the company's transition to open systems.andP;  The problem is the firststep has, in effect, created a proprietary turnkey system on an off-the-shelfhardware platform.andP;  (Its egocentric approach to the outside computer worldreminds us of East Berlin, pre-1990: it's not hard to get data in, but it'shell to get it back out.)andM;In making the port, Xerox decided that its object-based desktop and windowmanager were more stable and robust than what was available at the time onUnix workstations.andP;  It made a conscious decision to keep functionality,sacrificing a potential change in software approach.andP;  As graphical userinterfaces for Unix mature and stabilize, the challenge for Xerox will be tomodify its environment so that its applications--which are very tightlyintegrated within--become more tightly integrated with applications tht existoutside of its domain.andM;With regard to integrating with third-party applications, DocuBuild willprobably outpace GlobalView as a whole.andP;  The architecture of DocuBuild issuch that it already supports content created in third-party applications,and the publishing team is committed to enhancing its links to third-patyprograms.andP;  Because it is both an editor and formatter, DocuBuild may be usedas a front-end editor to another formatter or as a formatter thatincorporates data from other applications.andP;  By design, its data structuresare open, so even its first release could be purchased as a modularcomponents to be integrated with other systems and applications.andM;The team that is developing DocuBuild is a relatively small one that isfocused exclusively on publishing.andP;  If given the freedom to move at anaggressive pace, that group may be able to push its application forward morequickly than GlobalView as a whole.andP;  Because its product is still at leasthalf a year away from completion, and because it is entering an overcrowdedfield marked by fierce competition, the group will need that freedom torealize the potential of its architecture.andM;DocuTeam, which was develop for internal use but has now been made into aproduct, could also benefit from a more open, aggressive approach.andP;  Fewproducts today come close to offering as intuitive an interface to adatabase.andP;  But to reach widespread acceptance, DocuTeam must be enhanced towork in a more open software environment.andM;.  .  .  in a long journey.andP;  At the start of this article, we asked if theparade of new products from Xerox would change people's minds about theself-proclaimed &quot;document company.&quot;andP;  Xerox has earned its reputation forhigh-volume printers, but in the publishing software and systems business ithas never been nimble in responding to market changes.andP;  As a result, it hasbeen stigmatized as a technology-rich company that never seems to establishits products in the market.andM;GlobalView by itself is not going to change that image; at least not in itscurrent incarnation, which is nearly identical in appearance andfunctionality to what Xerox was offering three years ago.andM;Few would dispute that the interface Xerox pioneered with the Star was one ofthe landmark events in the computer industry.andP;  Xerox says it realizes itmissed its opportunity to establish that interface as a standard for theentire industry.andP;  Yet in going to Unix, for which it could have designed itssoftware in a way that was largely independent of the user interface, therebypositioning itself as a developer of application software, it instead clungto its former model, leaving the impression of a company that hasn't changed.andO;Over the last five years, Xerox has operated as a supplier of completesystems; it seems unable to visualize itself as a supplier of enablingtechnology.andP;  There is still time for change: it will face this challengeagain next year with its concept of rooms, which will achieve broad successonly if endorsed by major computer manufacturers.andM;In the meantime, with products like DocuBuild and its strategy for blendingwith other Unix environments, Xerox is at least beginning to clarify its roleas an application developer.andP;  It has made the first step.andP;  But the journeyinto open systems has only just begun.andP;  We can only hope that as it movesahead it begins to walk a bit faster, with its head up and eyes open.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
