Jarrett said he &quot;wouldn't argue&quot; with analysts' projections that the bank holding company's 1986 profit will be about equal to 1985 net income of $80.4 million, or $4.30 a share.    Mr. Jarrett also said analysts' forecasts of a 7% to 10% rise in profit for 1987 is a &quot;reasonable estimate.&quot;    For the current year, he said, &quot;If we're flat, we'd be doing extremely well,&quot; since 1985 results included gains of nearly $17 million from sales of securities.    Officials didn't estimate the exact amount of securities gains expected in 1986. For the nine months, AmeriTrust had a gain of $1.1 million from sales of securities compared with a gain of $8.8 million in the year-earlier period.    The company had nine-month earnings of $65.6 million, or $3.18 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
