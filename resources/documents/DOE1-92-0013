This is accomplishedby assuming that each gas chromatographic peak might be a mixture; deconvolutingeach peak using mass spectral type analysis into as many as 3 possiblecomponents of each of as many as 8 different types; and assigning a carbonnumber range to each possible component based on its elution time. Alibrary identification is assigned if and only if (a) it is within thesetype and carbon number limits, and (b) the corresponding deconvolutedspectrum also show a good match or fit with the library spectrum. Ifthe library identifications are unacceptable, the component is assigneda generic identification in terms of component type and carbon number.The expert system was constructed to retain the human expert's knowledgeand to reduce the need for the expert whose specialized skills can beused more productively in non-routine areas. The effect of solute ionizationand the concentrations of nonionic and zwitterionic (neutral but charged)surfactants on the retention times of weak acids, bases, and ampholytesin reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography was investigated.An equilibrium model based upon interaction among eluent and solutesis derived to predict the retention behavior.</TEXT></DOC>
