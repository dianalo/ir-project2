(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Party chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr.urged Democratic platform writers today to not turn the party'selection manifesto into a Yellow Pages listing of demands ``forevery organized group.''   As a 16-member drafting committee opened work, the partyreleased a 2,000-word ``discussion paper'' penned by one-time JohnF. Kennedy speechwriter Theodore Sorensen. Even before it was madepublic, the Sorensen paper was drawing criticism from the campaignsof Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson as not specific enough.   The Sorensen paper, styled as a declaration by ``We the peopleof the Democratic Party,'' denounces ``voodoo economics'' andcondemns ``South Africa's hateful apartheid, government-sponsoredterrorism.''   Jackson has said the platform must denounce South Africa as aterrorist state.   Kirk, in an opening statement to the platform writers, said theparty needs ``a pragmatic, principled and positive statement thatAmerican people can read and reflect upon and say, `That's the kindof country I want my kids to grow up in.''   ``We have to not only speak to ourselves, we have to rememberthe so-called swing voters. Where are they going to end up inNovember and where will their families end up in the 1990s?'' Kirkasked.   He told reporters as he departed that the Sorensen paper was ``astarting point.'' He said he did not think the party needs to spellout dollar figures or precise program goals in its platform.   ``I don't think we'll end up with the Yellow Pages, an ad forevery organized group,'' he said.   At a welcoming party Thursday night hosted by Michigan Gov.James J. Blanchard at his summer residence on this resort island,Kirk said he did not expect showdown votes at this weekend'sdrafting sessions.   Michael Barnes, a former Maryland congressman who is Dukakis'chief liaison with the platform committee, said the differencesbetween the two ``are not that great. It's not like Jesse Helms andGeorge McGovern. We're talking about two progressive Democrats.''   Jackson has said repeatedly he wants the platform to featurespecific planks, including a denuncation of South Africa as aterrorist state, elimination of voter registration restrictions,and a shift of resources from the military to social programs.   But it is a central theme of Jackson's own campaign, his promiseto raise taxes on the wealthy, that could cause the most discomfortfor Dukakis and party chieftains.   Although Dukakis commands a delegate majority, Jackson's24-percent share of delegates is large enough to force a floorfight on any platform issues he chooses.   Barnes told reporters that if Jackson seeks to bring a minorityreport to the convention floor in Atlanta favoring tax increases,``I can guarantee you it will be defeated.''   The platform drafting committee is led by a Jackson supporter,Rep. William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the HouseBudget Committee. Barnes also said a working paper that Kirkcommissioned by Theodore Sorensen, once John F. Kennedy'sspeechwriter, needed additional work.   Democratic officials declined to make Sorensen's paper publicThursday.   Kirk said, ``It is a very positive first step in the process,embracing all of the fundamental beliefs of our party.''   The party chief also said ``there is a reference to South Africaand terrorism'' in the paper, but did not elaborate.   ``I can't remember a time the party's been more unified. We havea tremendous opportunity. We see in our ranks common sense and asense of common purpose,'' said Kirk.   The full 186-member platform committee will not meet until June25-26 in Denver.   Blanchard, its chairman, said in a recent interview he does notexpect a finished product out of the deliberations on Mackinac, asylvan retreat where horse-drawn wagons, not cars, ply thelilac-lined roads.   ``I don't think we'll know what the platform really containsuntil we're at Atlanta, probably. But the sooner we can get a draftto everyone, the more time we provide for discussion, debate, thebetter off we'll be,'' Blanchard said.   ``I think it's going to be quite hard-hitting and progressive onthings like women's rights and civil rights and traditional thingsthat we all feel strongly about,'' said Blanchard, adding:   ``I would like a document that you could actually read at theDemocratic National Convention and people would listen to and stayawake for.''</TEXT></DOC>
