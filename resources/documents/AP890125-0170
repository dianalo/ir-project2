RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man whose flag-burning conviction in Texas isthe focus of a Supreme Court case on the limits of permissiblepublic protest said Wednesday that setting fire to the American flagis his idea of ``a thousand points of light.''   Gregory ``Joey'' Johnson, a member of the Revolutionary CommunistYouth Brigade, told a news conference the court case is anopportunity to examine the real meaning of the flag.   Around the world ``wherever people rise up ... quite often one ofthe first things they do is torch the red, white and blue,'' Johnsonsaid. ``Now that's what I call a thousand points of light.''   Johnson's sarcastic echo of one of President Bush's campaignthemes underscored the timely nature of the court dispute.   Bush, stressing patriotic values during his campaign, attackedDemocratic opponent Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts forvetoing legislation to require that Massachusetts public schoolteachers lead their classes in the Pledge of Allegiance.   The high court announced last October it will considerreinstating Johnson's flag-burning conviction that was overturned bya Texas appeals court. The state court said burning the flag was aform of symbolic expression protected by the Constitution.   The high court is expected to hear arguments in the case in Marchor April and announce a decision by July.   Johnson, 32, and living in New York City now, was sentenced to ayear in jail and fined $2,000 for his part in a demonstration duringthe 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas.   The protest culminated with a rally in front of Dallas City Hallin which demonstrators poured lighter fluid on an American flag andignited it.   Johnson said Wednesday he had no part directly in igniting theflag although he approved the action and gave speeches during therally.   He said he believed he was singled out for prosecution becausethe Dallas police knew he was a member in the RevolutionaryCommunist Youth Brigade.   The Center for Constitutional Rights, which is representingJohnson, filed a legal brief with the Supreme Court on Wednesdayurging it not to revive Johnson's conviction.   David Cole said the case ``seems to be a return to the 1960s''when protests against the war in Vietnam were reaching their peak.   He said the state of Texas ``is saying that it and it alone candefine the meaning of the flag and that it can prohibit privatecitizens acting in a political context from using even their ownflag for any purpose contrary to that defined by the state.''   The Texas law used to prosecute Johnson forbids ``the desecrationof a venerated object'' if that is likely to cause ``seriousoffense.''   Police officers who arrested Johnson said they were seriouslyoffended by the flag burning.   Cole said many states _ as well as the federal government _ havelaws against burning the flag, although it does not appear there aremany cases where the statutes have been enforced.   The Supreme Court in 1974 threw out the conviction of a collegestudent who taped a peace symbol onto a flag. The court in 1943ruled that the government may not compel citizens to salute theflag. But the justices never have decided whether laws againstdestruction of the flag are constitutional.</TEXT></DOC>
