If the jobs indirectly dependent on theindustry are added, there are more than 250,000 jobs dependent upon theTexas petrochemical industry. Energy costs are one of the fastest escalatingcosts a petrochemical producer faces. Fifteen years ago, energy costswere about one-half the amount of labor costs. Today they are more thantwice the industry's labor cost. This is true despite the vast stridesthe industry has made in conservation. Cogeneration is a key elementin helping the Texas petrochemical industry control its cost for steamand electricity and lower energy costs to help keep the Texas petrochemicalindustry competitive against the large volumes of petrochemicals nowbeing produced abroad; especially in the middle east.</TEXT></DOC>
