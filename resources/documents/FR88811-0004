Chlorendic anhydride, an organic chemical produced from hexachloropentadieneand maleic anhydride, is currently controlled for national security reasonsunder Export Control Commodity Number (ECCN) 5799C on the CCL. The chemicalnomenclature for chlorendic anhydride is 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7 hexachloro-5-norborene-2,3 dicarboxylic anhydride.In response to an exporter's petition, the Department of Commerce undertooka review of the rationale for the controls and decided to terminate thecontrol of chlorendic anhydride on the grounds that the availability ofthis chemical to controlled countries would no longer make a significantcontribution to the military potential of those countries. This decisionwas made in consultation with the Departments of Defense, Energy and Statepursuant to section 5(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended.This chemical remains subject to export controls to Country Groups S andZ for foreign policy reasons. To implement this decision, this chemicalis now being added to 15 CFR 399.2, Supp. No. 1, Interpretation 24, and,as a result, will be covered by ECCN 6799G.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Jim Seevaratnam, Capital GoodsTechnology Center, Bureau of Export Administration, (Telephone: (202) 377-5695).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared.2. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA)(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule also is exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruledoes not impose a new control. Further, no other law requires that a noticeof proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given forthis rule. 3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared. 4. This rule removes a burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980(44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>) by eliminating the requirement for a validated licenseto Country Groups Q, W, Y, the People's Republic of China, and Afghanistan.The reporting requirement for validated licenses has been approved by theOffice of Management and Budget under control number 0625-0001.5. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.Accordingly, it is being issued in final form. However, as with other Departmentof Commerce rules, comments from the public are always welcome.
