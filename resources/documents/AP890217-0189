Levine, the investment whiz turnedcrook whose squealings spawned Wall Street's insider tradingscandal, is briefing business school students about a subject heknows: white-collar crime.   Levine, paroled from a federal prison last year, told his storyof greed gone awry to about 90 rapt Columbia Business Schoolstudents Thursday in a tightly guarded and unpublicized session,people who attended said.   The visit to the prestigious school came against a background ofincreased emphasis on ethics by business educators, partly becauseof criminal behavior in the seductive high-stakes world ofsecurities and commodities trading.   Levine, who was not paid to speak at Columbia, traced hisinvolvement in a five-year scheme that turned $40,000 into $12.6million in illegal profits via his trades on illegally obtainedinformation about pending corporate takeovers.   ``He said it's very easy in such a heady exciting atmospheresimply to lose yourself in the enormously competitive race,'' saidColumbia professor James Kuhn, who teaches ethics and attended thespeech. ``He now realizes it was a major source of his downfall.''   Levine, 36, was paroled last September from a two-year prisonterm for securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury. He remains underthe supervision of federal probation authorities until April.   In a plea bargain with government prosecutors, Levine pleadedguilty to four felonies, was fined $362,000 and returned $11.6million in illegal profits.   The ex-investment banker, who worked at several investment firms,is best known for snitching on Ivan F. Boesky, the now-imprisonedinsider trader who himself made millions of dollars usinginformation supplied by Levine.   Both men are key figures in a corruption scandal that has doggedWall Street for nearly three years.   Levine's appearance at Columbia was endorsed by ethics expertsand former prosecutors, who said the theoretical approach bybusiness schools to social responsibility could use some real-lifelessons from financial felons.   Charles Carberry, a former assistant U.S. attorney who arrestedLevine in May 1986, said that as long as Levine isn't making moneyby peddling his life story on the campus lecture circuit, speakingwould be effective.   ``When you have close physical contact with someone who's reallygone through the ringer, all these penalties you read about take ona new reality,'' said Carberry, who is now in private practice.   ``I think he might be able to tell them things about hisexperience they may never be able to get out of a book,'' he said.   Levine would be permitted to profit on a book about hisexperiences under a New York law that prohibits only violentcriminals from exploiting their stories for money.   But he has kept a low profile since his release and is said to beoccupied with pending civil suits against him. Levine is permanentlybarred from working on Wall Street. His attorneys did not returntelephone calls Friday.   Another famous insider trader, former Wall Street Journalreporter R. Foster Winans, went on a speaking tour and wrote a bookafter he was convicted of securities fraud charges. Winans in 1983agreed to tip a broker about upcoming market-sensitive newspapercolumns in exhange for a cut of the broker's profits.   Columbia officials said Levine agreed to speak on a guarantee ofno publicity. The school deployed a public relations staffer in thelobby to keep at least one newspaper reporter away from Levine.   Levine was brought to campus by a student group called MORES _Managing Organizations Responsibly, Ethically and Successfully _with the approval of the dean. Only students in the group and twoethics classes could attend.   According to students who attended the speech, Levine praised theskill of government prosecutors and said he made naive and foolishmistakes but never clearly stated that the ordeal fundamentallyaltered his values.   Levine's remarks, they said, were more about law-breaking thanethics-making. Kuhn said students were ``quite skeptical of a manwho could get himself into these problems and not have greaterqualms about it.''   Levine spoke for about 20 minutes then answered questions formore than an hour. He was dressed in a dark suit like the investmentbanker he once was.   ``I told him privately he would have been much more effective ifhe came dressed in sackcloth and ashes,'' Kuhn said.</TEXT></DOC>
