Mathematicalmodels are developed to describe the transport of dissolved carbon dioxidein a liquid phase, and results of measurements of the diffusivity ofcarbon dioxide in hydrocarbons and water at reservoir conditions arereported. Diffusion coefficients were determined by fitting the mathematicalmodels to the observed motion of the interfaces. Measured diffusion coefficientsare reported for carbon dioxide in pentane, decane, hexadecane, and waterat 25{sup 0}C and pressures up to 6000 kPa. Correlations of diffusioncoefficients in liquids at atmospheric conditions are shown to give reasonableestimates of diffusion coefficients for carbon dioxide in fluids at reservoirconditions. Simple numerical models describing the swelling of oil bydirect contact with carbon dioxide and by diffusion of carbon dioxidethrough a blocking water phase at reservoir conditions are presented.The diffusion times calculated using the models are compared with thecorresponding times in laboratory micromodel and core flood experiments.The comparisons shows that diffusion plays a major role in the mobilizationand recovery of waterflood residual oil and that high unit or local displacementefficiencies are achieved when there is sufficient time for diffusionto significantly swell the oil. For the length scales normally associatedwith laboratory core floods, diffusion is shown to be sufficiently rapidto effectively reduce the adverse effects of bypassing on overall recoveryefficiency. This is not so for field floods where bypassing of oil byinjected carbon dioxide may be expected to occur on a much larger scale.</TEXT></DOC>
