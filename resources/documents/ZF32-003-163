 Some of the recent problemsinclude those pertaining to 32-bit cleanliness and Motorola 68040compatibility.andP;  Several years ago there was no need for thesorting out of compatibility issues by expert systems or questionsabout central processing units and memory management units.andP;  TheMacintosh is losing its critical advantage and buyers looking foruser-friendliness and simplicity are likely to look elsewhere.andO;IBM and Apple's future object-oriented operating system willhopefully be designed from scratch and will emulate the earlyMac's simplicity.andP;  In other news, a control panel called CacheOutthat switches the 68040's caches on and off automatically isavailable from the Zmac on-line service.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   Apple Macintosh (Microcomputer) (Usage)Apple Macintosh Quadra (Microcomputer) (Computer programs).andO;Topic:     Operating SystemsSystem CrashCompatibilitySystem DesignCache Memory.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Macintosh has gotten out of controlandM;There always have been bugs and problems in the Mac environment, but theexcessive complexity of today's systems is hurting even veteran Mac experts.andM;Ric FordandM;Issues andamp; TrendsandM;Losing control.andP;  There always have been growing pains and compatibilityproblems with the Macintosh, from the grossly inadequate memory and softwareof the 128K Mac to the bug-ridden System 6.0 release and the voodoo of SCSI.andO;Lately, we face problems of 68040 compatibility and 32-bit cleanliness.andM;What is disturbing is the increase in mysterious and intractable problems Iam hearing about in on-line discussions and in conversations with Macintoshexperts.andM;Crashes, freezes, trashed disks, unresolvable compatibility problems andrandom errors that cannot be reproduced by any reasonable sequence ofoperations -- the bugs and glitches and problems are affecting not just naiveusers, but experienced Macintosh consultants and technical-support veterans.andO;They are problems that often eat up days and weeks of people's time.andM;The Macintosh environment is out of control.andP;  No one is capable ofeffectively managing the infinite permutations of new hardware and softwarefrom Apple and other companies, system software versions, rapidly changingand bloating appeiandM;The price of power.andP;  The Mac has more power today than ever before, but ithas lost the essence of its original personality: simplicity.andP;  Remember whenthe Mac was truly easy to use?andP;  No questions about FPUs and MMUs and CPUs.andO;No ROM upgrades for expansion cards.andP;  No need for expert systems to sort outcompatibility issues.andP;  We have lost this critical advantage of the Mac, andit looks as if it will not be returning any time soon.andM;When consultants and corporations have just as much trouble managingMacintosh systems as Unix and DOS systems, Apple starts losing its primecompetitive edge, and buyers start looking more seriously at the otheroptions.andP;  Apple is touting the friendliness and simplicity it owned in 1990,but Mac users are struggling to make their 1991 systems work, while othercomputers are catching up.andM;The bottom line is that the next-generation Mac operating system -- theobject-oriented system known as Pink, now headed for Apple and IBM Corp.'sTaligent joint venture -- had better be designed from scratch with the samedevotion to &quot;elegant simplicity&quot; as the original Mac.andP;  It will depend almostcompletely on the people chosen for the new project, and they will have to bevery, very good to succeed.andP;  Any bets on the outcome?andM;PRODUCTSandM;CacheOut for Quadras.andP;  The new Macintosh Quadras are very fast computers, butonly when their 68040 caches are in full operation.andP;  Many widely usedprograms, however, are currently incompatible with the '040's defaultcopyback caching scheme, and when the caches are disabled via Apple's CacheSwitch control panel, the fast computer starts performing like an ordinaryMacintosh II.andP;  And with Apple's software, a restart is required to switchmodes.andM;Zmac, the on-line service of MacWEEK and MacUser magazine, contracted withprogrammer Fred Hollander to develop a better solution to the problem.andP;  It isa control panel called CacheOut, available for downloading exclusively fromZmac.andM;CacheOut automatically switches the 68040's caches on and off as you open andquit incompatible applications and desk accessories.andP;  These programs aredefined in a list in the control panel.andP;  On/off buttons enable and disableCacheOut itself, and an optional menu-bar icon shows the cache status.andM;With CacheOut 1.0, the current version at the time this was written, you mayneed to re-establish network connections after automatic cache switches.andO;Turning AppleTalk off and on again in the Chooser will do the trick.andM;New versions of CacheOut are being developed, and we welcome on-line feedbackabout its design.andM;The program is available fromA similar utility also has been released byAlysis Software Inc. of San Francisco.andP;  Alysis' Compatibility control paneldevice is available from on-line services for individual use, but a licenseis required for organizational use (see MacWEEK, Nov.andP;  11).andM;Both Compatibility and CacheOut are still going through design revisions, andthe two programs may differ in features and reliability.andM;Comments on MacInTouch are welcome at 7 Parmenter Ave., Maynard, Mass.andO;01754.andP;
