After that came the Bulgarian period. Food was imported from Bulgaria in dark, brown jars. We used the jars as glasses and we coined a new word. People would ask for 'a Bulgarian' of beer.&quot; Now, 11 years after independence, Angola has an operating glass factory.    These 11 years have been a grim struggle. Angola has a prospering oil industry producing annual revenue of $2 billion, but it doesn't have much else. At peace, this nation, larger than Texas and California combined but with only about nine million people, could be one of Africa's richest. But it has never had a chance.    A civil war begun before independence beggars Angola, consuming more than 45% of its expenditures. The war, pitting the Soviet-backed Marxist government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos against the U.S. and South African-backed rebels of Jonas Savimbi, appears stalemated, with everyone seemingly willing to fight to the last Angolan. Each side conscripts young men, and the government's manpower needs are so acute that it now drafts a high percentage of those most qualified to help the collapsing economy. For example, Chevron Corp.'s subsidiary here lost about half its group of Angolan trainees to the most recent semiannual call-up.    From a U.S. perspective, Angola's chief distinction is that it is one of the four governments (with Nicaragua, Afghanistan and Cambodia) that the U.S. openly seeks to overthrow. First the Ford administration and now the Reagan administration have described Angola as a vital battleground of superpower confrontation.    The Reagan administration, urged on by Republican conservatives such as Rep. Jack Kemp and former U.N. ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, decided last year to supply arms to Mr. Savimbi's anti-government forces. &quot;We cannot both proclaim our support for freedom and democracy and refuse to assist people who are fighting against totalitarian government and foreign Communist troops,&quot; Mr. Kemp says.    Yet such are the complications of Angola that while U.S. military aid helps keep the rebels fighting, U.S. food aid helps keep women and children alive on the government side.    In fact, aside from petroleum and human misery (it ranks second, behind Mozambique, on the Human Suffering Index of the Population Crisis Committee), Angola's growth industry is paradox.    Probably the best-known is that Cuban soldiers (the ones Washington says must be resisted) are protecting Chevron's Angolan subsidiary. Recently, Soviet military advisers are said to have been deployed near the port of Soyo as part of the security force for Western oil operations. But that is only one of the oddities in this broken-down country.    South African troops permanently occupy parts of southern Angola. This is justified by South Africa as a way to deter guerrilla attacks against its positions in Namibia, Angola's southern neighbor. The problem with this justification is that South Africa rules Namibia illegally in defiance of the United Nations and the policy of every major power, including the U.S. To defend occupying foreign territory on the ground that it helps protect illegally held territory &quot;is a little too complicated,&quot; says Richard Moose former assistant secretary of state for Africa.    There are other paradoxes. Guerrillas with South African-supplied arms attack diamond mines protected by, among others, hired South Africans. And American employees of Southern Air Transport, the airline once controlled by the Central Intelligence Agency, have been reported helping to resupply government troops despite Washington's declared support for Mr. Savimbi.    Not all the paradoxes are of recent vintage, as the example of Johnny Eduardo demonstrates. For 13 years, Mr. Eduardo was the head of foreign affairs for the Angolan faction that the CIA backed in the 1970s against both the faction that now rules and Mr. Savimbi's group.    Mr. Eduardo gave up his opposition to the government in 1984 and came home from exile. He has been rewarded with the directorship of a government company, and he says he expects the government will ask him to enter politics eventually. It seems appropriate to ask Mr. Eduardo whether he was compelled to embrace Marxism as part of his reconciliation with Angolan authorities.    &quot;Oh, I've been a Marxist since 1959,&quot; replies Mr. Eduardo. &quot;I'm no opportunist.&quot;    While Mr. Eduardo asserts he was a secret Marxist on the CIA payroll, the CIA's present favorite, Mr. Savimbi, is an ex-Maoist yet still professes socialism as one of the goals of his party. Way back in the 1960s when he called himself a Maoist, he once said: &quot;No progressive action is possible with men who serve American interests.&quot; He certainly no longer takes that view, but as recently as 1981 he said: &quot;If I am getting support from the U.S., it doesn't mean I support the U.S. I will get support where I can get it.&quot;    The Angolan government takes the same view. Although about 35,000 Cuban troops are in the country, Angolan officials make it clear they are eager to have diplomatic relations with the U.S. In interviews, Deputy Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura and Foreign Trade Minister Ismael Martins both stress Angola's desire to improve ties with Washington.    &quot;We are ready to dance,&quot; Mr. Martins says. &quot;Our young people like American rhythm and we would like to see our countries getting together more.&quot; He spreads his arms wide and adds: &quot;Let's dance.&quot;    U.S.-Angola talks resumed recently after being broken off in January 1986 when the Reagan administration decided to invite Mr. Savimbi to the White House. But the U.S. still demands the removal of the Cuban troops here, and Angola still thinks it needs them as insurance against another South African invasion.    Although Henry Kissinger, when he was secretary of state, said that &quot;there's no excuse for the Soviet-Cuban expeditionary forces in Angola,&quot; the Angolans had called for the Cubans in self-defense. At independence in 1975, South Africa, apparently with Mr. Kissinger's approval, invaded from Namibia, and its army was advancing rapidly toward the capital. Without the Cubans, there is little question that South Africa would have reached Luanda, the capital. As it was, the Cubans stopped the advance.    Now Washington says that arming Mr. Savimbi will pressure Luanda into sending the Cubans home. Mr. de Moura, the deputy foreign minister, thinks the U.S. policy doesn't make sense. &quot;If a man breaks into your house, do you take the lock off the door or do you reinforce your lock?&quot; he asks. The stronger Mr. Savimbi gets, the more Luanda depends on the Cubans, he says.    Despite the lack of U.S.-Angola relations and despite the war, almost all of Angola's oil trade is with the West and the U.S. is its single largest trading partner. One foreign resident points to yet another paradox: &quot;The Soviets encourage Angola's dealings with the West,&quot; he says. &quot;They want to make sure they get paid for their guns.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
