An emerging potentialexists for latitudinal and longitudinal chains of ionosondes to contributeuniquely to this thrust in ways complementary to the capabilities andshortcomings of other groundbased sensors and satellites. Here is illustrateda methodology to realize the fullest potential of such ionosonde data.Hourly values are fit in latitude using Legendre polynominals, and variationsfrom quiet time values are displayed in latitude - U.T. coordinates usinga color graphics method which provides an illuminating illustration ofthe penetration of ionospheric disturbances in latitude and their dependenceon Kp, storm time, and local time. Observed effects are interpreted interms of plausible electric field, neutral wind, and neutral compositionchanges during the storm period. Besides reflecting the anticipated southwardflows and equatorward extensions in conjunction with magnetically disturbedconditions, the 24-hour average meridional winds exhibit a northwardreturn flow after the magnetic disturbance has relaxed.</TEXT></DOC>
