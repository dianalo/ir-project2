Hundreds of spectators gathered on the South Superhighwayoverpass as three T-28 aircraft and a Sikorsky helicopter bombardedthe palace. As the aircraft fired, people cheered.   ``Wow! That was a great shot,'' said cigarette vendor JulioTorres, pointing toward the palace. ``But it would really be betterif there could be a dogfight later on, just like in the movies.''   Hours later, Philippine air force F-5 jets chased the renegadeaircraft out of the Manila area and destroyed some on the ground atan air station in Sangley Point in Cavite province, just acrossManila Bay.   In the afternoon, American warplanes helped patrol the skiesover the capital, with President Bush's approval, to help PresidentCorazon Aquino's government the sixth attempted coup.

Singh, who plans to establish a garment factory in thePhilippines, said, ``I don't think the coup will affect foreigninvestments, if the government acts swiftly.''
