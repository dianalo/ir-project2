Erburu said.    Mr. Erburu said that the improved earnings will include gains from the sales of timberland. He said declines in profits in newspapers and television have been balanced by strong performances in other groups, including professional publishing and cable television.    For 1987, the Los Angeles-based company earned $266.5 million, or $2.06 a share, on revenue of $3.15 billion.    The chairman said the company's newspaper publishing group continues to see some softness in advertising volume but that total newspaper revenue is &quot;running solidly ahead of last year.&quot; However, the gains have been offset by cost increases, particularly newsprint expense, which rose 22% in the first quarter, he said.    The company's cable television group is expected to see &quot;double digit&quot; growth in revenue, profit and cash flow. Broadcast television markets &quot;are not such a happy story,&quot; Mr. Erburu said. </TEXT></DOC>
