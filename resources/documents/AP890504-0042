The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision that the Armyerred when it denied him re-enlistment was a ``wonderful ruling,''said the 14-year veteran, who is now working as a U.S. ForestService clerk in Seattle.   Civil rights lawyers who supported his case said the ruling wasimportant despite its limited scope.   ``It is not a sweeping constitutional decision, but it is afirst step that recognizes the value of the services of openly gaysoldiers,'' said Nan Hunter of the American Civil Liberties Union'sLesbian and Gay Rights Project, which helped Watkins.   Lt. Col. Greg Rixon, an Army spokesman, declined to comment onthe ruling, but said there had been several other cases that havesupported the ban against homosexuals from military service. Hesaid any decision concerning an appeal would be made by thesolicitor general, the Justice Department's top litigator, who hasnot reviewed the ruling.   If the Army doesn't appeal Wednesday's ruling, Watkins said hewould like to re-enlist.   The court ruled in Watkins' favor on narrow grounds, saying hewas entitled to reinstatement because the Army was aware of hishomosexuality when he had previously re-enlisted.   Watkins, of Tacoma, ``has greatly benefited the Army, andtherefore the country, by his military service,'' said Judge HarryPregerson in the majority opinion.   But Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall said the Army never promisedWatkins an indefinite exemption from its ban. She also said a courtruling prohibiting a service branch from applying one of itsregulations would have ``a disruptive effect on militarydiscipline.''   Seven of the 11 judges voted in Watkins' favor, but only twoaddressed the constitutional issue that a smaller panel of thecourt had cited in a now-withdrawn February 1988 decision.   That ruling was the first by any federal appeals court todeclare that homosexuals, because of longstanding persecution andpolitical powerlessness, were entitled to be protected againstdiscrimination to the same degree as racial minorities. Bysidestepping that issue Wednesday, the court left it unresolved.   In Wednesday's decision, the court said it would be unjust toallow the Army to enforce its anti-homosexual policy againstWatkins because he said he was a homosexual when he was drafted in1967 and had been drafted and allowed to re-enlist three timeswhile the policy was in effect. After two tours of duty in Korea,he became supervisor of the Fort Lewis, Wash., personneladministration center.   Defense Department regulations prohibited the enlistment orre-enlistment of homosexuals throughout that period. Newregulations were added in 1981 to require the discharge of soldierswhose homosexual conduct was discovered while they were in themilitary.   After a federal judge stopped the Army from discharging Watkins,he was denied re-enlistment in 1982.   U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein ordered Watkinsreinstated, on grounds identical to Wednesday's ruling, but wasreversed in 1983 by the appeals court, leading to Watkins'discharge the following year.</TEXT></DOC>
