They exhibit the expected exponentialdecay behaviour and satisfy approximately the classical equations ofmotion. Vortex-antivortex superpositions are seen as well, supportingthe dilute gas picture. Single vortices finally relax into ''dislocations''and dissapear. A background charge construction turns out nearly insensitivewith respect to dislocations. 22 refs.; 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
