Six hundred residents from the village of Dersingham marched 1{miles on Monday to Queen Elizabeth II's Sandringham estate inNorfolk to demand that work begin on the bypass, which they firstcalled for 25 years ago.   After pressure from conservationists, environment secretaryNicholas Ridley said he would consider revoking planning permissionfor the bypass, which would cut through a bog on the royal estatethat is home to the moth.   A group called the Nature Conservancy Council said the roadcould wipe out the moth, Choristoneura Lafauryana, by destroyingthe bog where it breeds.   But the demonstrators doubt there are any moths left.   ``A big survey by the Nature Conservancy Council led to nothing_ they couldn't even find the damn moth,'' said one marcher, JamesCrowe.</TEXT></DOC>
