Francaise des Petroles said it signeda letter of intent with National Iranian Oil Co. coveringoffshore oil-field development and the marketing of &quot;animportant quantity of Iranian oil.&quot;   Terms of the preliminary agreement weren't disclosed.</LP><TEXT>   The French state-controlled group added that it and theIranian company also were considering the feasibility of aliquefied natural gas development project in Iran. Total saidthe two groups also discussed the arrangement of necessaryfinancing by a consortium of banks for the development andmarketing operations.   Total said the letter of intent reflected its strategy ofcreating &quot;new types of relationships&quot; with producercountries, exemplified by its joint efforts with Algerian andQatari national hydrocarbons companies.   The letter was signed with Wednesday's date, in thecontext of an international oil conference going on inIsfahan, Iran. During the conference, Iran had said it waslooking for investment agreements with Western oil companiesto help the country boost its oil and gas output. Tehran,which has been trying to end its economic and diplomaticisolation, has said that without outside assistance it maynot be able to reach its 1993 goal of boosting oil capacityto five million barrels a day from the current 3.5 millionbarrels a day.   At present, foreign companies are involved in the Iranianoil sector only through service or construction contracts.   Oil-industry sources earlier this week said that Iran wasnegotiating with a number of Western oil concerns, includingChevron Corp., although officials of the U.S. company deniedany talks were in progress.   Chevron Corp. announced that company representatives inIran are discussing the possibility of purchasing crude oilfrom the National Iranian Oil Co. &quot;The Iranians areinterested in selling oil, and Chevron is interested inbuying Iranian oil,&quot; said a spokeswoman for the petroleumconcern in San Francisco. &quot;We are certainly closer to anagreement than we were a few days ago. We don't have a firmcommitment at this time, but we hope to shortly.&quot;   In 1987, the U.S. banned the importation of Iranian oil,but in late 1989, the ban was partially lifted. Now, U.S.companies may purchase Iranian crude as long as speciallicenses are received and payment is made into a specialescrow account in The Hague, the Netherlands, to settle U.S.and Iranian claims.   &quot;We have had relations with Iran in the past, and we lookforward to renewing those as conditions permit,&quot; thespokeswoman added. As early as 1953, Chevron -- then SoCal --was part of an Iranian oil consortium, which continued tooperate until 1972, when the Iranian oil industry wasnationalized.   The spokeswoman reiterated that Chevron isn't involved inany discussions regarding the development of offshore Iranianoil fields.   A Total spokesman said details of the letter of intent,such as the offshore fields covered and the amount of Iranianoil to be marketed by Total, won't be available until a moredefinitive accord is reached, which should be quite soon.   The spokesman said the Total link with the Iranian concernrepresented an opportunity to relaunch the French group'sactive participation in Iran, which was stalled in 1979following the Islamic revolution and the beginning of the warwith Iraq. &quot;We were a major partner in Iran prior to thatdate, and we stayed in discreet contact with NationalIranian in the meantime,&quot; he said.   On Wednesday, Total said it signed a major contract inQatar to develop natural gas reserves in the North Field.Yesterday, Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, another Frenchoil company, announced a similar contract with the Qatarigovernment.</TEXT></DOC>
