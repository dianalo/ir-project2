KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Interstate Commerce Commission votedunanimously Tuesday to ban smoking on all regularly scheduledinterstate buses in the United States.   Bus companies were given the option of allowing charterpassengers to smoke if the chartering group agrees it should bepermitted.   The ban will take effect soon after the issuance of thecommission's decision in writing and its publication in the FederalRegister, according to ICC spokesman A. Dennis Watson.   Lawyers for the ICC said the change was supported by a widevariety of groups but was opposed by the tobacco industry.   John Banzhaf, executive director of Action on Smoking andHealth, the organization whose request initiated the ICC action,praised the decision.   ``Smokers can refrain from smoking for several hours and lightup at bus stops, but non-smokers cannot similarly refrain frombreathing,'' Banzhaf said.   The ICC lawyers contended that smoking has been proved to beinjurious to health and that tobacco smoke cannot be adequatelyventilated from buses to assure the health and comfort ofnon-smokers.   The commission began its consideration of a smoking ban lastMarch at the request of the American Bus Association and United BusOwners of America, the national trade associations for theintercity bus business.   In April, Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), an anti-smokingassociation, filed a similar request but asked that it be imposedon all buses, including charters.   Officials for the bus industry contended that operators ofcharter buses should be permitted to regulate smoking based ontheir passengers' desires.   The commission lawyers said officials of the nation's charterbus industry said they feared some business would be lost i theywere compelled to enforce a uniform non-smoking ban.   The ICC no-smoking rule affects passengers served by about 300bus companies that provide service on interstate routes. In 1990,these companies are expected to serve some 24 million passengers.   Greyhound, the nation's largest bus company, banned smoking onits own initiative shortly after the ICC began considering theissue.   As the regulatory process unfolded this year, ASH contended thatbus passengers are entitled to the same protection from tobaccosmoke in the air as those who travel by plane and train.   It noted that Amtrak recently banned smoking in the last fourrows of its Superliner lounge cars and in most of its trainstations. There are still smoking cars on trains.   Smoking is banned on almost all domestic airline flights. Theonly exceptions are flights to Alaska and Hawaii, each lasting morethan six hours. Overseas flights are not affected.   ASH said that a recent study of air quality in airline passengercabins showed that as many as 440 non-smokers a year would die ofcancer if smokers were to continue to light up aboard flightslasting two hours or longer.   The anti-smoking group said bus passengers would be at evenhigher risk if smoking were to continue.   It said the smaller seating capacity of buses forces non-smokingpassengers to be seated closer to smokers than on planes. It alsosaid ventilation on buses often is inferior to that on airplanes.And it said buses are often the only affordable means oflong-distance transportation for the poor and elderly.   The bus trade associations also cited the health issue, but theycontended a clear federal prohibition would also eliminate anymisunderstanding in the effort of individual bus companies toenforce limitations on smoking.   They said the current rule limiting smoking to no more than 30percent of bus seats is hard to enforce and that efforts by somecompanies to ban smoking could place them at a disadvantage ifcompetitors advertised that smoking was permitted.   The tobacco industry contended that health hazards posed tonon-smokers on interstate buses are not proved.</TEXT></DOC>
