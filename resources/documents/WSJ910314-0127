The transaction is Union Texas Petroleum's first since thecompany took its entire operations off the block in December,following seven months of failed sales efforts. TheHouston-based oil company continued, however, to offer itsonshore and offshore U.S. properties for sale.</LP><TEXT>   For Nerco, the 82%-owned energy and mining subsidiary ofPacifiCorp, the planned purchase is part of a major plan toboost the company's oil and gas operations, adding to morethan $600 million invested in the business over the past fouryears.   Nerco said it planned to finance the acquisition initiallywith a revolving credit facility through a group of banks ledby Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York. Nerco said it plansa $150 million sale of common stock to retire part of thedebt. PacifiCorp, a Portland, Ore., electrical and telephoneutility, is expected to buy enough stock to keep its 82%stake.   Major credit rating companies were divided in their viewof the financial effect on Nerco. Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.said it affirmed its ratings on Nerco's unsecured debt andcommercial paper, although it said financial leverage wouldbe increased. Moody's Investors Service Inc., however, putNerco securities, as well as those of a PacifiCorp financialunit, under review for possible downgrade.   According to Nerco, Union Texas Petroleum's Gulf of Mexicooperations include proven reserves of about 315 billion cubicfeet of natural gas and oil. Nerco's own reserves total about507 billion cubic feet of natural gas and oil. Union Texasreported a slightly different figure of 295 billion cubicfeet of gas and 6.2 million barrels of oil for provenreserves-equivalent to a total of about 332 billion cubicfeet at standard industry rates for conversion.   In addition, Nerco said there are an estimated 184 billioncubic feet of gas and oil of probable and possible reserves.   Using either number for established reserves, analystssaid the $475 million price is high. Allowing about $25million for exploration acreage in the package, the priceworks out to about $1.34 per thousand cubic feet in theground, said Peter Hunsberger, director of research for JohnS. Herold Inc., which specializes in appraising petroleumproperties.   &quot;That's a startlingly high price for {natural} gas in theground, particularly given the current weakness of gasprices,&quot; Mr. Hunsberger said, adding that &quot;it looks as thoughUnion Texas made out very well in this deal.&quot;   Nerco officials emphasized that the properties, which willdouble the company's 200 million cubic feet of daily gasoutput, are in many cases close to existing Nerco propertiesand thus offer prospective operating economies in addition toattractive exploration potential. As well, Nerco is known tohave been looking for an established exploration department,which it will acquire with the purchase.   Union Texas Petroleum, which is 40%-owned by the leveragedbuy-out specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. and 40% byAllied-Signal Inc., with the remainder in public hands, willretain its large foreign holdings and apparently willcontinue efforts to sell its U.S. onshore holdings, whichanalysts say aren't as marketable as the Gulf of Mexicooperations.</TEXT></DOC>
