Sled dogs on the Arctic island died of distemper early in 1988and the first discoveries of swollen, dead seals were reported inApril in Denmark.   Western European experts said earlier this week the CanineDistemper Virus (CDV) or a similar one killed the seals.   ``We knew that Greenland was ravished by the distemper diseasein March,'' TT quoted seal expert Berndt Klingeborn as saying. ``Wefirst thought that the seals had contaminated the dogs, but afterhearing that the carcasses were thrown into the water it appears tobe the other way around.''   Thousands of seals migrate from Greenland to Western Europeanwaters each year in search of food.   Distemper virus causes infections of the respiratory and centralnervous systems and digestive tracts in both dogs and seals.   Greenland officials have said the virus was brought to Greenlandby foxes, ravens and possibly polar bears across the frozen BaffinBay from the Canadian Arctic, where distemper was reported inOctober.   Seal experts say up to 80 percent of the seals in affectedwaters will die but those remaining population will be immune tothe disease.   The virus has been most devastating off Scandinavia, with 3,400seals dead in Sweden and almost 3,000 in Denmark. About 3,900others died off West Germany, 600 in Norwegian waters and 175 offthe Netherlands.</TEXT></DOC>
