<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-79-0579 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Jet Drift Chamber employs a charge division readout scheme which requirestwo amplifiers per sense wire. Since there are 690 sense wires, 1380amplifiers are needed. It follows that each end cap must accommodate690 amplifiers which makes packaging and cooling critical problems. Asa result, 30 six-layer surface mount boards each containing 24 (23 used)channels of amplifiers have been made. Each amplifier could accept upto 2 pC of charge and could provide a linear differential output of {+-}300 mV which is used to drive a twisted pair transmission line up to70' in length. The power dissipation of each board is 1.5 W. 4 refs.,7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
