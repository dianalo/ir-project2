Stafford, well over $2 million, in a compensation package that includes a lifetime retirement benefit.    The company also agreed to pay Mr. Stafford's successor, Philip L. Smith, at least $1 million in his first year. The former chief executive of General Foods Corp. will be paid an initial base salary of $625,000 a year, plus a minimum of $375,000 in management incentives for the year ending May 31.    Pillsbury made the disclosures in a proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It said Mr. Stafford, who stepped down Feb. 29, will be paid $74,375 a month for 24 months, or $1,785,000, &quot;in recognition of his office, contributions and years of service.&quot;    Mr. Stafford, who was paid $594,351 in fiscal 1988, also will receive a retirement benefit the company estimates would range from $30,000 to $56,000 a year for life. Mr. Stafford is 50 years old.    The statement also disclosed that J. Jeffrey Campbell, an executive vice president who had headed Pillsbury's flagging restaurant operations, will receive $45,000 a month for up to two years, or until he finds another job. If that occurs before July 1990, Mr. Campbell would be paid a lump sum settlement equal to one-half the remaining monthly payments.    Like Mr. Stafford, Mr. Campbell would be reimbursed for employment search expenses, including office space and secretarial services, plus benefits including medical, dental, term life insurance, a company car, club membership and financial and tax counseling.    In fiscal 1988, Mr. Campbell was paid $467,198 as chairman of Pillsbury's restaurant group, which includes Burger King, Steak andamp; Ale and Bennigan's. Although the restaurant group had sales slumps and required large write-offs this past year, Mr. Campbell got a $27,776 raise during his last year with the company. His salary the previous year was $439,422.    Neither Mr. Stafford nor Mr. Campbell could be reached for comment.    Messrs. Stafford and Campbell were held responsible by Pillsbury directors for a series of management blunders that led to a 62% earnings drop, huge write-offs and a major restructuring of the packaged foods and restaurants concern.    William H. Spoor, who came out of retirement to run the company while the search for the new chief executive was under way, was paid $75,000 a month, the statement discloses. Pillsbury's board also may pay him added cash compensation, including an incentive payment based on performance, plus a special bonus award and an amount equal to the market value of an additional undisclosed number of shares of company stock. </TEXT></DOC>
