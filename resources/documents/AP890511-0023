Thousands of undocumented aliens who do not qualify for amnestyare ``being forced into a fearful underground and impoverishedexistence,'' said Muriel Heiberger, executive director of theMassachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.   The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 act allowedundocumented aliens who could show they entered the United Statesbefore 1982 to apply for amnesty and prohibited employers fromhiring undocumented aliens.   But witnesses told the House Judiciary subcommittee onimmigration, refugees and international law the law has left manyharshly exploited and with nowhere to turn.   ``As the undocumented are forced further underground, theimmigration law is creating everything it was supposed to eliminate_ a vulnerable underclass, living in the shadows of ourcommunities, facing increased poverty and exploitation,'' Ms.Heiberger testified.   Unscrupulous employers ``often exploit undocumented workersfearful of reporting subminimum wages, sexual harassment and unsafeworking conditions,'' she said.   Muzaffar A. Chishti, director of the Immigration Project for theInternational Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, said the law has hada deep impact on the so-called ``sweatshop sector.'' Employers are``finding it easier to exploit these workers and further depresswages and working conditions,'' she said.   INS spokesman Verne Jervis countered that those who don'tqualify for amnesty do not have to remain in the United States.   Jervis said the law was not intended ``to benefit the mostrecent arrivals. ... The law is doing what it intended to do'' bykeeping undocumented aliens out of the work force.   Cecilia Munoz of the National Council of La Raza testified thatspouses and children of legalized family members have haddeportation proceedings initiated against them in Chicago, Dallas,Oklahoma City, Albuquerque, San Antonio and elsewhere.   Jervis called that charge ``ridiculous.''</TEXT></DOC>
