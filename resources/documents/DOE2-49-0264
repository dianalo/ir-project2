Threespecific sites in the Seattle area were studied. A life-cycle costingapproach was used. The main result of the study was that (for the threelocations studied) the construction of HOV lanes was the most cost-effectivealternative. The marginal net present value of each of the projects waspositive (on the order of $50 to $600 per commuter per year, dependingon the specific comparison). The marginal benefit/cost ratio was greaterthan six for all cases. These findings showed that the three projectsunder consideration are very cost effective and should remain in placeas HOV lanes. The methodology developed for the study was incorporatedinto an easy-to-use computer program that assesses the cost-effectivenessof the construction of HOV lanes in other locations.</TEXT></DOC>
