The decline may continue over the next few days, analysts said. The futures, though, will resume their rally once the correction has run its course, and the dollar will turn downward, they maintained.    Treasury bond futures prices also dropped. Traders feared that the prime rate increase was a harbinger of widespread interest rate increases and rekindled inflation.    In comments apparently aimed at calming the markets, Treasury Secretary James Baker told a House panel that he hoped the prime rate increase would be &quot;a temporary blip upward&quot; that wouldn't have a major impact on the economy.    A parade of banks boosted their prime rates yesterday following Citibank's and Chase Manhattan Bank's moves late Tuesday afternoon, after the foreign currency futures and bond futures markets closed. The prime rate had stood at 7 1/2% since August.    &quot;This is a correction rather than a trend reversal&quot; in foreign currency futures prices, said Anne Mills, futures analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. &quot;Just because U.S. banks are raising their prime rates doesn't mean that U.S. rates on balance will go higher,&quot; she said.    Yen futures for June delivery fell 0.0054 cent to close at 0.6839 cent, just slightly above the contract's low of the day. Yen futures would receive support from technical chart-following traders at about 0.6800 cent, Ms. Mills said.    June futures on West German marks plunged 0.70 cent to close at 55.02 cents. Technical support is likely to surface at 54.40 cents to 54.65 cents, Ms. Mills said.    Adding to the decline yesterday was the fact that &quot;currencies may have been a little overbought&quot; following the rally in recent weeks, said Michael Ptack, futures trader at Gartman Financial Services Inc. in Portsmouth, Va.    In other futures markets yesterday:    COTTON: Futures rose following a smaller than expected planting-intentions forecast by the government. Late selling trimmed advances that peaked at about 1.5 cents a pound. Cotton for May delivery on the New York Cotton Exchange climbed 0.89 cent per pound to settle at 57.94 cents. After Tuesday's close of trading, the Agriculture Department released its estimate that U.S. cotton plantings for the season beginning Aug. 1 will total more than 10,354,000 acres, compared with final planted acreage of about 10 million in the current season. The forecast was around the lower end of expectations, which ranged between 10.4 million and 10.9 million acres, analysts said. The goverment forecast suggests that next season's crop could total between 11.2 million and 12 million bales, compared with about 10 million for the current season, which suffered from drought and then excess rains, said Judy Weissman, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. If the government planting estimate proves correct, and yields next season average between 560 pounds to 600 pounds per harvested acre, output might trail demand, Miss Weissman said. That would reduce cotton stockpiles for the second consecutive year, she said. At the start of the current season, they stood at 9.4 million bales. By the end of the season, they are expected to have dropped almost four million bales. If the current strong demand for cotton continues, stockpiles might decline a further one million bales by July 31, 1988, Miss Weissman said.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Pork belly futures were down. Some fell their daily limit of $2 per hundredweight, or 2 cents a pound. Analysts attributed the drop to an expected increase in slaughter next week and the bearish Agriculture Department hog and pig report. Released Tuesday after trading's close, the report said the total hog population rose 3% to 39.2 million from 38.2 million a year ago. That will increase the number of hogs available for slaughter during the summer months, when belly demand is high. Before the report, traders expected tight summer supplies. Cattle rose. Traders expect last week's snowstorms to keep slowing movement of cattle to slaughter, analysts said.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybeans rallied on an Agriculture Department report that predicted a 7% decline in soybean-planted acreage from last year. At 56.9 million acres, the department's figure was on the low side of market expectations, analysts said. An increase in farmer selling and the use of generic certificates, which can be redeemed for governmentheld grain, helped push corn lower, analysts said. Wheat also was down. </TEXT></DOC>
