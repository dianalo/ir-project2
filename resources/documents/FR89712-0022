The rule also requiresthat asbestos-containing products that are subject to this rule be labeledto facilitate compliance with and enforcement of the rule.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average less than 2 hours annually per firm over the 3-year period reviewedfor the analysis of regulatory burden. This burden estimate includes thetime for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information. This estimate of annual burden is a relatively low figurebecause of the small number of firms affected by the regulatory actionstaken during the period reviewed for the analysis of regulatory burden.Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Authority</ITAG>Section 6(a) of TSCA authorizes EPA to impose certain regulatory requirementson activities involving a chemical substance or mixture if EPA finds thatthere is a reasonable basis to conclude that the manufacture, processing,distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical substance, orany combination of such activities, presents or will present an unreasonablerisk of injury to human health or the environment. Section 6(a)(1) authorizesEPA to prohibit or limit the manufacture, processing, or distribution incommerce of substances or mixtures if EPA finds that these activities posean unreasonable risk. Section 6(a)(2) authorizes EPA to prohibit or limitsuch activities for a particular use of such substances or mixtures. Section6(a)(3) authorizes EPA to require labels for such substances or mixtures.Sections 6 and 8(a) authorize EPA to require the maintenance of recordsrelated to enforcement of EPA actions under section 6. These sections ofTSCA provide EPA the authority to issue this rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. TSCA Actions to Date</ITAG>EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of October 17, 1979 (44 FR 60061), announcingits intent to explore the use of section 6 of TSCA to reduce the risk tohuman health posed by exposure to asbestos. EPA then issued a reportingrule under section 8(a) of TSCA in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 30, 1982 (47 FR 33207, 40 CFR 763.60),to collect information on industrial and commercial uses of asbestos. Informationcollected under that rule, as well as analyses developed by EPA and otherorganizations, were evaluated and used to support a proposed rule, publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of January 29, 1986 (51 FR 3738).In the proposed rule EPA found that exposure to asbestos poses an unreasonablerisk to human health and discussed regulatory options for prohibiting orrestricting the mining and importation of bulk asbestos and the manufacturing,importation, and processing of asbestos-containing products as means ofreducing the risk. The following options were discussed in the proposedrule:1. Two options involving bans of some products soon after promulgationof the final rule and a phase out of others over 10 years by means of apermit system for asbestos use.2. A 2-stage ban, with the first ban, on asbestos construction productsand clothing, to begin soon after promulgation of the final rule and thesecond ban, on friction products, to begin in 5 years, and after promulgationof the final rule, the collection of additional data on other products.3. A 3-stage ban on all asbestos products to begin soon after the promulgationof the final rule, and 5 years and 10 years after promulgation.Requiring labeling of asbestos-containing products was also discussed.EPA received over 200 comments in response to the proposed rule.Prior to issuing the proposal, EPA received and granted two TSCA section21 petitions (15 U.S.C. 2620). Under section 21 of TSCA, a person may petitionEPA to initiate a proceeding for the issuance of a rule under various sectionsof TSCA. One petition requested the prohibition of the future use of asbestosin asbestos-cement pipe; this petition was granted in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of October 18, 1979 (44 FR 60155). The otherpetition requested the prohibition of the future use of asbestos in motorvehicle brakes; this petition was granted in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of December 18, 1984 (49 FR 49311). In grantingthese peititions, EPA stated that it would, as part of the rulemaking proceedingand the final rule, consider including prohibitions of the future use ofasbestos in asbestos-cement pipe and in motor vehicle brakes. Both usesare prohibited by this final rule.Pursuant to section 6(c)(2) of TSCA, EPA also provided interested partiesopportunities to participate in a legislative hearing on the proposed rulein July 1986, and in extensive cross-examination of EPA personnel and contractorson factual issues relating to the rule in October 1986.Since the end of cross-examination in October 1986, EPA has updated thedata collections and regulatory analyses used to support the findings onwhich this rule is based. EPA believes that adequate data and analysesexisted in the rulemaking record for the proposal to support the optionsdiscussed therein. The data collections and analyses were updated due tothe passage of time since the publication of the proposal and in responseto specific public comments that the data base supporting the proposedrule, gathered largely in 1982, was outdated.EPA has gathered updated data relating to: (1) Asbestos consumption, (2)manufacturing, import, and processing volumes of asbestos-containing products,(3) trends in the development of non-asbestos substitutes, (4) costs ofcapital conversion to the production of non-asbestos products, (5) production,processing, use, and disposal practices for asbestos-containing products,and (6) occupational and non-occupational release and exposure from themanufacture, processing, installation, use, repair, removal, and disposalof asbestos-containing products. These data were derived from, among othersources, the 1987 EPA Asbestos Exposure survey, the 1987 EPA Asbestos Marketsurvey, and 1987 Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) compliancedata. EPA has also modified and updated its Asbestos Regulatory Cost Model(ARCM), Health Benefits Model, and asbestos exposure models which wereused to evaluate the costs and benefits of various regulatory options.Additionally, EPA has furthered its analysis of the availability and possiblehazards posed by asbestos substitutes.These updated data and analyses were reflected in documents released forpublic comment in notices published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of April 1, 1988 (53 FR 10546), and May 4, 1988(53 FR 15857). EPA received over 40 public comments in response to thesenotices. In addition, EPA allowed further cross-examination of EPA personneland contractors on factual issues related to the updated analytical database in September 1988. The materials released for public comment containthe technical basis for the actions taken in this final rule. EPA affordedthe opportunity for public comment on the updated documents and for furthercross-examination as an exercise of its discretion and as a means of ensuringthat any remaining disputed issues of material fact in the updated dataand analyses could be identified and resolved before promulgation of thisfinal rule. EPA has reviewed the comments received and the testimony elicitedand has updated the record accordingly.Pursuant to its procedural rules at 40 CFR 750.4(b), EPA also announcedto interested parties in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 16, 1988 (53 FR 36227), the opportunityto provide EPA with reply comments relating to the rulemaking proceeding.EPA received reply comments from three commenters.The record which serves as the basis for the actions taken in this ruleconsists of over 45,000 pages of analyses, comments, testimony, correspondence,and other materials. The record for this rule also incorporates by referencethe extensive record developed by OSHA in its rulemaking to lower its PermissibleExposure Level (PEL) for asbestos, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of June 20, 1986 (51 FR 22612). EPA has fullyconsidered these materials in developing this final rule. In addition,all significant testimony or public comments made on the proposed rule,in conjunction with the legislative hearing, cross-examination hearing,or reply comments, or in response to the materials announced in the Apriland May 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices, cited above, were considered in thedevelopment of the final rule. EPA's responses to all significant commentsare found either in this preamble or in a separate Response to Commentsdocument that is available in the Public Docket (Ref. 40).Based on the numerous detailed analyses performed by EPA in support ofthis rule and after careful consideration of the extensive public commentsreceived, EPA has concluded that the continued commercial manufacture,import, processing, and distribution in commerce of the products identifiedin this rule poses an unreasonable risk of injury to human health undersection 6 of TSCA.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Provisions of the Rule</ITAG>A. General ProvisionsConsistent with an option described in the proposal, this rule imposesa 3-stage ban on the manufacture, importation, processing, and distributionin commerce of various asbestos-containing products. The rule also containsa requirement that products subject to a manufacture, importation, andprocessing ban, but not yet subject to a ban on distribution in commerce,be labeled in the manner described at andSection;763.171. In addition, therule includes procedures for requesting an exemption from the rule's provisions.The effective dates of the various bans are as follows (with exceptionsas noted in Unit III.B of this preamble for some asbestos friction products):<ITAG tagnum="16">Manufacture, Import, and Processing Ban:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Stage 1_August 27, 1990</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Stage 2_August 25, 1993</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Stage 3_August 26, 1996</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Distribution in Commerce Ban:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Stage 1_August 25, 1992</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Stage 2_August 25, 1994</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Stage 3_August 25, 1997</ITAG>B. Manufacture, Importation, and ProcessingBansAs of the dates indicated below, the manufacture, importation, and processingof all asbestos-containing products within the categories listed must ceaseas follows for each stage:<T3>Stage 1:</T3> Manufacture, importation, and processing of the followingproducts must cease by August 27, 1990:<ITAG tagnum="15">Flooring Felt</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Roofing Felt</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Pipeline Wrap</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Asbestos/Cement (A/C) Flat Sheet</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">A/C Corrugated Sheet</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Vinyl/Asbestos Floor Tile</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Asbestos Clothing</ITAG><T3>Stage 2: </T3>Manufacture, importation, and processing of the followingproducts must cease by August 25, 1993:<ITAG tagnum="15">Beater-Add Gaskets (except specialty industrial gaskets)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Sheet Gaskets (except specialty industrial gaskets)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Clutch Facings</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Automatic Transmission Components</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Commercial and Industrial Friction Products</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Drum Brake Linings [Original Equipment Market (OEM)] \1\</ITAG><NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ These bans affect products used as original equipmentin vehicles introduced in the 1994 model year. For example, if new modelyear products are introduced annually by a producer in October, asbestosbrake products may be used in vehicles made by that producer before theintroduction of model year 1994 vehicles in October 1993, but not thereafter.In addition, products manufactured, imported, or marketed for use as aftermarketreplacement parts for brake systems designed to use non-asbestos brakepads and drums are banned from manufacture, importation, and processingas of August 25, 1993.<ITAG tagnum="15">Disc Brake Pads for Light- and Medium-weight Vehicles (LMV) (OEM)\1\</ITAG><T3>State 3: </T3>Manufacture, importation, and processing of the followingproducts must cease by August 26, 1996:<ITAG tagnum="15">A/C Pipe</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Commercial Paper</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Corrugated Paper</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Rollboard</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Millboard</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">A/C Shingle</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Specialty Paper</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Roof Coatings</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Non-Roof Coatings</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Brake Blocks</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Drum Brake Linings [Aftermarket (AM)]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Disc Brake Pads, LMV (AM)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Disc Brake Pads, HV (AM)</ITAG>In addition, any new asbestos-containing products for which commercialmanufacture, importation, or processing is initiated after the effectivedate of this rule will be banned as of the effective date of Stage 1, unlessEPA approves the use or product pursuant to an exemption application. Inother words, if a person devises a new application for asbestos that isnot covered by the product categories defined in this rule, and the personwishes to commence commercial manufacture, importation, and processingof the product after August 25, 1989, manufacture, importation, and processingof the product must cease by August 27, 1990, and distribution in commerceof the product must cease by August 25, 1992. These bans on manufacture,importation, processing, and distribution in commerce may be avoided onlyif a person applies to EPA for an exemption from the bans and the applicationis granted.Pursuant to section 12(a)(2), EPA finds that the manufacture or processingfor export of the asbestos-containing products that are subject to thisrule will present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health. Therefore,the manufacture and processing of the asbestos-containing products forexport is not exempted from this rule under section 12(a)(1), and is subjectto this rule's bans on manufacture, processing, and distribution in commercebans. Much of the life cycle and a significant portion of risk posed byexport products occurs in the United States. The most significant sourceof exposure that could be quantified by EPA for this rule is primary andsecondary manufacturing. During primary manufacture asbestos fibers areintroduced into the production process. During secondary manufacture, anasbestos fiber-containing component is used. EPA has concluded that theseactivities cause significant occupational and non-occupational exposuresto workers and their families, populations surrounding plant sites, andthe general population. In light of the high individual risk caused byexposure to asbestos, EPA has concluded that exposures due to manufacturingor processing of these asbestos-containing products for export pose anunreasonable risk of injury to human health in the United States.EPA has not found that asbestos-containing products imported into the UnitedStates for the sole purpose of shipment to another country pose an unreasonablerisk. Therefore, such activities are not subject to this rule's bans. However,for the reasons described above, imported products that are repackagedor otherwise processed in the United States before shipment to anothercountry are subject to the rule's bans.The proposal would have exempted the import of small quantities of otherwisebanned asbestos-containing products for personal use from the rule's bans.EPA received comments indicating that many new automobiles are importedby individuals. However, EPA is uncertain about the extent of any riskreduction that would be achieved by a ban on these activities. Therefore,the final rule's ban on importation excludes the act of bringing smallquantities of articles into the United States for normal personal or businessactivities (not including distribution of asbestos-containing productsin commerce) involving the use of a banned product either alone or as acomponent or part of a larger object. Similarly, the definition of importexcludes activities such as the movement of automobiles with asbestos-containingproducts as integral parts of the auto, back and forth across the UnitedStates border during the normal course of personal or business activities.The final rule bans the import of products that are purchased or otherwiseacquired outside of the United States for the sole purpose of resale.For example, after the effective date of the ban on OEM brake pads, a 1994or later model year automobile containing banned asbestos-containing partscannot be purchased in Canada or another country and be transported bya person to the United States for resale. However, the rule does not banthe import by a person of such a vehicle for personal use in the UnitedStates. For purposes of enforcing this provision, EPA will consider a vehicleto be imported for personal use if the person importing the vehicle importsno more than one vehicle containing banned products every 5 years. If aperson imports a vehicle more frequently, EPA will presume that the activityis subject to the rule's bans. Other activities that are excluded fromthe definition of import include driving across the U.S. border in a 1994or later model year automobile containing banned products during the courseof transacting business or for recreational purposes, or purchasing a used(i.e., pre-1994 model year) vehicle containing asbestos brakes in anothercountry and transporting it into the United States. C. Bans on Distribution in CommerceAvailable evidence shows that the release of asbestos fibers occurs notonly in the manufacture and processing of asbestos products, but also intheir use and maintenance. EPA proposed to ban activities involving asbestosproducts because of this life cycle risk. The proposed ban also implicitlywould have prohibited the eventual distribution of these products in commercebecause persons would not be permitted to manufacture, import, or processasbestos products.Consistent with the intent of the proposal, this final rule explicitlyprohibits the distribution in commerce of asbestos products within thespecified timeframe after manufacture, importation, and processing bansfor the products become effective. The time periods for distribution incommerce were established to afford affected parties sufficient time tosell existing stocks and therefore limit the likely economic impact ofthe ban. This was done after balancing the likely risks presented by continueduse of asbestos products with the economic impact of an outright ban onthis activity.As stated above, this rule bans the distribution in commerce of asbestosproducts after manufacture, importation, and processing bans for the productsbecome effective. The ban on distribution in commerce for products subjectto the Stage 1 manufacture, importation, and processing ban will becomeeffective on August 25, 1992. For Stage 2 products, the ban on distributionin commerce will become effective on August 25, 1994. For Stage 3 products,the ban on distribution in commerce will become effective on August 25,1997.Remaining ``stock-on-hand'' of an affected product must be disposed ofwithin 6 months of the effective date of the ban on distribution in commerce.Remaining stocks include all units of the product in the possession orcontrol of the person subject to the distribution in commerce ban. Disposalmust be by means that are in compliance with applicable local, State, andFederal restrictions.The rule's distribution in commerce ban does not cover all actions takenwith respect to asbestos-containing products. For purposes of the rule,the term ``distribution in commerce'' does not cover end use activities,for example, sale, resale, holding, or delivery, with respect to asbestosproducts by persons who use the product after it is manufactured, imported,or processed. For example, the term ``distribution in commerce'' does notinclude the resale of homes or motor vehicles that contain asbestos-containingparts or products or the installation of asbestos-containing brake padsin a person's automobile after the distribution in commerce of such brakepads is banned. (However, it is a violation of this rule for a person toengage in selling brake pads to anyone.) This provision also does not coverthe disposal of asbestos-containing products. EPA recognizes that some asbestos-containing products which are excludedfrom the ban may be very similar in form to asbestos-containing productsthat are banned. For example, this rule's bans do not cover the manufacture,importation, processing, and distribution in commerce of high-grade electricalpaper, a product which may be similar in some cases to millboard or otherasbestos paper products. Persons might try to manufacture or distributethe excluded products for uses that are banned. Such activities would violatethis rule's bans because this conversion of use will be interpreted byEPA to be processing or distribution in commerce of the banned products.The definitions of processing and distribution in commerce are broad andwill be interpreted by EPA to cover activities which involve the conversionof excluded asbestos-containing products in this manner.D. Labeling Products that are subject to a current or future ban on manufacturing,processing, import, or distribution in commerce must be labeled as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Notice_</T4>This product contains <T3>ASBESTOS. </T3>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has bannedthe distribution in U.S. commerce of this product under section 6 of theToxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2605) as of (insert the effectivedate of ban on distribution in commerce). Distribution of this productin commerce after this date and intentionally removing or tampering withthis label are <T3>violations of Federal law.</T3></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The purpose of this labeling requirement is to facilitate effortsby manufacturers, importers, processors, and distributors to comply withthis rule's bans and EPA's efforts to enforce the rule. Labels must be applied by manufacturers, importers, and processors to specifiedproducts produced after the dates listed below, and to all stock-on-handof these products in their possession or control at that time. The effectivedates of the labeling requirement are as follows: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,xs48</C> <H1>Products</H1><H1>Date by which products must be labeled</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Products banned in Stage 1 <D>Aug. 27, 1990 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Products banned in Stage 2, plus aftermarket disc and drum brake products<D>Aug. 25, 1992</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">All other products banned in Stage 3 <D>Aug. 25, 1995</D></ITAG></ITAG> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Therefore, a manufacturer, importer, or processor of a product bannedin Stage 2 must label all stock-on-hand of the product as of August 25,1992, as well as any further stock of that product manufactured, imported,or processed after that date. Products must be labeled at the times indicatedto ensure that a substantial portion of the stock in the chain of distributionafter the effective date of the manufacture, importation, or processingbans are labeled to facilitate enforcement and compliance efforts. Asbestos-containingbrake pads, drum brake linings, and brake blocks must be labeled earlierthan other products because of the relatively long potential shelf lifeof brake products and to facilitate compliance with the two-part ban ofasbestos friction products.For purposes of this labeling requirement, ``stock-on-hand'' means allunits of the product in the possession or control of the manufacturer,importer, or processor. This includes products stored by a separate commercialentity, but still within the direction or control of the manufacturer,importer, or processor.Manufacturers, importers, and processors must insert in the label theyapply to their products the effective date of the ban on distribution incommerce for that product. Labels must be displayed prominently on productpackaging, as described below. Labels must be either printed on productpackaging or in the form of either a sticker or tag made of plastic, paper,metal, or another durable material and securely adhered or attached toproduct packaging. Labels must be securely attached so that they cannotbe removed without being defaced or destroyed. They must be written inEnglish in block letters and numerals. Text in other languages is permittedin addition to the English language text. The color of the text must contractwith the background of the label. Labels must be applied in a visible locationon the exterior of the immediate packaging in which a product is distributedin commerce. However, if the product packaging has no visible surfaceslarger than 5 square inches, the person subject to the labeling requirementmust either securely attach a tag containing the required language to theproduct packaging or must label the next outer container in which the smallerwrapped products are packed for storage, transport, or distribution. Labelsmust be applied directly onto products which are stored, shipped, or distributedin commerce without packaging or wrapping. However, if a product is otherwiseproperly labeled and is removed from the properly labeled packaging onlywhen distributed to the end user, the product does not need to also belabeled directly.Compliance with the labeling requirements of this rule does not fulfilllabeling requirements established under the Federal Hazardous SubstancesAct (FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1261).E. Exemption Application Procedures EPA believes that exemptions from the rule's bans on future manufacture,importation, processing, and distribution in commerce will fall into twodifferent categories, those involving existing asbestos-containing productsor existing uses of asbestos in products and those involving new uses ofasbestos in products or new asbestos products. This rule provides two approachesto obtaining an exemption from these bans.EPA has already determined that activities involving most asbestos-containingproducts present unreasonable risks of injury to human health. Therefore,procedures in the final rule for evaluating exemption applications involvingmanufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in commerce of asbestos-containingproducts in categories identified in this rule or uses of asbestos in theseproducts place the burden upon the applicant to show that he or she hasmade demonstrable good faith efforts to develop substitutes for its productand that granting the exemption will not result in an unreasonable riskof injury to human health.EPA is uncertain about the facts and circumstances that will attend anypotential exemption involving new asbestos-containing products or new usesof asbestos. In view of this uncertainty about these products or uses,EPA believes that it is appropriate to employ a different process for reviewingexemptions for new asbestos products or uses. Thus, requests for exemptionfor new products or uses will be treated as a petition to amend this rulepursuant to section 21 of TSCA. Such petitions should comply with the proceduresof section 21 and contain, at a minimum, the type of information set forthin this final rule for exemption applications.The remainder of this Unit discusses general exemption procedures for applicationsinvolving products identified in the rule. Exemptions for military usesare discussed in Unit III.F of this preamble.1. <T3>Information requirements. </T3>This provision allows that EPA willexempt products from the rule's bans if an applicant can show that theactivity described in the application will not result in an unreasonablerisk of injury to human health and that the applicant has made demonstrablegood faith efforts to develop substitutes that do not pose an unreasonablerisk. EPA will balance the various information received in an exemptionapplication in determining whether the applicant has met the criteria forgranting an exemption. Applicants for exemptions must submit to EPA dataor discussions addressing each of the following issues regarding theirproduct:a. Data demonstrating the exposure level over the life cycle of the productthat is the subject of the application.b. Data concerning:i. The extent to which non-asbestos substitutes for the product that isthe subject of the application fall significantly short in performanceunder necessary product standards or requirements, including laws or ordinancesmandating product safety standards.ii. The costs of non-asbestos substitutes relative to the costs of theasbestos-containing product and, in the case in which the product is acomponent of another product, the effect on the cost of the end use productof using the substitute component.iii. The extent to which the product or use serves a high-valued use.c. Evidence of demonstrable good faith attempts by the applicant to developand use a non-asbestos substance or product which may be substituted forthe asbestos-containing product or the asbestos in the product or use thatis the subject of the application.d. An explanation of why the continued manufacture, importation, processing,distribution in commerce, and use, as applicable, of the product will notpresent an unreasonable risk of injury to human health.Exemption applications which do not contain these items of informationand the other information required under andSection; 763.173(d) will be consideredincomplete and will be returned to the applicant without further actionby EPA. Exemption applications that are returned as incomplete can be resubmittedwith the additional required information. The resubmitted application willcarry the resubmittal date as the date of receipt. 2. <T3>Procedures for submitting exemption applications. </T3>Exemption applicationscannot be submitted for products subject to the following bans before thedates indicated, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Manufacture, Importation, and Processing</T3><ITAG tagnum="14">Stage 1_August 25, 1989</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Stage 2_February 26, 1992</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Stage 3_February 27, 1995</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Distribution in Commerce</T3><ITAG tagnum="14">Stage 1_February 26, 1990</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Stage 2_February 26, 1993</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Stage 3_February 26, 1996</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">EPA believes that, because of the rapid development of asbestos substitutes,decisions on exemption applications made before these dates would be premature.However, EPA will consider, if appropriate, arguments made for an exemptionfrom a ban on distribution in commerce for a product at the time and applicantsubmits an application for an exemption from a manufacture, importation,or processing ban.Exemption applications must be addressed to: TSCA Document Processing Center(TS-790), Office of Toxic Substances, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460, ATTN: Asbestos Exemption. 3. <T3>EPA review and decision. </T3>EPA's review periods for exemption applicationsfor existing products will vary, depending on the timeliness of their submissionand the adequacy of the data that is submitted. If a complete exemptionapplication is submitted more than 1 year before the effective date ofthe applicable ban (or 9 months before the effective date of the ban inthe case of Stage 1 manufacture, importation, and processing bans), EPAwill complete its review of the application and issue its decision priorto the effective date of the ban. If EPA fails to meet this deadline, theapplicant will be granted an automatic extension of up to 1 year, or untilEPA decides whether to approve the application, during which the applicantcan continue the activity that is the subject of the application. EPA willrender its decision during the extension period. For example, if a ban becomes effective on September 1, 1994, an exemptionapplication for a product subject to that ban cannot be submitted to EPAbefore March 1, 1993. To ensure a decision by EPA on an application beforethe ban's effective date, the applicant must submit the application toEPA before September 1, 1993.If an exemption application is submitted less than 1 year before the effectivedate of the applicable ban or after the ban, EPA will issue a decisionas soon as is feasible. The submitter of this ``late'' application mustcease the banned activity as of the effective date of the ban unless EPAgrants the exemption. For example, if a manufacture or importation ban becomes effective on September1, 1994, and an application for a product subject to the ban is receivedby EPA on April 1, 1994, EPA will render its decision on the applicationas soon as is feasible. If EPA has not rendered a decision granting theexemption by September 1, 1994, the applicant must cease manufacture orimportation of the product. If EPA denies an exemption application before the effective date of a ban,the applicant must cease the activity as of the effective date of the ban,or within 30 days after receipt of the denial if it is issued less than30 days before the effective date of the ban. If a denial is rendered duringan extension period, the applicant must cease the banned activity within30 days after the issuance of the denial. For example, if the effective date of a ban is November 1, 1994, and EPArenders a denial on June 1, 1994, the activity must cease by November 1,1994. If the effective date of the ban is July 1, 1994, and EPA rendersa denial on June 15, 1994, the activity must cease by July 15, 1994. Further,if an extension period runs until December 1, 1994, and EPA issues a denialon June 1, 1994, the activity must cease by July 1, 1994. The time frames discussed in the preceding paragraphs for EPA's reviewof exemption applications do not apply to applications pertaining to newuses of asbestos. Applications for new uses will be subject to the deadlinesfor EPA review and decision specified in section 21 of TSCA. Upon receipt of a complete exemption application, EPA will issue a noticein the <T4>Federal Register</T4> announcing receipt of the application and invitingcomments. EPA will consider any comments received in determining whetherto grant or deny the application. EPA may request further information fromthe applicant to assist in determining whether the exemption applicationmeets the rule's criteria. When denying an application, EPA will send the applicant a copy of thedenial via registered mail. This written denial is a final Agency actionfor purposes of judicial review. If EPA proposes to grant an application, EPA will issue a notice in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> requesting comments on its proposal or the submissionof supplementary information. EPA will consider any comments received whenpreparing its final decision. A final grant of an exemption applicationwill be issued by <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice and, likewise, is a final Agency decisionfor purposes of judicial review. The notice will state the length of theexemption period granted by EPA. In addition, if an application is approved,EPA may notify the applicant that the labeling requirements of andSection;763.171 have been stayed until a later date indicated by EPA or otherwisemodified in the exemption application approval. Exemption renewal applications cannot be submitted earlier than 15 monthsbefore the end of the exemption period, unless so allowed in the noticegranting the original exemption. Notices received between 15 months and1 year before the end of the exemption period will be granted or deniedbefore the end of the exemption period. Renewal applications received thereafterwill be granted or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible. The activity thatis the subject of the renewal application may not continue beyond the originalexemption period unless EPA grants the renewal.  4. <T3>Factors considered in evaluating exemption applications. </T3>EPA hasconcluded that the future manufacture, importation, processing, and distributionin commerce of most asbestos-containing products results in an unreasonablerisk of injury to human health. The rule seeks the elimination of theserisks by banning the future use of asbestos in many products in U.S. commerce.Therefore, exemptions will be granted by EPA only in those instances wherea clear showing is made by an applicant that the activity described inthe exemption application meets the criteria set out in this preamble andrule. The criteria require the applicant to demonstrate that the activitydescribed in the application will not result in an unreasonable risk ofinjury to human health and that the applicant has made demonstrable goodfaith efforts to develop substitutes that do not pose an unreasonable risk.EPA believes that these criteria are consistent with the findings in thisrule, yet provide applicants an opportunity to demonstrate that they areentitled to an exemption in certain non-routine circumstances.EPA's evaluation of exemption applications will involve a balancing ofa number of factors which go into determining whether the exemption criteriahave been met. These factors include the availability of suitable substitutesand the feasibility of substituting for asbestos in the product, asbestosexposure risks posed by the continued use of the asbestos product, whetherthe asbestos use is a high-valued use, and the efforts of the applicantto develop substitutes. EPA will grant an exemption only after carefullybalancing all the factors presented in an application. The paragraphs thatfollow provide guidelines which EPA will follow in applying the above-statedexemption criteria in making decisions on exemption applications. Generally, EPA does not intend to grant exemptions to applicants who aremerely seeking to avoid their share of the costs imposed by the actionstaken in this rule. Also, EPA does not intend to grant exemptions thatwould indefinitely extend the use of asbestos in products.EPA has concluded that exposure to asbestos during the life cycles of theproducts that are subject to this rule poses an unreasonable risk of injuryto human health. Therefore, EPA does not intend to grant exemption applicationsthat are based solely on the rationale that relatively low levels of exposureexist, because exposure levels may be only one of several factors balancedin detemining whether the use described in an exemption application wouldpose an unreasonable risk. EPA has also found that suitable non-asbestossubstitutes exist for most uses of asbestos. Therefore, if a non-asbestossubstitute exists for a product and is in use by one or more of the producersin the market for the product, EPA does not intend to grant an exemptionto one producer based on the cost or difficulty of modifying its productionprocess or of setting up a supply system for obtaining the substitute.EPA has, in establishing the effective dates for the bans, afforded sufficienttime to allow producers and distributors to develop and implement transitionplans. Therefore, EPA does not intend to grant an exemption because anapplicant has yet to purchase the necessary equipment, to set up systemsof supply for substitutes, or to make other transition plans.Also, EPA does not intend to grant or renew an exemption if the applicanthas failed to make a tangible, documented effort to identify, develop,and use suitable non-asbestos substitutes for the product which is thesubject of the exemption application.In addition, EPA does not intend to grant an exemption merely because usinga substitute is somewhat more costly in the production of a product thanusing asbestos. However, EPA may grant an exemption for an existing asbestosproduct if, in addition to other factors, a non-asbestos substitute forthe product has not been developed or adapted, despite the best effortsof the requestor, or if available substitutes are unreasonably expensiveto purchasers.F. Military ExemptionsEPA and the Department of Defense will develop a Memorandum of Understandingestablishing mechanisms for dealing with asbestos-containing products usedfor military purposes. Along with the criteria for consideration of generalexemptions described in the preceding Unit, consideration will be givento the military nature of such uses and the mission of the Department ofDefense. EPA and the Department of Defense will jointly develop proceduresfor exemptions from this rule for asbestos-containing products used formilitary purposes.G. RecordkeepingTo ensure compliance with this rule, and to assist enforcement efforts,EPA is requiring under the authority of sections 6 and 8 of TSCA that allmanufacturers, importers, and processors of certain asbestos-containingproducts keep records. Section 8(a) provides broad authority for EPA torequire manufacturers, importers, and processors to keep records. Section8(a) exempts small businesses from reporting in certain cases. However,EPA may require manufacturers, importers, and processors of a substancesubject to a rule under section 6 of TSCA to maintain records. Since asbestosis already subject to rules under section 6 and is also subject to thisone, the small business exemption of section 8(a) would not apply. EPAbelieves that these recordkeeping requirements represent very little burdenand are necessary for the enforcement of this rule.EPA also has authority under section 6 to require recordkeeping and reportingrelated to the other regulatory requirements imposed by EPA under section6. In this case, section 6 provides the authority to apply the recordkeepingrequirements to distributors of asbestos-containing products who are notalso manufacturers, importers, or processors of these products subjectto section 8(a). EPA has used this section 6 recordkeeping and reportingauthority previously in its polychlorinated biphenyl and asbestos rulespromulgated under TSCA section 6 in 40 CFR Parts 761 and 763.1. <T3>Inventory. </T3>As of the effective date of a ban on manufacture, importation,or processing, all manufacturers, importers, and processors of productssubject to the ban must take an inventory of their stock-on-hand of thebanned products. This inventory must consist of a count of the number ofproduct units in stock, in terms of the unit measure or form in which theproduct is used or sold, and the location of current stock. ``Stock-on-hand''covers all stock owned or controlled by the manufacturer, importer, orprocessor. This includes stock in a storage location owned by the person,as well as stock in storage locations owned by others if the stock remainswithin the direction or control of the person. Results of this inventorymust be retained by the manufacturer, importer, or processor for 3 yearsafter the effective date of the ban. The purpose of this inventory is toserve as a baseline for EPA's enforcement of the rule's bans on manufacture,importation, processing, and distribution in commerce. Inventory resultswill be compared by EPA inspectors with the business records maintainedunder andSection; 763.178(b)(1) to determine compliance with this rule.2. <T3>Records. </T3>Manufacturers, importers, and processors must maintaina copy of all labels used in compliance with andSection; 763.171 for 3 yearsafter the effective date of the ban on distribution in commerce to whichthe label applies. For example, if the label is required for a productbanned from distribution in commerce as of October 1, 1992, the recordsregarding the label must be maintained until October 1, 1995.Manufacturers, importers, processors, and those persons subject to banson distribution in commerce must maintain normal business and sales recordsrecording the dates and quantities purchased of all products subject tobans. These records must be maintained for transactions from the effectivedate of the manufacture, importation, or processing ban for a product untilthe effective date of the ban on distribution in commerce for the product.These records must be maintained for 3 years after the effective date ofthe ban on distribution in commerce for a product.For example, if a manufacturer produces an asbestos-containing productthat is subject to a manfacture ban that takes effect on September 1, 1993,the manufacturer must by that date, make an inventory of the stock-on-handof the banned product as of that date. A record of the inventory must bemaintained until September 1, 1996. The manufacturer must also keep recordsof all sales or transfers of the product between September 1, 1993, andthe effective date of the ban on distribution in commerce (for purposesof this example, September 1, 1994). These records must be maintained bythe manufacturer until at least September 1, 1997.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Summary of Analysis Supporting This Final Rule</ITAG>EPA's basis for this rule, as described in the proposal, remains largelyunchanged. EPA's unreasonable risk findings under section 6 of TSCA arebased on extensive data gathering, modeling, analysis, and review of publiccomments. EPA's findings are summarized briefly in this preamble. Thispreamble also addresses significant public comments raised during the courseof this rulemaking. EPA has addressed other comments in a separate Responseto Comments document, which is incorporated by reference in this preambleand is included in the public docket. The following documents are alsocontained in the public docket and serve as the primary, although not exclusive,basis for the actions taken in this rule.1. <T3>Regulatory Impact Analysis, </T3>EPA, 1988.

This document was based in part on <T3>Recent Epidemiological Investigations on Populations Exposed to SelectedNon-Asbestos Fibers, </T3>EPA, 1988.Other materials used in the development of this rule are cited in the textof this preamble and listed in Unit XI of this preamble.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Assessment</ITAG>Section 6 of TSCA authorizes EPA to promulgate a rule prohibiting or limitingthe amount of a chemical substance that may be manufactured, processed,or distributed in commerce in the U.S. if EPA finds that there is a reasonablebasis to conclude that the manufacturer, processing, distribution in commerce,use, or disposal of the chemical substance, or any combination of theseactivities, presents or will present an unreasonable risk of injury tohuman health or the environment.Section 6(c)(1) of TSCA requires EPA to consider the following factorswhen determining whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonablerisk:1. The effects of such substance on human health and the magnitude of theexposure of human beings to such substance.2. The effects of such substance on the environment and the magnitude ofthe exposure of the environment to such substance or mixture.3. The benefits of such substance for various uses and the availabilityof substitutes for such uses.4. The reasonably ascertainable economic consequences of the rule, afterconsideration of the effect on the national economy, small businesses,technological innovation, the environment, and public health.To determine whether a risk from activities involving asbestos-containingproducts presents an unreasonable risk, EPA must balance the probabilitythat harm will occur from the activities against the effects of the proposedregulatory action on the availability to society of the benefits of asbestos.EPA has considered these factors in conjunction with the extensive recordgathered in the development of this rule. EPA has concluded that the continuedmanufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in commerce of mostasbestos-containing products poses an unreasonable risk to human health.This conclusion is based on information summarized in the following paragraphsand discussed in the units that follow. EPA has concluded that exposure to asbestos during the life cycles of manyasbestos-containing products poses an unreasonable risk of injury to humanhealth. EPA has also concluded that section 6 of TSCA is the ideal statutoryauthority to regulate the risks posed by asbestos exposure. This rule'spollution prevention actions under TSCA are both the preferable and theleast burdensome means of controlling the exposure risks posed throughoutthe life cycle of asbestos-containing products. Findings supporting thisconclusion include the following:1. Exposure to asbestos causes many painful, premature deaths due to mesotheliomaand lung, gastrointestinal, and other cancers, as well as asbestosis andother diseases. Risks attributable to asbestos exposure and addressed bythis rule are serious and are calculated for this rule using direct evidencefrom numerous human epidemiological studies. Studies show that asbestosis a highly potent carcinogen and that severe health effects occur aftereven short-term, high-level or longer-term, low-level exposures to asbestos.Asbestos exposure is compatible with a linear, no-threshold dose-responsemodel for lung cancer. In addition, there is no undisputed evidence ofquantitative differences in potency based on fiber size or type.For the quantitative risk assessment performed as part of this rulemaking,EPA used dose-response constants for lung cancer and mesothelioma thatwere the geometric means of the ``best estimates'' from a number of epidemiologicalstudies. If EPA had instead used an upper bound estimate, as is normallydone by the scientific community and in EPA regulatory risk assessmentwhen only data from animal studies is available to extrapolate human healthrisk, predicted lung cancer deaths could increase by a factor of 10 andmesothelioma deaths could increase by a factor of 20 (Ref. 1).2. People are frequently unknowingly exposed to asbestos and are rarelyin a position to protect themselves. Asbestos is generally invisible, odorless,very durable, and highly aerodynamic. It can travel long distances andexist in the environment for extended periods. Therefore, exposure cantake place long after the release of asbestos and at a distant locationfrom the source of release.3. Additions to the current stock of asbestos-containing products wouldcontribute to the environmental loading of asbestos. This poses the potentialfor an increased risk to the general population of asbestos-related diseaseand an increased risk to future generations because of asbestos' longevity.4. Asbestos fibers are released to the air at many stages of the commerciallife of the products that are subject to this rule. Activities that mighlead to the release of asbestos include mining of the substance, processingasbestos fibers into products, and transport, installation, use, maintenance,repair, removal, and disposal of asbestos-containing products. EPA hasfound that the occupational and non-occupational exposure existing overthe entire life cycles of each of the banned asbestos-containing productsposes a high level of individual risk. EPA has determined that thousandsof persons involved in the manufacture, processing, transport, installation,use, repair, removal, and disposal of the asbestos-containing productsaffected by this rule are exposed to a serious lifetime asbestos exposurerisk, despite OSHA's relatively low workplace PEL. In addition, accordingto the EPA Asbestos Modeling Study, millions of members of the generalU.S. population are exposed to elevated levels of lifetime risk due toasbestos released throughout the life cycle of asbestos-containing products.EPA believes that the exposure quantified for the analyses supporting thisrule represent an understatement of actual exposure.5. Release of asbestos fibers from many products during life cycle activitiescan be substantial. OSHA stated in setting its PEL of 0.2 f/cc that remainingexposures pose a serious risk because of limitations on available exposurecontrol technologies. Even with OSHA's controls, thousands of workers involvedin the manufacture and processing of asbestos-containing products are exposedto a lifetime risk of 1 in 1,000 of developing cancer. Many other exposuresaddressed by this rule are not affected by engineering controls requiredby OSHA's PEL or by other government regulation. Because asbestos is ahighly potent carcinogen, the uncontrolled high peak episodic exposuresthat are faced by large populations pose a significant risk.6. Because of the life cycle or ``cradle-to-grave'' nature of the riskposed by asbestos, attempts by OSHA, the Consumer Product Safety Commission(CPSC), and other EPA offices to regulate the continued commercial useof asbestos still leave many persons unprotected from the hazards of asbestosexposure. Technological limitations inhibit the effectiveness of existingor possible exposure control actions under non-TSCA authorities. Many routesof asbestos exposure posed by the products subject to this rule are outsidethe jurisdictions of regulatory authorities other than TSCA. EPA has determinedthat the residual exposure to asbestos that exists despite the actionstaken under other authorities poses a serious health risk throughout thelife cycle of many asbestos-containing products. This residual exposurecan only be adequately controlled by the exposure prevention actions takenin this rule.7. Despite the proven risks of asbestos exposure and the current or imminentexistence of suitable substitutes for most uses of asbestos, asbestos continuesto be used in large quantities in the U.S. in the manufacture or processingof a wide variety of commercial products. Total annual U.S. consumptionof asbestos dropped from a 1984 total of about 240,000 metric tons to lessthan 85,000 metric tons in 1987, according to the U.S. Department of Interior,Bureau of Mines data. This change suggests that the use of substituteshas increased markedly since the proposal. However, the 1987 consumptiontotal indicates that significant exposure due to the commercial use ofasbestos and the resultant risks would continue for the foreseeable futureabsent the actions taken in this rule.Evidence supports the conclusion that substitutes already exist or willsoon exist for each of the products that are subject to the rule's bans.In scheduling products for the different stages of the bans, EPA has analyzedthe probable availability of non-asbestos substitutes. In the rule, thevarious asbestos products are scheduled to be banned at times when it islikely that suitable non-asbestos substitutes will be available. However,the rule also includes an exemption provision to account for instancesin which technology might not have advanced sufficiently by the time ofa ban to produce substitutes for certain specialized or limited uses ofasbestos.8. EPA has calculated that the product bans in this rule will result inthe avoidance of 202 quantifiable cancer cases, if benefits are not discounted,and 148 cases, if benefits are discounted at 3 percent. The figures decreaseto 164 cases, if benefits are not discounted, and 120 cases, if benefitsare discounted at 3 percent, if analogous exposures are not included inthe analysis. In all likelihood, the rule will result in the avoidanceof a large number of other cancer cases that cannot be quantified, as wellas many cases of asbestos-related diseases. Estimates of benefits resultingfrom the action taken in this rule are limited to mesothelioma and lungand gastrointestinal cancer-cases-avoided, and do not include cases ofasbestosis and other diseases avoided and avoided costs from treating asbestosdiseases, lost productivity, or other factors. EPA has estimated that thecost of this rule, for the 13-year period of the analyses performed, willbe approximately $458.89 million, or $806.51 million if a 1 percent annualdecline in the price of substitutes is not assumed. This cost will be spreadover time and a large population so that the cost to any person is likelyto be negligible. In addition, the rule's exemption provision is a qualitativefactor that supports the actions taken in this rule. EPA has concludedthat the quantifiable and unquantifiable benefits of the rule's staged-banof the identified asbestos-containing products will outweigh the resultanteconomic consequences to consumers, producers, and users of the products.9. EPA has determined that, within the findings required by section 6 ofTSCA, only the staged-ban approach employed in this final rule will adequatelycontrol the asbestos exposure risk posed by the product categories affectedby this rule. Other options either fail to address significant portionsof the life cycle risk posed by products subject to the rule or are unreasonablyburdensome. EPA has, therefore, concluded that the actions taken in thisrule represent the least burdensome means of reducing the risk posed byexposure to asbestos during the life cycles of the products that are subjectto the bans.10. Based on the reasons summarized in this preamble, this rule bans mostasbestos-containing products in the U.S. because they pose an unreasonablerisk to human health. These banned products account for approximately 94percent of U.S. asbestos consumption, based on 1985 consumption figures.The actions taken will result in a substantial reduction in the unreasonablerisk caused by asbestos exposure in the U.S.A few minor uses of asbestos and asbestos products are not included inthe ban. These uses, which account for less than 6 percent of U.S. asbestosconsumption based on 1985 data, do not pose an unreasonable risk, basedon current knowledge. For some product categories, EPA was unable to findthat the products pose an unreasonable risk because asbestos exposure isminimal over the product's life cycle relative to the exposures posed byother products. In other instances EPA currently has insufficient informationabout either asbestos exposure attributable to the products or the futureavailability of suitable substitutes to make a finding of unreasonablerisk. Exposure information was considered insufficient in cases where monitoringdata was largely unavailable for most major stages of a product's lifecycle and too little was known about exposures during these stages to estimateexposure by analogy to those posed by other products. When no informationis available for a product indicating that cost-effective substitutes exist,the estimated cost of a product ban is very high. In all of these cases,the risk reduction potential that EPA could quantitatively or qualitativelyestimate as a result of possible regulatory actions could not be justifiedin light of the resultant costs, under the criteria of section 6 of TSCA.Human health effects of asbestos and EPA's cancer risk extrapolation arediscussed in Units V.A.1 and V.A.2 of this preamble. The extent of humanexposure to asbestos and the resulting risks are discussed in Unit V.A.3of this preamble. Asbestos substitutes are discussed in Units V.C. andV.F. of this preamble. EPA's evaluation of the viability of other regulatoryoptions under TSCA is discussed in Unit V.E. of this preamble. EPA's evaluationof the viability of actions under authorities other than TSCA to controlthe risk posed by asbestos exposure is discussed in Units VI and VII ofthis preamble. EPA's estimates of the costs and benefits of this rule arediscussed in Unit V.D. of this preamble. EPA's evaluations of the risksposed by the different categories of asbestos-containing products are summarizedin Unit V.F. of this preamble.A. Health Effects and Magnitude of Exposure To Asbestos1. <T3>Health effects.</T3> The human health effects caused by exposure toasbestos are well-documented. This Unit reiterates the major health effectsand the uncertainties that exist regarding this subject. More comprehensiveanalysis can be found in the <T3>Airborne Asbestos Health Assessment Update</T3> (Ref. 1), the <T3>Report to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission by the ChronicHazard Advisory Panel on Asbestos</T3> (Ref. 2), and <T3>Asbestiform Fibers: Non-occupational Health Risks</T3> (Ref. 3). Furtherresponses to comments on this subject can be found in the Response to Commentsdocument.Asbestos is a chemical substance as that term is defined in section 3(2)of TSCA. It is well-recognized that asbestos is a human carcinogen andis one of the most hazardous substances to which humans are exposed inboth occupational and non-occupational settings. As OSHA stated in itsfinal rule, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of June 20, 1986 (51 FR 22612), establishinga 0.2 fibers-per-cubic-centimeter (f/cc) PEL for asbestos, ``OSHA is awareof no instance in which exposure to a toxic substance has more clearlydemonstrated detrimental health effects on humans than has asbestos exposure.''There is wide agreement that all types of asbestos fibers are associatedwith pulmonary fibrosis (asbestosis), lung cancer, and mesothelioma. Gastrointestinalcancer and other cancers at extrathoracic sites, as well as other lungdisorders and diseases, have also been associated with asbestos exposure,although the consistency and magnitude of the excess risks of these diseasesare not as great as for lung cancer and mesothelioma. All of these asbestos-relateddiseases are life-threatening or disabling and cause substantial pain andsuffering.The conclusions reached by EPA regarding the health effects of asbestosexposure represent a widely accepted consensus of opinions of health agencies,scientific organizations, and independent experts. The major health effectsof asbestos are summarized below.a. <T3>Lung cancer and mesothelioma.</T3> Lung cancer has been responsiblefor the largest number of deaths attributable to occupational exposureto all of the principal commercial asbestos mineral types: chrysotile,amosite, crocidolite, and anthophyllite. Excess lung cancers have beendocumented among workers involved in asbestos mining and milling and inthe manufacturing and use of a variety of asbestos products. Lung cancerrisk appears to increase with both the level and duration of exposure.The latency period for the disease is generally 20 years or more afterexposure. This means that lung cancer usually does not manifest itselfuntil 20 years after the disease-initiating exposure. Most persons whodevelop lung cancer die within 2 years of diagnosis.While both asbestos and cigarette smoking can separately increase riskof lung cancer, together they appear to interact synergistically to multiplylung cancer risk in humans. Commenters have suggested that smoking shouldbe controlled to reduce the very high lung cancer risk due to combinedasbestos exposure and smoking. However, even complete control of the smokingfactor, if possible, would leave a substantial health risk since the asbestos-relatedrisk of lung cancer to nonsmokers and of mesothelioma (which is apparentlynot affected by smoking) would remain.Mesothelioma is a rare cancer of the lining of the lung (pleural mesothelioma)or abdominal cavity (peritoneal mesothelioma). Mesothelioma has been associatedwith occupational exposure to chrysotile, amosite, and crocidolite. Epidemiologicalstudies suggest that mesothelial risk rises rapidly with time from theonset of exposure. Risk also increases with both intensity and durationof exposure. The latency period for the disease is generally between 25and 30 years. In almost all instances, the disease is rapidly fatal, withsurvival times of less than 2 years after diagnosis. There is no evidencethat cigarette smoking increases the risk of developing asbestos-inducedmesothelioma. Most epidemiological studies have been conducted on occupational populationsexposed to high airborne concentrations of asbestos for relatively longperiods of time. However, short-term occupational exposures have been shownto cause serious health effects. For example, one group of asbestos factoryworkers with less than 2 months of occupational exposure had a two-foldincrease in lung cancer risk (Ref. 4). Also, many documented cases of mesotheliomahave been linked to extremely brief exposures to relatively high concentrationsof asbestos (Ref. 1). There is also direct evidence of adverse health effects from non-occupationalasbestos exposure. Increased risk of pleural abnormalities and mesotheliomahave been observed in families of asbestos workers, presumably due to thedissemination of fibers in the home from contaminated work clothes. Mesotheliomashave also been documented in populations whose only identified exposurewas living near asbestos mines or asbestos product factories, or shipyardswith heavy asbestos use (Ref. 1). Animal studies confirm the epidemiological findings regarding the healtheffects of asbestos exposure. All commercial forms of asbestos have beenshown to produce lung tumors and mesothelioma in laboratory animals withno substantial differences between the form of asbestos forms in carcinogenicpotency. b. <T3>Gastrointestinal cancer. </T3>A number of epidemiological studies havedocumented significant increases in the incidence of gastrointestinal cancerdue to occupational exposure to asbestos. Gastrointestinal cancers consistlargely of cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum. However,the magnitude of gastrointestinal cancer risk is lower than that of lungcancer or mesothelioma and no dose-response data are available. A number of commenters argued that the evidence indicating a positive associationbetween gastrointestinal cancer and asbestos exposure is weak and inconclusive.They indicated that unidentified facts may cause the excess gastrointestinalcancers. Commenters suggested that many of the excess cancers attributedto gastrointestinal sites may be due to misdiagnosis of peritoneal mesotheliomas.Other commenters contended that in the absence of any positive experimentalevidence, the epidemiology data alone do not support the conclusion thatexposure to asbestos can cause gastrointestinal cancer. EPA recognizes that the evidence supporting an association between gastrointestinalcancer and asbestos exposure is not as strong as that which is availableto support an association between asbestos exposure and lung cancer andmesothelioma. However, after weighing available information, EPA believesthat there is evidence of a strong causal relationship between asbestosexposure and gastrointestinal cancer excess. This evidence includes thefollowing: (1) A statistically significant increase in gastrointestinalcancer was found in 10 of 23 epidemiological studies. (2) A consistentrelationship exists between increased gastrointestinal cancer risk andincreased lung cancer risk (approximately 10 to 30 percent of the lungcancer excess). (3) It is biologically plausible that asbestos could beassociated with these tumor sites, because it is conceivable that the majorityof fibers inhaled are cleared from the respiratory tract and subsequentlyswallowed, allowing the fibers to enter the gastrointestinal tract (Ref.5). Additionally fibers may be swallowed directly. (4) One study demonstratedsome evidence of carcinogenicity in male rats fed diets containing intermediaterange size chrysotile asbestos (65 percent  10 microns in length) (Ref.6). Further, EPA does not accept the argument that all gastrointestinal cancersidentified in the epidemiology studies described above are the result ofmisdiagnosis. Cancers of some gastrointestinal cancer sites (e.g., stomachand pancreas) could be the result of misdiagnosis of peritoneal mesotheliomas.However, this does not account for all of the excess cancers seen at sitessuch as the colon or rectum. OSHA, in its final rule lowering the asbestosPEL concluded that the studies conducted to date ``constitute substantialevidence of an association between asbestos exposure and a risk of incurringgastrointestinal cancer.'' EPA agrees with this conclusion.c. <T3>Cancers at other sites. </T3>Increased risk of cancers other than mesotheliomaand lung and gastrointestinal cancers have been observed in populationsoccupationally exposed to asbestos. An excess of laryngeal cancer in asbestosworkers has been reported in a number of studies (Ref. 2). Available data,however, indicate that there may be an interaction between smoking andasbestos exposure in the etiology of laryngeal cancer. Elevated risk ofkidney cancer has also been observed in two epidemiological studies (Refs.7 and 8). In addition, an increased incidence of ovarian cancer has beenfound among female workers in three studies (Refs. 9, 10, and 11). Therefore,evidence suggest an association between asbestos exposure and cancers otherthan lung cancer, mesothelioma, and gastrointestinal cancer. However, becauseof study limitations, inconsistencies among studies, and the possibilityof misdiagnosis of disease, the relationship between asbestos exposureand cancer at these extrathoracic sites is not clear. Because of this uncertainty,EPA did not calculate the risk of cancers at other sites for purposes ofthe quantitative risk assessment for this rule.d. <T3>Asbestosis. </T3>Asbestosis is a disabling fibrotic lung disease thathas been associated with high levels of occupational exposure to asbestos.Clinical signs and symptoms associated with asbestosis include shortnessof breath, pulmonary functional changes, basal rales, and small, mainlyirregular, opacities on chest radiographs. Asbestosis can both appear andprogress many years after the termination of exposure. All types of asbestoshave been associated with the development of asbestosis. Epidemiologicaldata indicate that the incidence rate increases and the disease becomesmore severe with increasing dust level and duration of exposure. This hasalso been confirmed in animal studies via inhalation exposure. It is notclear whether an exposure threshold exists for asbestosis. However, thereis no available evidence that disabling asbestosis is caused by non-occupationalasbestos exposure or relatively low levels of occupational exposure. Therefore,the risk of disabling asbestosis from low levels of exposure to asbestoswas not calculated for purposes of the quantitative risk assessment performedfor this final rule.e. <T3>Effect of fiber type. </T3>A number of commenters argued that chrysotile,the major commercial form of asbestos, is far less carcinogenic than theamphibole asbestos types (e.g., amosite and crocidolite) and thus, differentcarcinogenic potency values for chrysotile and amphiboles should be usedfor quantitative risk assessment.For lung cancer, EPA finds the evidence supporting this argument to beinconclusive and inconsistent. Some of the lowest unit risk factors observedfor lung cancer are among cohorts exposed to predominantly chrysotile asbestos(Refs. 12 and 13). However, some of the highest unit values are also fromexposure to primarily chrysotile (Refs. 14 and 15). This suggests thatchrysotile exposures can confer an extremely high risk of lung cancer.The cause of the observed variability in lung cancer unit risk for chrysotilein different studies is unknown, but some of the variabilities can be attributedto differences in the fiber characteristics associated with different processes,uncertainties due to small numbers in epidemiological studies, and incorrectestimates of the exposures of earlier years (Refs. 1 and 2).For mesothelioma, EPA recognizes that peritoneal mesotheliomas have largelybeen associated with crocidolite exposure and that there is some epidemiologicalevidence suggesting that crocidolite is more potent than chrysotile ininducing pleural mesothelioma. However, definitive conclusions concerningthe relative potency of various fiber types in inducing mesothelioma cannotbe made on the basis of available epidemiological information. This isbecause: (1) Mesotheliomas are difficult to diagnose; (2) dose-responseinformation for mesothelioma for individual fiber types is unavailable;(3) exposure data are inadequate; and (4) exposure to crocidolite fiberscould be higher because they become airborne more easily than other fibertypes. Further, numerous animal studies have demonstrated that chrysotileis at least as potent as amphiboles in inducing both mesothelioma and lungcancer by inhalation, as well as by injection or implantation.Available information indicates that the combined epidemiological and animalevidence fail to establish conclusively differences in mesothelioma hazardfor the various types of asbestos fibers. In view of the inconsistenciesand uncertainty regarding this issue, EPA believes that it is prudent andin the public interest to consider all fiber types as having comparablecarcinogenic potency in its quantitative assessment of mesothelioma risk.EPA does recognize that some evidence exists indicating that amphibolesmay be more potent in inducing mesothelioma than chrysotile. However, theneed for further study to resolve this issue, and the resulting delay inEPA's risk assessment for asbestos, cannot be justified given the volumeof data showing the carcinogenic potency of all fiber types. Similar conclusionswere reached previously by other scientific bodies and agencies (Refs.2, 3, and 16).f. <T3>Effect of fiber dimension. </T3>A number of commenters stated thatwhile long fibers (andgreater;5 microns) are associated with biological activity,fibers less than 5 microns in length may be innocuous. According to thesecommenters, short fibers to not contribute to any significant risk to humansand therefore EPA should base its cancer risk estimates on only fiberslonger than 5 microns in length.Injection or implantation studies in animals indicate that longer, finerfibers of the same asbestos fiber type appear to have greater carcinogenicpotential than shorter, thicker fibers (Refs. 1, 2, and 3). Results ofseveral recent inhalation studies also indicate that long fibers (andgreater;5microns) are more carcinogenic than short fibers (andless;5 microns) (Refs.17 and 18). However, studies performed to date have not established fiberdimensional thresholds for potency.Although animal studies have provided an indication of the qualitativerelationship between fiber dimension and carcinogenic potency, they arenot used for quantifying dose-response relationships for humans becauseEPA believes that extrapolation of data from human exposures in the workplaceto human exposure in non-occupational settings is more appropriate. EPAbased most of its estimates of non-occupational exposure in terms of thetotal mass of asbestos released to air. To estimate health risks from thenon-occupational exposure, the mass measurements need to be converted tothe equivalent optical fiber concentration (fibers longer than 5 micronsand greater than 0.25 andCx.18;m in diameter) that are used as dose measurementsin workplaces for which dose-response relationship has been developed.Some data exist that relate optical fiber counts to the total mass of asbestos.The range of conversion factors between optical fiber count mass concentrationis large (5 to 150 andCx.18;g/m\3\/f/ml) because these values vary with differentenvironments and sampling techniques, and any average value derived fromthis range has a large uncertainty. Despite the uncertainties, they arethe best data available for such assessments and therefore EPA believesthat for the purpose of extrapolating to low mass concentration from fibercount, the approximate geometric mean, 30 andCx.18;g/m\3\/f/ml is appropriate(Ref. 1). Additionally, uncertainty may be introduced in the assumptionmade in this assessment that the fiber size distribution is the same inboth occupational and non-occupational air environments. The assumptionis considered prudent in view of the fact that qualitatively, short fibersare found more predominantly than long fibers in both occupational andnon-occupational settings. The same approach has been adopted by the NationalAcademy of Sciences (Ref. 3) and the Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel (CHAP)on Asbestos (Ref. 2) in estimating human health risk associated with low-levelnon-occupational exposure to asbestos.g. <T3>Potency values. </T3>Commenters stated that cancer risks vary fromone industry segment to another and maintained that EPA should use differentpotency values for different industries in its quantitative cancer riskassessment for asbestos. Most of the commenters singled out two segmentsof the asbestos industry, manufacturers of chrysotile friction productsand A/C products made from chrysotile, in which the lung cancer risks wereconsiderably lower than those in chrysotile textile production.EPA has concluded that the data supporting this suggestion are not convincingbecause of significant methodological or statistical uncertainties in thesestudies. Further, when the 95 percent confidence limits on the potencyfactors for lung cancer are considered along with the uncertainties associatedwith estimates of exposures, there is considerable overlap of the unitrisk estimates across industry segments and fiber types (Ref. 1). Accordingly,EPA believes that its use of a geometric mean unit risk derived from 11studies that cover all industrial processes (with the exception of miningand milling) and that provide a dose-response relationship is reasonable.This approach recognizes that lower cancer risks may exist in some industrysegments because of uncertainties in the measurement of exposure or statisticalvariabilities, but the potency factor for asbestos is considered to beequivalent across industry segments. In fact, a follow-up study (Ref. 24)reported a lung cancer unit risk of 0.0076 for A/C production workers whowere exposed predominantly to chrysotile. This value is closer to the bestestimate for the fractional increase in lung cancer, K<T2>L</T2>, for asbestos exposure, 0.010. This study provides further supportfor the use of a single potency factor for all asbestos exposure scenarios.2. <T3>Quantitative Risk Assessment.</T3> Risk assessment usually requiresextrapolation between different routes of exposure, from animals to humans,and from test groups to the population at large. Despite uncertainties,risk assessment provides an estimate of the magnitude of risk for makingdecisions about controlling exposure to a hazardous substance. However,because health risk from asbestos exposure is estimated using direct evidencefrom a large number of epidemiological studies, the risk posed by asbestosexposure is far more certain than that posed by exposure to other hazardoussubstances for which only animal data and/or fewer, less conclusive humandata are available.Data from a study of U.S. insulation workers allow models to be developedfor the time and age dependence of lung cancer and mesothelioma risk (Ref.4). Thirteen other epidemiological studies demonstrate a linear dose-responserelationship between cumulative occupational asbestos exposure and lungcancer. Although much less data are available regarding a dose-responserelationship for mesothelioma, existing data suggest a linear responsewith dose and duration of exposure. To obtain dose-response estimates forcurrent occupational and non-occupational exposures to asbestos, it isnecessary to extrapolate the effects observed in occupational settingswith historically high exposure to anticipated effects at low levels ofexposure. This is based on a no-threshold linear extrapolation. The assumptionof no-threshold low dose linearity for asbestos carcinogenicity is reasonableand well-supported because (1) cumulative dose-response relationship havebeen shown in several epidemiological studies over a wide range of exposure;(2) threshold dose has not been demonstrated; and (3) the concept is consistentwith accepted theories of carcinogenesis.Both the lung cancer and mesothelioma models used for this final rule havebeen adopted by OSHA (Ref. 16). The National Academy of Sciences (Ref.3) also adopted a similar no-threshold model to estimate lung cancer riskto non-occupational populations from exposure to asbestos. No-thresholdlinear models have widespread support (Refs. 2, 3, 16, 22, and 23). Thederivation and validation of the models as well as the assumptions anduncertainties involved in the model, are discussed in detail in Refs. 1,2, and 21.<ITAG tagnum="26">d<T2>(t-10)</T2> = duration of exposure from onset until 10 years (minimumlatency period) before present (years).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">f = intensity of exposure to fiber equivalents longer than 5 microns(f/cc).</ITAG>K<T2>L</T2> = dose response constant = 0.010. (Refs. 1 and 21)Because mesothelioma is a very rare form of cancer in the general population,an absolute risk model is used to estimate excess mesothelioma incidencedue to asbestos exposure. According to this model, the added risk of mesotheliomais proportional to the cumulative exposure to asbestos and increases inproportion to the third power of time after onset of exposure. This modelincorporates a delay of 10 years for the manifestation of disease (i.e.,a minimum latency period of 10 years). Four epidemiological studies providedquantitative data suitable for calculation of potency factors for mesothelioma(K<T2>M</T2>). EPA (Ref. 1) selected an average value for K<T2>M</T2> of 1.0 x 10^8 as the best estimate for environmental exposures.Although it was not possible to determine directly the 95 percent confidencelimits on K<T2>M,</T2> a multiplicative factor of 5 was estimated for the averagevalue of K<T2>M,</T2> and a multiplicative factor of 20 was estimated for its applicationto any unstudied exposure circumstance.The absolute risk model for mesothelioma can be expressed as:<ITAG tagnum="26">I<T2>M</T2>(t, d, f) = K<T2>M</T2> andCx.1; f[(t - 10) \3\ - (t - 10 - d) \3\] for t andgreater; 10+ d</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">\3\10 = K</ITAG><T2>M</T2> andCx.1; f(t - 10) \3\ for 10 + d andgreater; t andgreater;<ITAG tagnum="20">    = 0 for t andless; 10andless;andgreater;andgreater;andgreater;andgreater;andgreater;andgreater;andgreater;andless;]andgreater;</ITAG>Lung cancer is best described by a relative risk model. According to thismodel, excess risk of lung cancer from asbestos exposure is proportionalto the cumulative exposure (i.e., the duration of exposure times the intensityof exposure, in terms of fiber-year/cc) and the background risk in theabsence of exposure. EPA used this model and data from 11 studies of workersexposed to asbestos in textile production, asbestos product manufacturing,and insulation application to calculate potency factors for lung cancer(K<T2>L</T2>, the fractional increase in risk per fiber-year/cc of exposure)(Ref. 1). The geometric mean value of K<T2>L</T2> for these studies, 0.010, was used as the best estimate forenvironmental asbestos exposure. The 95 percent confidence limits for thisvalue are 0.0040 and 0.027 (multiplicative factor of 2.5) based on an analysisof variances in the 11 studies from which the K<T2>L</T2> was calculated. The 95 percent confidence limits for K<T2>L</T2> that might be applied in any unstudied exposure circumstancesare estimated to be a multiplicative factor of approximately 10.The relative risk model for lung cancer can be expressed as: <ITAG tagnum="26">I<T2>L</T2> = I<T2>E</T2> [1 + K<T2>L</T2> andCx.1; f andCx.1; d<T2>(t-10)</T2>] </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where: <ITAG tagnum="26">I<T2>L</T2> = age ^ specific lung cancer death rate with exposure to asbestos.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">I<T2>E</T2> = age ^ specific lung cancer death rate without exposure toasbestos. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">t = time from onset of exposure until present (years). </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where: <ITAG tagnum="26">I<T2>M</T2> (t, d, f) = mesothelioma incidence at t years from onset ofexposure, from duration d, at concentration f. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">K<T2>M</T2> = carcinogenic potency expressed as the incidence of mesotheliomaper unit of exposure in fiber-years \3\/cc. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">f = intensity of exposure to fiber equivalents longer than 5 microns(f/cc). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">t = time after exposure in years. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">d = duration of exposure in years. (Refs. 1 and 21) </ITAG>In extrapolating rates of excess asbestos-related deaths from gastrointestinalcancer, EPA adopted the approach used by OSHA (Ref. 16) in assuming thatexcess gastrointestinal cancers will be equal to 10 percent of those forlung cancer in each time period. However, this approach may actually understatethe rate of gastrointestinal cancers. OSHA noted that this approach couldresult in an underestimate, and EPA's analysis indicates that the excessgastrointestinal cancer rate could be as high as 30 percent of the lungcancer rate (Ref. 1). There are inconsistencies in findings among different epidemiological studieswith regard to excess mortality for cancers at sites other than the lung,mesothelial linings, and gastrointestinal tract (e.g., laryngeal, kidney,and ovary cancers). Also, there are uncertainties about the developmentof disabling asbestosis at low exposure. Therefore, EPA has not made numericalestimates of the risks for these asbestos-related diseases for purposesof this analysis. Since estimates of these diseases are not included inthe overall risk estimates, EPA believes that the total health risk posedby exposure to asbestos is underestimated. A number of commenters contended that it is inappropriate to adhere toa linear, no-threshold dose-response model for estimating lung cancer andmesothelioma risk from asbestos exposure. They cited a number of epidemiologicalstudies which they stated show that there is a threshold below which asbestos-relateddisease does not occur (Refs. 12, 13, 25, and 26). EPA has reviewed thesestudies and found that they are all insufficient to detect a thresholdat low doses (Ref. 1). Other commenters expressed concern about the low-dose linearity assumptionbecause the shape of the dose-response curve at extremely low doses issubject to conjecture and that the use of no threshold linear model greatlyoverestimates true risk. Others believe that asbestos is a non-geneticcarcinogen. As discussed above, EPA has concluded that the low-dose linearityassumption is reasonable because direct evidence for linearity of carcinogenicresponse associated with asbestos exposure is found in several epidemiologicalstudies over a wide range of exposure. Whether the response is linear atvery low doses is not known (Ref. 1). In the discussion of the choice ofmathematical procedures in carcinogen risk assessment, the White HouseOffice of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) stated: ``When data andinformation are limited, however, and when such uncertainty exists regardingthe mechanism of carcinogenic action, models or procedures which incorporatelow-dose linearity are preferred when compatible with the limited information''(Ref. 27). EPA generally concurs with this position as reflected in EPA'sGuidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (51 FR 33992). Thus, given thelack of complete understanding of the mechanisms by which asbestos inducescancer, and the goal of protecting human health, EPA believes that thechoice of low-dose linearity is most prudent. 3. <T3>Magnitude of human exposure. </T3>Exposure to asbestos is discussedin more detail in the Asbestos Exposure Assessment (Ref. 29), the AsbestosModeling Study (Ref. 30), and the Non-occupational Asbestos Exposure Report(Ref. 31). Further responses to comments on this subject can be found inthe Response to Comments document. Most of the population of the United States is exposed to some level ofairborne asbestos from asbestos-containing products. Asbestos productshave been in wide use in the U.S. for decades. Although U.S. asbestos consumptionhas declined in recent years, thousands of tons of asbestos are still usedannually in the manufacture in the U.S. of the products that are subjectto this rule (Ref. 21). Fibers can be released to the air and exposurecan occur at all stages of the life cycle of asbestos products, includingmining, processing, and the transport, installation, use, repair, removal,and disposal of asbestos-containing products.Once released, asbestos fibers exhibit a number of characteristics thattend to increase human exposure to them. They are ordorless and fibersof respirable size are largely invisible, presenting risk to persons whoare not aware that they are being exposed. They are also extremely durableand possess aerodynamic properties that allow them to remain suspendedin the air for a long time and to reenter the air readily after settlingout. Asbestos, therefore, can persist for a very long time in the environmentand can travel extended distances through the air. These factors increasethe intensity, duration, and area of exposure and complicate attempts tocontrol or reduce exposure.EPA has quantified many of the life cycle exposures anticipated from thecontinued manufacture, importation, processing, and use of the asbestosproducts that are subject to this rule. EPA estimates that over 135,000full-time equivalent (FTE) workers are exposed during the life cycles ofthese products to levels of asbestos carrying lifetime risks of between7 in 10,000 and 7 in 1,000 (Ref. 29). At least 40 million consumers facea potential hazard as they install, use, repair, and dispose of these products(Ref. 31). In addition, the general population is exposed to asbestos thatis released into the ambient air during all of these activities. Both consumersand members of the general population frequently incur individual lifetimerisks of 1 in 1,000,000 or greater of developing cancer from these exposures(Ref. 31).There are other exposures associated with the continued production of asbestosproducts that cannot be readily quantified, but which could pose a significantrisk to large populations. As discussed in more detail below, many releasesof asbestos from asbestos products take place intermittently and over longperiods, making them difficult to measure. Because of the difficulty ofobtaining accurate monitoring data for these releases, they have not beenquantified for purposes of this rule's analyses, but qualitative evidenceindicates that cumulatively, they are probably significant. Similarly,because it is difficult to quantify the tendency of asbestos to be resuspendedin air, EPA has not quantified in its analyses the risk posed by asbestosthat is repeatedly reentrained after settling out. However, some reentrainmentcertainly occurs, and asbestos may pose some threat years after its initialrelease from asbestos products. These exposures, although unquantified,have the potential to affect large numbers of people for long periods oftime. Thus, in addition to the exposures quantified for this rule, theyare a source of considerable concern.a. <T3>Occupational exposures.</T3> Since EPA's proposed rule was issued,OSHA has promulgated new occupational exposure standards for asbestos,lowering the 8-hour Time Weighted Average (TWA) PEL from 2.0 to 0.2 f/cc(51 FR 22612). OSHA has also set an Excursion Limit (EL) of 1 f/cc as ahalf-hour TWA in a September 1988 amendment to the standards (53 FR 35610).The probable impact of the 0.2 f/cc PEL on workers' exposures to asbestoswas discussed in the proposal. As noted both in that proposal and in OSHA'srulemaking, exposures at the new PEL still pose significant risks, as doexposure at the EL. OSHA notes that the new PEL and EL do not represent``safe'' levels of asbestos exposure, but are the lowest levels that industrycan feasibly achieve during current control technologies. EPA estimatesthat under the new PEL, approximately 135,000 FTE workers engaged in themanufacture, processing, installation, repair, and disposal of the productsto be banned are exposed to levels of airborne asbestos between 0.02 f/ccand 0.2 f/cc (Ref. 29). Assuming that workers are exposed to these levelsover a 45-year working lifetime, they incur individual risks of between7 in 10,000 and 7 in 1,000 of developing cancer (51 FR 22644).A number of commenters criticized the occupational exposure data base usedto support the proposal as being outdated and incomplete. Much of thatdata came from the 1982 TSCA section 8(a) reporting rule (40 CFR 763.60).In response to these comments and because of the passage of time sincethe proposal, EPA has updated and expanded its analysis of occupationalexposures, making use of available literature and data bases and conductingsurveys of asbestos use and exposure levels. Materials used by EPA in theupdated analysis include OSHA and Mine Safety and Health Administration(MSHA) compliance inspection reports, National Institute for OccupatioalSafety and Health (NIOSH) studies, academic and industry studies, and publiccomments. In 1986 and 1987, EPA conducted the Asbestos Exposure Surveyand gathered exposure and release information on the manufacture of mostof the major asbestos product categories from primary and secondary manufacturersof asbestos products. EPA gathered data on populations engaged in manufacturingin the 1986-87 Asbestos Market Survey.EPA was able to obtain extensive information on occupational exposuresduring primary and secondary manufacturing for many product categories.Air monitoring data for primary and secondary manufacturing were availablefor many products from the 1986-87 EPA Exposure Survey, OSHA inspections,and numerous studies. EPA has estimated that approximately 9,300 workersin the U.S. are exposed to asbestos during the primary and secondary manufacturingof the products that are affected by this rule (Ref. 29). These exposuresare listed in Table I of this Unit.EPA also gathered information on occupational exposures from the installation,repair, and disposal of most friction and construction products, the twoproduct groups for which exposures are likely to be highest during theselife cycle stages. For the installation and removal of construction products(roofing felt and A/C pipe, sheet, and shingle), air monitoring data wereavailable from several studies. Occupational populations (in terms of FTEs)were estimated on the basis of crew size, productivity, and total manufactureand import volumes of the products. Exposures associated with the replacementand repair of friction materials were estimated in a similar fashion. EPAestimates that 125,400 FTEs are exposed to asbestos during the installation,repair, and disposal of asbestos friction and construction products. Morethan 125,400 workers are actually exposed to asbestos during these processes(OSHA estimates that 556,320 persons are exposed), but many are exposedon a less than a full-time basis (Ref. 29). FTE exposures are listed inTable I of this Unit.  Very little monitoring data on occupational exposures during installation,repair, and disposal were available for the other asbestos products thatare subject to this rule, and EPA's estimates therefore do not includeexposures from the installation, repair, and disposal of these products.However, on the basis of the limited data that exist for these productsand on the basis of data for similar products and processes, EPA believesthat significant exposures during installation, repair, and disposal ofthese products do take place (Ref. 57). Therefore, EPA believes that itsanalysis underestimates exposures associated with these products. EPA conductedan analysis in order to gauge the possible impact of the absence of someoccupational exposure data on calculations of the rule's benefits; theresults of this analysis appear in Table II of this Unit and Table VIIIof Unit V.D.  In general, when data relating to a certain type of exposure could notbe obtained, EPA did not quantify that type of exposure, reflecting whatEPA considers to be a reasonable approach to risk assessment. EPA findsthe exposures quantified for this rule sufficient in themselves to supportEPA's risk assessment conclusions for asbestos. However, EPA notes thatif all exposures to asbestos from the products affected by this rule couldhave been quantified, the benefits calculated for this rule would probablyhave been significantly greater than noted in EPA's risk assessment, lendingfurther support to EPA's unreasonable risk finding for asbestos.  Much of EPA's occupational exposures data base for this rule representsexposure that took place before OSHA's lowered PEL of 0.2 f/cc became effectivein 1986. To estimate exposures taking place after the lowering of the PEL,EPA first lowered to 0.2 f/cc all data points which reported exposuresabove 0.2 f/cc. EPA then averaged these points with those points that werereported as lower than 0.2 f/cc for each job category in each product category.For purposes of this analysis, EPA considered it appropriate to assumethat previously high exposures will probably not be lowered significantlybelow the PEL. OSHA determined that 0.2 f/cc, which is 10 times lower thanthe previous PEL, was the lowest PEL that most of the asbestos industrycould feasibly achieve using work practices and engineering controls. Theasbestos industry challenged OSHA's standards, arguing that a PEL of 0.5f/cc was the lowest feasible standard, and OSHA acknowledged that someindustry sectors might not be able to control exposures to 0.2 f/cc withoutthe use of respirators. Thus, while EPA believes that it is possible thatsome companies are below the 0.2 f/cc PEL by some margin, it is probablethat others are not and that some of these actually exceed the PEL. EPAbelieves that adjusting previously high exposure points to 0.2 f/cc isa reasonable means of adjusting for facilities that may be above the PEL.In estimating the benefits of its 0.2 f/cc PEL, OSHA used somewhat differentassumptions than EPA has in this rule to estimate the impact of the PELon workplace exposure levels. OSHA's analysis adjusted all exposures inits data base that were at or above 0.2 f/cc to 0.15 f/cc in cases whereOSHA assumed that engineering controls were used. In cases where OSHA assumedthat respirators were used, OSHA reduced the exposures by a factor equalto the effective protection factor of the respirator. OSHA assumed thatexposures below 0.2 f/cc would be reduced by 20 percent due to engineeringcontrols. OSHA's approach assumes not only general compliance with itsfiber level standards, but also that, on average, those subject to thePEL will reduce their workplace exposures significantly below the standardsto ensure compliance. OSHA did not factor non-compliance into its analysisof the costs and benefits of the PEL because both costs and benefits declinein proportion to any non-compliance, leaving cost-benefit ratios for theOSHA rule unchanged.On the other hand, EPA's assessment of the costs and benefits of this ruleis affected by non-compliance with the OSHA PEL. EPA's approach assumesgeneral compliance with the PEL, but also accommodates the possibilitythat some level of non-compliance with the standard exists. As is discussedfurther below, OSHA issued many citations for violations of the asbestosstandards in the first year after they went into effect. Using OSHA's fiberlevel adjustment assumptions in place of EPA's to estimate the effectsof this rule results in an approximately 20 percent lower estimate of cancer-cases-avoidedfor occupational settings. However, if a non-compliance rate of 2 percent(a relatively low rate based on non-compliance rates in other Federal healthand environmental regulatory settings) is assumed in conjunction with theOSHA fiber level adjustments, the resulting estimated benefits are virtuallythe same as those estimated using EPA's assumption about fiber level averageexposure (Ref. 21). Therefore, EPA believes that its assumptions are appropriatefor purposes of calculating the benefits of this rule. In practice, givensome level of non-compliance with OSHA's asbestos regulations, actual cancercases that would have occurred as a result of that non-compliance willnow be prevented by this rule's product bans.One commenter maintained that EPA should base its analyses solely on thedata collected before OSHA promulgated its asbestos standard and shouldnot adjust the data to reflect compliance with the standard. However, EPAconsiders it reasonable to assume that previously high exposure levelshave been reduced to some lower level as a result of OSHA's action, andas discussed above, EPA has selected the PEL as a logical approximationof this level. Other commenters contended that EPA's approximation of occupationalexposures taking place after the lowering of the PEL was too high, arguingthat because exposure levels vary considerably from day to day, industrykeeps average exposures significantly below the PEL to guarantee constantcompliance. These commenters made similar arguments during OSHA's rulemakingsetting the new PEL. However, in that instance, the commenters used thevariability argument to support a claim that the PEL was infeasible becauseaverage exposures could not be kept low enough to guarantee constant compliance.OSHA refuted this argument, noting that day-to-day variability can be reducedby employers and that while exposures might be above the PEL some of thetime, a finding of technological feasibility does not require that employersbe able to comply with a standard constantly (51 FR 22653).Moreover, data from recent OSHA inspections do not support the assertionthat current exposures are significantly below the PEL. OSHA cited employersfor nearly 1,000 violations of its asbestos standards in the first yearafter the standards went into effect, and the violation most frequentlycited was the failure of employers to institute engineering controls tomaintain employee exposure at or below the PEL (Ref. 32). Personal monitoringdata from recent inspections showed that 91 out of 655 establishments inspectedhad concentrations of airborne asbestos above the PEL, and the averageconcentration level for all establishments inspected was 0.29 f/cc, 45percent higher than the PEL (Ref. 33). While respirators were in use inmany of the establishments with air concentrations higher than the PEL,20 percent of these establishments were cited for violations of respiratoryprotection provisions or for violations of the PEL (Ref. 49).On a related issue, some commenters stated that EPA had ignored the effectof using best available control technology (BACT) to reduce exposures,arguing that industry-wide exposure values are ``not relevant to determinationof the consequences of an effective PEL and consistent use of good workpractice.'' As is discussed more fully in Unit V.E. and in the Responseto Comments document, EPA has analyzed the likely effectiveness of mandatingthe use of BACT and has concluded that this regulatory option would notsufficiently reduce exposures to asbestos from the products affected bythis rule. For calculating the cancer-cases-avoided through regulation,EPA considers existing rather than best-case exposures to be the appropriatebaseline. The evidence discussed in the preceding paragraphs indicatesthat many workplaces do not utilize BACT and that the adjustments EPA hasmade to its exposure data account for the impact of the 0.2 f/cc PEL. WhereBACT is utilized. EPA's analysis has taken it into account. For instance,in its analysis of exposures during brake repair, EPA estimated that 9.6percent of brake repair shops used BACT, and EPA calculated an averageof industry-wide exposures including the relatively low exposures fromthis group.On September 14, 1988 (53 FR 35610), OSHA amended its Asbestos Standardsto incorporate an EL, which limits allowable short-term exposures to 1f/cc over a half-hour period. OSHA took this action after noting that controllingepisodic exposures to asbestos would lower the significant risk posed byasbestos in the workplace. However, while the EL will probably reduce workplaceexposures, EPA does not believe that this reduction will be very great.EPA bases its judgment on a number of observations regarding the natureof and circumstances surrounding episodic exposures.First, many exposures that are episodic are also unpredictable, defyingattempts to control them. In industrial settings, episodic exposures arelikely to be associated with unexpected events such as equipment breakdown(53 FR 35620). In the maintenance and repair sector of the constructionindustry, episodic exposures take place when individuals who only occasionallycome into contact with asbestos materials and who may not recognize suchmaterials disturb them accidentally or unwittingly in the course of theirwork (53 FR 35624). OSHA directs employers to conduct initial monitoringof employees' exposures where they ``may reasonably be expected'' to exceedthe excursion limit. However, if peak exposures cannot reasonably be expected,they are unlikely to be either monitored for or protected against.Second, the initial monitoring required to measure short-term, peak exposureswhere they are expected to occur is subject to error. To obtain accurateestimates of short-term exposures, monitoring must be conducted using thestrictest sampling strategies and analytical techniques. If the properprotocol is not observed precisely, violations of the EL can go undetected(53 FR 35618 and 35619).Third, where violations of the EL are detected and control measures areimplemented, these control measures will frequently be ineffective. OSHAexpects that for many of the employees exposed to predictable bursts ofairborne asbestos, including workers in industry and in building maintenanceand repair, respirator use will prove the only feasible means of controllingexposure (53 FR 35616 and 35624). Unfortunately, respiratory protectionhas not been found to be very reliable. OSHA ranked respirator use lastin its recommended hierarchy of controls in its 1986 revision to the asbestosstandards, observing:<ITAG tagnum="21">Respirators are capable of providing adequate protection only if theyare properly selected for the concentrations of airborne contaminants present,properly fitted to the employee, properly and conscientiously worn by theemployee, carefully maintained, and replaced when they have ceased to provideadequate protection. While theoretically it is possible for all of theseconditions to be met, it is more often the case that they are not (51 FR22692).</ITAG>The drawbacks cited above are aggravated if those using the respiratorsare not accustomed to working with them or with asbestos. OSHA states inits amendment establishing the EL that it ``is concerned about relyingon respirator use to meet the EL in the maintenance and repair sector ofthe construction industry,'' where contact with asbestos is often onlyoccasional (53 FR 35624). Finally, even if all the conditions mentionedabove are met, respirators will do nothing to reduce the quantity of asbestosreleased into the immediate environment of respirator wearers. Thus, duringthe activity that generates the airborne asbestos, persons near the respiratorwearer can be exposed to levels that are quite high even if they do notviolate the EL; and after the activity, all persons in the area, includingthose who have removed their respirators, can be exposed to dust that remainsairborne or that is reentrained after settling out.Like respirators, other control measures may reduce some short-term exposureswithout having much impact on long-term exposures. Some control measuresreplace one opportunity for exposure with another. For instance, to reduceshort-term exposures during brake repair, OSHA recommends that mechanicsutilize either a solvent spray or a vacuum enclosure equipped with a HighEfficiency Particulate and Aerosol (HEPA) filter. While both of these controlscan be effective in reducing short-term exposures during the brake job,exposures can be high later if the asbestos-contaminated solvent is allowedto remain in the area to evaporate, or if care is not taken during theremoval of the HEPA filter from the vacuum device (Ref. 29). Because establishmentsusing HEPA vacuum enclosures are exempt from monitoring under the OSHAstandard, high exposures during filter removal may not be detected. Again,as is the case for respirators, the effectiveness of the brake repair controlmeasures in reducing overall exposures depends heavily on the knowledgeand conscientiousness of the user. This is also true for shrouded tools,the control measure recommended by OSHA for reducing short-term exposuresduring the cutting of A/C pipe (53 FR 35622).Fourth, the implementation of additional control measures will be difficult,expensive, and time-consuming for much of the regulated community, discouragingcompliance with the EL. For instance, although some brake repair establishmentsservicing large government fleets utilize HEPA vacuum enclosures, smallerestablishments repairing brakes less frequently are less likely to investin these relatively expensive devices. Moreover, while employees in governmentbrake repair shops are usually paid by the hour, employees in private establishmentsare often paid by the job, which discourages the use of time-consumingwork practices and engineering controls (Ref. 50). A similar situationexists in the maintenance and repair sector of the construction industrywhere, as noted earlier, many smaller building firms may find it difficultto institute adequate respirator programs. In these industry sectors andothers, limitations on resources and time may discourage the diligent useof control measures that is required to achieve substantial reductionsin occupational exposures to asbestos. The record of compliance with OSHA's0.2 f/cc PEL supports this projection. The provisions most frequently violatedin the year after OSHA's 1986 PEL went into effect included the requirementsto conduct initial and daily monitoring, to institute engineering controls,and to institute a respirator program, all of which are as important toachieving the EL as the PEL. In fact, achievement of the EL requires stricterapplication of these requirements than does achievement of the PEL, makinguniform compliance more difficult. Moreover, the structure of the brakerepair and building maintenance and repair industries, in which numerous,small businesses are the norm, will also make enforcement of the EL difficult.In summary, attempts to reduce short-term exposures are likely to haveonly a limited effect in eliminating the exposure risks posed by asbestos.Peak exposures are both unpredictable and difficult to detect. Effortsto control them must rely largely on respirators and work practice controls,control measures whose effectiveness is uneven, depending upon the conscientiousnessof the user. Implementation of these control measures also requires resourcesthat employers and employees may have difficulty investing, and the recordof compliance with the 0.2 f/cc PEL indicates that in many cases, the investmentwill not be made. For these reasons, occupational exposures will probablynot be greatly lowered as a result of the EL. Although the estimates givenbelow may slightly overestimate occupational exposures in those cases wherethe impact of the EL is greatest, EPA believes that any overestimate islikely to be minor overall.The following table summarizes EPA's estimates of occupational exposuresto asbestos by product category and process. This table and the other tablesin this Unit present exposure levels in terms of millions of fibers breathedper year (106 f/yr), an index of exposure that accounts for varying breathingrates, air concentration levels, and frequencies and durations of exposureamong workers, consumers, and the general population. Assuming an 8-hourworkday, a 250-day work year (both conditions do not always hold in theindustries below), and a breathing rate of 1.3 m3/hr, 100andmultiply;106fibers/year = 0.038 f/cc. Assuming a 45-year working lifetime exposure,exposure to 100andmultiply;106 fibers/year carries a risk of 1.29andmultiply;10-3(1.29 in 1,000) of developing cancer (51 FR 35610). In many cases, blankspaces in the table signify that information was not available, not thatno exposure takes place. The high fiber levels and relatively low populationsgiven for the repair and disposal of A/C shingle, A/C sheet, and roofingfelt are a result of the FTE approach to the calculation of benefits (cancer-cases-avoided).In reality, per person fiber levels are lower and populations are higher.Except as noted, all exposure information presented in this Unit of thepreamble dates from 1985, the most recent year for which a complete setof data was available in the Market and Exposure Surveys. In calculatingthe cancer-cases-avoided through the rule, however, EPA has assumed thatexposed populations would decline at the same rate as production volumes.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table I_Occupational Exposures </T4><H1>Product </H1><H1>Primary manufact. </H1><H2>Pop. </H2><H2>10</H2> 6 f/yr <H1>Secondary manufact. </H1><H2>Pop. </H2><H2>10</H2> 6 f/yr <H1>Install. </H1><H2>Pop. </H2><H2>10</H2> 6 f/yr <H1>Repair/disposal </H1><H2>Pop. </H2><H2>10</H2> 6 f/yr <ITAG tagnum="1">Commercial paper 1 <D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rollboard 1 <D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Millboard <D>12 </D><D>145 </D><D>448 </D><D>57 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pipeline wrap <D>35 </D><D>134 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Beater-add gaskets 2 <D>235</D><D>110</D><D>1,296</D><D>57</D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Roofing felt <D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>396 </D><D>439 </D><D>263 </D><D>296 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Flooring felt 1 <D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Corrugated paper 1 <D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Specialty paper <D>2 </D><D>111 </D><D>149 </D><D>57 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">V/A floor tile 1 <D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A/C pipe <D>286 </D><D>270 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>933 </D><D>296 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A/C flat sheet <D>53 </D><D>478 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>49 </D><D>723 </D><D>61 </D><D>2,080 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A/C corrugated sheet <D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>7 </D><D>723 </D><D>9 </D><D>2,080 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A/C shingles <D>11 </D><D>473 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>323 </D><D>130 </D><D>225 </D><D>244 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Drum brake linings <D>1,565 </D><D>385 </D><D>2,719 </D><D>125 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>86,398 </D><D>376 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Disc brake pads, LMV <D>916 </D><D>390 </D><D>300 </D><D>146 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>32,568 </D><D>386 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Disc brake pads, HV <D>15 </D><D>385 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>117 </D><D>390 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Brake blocks <D>283 </D><D>377 </D><D>19 </D><D>127 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>3,935 </D><D>388 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Clutch facings 3 <D>239 </D><D>406 </D><D>48 </D><D>166 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>73 </D><D>125 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Automatic transmission components <D>11 </D><D>113 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Friction materials <D>191 </D><D>398 </D><D>28 </D><D>195 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>43 </D><D>120 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Asbestos clothing 1 <D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sheet gaskets 2 <D>167 </D><D>208 </D><D>885 </D><D>276 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Roof coatings <D>582 </D><D>273 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Non-roof coatings <D>553 </D><D>220 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><F/>1 No U.S. manufacture or import. <F/>2 Exposures listed include a relatively small number of exposuresposed during the production of specialty industrial gaskets, which arenot banned by this rule. <F/>3 Repair and disposal figures include rebuilding only.</ITAG></ITAG> EPA was not able to quantify all occupational exposures to asbestos. Asnoted earlier, there are few data on exposures during the installation,use, repair, removal, and disposal of a number of products, although exposureis believed to take place during these processes for many of these products.Moreover, existing exposure data do not reflect the elevated levels ofairborne asbestos that can result from unpredictable episodic events, suchas the accidental disturbance of asbestos material by a maintenance worker.As a means of representing part of this recognized but unmeasured exposure,EPA estimated occupational exposures associated with the installation,repair, and disposal of certain products on the basis of the limited datathat exist for these products and processes and on the basis of exposuredata for similar products and processes. Populations (in terms of FTEs)were estimated on the basis of production volumes and the person-hourstypically required for the activity of concern. These estimates are presentedin the table below, and are used as indicated in this preamble to assessthe possible impact of the absence of some occupational exposure data oncalculations of the rule's benefits. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table II_Analogous Exposure Estimates </T4><H1>Product </H1><H1>Installation </H1><H2>Population </H2><H2>10</H2>6 f/yr <H1>Repair/Disposal </H1><H2>Population </H2><H2>10</H2>6 f/yr <ITAG tagnum="1">Millboard <D>20 </D><D>57 </D><D>20 </D><D>57 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pipeline wrap <D>2,725 </D><D>52 </D><D>2,725 </D><D>23 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Beater-add gaskets 1 <D>53,417 </D><D>57 </D><D>53,417 </D><D>57 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Specialty paper <D>350 </D><D>57 </D><D>350 </D><D>57 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A/C pipe <D>(</D>3) <D>(</D>3) <D>1,458 </D><D>296 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Clutch facings 2 <D>  </D><D>  </D><D>475 </D><D>395 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sheet gaskets 1 <D>5,741 </D><D>276 </D><D>5,741 </D><D>276 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Non-roof coatings <D>1,780 </D><D>390 </D><D>  </D><D>  </D><F/>1 Exposures listed include a relatively small number of exposuresposed during the production of specialty industrial gaskets, which arenot banned by this rule. <F/>2 Exposures listed under Repair and Disposal here take place inaddition to those listed under Repair and Disposal in Table I. <F/>3 See table I.</ITAG></ITAG> In view of the information presented in this Unit, EPA concludes that despiteOSHA's recent promulgation of new, stricter standards for exposure to asbestosin the workplace, occupational exposures and risks remain unacceptablyhigh. As noted earlier, OSHA has observed that risks at the 0.2 f/cc PELremain significant but that feasibility constraints prevent OSHA from settingthe PEL any lower. EPA's extensive data base on occupational exposures,including information collected after OSHA's 0.2 f/cc PEL became effective,indicates that individual risk remains higher than 1 in 1,000 for tensof thousands of people who work with asbestos products. b. <T3>Non-occupational exposures.</T3> Outside of the work environment, mostof the U.S. population is exposed to asbestos that is released during thelife cycle of asbestos products. Some of these people are consumers whoare exposed to asbestos as they install, use, repair, remove, and disposeof asbestos products that they have purchased, such as roofing materialsand automotive brakes. Others are exposed to asbestos released into theambient air during the manufacture, installation, use, repair, and disposalof asbestos products. Risks from non-occupational exposure are not onlyincurred by very large populations but occasionally can be quite high.EPA estimates that approximately 40 million consumers and 19 million ofthose exposed to ambient asbestos incur risks of 1 in 1,000,000 or moreof developing cancer from their exposure. Approximately 223,000 of thoseexposed to ambient asbestos incur lifetime risks of 1 in 10,000 or greaterof developing cancer (Ref. 30). Historically, consumer exposures to asbestos have not received as muchattention as occupational exposures to asbestos, but they are a sourceof significant concern. While consumer exposures are not likely to be asfrequent for individual consumers as occupational exposures are for workers,they are likely to be more intense than occupational exposures becauseconsumers generally lack the exposure-reducing equipment and expertiseavailable to protect workers. For instance, consumers replacing their brakesare not likely to use either solvent spray or a HEPA enclosure, the twopieces of equipment recommended by OSHA for use in reducing exposures toasbestos during brake repair. Consumers may in fact employ a shop or householdvacuum cleaner to remove asbestos dust from brake assemblies, a techniquethat can lead to very high exposures because most vacuum cleaners failto capture asbestos dust and simply force it back out into the air (Ref.59). Consumer exposures are also experienced by a much larger population thanoccupational exposures. According to two recent, independent consumer surveys,approximately 40 million consumers repair their own brakes once every 3years, and other consumer surveys indicate that at least 840,000 consumersrepair their own roofs every 4 years (Ref. 31). These figures do not includeconsumer populations exposed to asbestos from the installation, repair,and removal of gaskets, A/C sheet, and A/C shingle, other processing duringwhich consumer exposures are likely, but not quantified. Populations annuallyexposed to asbestos during brake and roof repair are presented along withequivalent information for exposures to ambient asbestos in Table IV ofthis Unit. Air concentration levels were estimated from occupational data.This may result in underestimates because, as noted above, consumers areunlikely to have access to the exposure-reducing work practices and engineeringcontrols used by workers. The ability of asbestos to persist and to spread in the environment makesit a hazard to millions of people who may not have any direct occupationalor consumer contact with asbestos products. Several tons of asbestos arereleased to the ambient air during mining and milling, during the manufactureof asbestos products, during brake use and repair, and during constructionand demolition (Ref. 29). Additional asbestos is released from asbestosproducts during other parts of their life cycles. Once released, this asbestosaccumulates and spreads in the environment. Air monitoring studies havedemonstrated that urban areas, with their high concentrations of motorvehicles, construction, and demolition, generally have levels of airborneasbestos one or two orders of magnitude higher than rural areas. Whilerural background levels range between 0.01 and 0.1 andCx.18;g/m3, readingsin large cities range from 1 andCx.18;g/m3 upward (Ref. 3). Thus, asbestosreleased during the life cycle of asbestos products is capable of elevatingambient levels of asbestos to several times the background level. The release estimates and atmospheric modeling that EPA used to estimateambient exposures capture at least part of the contribution of asbestos-containingproducts produced and used in the future to ambient levels. For this rulemaking,EPA calculated ambient exposures attributable to releases from mining andmilling, the manufacture of asbestos products, brake use and repair, andconstruction with asbestos products. Since the proposal, these calculationshave been expanded and refined to include ambient exposures from brakerepair, construction, and demolition. To estimate ambient exposures attributable to milling and product manufacturing,EPA first estimated air emissions per facility in milling and in each productcategory, using production volumes and the efficiency of pollution controlequipment for each product category. EPA then used atmospheric dispersionmodeling based on site-specific meteorological data to estimate ambientconcentrations and exposed populations. Because the number of plants involvedin the manufacture of asbestos products is quite large, monitoring airconcentrations around each plant is impractical. The atmospheric modelingused in EPA's asbestos exposure analyses has been tested on other pollutantsand has been found generally to predict their concentrations within a factorof two (Ref. 47). As explained in the Asbestos Exposure Assessment (Ref. 29), EPA's methodologyto estimate asbestos air releases from manufacturing and processing plantsis presented in the March 5, 1987 draft EPA report entitled National EmissionStandards for Asbestos-Background Information for Proposed Standards (Ref.46). This document presents emission scenarios based on the only publishedstudy on the efficiency of baghouses in the asbestos industry. For eachindustry, three emissions scenarios were presented for baghouses operatingin normal, non-failure mode: minimum, maximum, and ``best estimate'' emissions.These scenarios were based upon three different assumptions regarding thesensitivity of the gravimetric analytical method used in the study. Forall three scenarios, TWA efficiencies were also calculated taking intoaccount occasional baghouse failures. Time-weighted efficiencies for variousasbestos product categories range from between 99.965 and 99.659 percentunder the maximum emission scenario with occasional baghouse failure assumedto 99.99 percent for all products under the minimum emission scenario withno baghouse failure assumed. Under the ``best estimate'' emission scenariowith occasional baghouse failure assumed, efficiencies range between 99.968and 99.988. For the maximum emission scenario with no baghouse failure assumed, a normaloperating mode consisting of two efficiencies, 99.95 percent for asbestosproduct categories with high inlet concentrations (greater than 0.1 grain/cuft) and 99.67 percent for product categories with low inlet concentrations(less than 0.1 grain/cu ft) was used. The asbestos product categories withhigh inlet concentrations, for which an efficiency of 99.95 percent wasused, are asbestos-cement sheet and pipe, friction materials, and reinforcedplastics. Those with low inlet concentrations, for which an efficiencyof 99.67 percent was used, are paper, coatings and sealants, gaskets, andtextiles. For purposes of comparison, EPA presents some results in thispreamble using both the maximum emissions scenario with no baghouse failureassumed and the ``best-estimate'' emissions scenario with occasional baghousefailure assumed. However, in many cases, EPA presents results in this preambleusing only the maximum emissions scenario with no baghouse failure assumed.EPA estimates that 122 million people are exposed to ambient asbestos releasedduring milling and product manufacturing. Under the maximum emission scenariowith no baghouse failure assumed, a number of people would incur risksof at least 1 in 1,000 of developing cancer from a lifetime of exposure(Ref. 30). Under the ``best estimate'' assumption of baghouse efficiencywith occasional baghouse failure assumed, many thousands of persons wouldincur risks of at least 1 in 10,000 of developing cancer from ambient exposureto asbestos from plant emissions. Table III of this Unit, based on the maximum emissions scenario with nobaghouse failure assumed, lists the exposure levels and populations associatedwith plant releases for each product category. For each category, exposurelevels have been averaged over the entire population exposed. As detailedin Unit V.F and in the Asbestos Modeling Study, actual exposures are muchhigher for some people and lower for others, but the total populationsand average exposures presented here provide a general gauge of exposurefor each product category and were used to calculate the benefits (cancer-cases-avoided)of the rule.Averaging has no effect on EPA's calculation of benefits because EPA usesa linear dose-response model to project cancer-cases-avoided. A lineardose-response model assumes that an individual's risk of developing cancerincreases at a constant rate with his or her exposure to asbestos. Thus,for populations of equal size, a given increment of exposure carries thesame amount of risk regardless of any differences that may exist betweenthe populations in the magnitude of the exposures that they experiencein addition to it. For example, if half of a population is exposed to anasbestos concentration of 0.19 f/cc and half is exposed to an asbestosconcentration of 0.21 f/cc, the expected incidence of cancer for the entirepopulation can be calculated by ``moving,'' for the purposes of the analysis,0.01 f/cc of exposure from the 0.21 f/cc population to the 0.19 f/cc population,yielding an average exposure level of 0.2 f/cc for the entire population.For populations of the same size, the 0.01 f/cc carries the same risk whetherit is associated with an additional exposure of 0.2 f/cc or of 0.19 f/cc.As long as the cumulative population exposure (the sum of the productsof the various exposure levels and the populations exposed to each) remainsconstant, it can be distributed in any way among the population withoutaffecting the calculation of expected cancer cases. The following TableIII, based on the maximum emissions scenario with no baghouse failure assumed,lists the exposure levels and populations associated with plant releasesfor each product category.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,10,1.9</C><T4>Table III_Exposures to Ambient Asbestos From Primary and SecondaryManufacturing</T4><H1>Product</H1><H1>Population exposed</H1><H1>Average exposure (10\6\ f/yr)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Commercial paper<D>0</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rollboard<D>0</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Millboard<D>5,747,875</D><D>0.0232</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pipeline wrap<D>4,847,937</D><D>0.0476</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Beater-add gaskets \1\<D>37,169,666</D><D>0.0373</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">High-grade electrical paper<D>254,772</D><D>0.405</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Roofing felt<D>0</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Flooring felt<D>0</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Corrugated paper<D>0</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">V/A floor tile<D>0</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A/C pipe<D>3,313,602</D><D>0.167</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A/C flat sheet<D>21,232,368</D><D>0.0218</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A/C corrugated sheet<D>0</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A/C shingle<D>891,143</D><D>0.00361</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Drum brake linings (LMV)<D>34,542,107</D><D>0.0575</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Disc brake pads (LMV)<D>24,065,022</D><D>0.0214</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Disc brake pads (HV)<D>1,704,883</D><D>0.000000827</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Brake blocks<D>9,785,424</D><D>0.00388</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Clutch facings<D>8,761,571</D><D>0.0027</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Automatic transmission components<D>0</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Friction materials<D>12,922,247</D><D>0.00234</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Asbestos clothing<D>0</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sheet gaskets \1\<D>43,612,019</D><D>0.00561</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Roof coatings<D>84,570,429</D><D>0.00233</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Non-roof coatings<D>70,389,388</D><D>0.0000394</D><F>\1\ Exposures listed include a relatively small number of exposuresposed during the production of specialty industrial gaskets, which arenot banned by this rule.</F></ITAG></ITAG>To calculate exposures to asbestos released into the ambient air from miningand construction sites and from brake repair facilities, EPA estimatedemissions on the basis of its information on occupational exposures duringmining, construction, and brake repair.

Second, EPA performed atmospheric dispersionmodeling of these emissions to estimate concentrations in each city. Third,EPA grouped the cities together by population, obtaining average concentrationsfor each group. To estimate the populations exposed to each of these averageconcentrations nationwide, EPA added up the populations living in the U.S.cities similar in size to the cities of each group. Because none of theoriginal 24 cities had fewer than 25,000 inhabitants and because vehiculartraffic is less concentrated in rural areas than in cities, populationsliving in areas with fewer than 25,000 inhabitants were assumed to haveno exposure to asbestos released during brake use. Finally, EPA averagedthe estimated concentrations over all population groups from areas withmore than 25,000 inhabitants, weighting each concentration by the populationexposed to it. Using this technique, EPA estimates that 100 million people(the 1980 U.S. population living in areas of more than 25,000 people) areexposed to 8.7 andmultiply; 10^5 andCx.18;g/m3 of asbestos resulting from theuse of asbestos brakes (Ref. 31). The individual risk of developing cancerfrom a lifetime of exposure to this concentration of asbestos is estimatedat approximately 1 in a million, a level which is significant given thevery large population exposed. Because populations living in areas withfewer than 25,000 people (55.5 percent of the U.S. population) probablyare exposed to at least some asbestos from brake use, this estimate shouldbe considered a lower bound.In addition to the exposures quantified above, EPA believes that othersignificant ambient exposures occur that cannot be easily quantified. Onetype of unquantified exposure results from releases of asbestos that aredifficult to measure, such as the gradual weathering and disintegrationof construction products used outdoors. A number of studies indicate thatthese releases are probably significant. Indirect evidence of weatheringcomes from several studies of corrosion in A/C pipe; soft, acid water hasbeen found to dissolve A/C pipe in some instances (Ref. 64). Because rainwater is likely to be both soft and acid, it is likely to be very corrosiveto A/C materials.Direct evidence of weathering supports this projection. A study of erosionin A/C shingle found visible differences in wear between areas of shinglethat were exposed to the elements and areas that were protected, and inspectionof the worn areas with a scanning electron microscope revealed a networkof asbestos fibers on the shingle surface. In addition, concentrationsof asbestos as high as 543 million fibers per liter (mfL) were found inrunoff collected from roofs covered in A/C single. Ten mfL is consideredabnormally high (Ref. 51). Another study detected asbestos releases fromconstruction materials after a shingle storm; several air samples takenafter a heavy rain at a school with A/C walkways and roof panels showedsignificantly elevated asbestos concentrations (Ref. 1). Thus, in areaswhere there is widespread use of A/C sheet and A/C shingle, weatheringis probably an important source of ambient asbestos.Another type of unquantified exposure results from the tendencies of asbestosto persist in the environment and to reenter the air after settling out.Both the durability and aerodynamic properties of asbestos are well documented.The extraordinary ability of asbestos to survive for long periods undera variety of different conditions is often cited as an important reasonfor its incorporation into a number of products, including paper productsused as insulation, friction materials, asbestos cement products, packings,and gaskets. Reentrainment is supported by studies finding high airborneasbestos concentrations not only near waste piles but upwind as well asdownwind of point sources (Ref. 48), a finding most likely to result fromthe resuspension of asbestos deposited earlier by winds blowing in theopposite direction. This evidence indicates that over time, asbestos buildsup to some degree in surface waters and soils and that some of this build-upis continuously reentrained in the air. This process of build-up and reentrainmentis referred to as environmental loading. Because the likelihood of reentrainmentin the environment depends upon a number of factors that are difficultto measure, including the fraction of asbestos that is washed away by rainfallor buried under later soil deposits, reentrainment has not been includedin EPA's atmospheric modeling. Thus, EPA has not quantified exposures attributableto environmental loading. Nonetheless, EPA is very concerned about thepossible impact of this process on exposures to ambient asbestos. Givenits durability, asbestos may persist in the environment for a decade ormore after its original release, and environmental loading is likely tobe most severe in urban areas, where large populations both create andcome into contact with asbestos releases. In fact, the elevated concentrationsof asbestos found by numerous studies in urban areas probably result atleast in part from environmental loading. The potential longevity of therisk posed by environmental loading was a major factor in EPA's decisionto eliminate that risk at its source by banning most asbestos products.Some commenters argued that exposures to asbestos released into the ambientair by the manufacture, importation, processing, and use of asbestos-containingproducts are insignificant because the risks associated with such exposuresare very small. However, individual risks from asbestos in the ambientair can be quite high for persons living near asbestos product plants,construction sites, or other sources of release. As noted earlier, underthe maximum emission scenario with no baghouse failure assumed, a numberof people would incur risks of at least 1 in 1,000 of developing cancerby living in such areas. Under the ``best estimate'' emissions scenario,many thousands of persons would still incur a risk of at least 1 in 10,000from ambient exposure to asbestos from plant emissions. Moreover, whilemost people exposed to ambient asbestos from asbestos-containing productsincur individual risks smaller than 1 in 1,000, the number of people exposedis extremely large, making the total risk a concern.c. <T3>Exposure from imported and exported asbestos products. </T3>EPA hasdetermined that significant exposure is likely from imported asbestos products.Although some exposure to U.S. populations is avoided when asbestos productsare manufactured abroad and imported rather than manufactured in the U.S.(foreign exposures and resulting cancer cases are not included in the estimatesfor this rule), significant exposures still occur after import of the productsinto this country. U.S. exposures occur during transport, installation,use, maintenance, removal, and disposal of the product. As noted above,large numbers of people are exposed to asbestos during these activitiesand the level of exposure is often quite high.Significant exposures also occur during the U.S. portion of the life cycleof asbestos-containing products manufactured in this country for export.These exposures occur during the mining and milling of asbestos fiber andthe processing of fiber into products. Families of workers and populationsliving near mining and manufacturing sites are also exposed to asbestosas a result of these activities. Therefore, as is discussed in Unit III.Bof this preamble, EPA finds under section 12(a)(2) of TSCA that the manufactureor processing for export of asbestos-containing products that are subjectto the rule will present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health.Therefore, the manufacture and processing of asbestos-containing productsfor export is not exempted from this rule under section 12(a)(1), and issubject to the rule's bans.d. <T3>Exposure conclusions.</T3> In conclusion, EPA finds the intensity,scope, and potential longevity of human exposure to asbestos released duringthe life cycles of the products subject to this rule cause for seriousconcern. In spite of efforts to control exposure, asbestos is releasedand inhaled at all stages of the life cycles of asbestos products; extensiveexposures have been quantified for workers, consumers, and the generalpopulation. EPA estimates that thousands of asbestos workers and membersof the general population incur individual risks near 1 in 1,000 from exposureto asbestos released from the products subject to this rule and that millionsof people incur risks near 1 in 1,000,000 from such exposure. These risksare very large. Moreover, evidence indicates that significant exposurestake place that cannot be quantified. EPA is especially concerned aboutexposures from environmental loading, which may occur long after the initialrelease of asbestos from a product.B. Environmental EffectsThe unreasonable risk finding for this rule is based on the risks to humanhealth posed by exposure to asbestos. These risks are the most readilyquantifiable consequences of the commercial use of asbestos and are sufficientto support the actions taken in this rule. However, EPA is concerned aboutthe potential environmental effects of ambient loading due to continuedmanufacture, importation, processing, and use of commercial asbestos products.Exposure to asbestos fibers has been clearly shown in both human and animalstudies to cause severe health effects. Effects on wildlife have not beenquantified for purposes of this rule. However, because asbestos fibersare extremely durable and transportable, EPA believes that continued asbestosuse will leave a legacy of serious health and environmental effects dueto unnaturally high concentrations of asbestos in the ambient air.C. Asbestos SubstitutesThis Unit discusses the relative availability of substitutes for asbestosin asbestos-containing products and the potential health hazards posedby such substitutes. EPA has found that suitable substitutes currentlyexist for most uses of asbestos. EPA believes that the benefits to societyof asbestos-containing products are relatively small because of the currentavailability of many substitutes and the expected development of othersafter promulgation of this final rule.1. <T3>Availability of substitutes. </T3> This subject is described in moredetail in Volume III, Appendix F of the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA).Further responses to comments on these subjects can be found in the Responseto Comments document. The availability of substitutes for the various productgroupings subject to this rule are discussed in Unit V.F. of this preamble.The following Table V lists currently-available major substitutes for asbestos-containingproducts that are banned by this rule and the market shares for each productcategory projected for the substitutes in the absence of asbestos. Thisbreakdown does not take into account the development of new substitutesor new applications of existing substitutes since the preparation of theRIA. It also does not account for the likely development of new substitutesbefore the effective date of this rule's bans. EPA is aware that it maynot have identified all substitutes for asbestos-containing products andthat the costs of the rule may be overstated as a result.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table V. _Projected Market Shares of Current Substitutes</T4><H1>Product and substitute </H1><H1>Approximate Substitute Market Share (percent)</H1>  Pipeline wrap:<ITAG tagnum="2">Mineral felt <D>48</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Safelt (R) <D>32</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Duraglass (R) <D>20  </D></ITAG>Beater-add gaskets:<ITAG tagnum="2">Cellulose <D>25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Aramid <D>30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Fibrous glass <D>20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Polytetrafluoroethylene <D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Graphite <D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Ceramic fibers <D>5  </D></ITAG>Sheet gaskets:<ITAG tagnum="2">Para-aramid <D>30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Fibrous glass <D>25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Graphite <D>15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Cellulose <D>15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Polytetrafluoroethylene <D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Ceramic <D>5  </D></ITAG>Roofing felt:<ITAG tagnum="2">Fiberglass felt <D>40</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Modified bitumen <D>50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Single-ply membrane <D>10  </D></ITAG>A/C pipe:<ITAG tagnum="2">Polyvinylchloride (PVC) <D>93</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Ductile iron <D>7  </D></ITAG>A/C flat sheet:<ITAG tagnum="2">Calcium silicate <D>76</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Non-calcium silicate <D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Laboratory sheet <D>20  </D></ITAG>A/C corrugated sheet:<ITAG tagnum="2">Fiberglass reinforced plastic <D>48</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Aluminum <D>32</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Steel <D>11</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Polyvinylchloride <D>9  </D></ITAG>A/C shingles:<ITAG tagnum="2">Wood <D>32</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Vinyl <D>27</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Asphalt <D>20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Aluminum <D>19</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Tile <D>2  </D></ITAG>Drum brake linings:<ITAG tagnum="2">Non-asbestos organics <D>99</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Semi-metallic <D>1  </D></ITAG>Disc brake pads (LMV and HMV): <ITAG tagnum="2">Semi-metallic <D>100  </D></ITAG>Brake blocks: <ITAG tagnum="2">Non-asbestos organics <D>99</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Semi-metallic <D>1</D></ITAG>Clutch facings: <ITAG tagnum="2">European woven <D>50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">U.S. woven <D>30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Molded aramid <D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Molded fiberglass <D>10  </D></ITAG>Automatic transmission components:<ITAG tagnum="2">Cellulose <D>100  </D></ITAG>Other friction materials;<ITAG tagnum="2">Fiberglass andamp; para-aramid <D>100  </D></ITAG>Millboard: <ITAG tagnum="2">Standard board <D>80</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Premium board <D>20  </D></ITAG>Specialty paper:<ITAG tagnum="2">Earth and cellulose <D>50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Loose cellulose <D>50  </D></ITAG>Roof coatings:<ITAG tagnum="2">Cellulose <D>87</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Polyethylene <D>8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Other <D>5  </D></ITAG>Non-roof coatings:<ITAG tagnum="2">Synthetic fibers <D>70</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Clay and mineral <D>30</D></ITAG></ITAG>  Substitutes for asbestos products are steadily being developed and acceptedin the marketplace. It should be noted that a number of products that aresubject to this rule's bans are no longer manufactured or imported in theU.S. In these cases, viable substitutes have apparently forced asbestos-containingproducts from the U.S. market. An increasing rate of availability and acceptanceof substitutes is evidenced by a more rapid decrease in asbestos use inmost product categories than was predicted in the RIA for the proposal.Public comments have identified new subsitutes and indicated that substituteprices have decreased substantially beyond the estimates generated in theRIA for this final rule. In addition, EPA believes that this rule willfurther spur the development of substitutes, thereby increasing availabilityand decreasing costs. 2.<T3> Health risk review of fibrous asbestos substitutes.</T3> This Unitaddresses the potential health risks caused by exposure to various fibersprojected to replace asbestos in products banned by this rule. This subjectis discussed in more detail in (1) ``Review of Recent Epidemiological Investigationson Populations Exposed to Selected Non-asbestos Fibers'' (Ref. 35); (2)``Durable Fiber Exposure Assessment'' (Ref. 36); (3) ``Durable Fiber IndustryProfile and Market Outlook'' (Ref. 37); and (4) ``Health Hazard Assessmentof Non-asbestos Fibers'' (Ref. 38). Further responses to comments on thissubject can be found in the Response to Comments document.Based on available information and a public health policy regarding asbestos,EPA has more concern about the continued use and exposure to asbestos thanit has for the future replacement of asbestos in the products subject tothis rule with other fibrous substances. Available information about thefibrous substitutes under review for this rulemaking supports the conclusionthat the fibrous substitutes appear to pose a lower human health hazardthan asbestos (Ref. 38). However, due to limited data, EPA cannot quantifythe risk that may be posed by fibrous asbestos substitutes. EPA believesit is prudent public health policy to regulate asbestos rather than todelay regulation until all risks of substitute products are definitivelydetermined. This conclusion is based on a consideration of (1) Availabledata on the health hazards and exposures posed by asbestos and its substitutes;(2) the factors that enhance or mitigate fiber pathogenicity; (3) an understandingof the deficiencies of the data available on health hazards and exposuresof substitutes; and (4) EPA's public health policy of reducing known, serioushealth risks.a.<T3> Background.</T3> EPA, for the proposed rule, performed a review ofthe available hazard and exposure information on eight fibrous substancesthat could substitute for asbestos in ``Asbestos Substitutes and RelatedMaterials'' (Ref. 39). In response to public comments received on the proposal,EPA conducted an extensive review of available information and updatedits hazard and exposure assessment of fibrous asbestos substitutes (seeRefs. 35, 36, 37, and 38).Specifically, this analysis included six man-made or synthetic fibrousmaterials (aramid fibers, carbon fiber, ceramic fibers, fibrous glass,mineral wool, and polyolefin fibers), and two naturally-occurring fibers(attapulgite and wollastonite). These eight fibers were individually selectedfor review because (1) They are commercially important; (2) they are potentiallythe major fibrous substitutes for asbestos; (3) they represent fiber typeswith broadly different physical and chemical characteristics; and (4) hazardand exposure data are available. EPA chose to place its emphasis on thereview of fibrous substitutes because their morphological similarity toasbestos suggested that they may induce cancer. Other non-fibrous substitutes,specifically, wood and other cellulose products, cement, and bricks, appearto pose little or no health hazard and, for this reason, their potentialhealth effects have not been analyzed in detail for purposes of this rule.b. <T3>Health effects of fibrous substitutes.</T3> EPA conducted a comprehensivereview of the experimental and epidemiological hazard data for the eightfibrous substitutes (Refs. 35 and 38). Available epidemiological and toxicologicaldata indicate that inhalation exposure to some fibrous substitutes maybe associated with malignant and non-malignant diseases in humans. However,the evidence of carcinogenicity and fibrogenicity of these substitutesis more limited than for asbestos. Based on available data, EPA has concludedthat, under similar experimental conditions, the fibrous substitutes aregenerally less biologically active and pathogenic than asbestos (Ref. 38).Unlike the fibrous substitutes, asbestos is a well-recognized, potent humancarcinogen, which also causes non-malignant pulmonary effects. At thistime, EPA cannot make a definitive assessment of the biological activityand pathogenicity of fibrous substitutes in comparison with asbestos becauseavailable data on the health effects of the substitutes are incomplete.EPA has not derived a carcinogenic potency for any of the fibrous asbestossubstitutes suspected to pose a carcinogenic concern, because either availableepidemiological data and/or animal inhalation data are inadequate to establisha quantitative exposure-response relationship or tumor response has onlybeen observed in animals via non-physiological routes of administration,such as intraperitoneal injection (Ref. 38).One commenter contended that a potency value could be determined for fibrousglass and mineral wool based on epidemiological data and concluded thatthe potency may be comparable to or exceed the potency established forasbestos. EPA has concluded that a potency value cannot be derived forfibrous glass because the epidemiological evidence for carcinogenicityof these substances is inadequate. The data cited by commenters do notshow consistent elevation of lung cancer risks in exposed workers or providesufficient information to demonstrate a dose-response relationship (Ref.35). Further, it is not appropriate to compute potency values from theavailable experimental data because the inhalation studies in animals didnot produce tumorigenic responses (Ref. 38). Similarly, carcinogenic potencycannot be determined for mineral wool because dose-response informationis not available from existing epidemiological studies (Ref. 35) and notumorigenic responses were found in available inhalation studies (Ref.38).The commenter also stated that a unit cancer risk could be developed foraramid fibers using results from an animal inhalation bioassay for ultrafinepara-aramid. The commenter made use of the linearized multi-stage procedureto calculate risk. In calculating the unit cancer risk value, the commenteronly considered a subset of the bioassay data (Ref. 56). Consequently,EPA does not believe that the analysis presented by the commenter adequatelyreflects the results of the bioassay (Ref. 56). EPA is continuing to gatheradditional information to evaluate potential cancer risk of respirablearamid fibrils. Additionally, EPA is assessing the appropriate model touse to extrapolate cancer risk for aramid fibrils.Unprocessed commercial-grade para-aramid, a type of aramid fiber, is manufacturedin sizes that are too large to be respirable (Ref. 36). In addition, notall types of aramid fibers are expected to produce fibrils (e.g., continuouspara-aramid) (Ref. 36). The para-aramid used in the cited animal studywas a highly respirable material made specifically for the study (Ref.38). Although the commercial-grade of para-aramid is believed to have thepotential to generate respirable fibers as the small fibrils peel off fromthe non-respirable core matrix, exposure data are too limited to determineif fibril formation poses a significant concern. Limited monitoring data(combined area samples and personal samples) indicate that exposures topara-aramid fibrils range from not detectable to a maximum of 7.5 f/cc(Refs. 36, 54, and 55). According to a commenter, during manufacture, amaximum likely 8-hour TWA of 0.1 f/cc was recorded. According to the samecommenter, during production and processing of friction materials, themaximum likely 8-hour TWA was less than 0.1 f/cc. Due to the way that themonitoring data were presented, it is difficult to determine if these dataare representative of occupational exposure (Refs. 52 and 53). In additionto the limited monitoring data, exposures were only monitored at a fewindustrial operations which are suspected of producing respirable fibers(Ref. 52). Additionally, it is not known if these operations are representativeof the industry (Ref. 53). Based on available information, EPA believesthat neither commercial-grade aramid products nor fibrils formed from suchproducts may pose major occupational, consumer, and ambient exposures.Generally, it appears that aramid fibrils tend to curl and clump together,thus reducing their tendency to become or remain airborne. Fibril formationappears to be a by-product of aramid manufacture and processing. Fibrilsare not expected to become an integral component of aramid products. Incontrast, asbestos becomes airborne easily and can remain airborne forlong periods of time. c. <T3>Respirability. </T3>A basic property which allows a fiber's potentialtoxicity to be expressed is its respirability, i.e., the ability to penetrateinto the lower respiratory tract. Respirable fibers are generally definedas fibers with actual diameters of less than about 3.5 microns or an aerodynamicdiameter of less than about 10 microns. Once in the lower respiratory tract,other factors such as fiber length and diameter, surface, and chemicalproperties are thought to influence biological activity (Ref. 38). According to available information, a large percentage of the productionvolume of these fibrous substitutes consists of non-respirable fibers (Ref.36). Because non-respirable fibers are unlikely to enter and penetratethe lung, such fibers pose minimal risk of inhalation toxicity. However,some portion of the production volume for many of these substitutes containsfibers of respirable size. Such fibers are of concern to EPA. However,available information indicates that fibers in the respirable size rangeare generally manufactured for specialty uses, such as high-temperatureinsulation materials, filtration media, ear defenders, spacecraft, andaircraft insulation (Ref. 36). Specialty uses may be of concern in termsof risk to individuals but do not have as great a potential for broad populationexposures. d. <T3>Exposure of fibrous substitutes. </T3>EPA conducted an analysis ofthe durable fibers industry which included information about producers,uses, and future trends of the eight fibrous substitutes (Ref. 37). EPAalso developed an exposure profile of durable fibers (Ref. 36). To thisend, EPA conducted a search of the literature and surveyed industry sources.This analysis focused primarily on activities and applications most likelyto generate airborne fibers of respirable size. Exposure data for fibroussubstitutes, although very limited, were available for all fibers exceptpolyolefins. Most exposure data available in the literature are for fibermanufacture. Exposures during man-made and synthetic fiber production aretypically less than 1.0 f/cc because processes are highly automated andoften enclosed, meaning that operators are rarely in contact with the fiber(Ref. 36). Many of the packaging operations are also automated and ventilated,and the exhaust is sent to dust collection equipment (Ref. 36). Often thefiber size composition of a sample of airborne material is not noted. Whenfiber size distinctions have been made, respirable fibers can constitute50 percent or more of airborne fibers. However, as noted above, airbornefibers typically measured less than 1.0 f/cc. Much of the airborne occupationalexposure data available to EPA is outdated. Since many of these data weredeveloped, the industry has become increasingly automated (Ref. 36). Therefore,current exposure levels may be lower. Production of naturally-occurring substitute fibers presents a differentexposure scenario than man-made fibers since the former are mined and milled.Mining and milling have traditionally been ``dusty'' operations where theuse of engineering controls or personal protective equipment are difficultto integrate into the routine operations of the industry. Mining operationsare labor intensive and exposures are likely; however, most mining is performedin open pits which allows for some ventilation. Milling operations usemechanical grinding and screening machines and exposure occurs to workerswho run these machines. Both dust and fiber concentrations have been shownto significantly exceed OSHA's nuisance dust standards (Ref. 36). Duringwollastonite milling, a limited study found fiber concentrations rangingfrom 30 to 80 fibers/cc (Ref. 36). While worker exposure to attapulgite and wollastonite may be high duringcertain mining and milling activities, available information indicateslow hazard for wollastonite or short fiber attapulgite (Ref. 38). Attapulgitemined in the U.S. is of the short fiber variety (Ref. 36). The U.S. suppliesover 90 percent of the world-wide demand for attapulgite (Ref. 37). Basedon EPA's analysis (See Unit V.C.1 of this preamble), neither attapulgiteor wollastonite are expected to be important asbestos substitutes. Some commenters cited exposure data for various fibrous products and concludedthat the exposures sometimes exceeded the asbestos PEL. These commenterswere concerned that exposures may pose a significant risk. In general,production and use of respirable-size man-made fibers and mining and millingof the naturally-occurring mineral fibers, may potentially result in someexposures that exceed exposures from asbestos (Ref. 36). While the dataon certain fibrous substitutes indicate that occupational exposure mayrange from not detectable to levels that exceed the asbestos PEL, levelsin excess of the asbestos PEL alone will not lead to significant risksunless the substitutes present a health hazard of a magnitude approachingthat of asbestos. As explained above, available information on the hazardsof the fibrous substitutes indicate that they are less biologically activeand pathogenic than asbestos. Given the scarcity of exposure data, the numerous types of processes oractivities involved, and the variable characteristics of the many fibrousmaterials, EPA has concluded that reliable projections cannot be made aboutexposures to fibrous asbestos substitutes. This is contrasted with asbestosmanufacturing, processing, and use practices, about which much is knownand such conclusions or reasonable projections about exposure can be made.e. <T3>Risk of fibrous substitutes. </T3>Some commenters stated that EPA shouldperform risk analyses of the same depth for the non-asbestos substitutesas EPA performed for asbestos. Commenters also stated that EPA's substituteanalysis should consider the entire life cycle of the substitute, includingthe risk associated with non-asbestos raw materials, by-products, contaminants,and energy production. Additionally, some commenters stated that EPA shouldconsider other health and environmental effects in addition to cancer associatedwith the substitutes, including silicosis and death due to trauma. For reasons described previously, EPA believes that the available database on the hazards and exposure to substitute fibers is not sufficientfor EPA to perform a quantitative risk analysis. While EPA adopted a lifecycle approach to its risk analysis for asbestos, EPA did not include inthat analysis additional risks that may result from: (1) Exposure to rawmaterials, byproducts, or contaminants associated with production and useof asbestos-containing products; (2) accidents; or (3) energy productionand consumption required to produce asbestos products. EPA quantified,to the extent possible, only risks of cancer associated with exposure toasbestos fibers. EPA adopted a similar life cycle approach in its reviewof substitutes and only evaluated the potential that the fiber itself maycause cancer or non-malignant lung effects. In summary, the review approachadopted for substitutes is comparable to the approach used for asbestosand is only limited by the availability of data. Some commenters stated that EPA could not conclude, based on availabledata, that substitutes pose lower risk than asbestos. EPA agrees that thedata base is insufficient to quantify the risk of substitutes; however,in spite of the deficiencies of the data base, information is availableto indicate that: (1) Some non-fibrous asbestos substitutes pose littleor no health risk concern; (2) the inherent biological activity or pathogenicityof the substitute fibers appears to be less than asbestos; (3) a largepercentage of the total production volume of fibrous substitutes is non-respirable,and thus does not pose a risk concern; and (4) the diameter size of man-madeand synthetic fibers may be controlled, thus enhancing efforts to reducethe presence of contaminants or unnecessary respirable fibers in substituteproducts. f. <T3>Policy approach to asbestos and asbestos substitutes. </T3>Regulatorydecisions about asbestos which poses well-recognized, serious risks shouldnot be delayed until the risk of all replacement materials are fully quantified.EPA believes that this is a prudent policy since: (1) Asbestos is a humancarcingen and poses a serious risk to health; (2) substitute fibers appearsto pose less hazard; (3) years are likely to pass before experimental toxicologicaldata are available to quantify or adequately evaluate the possible healtheffects of substitutes; (4) a decade or more may pass before epidemiologicaldata of the quality that exists for asbestos may be available to confirmany hazards of substitutes identified in experimental data; (5) evolvingfiber technology and the advances within the chemical industry are likelyto create new substitutes, thus making it quite difficult to ever fullyanalyze the risks of all possible major substitutes; and (6) risks associatedwith man-made and synthetic fibers appears easier to control than the risksresulting from asbestos use because fiber diameter size can be technologicallycontrolled. EPA will control to evaluate hazards and exposures posed by fibrous materialsand will determine appropriate regulatory action to mitigate any unreasonablerisks that may be identified. EPA may consider regulation of fiber diameterand length of substitute fibers if it is determined that such risk reductionaction is needed. EPA recommends, that, whenever feasible, manufacturers,processors and users avoid the production and use of respirable fibers.EPA also strongly encourages manufacturers and processors of fibers toinstitute quality control practices that minimize if not eliminate theinadvertent production of respirable fibers. D. Economic Effects of the Rule EPA has prepared a <T3>Regulatory Impact Analysis of Controls on Asbestos and Asbestos Products</T3>(Ref. 21) which analyzes the potential economic impact of the rule.EPA's assessment of the ``reasonably ascertainable economic consequencesof the rule,'' pursuant to section 6(c)(1)(D), is summarized below. Themethodologies used by EPA to estimate the costs and benefits of this rulecomport with widely-accepted cost-benefit techniques. The methodologiesused and the data on which costs and benefit estimates are based have beenupdated to reflect public comments. Further responses to comments on thissubject can be found in the Response to Comments document. 1. <T3>Estimated costs. </T3>Estimated costs were derived using the AsbestosRegulatory Cost Model (ARCM), which is described in the RIA and which primarilyused information collected during telephone surveys conducted by an EPAcontractor during 1986 and 1987. EPA also used some data obtained underthe TSCA section 8(a) asbestos rule to estimate costs. Some informationwas adjusted to reflect more current data obtained through public commentsand from other sources. The sources of information are noted in the recordfor this rule. The costs represent the net present value of costs incurred due to changesin asbestos production volume between the years 1987 and 2000, using asocial rate of discount of 3 percent. The 13-year time period serves asa reasonable endpoint for the analysis at a point well after all the actionstaken in the rule have become effective. The 3 percent rate used to discountcosts (and benefits, as discussed below) is a reasonable rate set by consensusby EPA economists. This figure falls within the range of social discountrates suggested by the economics literature. In estimating the costs of this rule, allowance is made by the economicmodel to estimate declines in the prices of substitutes. In practice, thecost of a product, in real terms, declines over its production as experienceis gained in the manufacturing process. In addition, experience under otherregulations has shown that the number of substitutes will increase as aresult of product regulation. Some of the new substitutes will be of lowercost than some of the existing substitutes or they will not capture marketshare from the existing substitutes. Both of these effects will lower theprices of substitutes. Neither of these effects can be fully quantified.However, as the cost of substitutes decreases, the overall cost of thisrule will also decrease. The economic model does not take into account the cost reduction benefitsof using substitutes which currently have lower costs than the asbestos-containingproducts. In other words, the analysis assumes that the price of substitutes,after being adjusted for product life and performance, is always greaterthan or equal to the price of the comparable asbestos-containing product.This was done to account for differences in the characteristics of asbestosand non-asbestos substitute products that cannot be captured in cost differences.For example, because asbestos-containing products have been traditionallyused in these markets, a bias may exist toward the use of asbestos productsrather than similarly-priced substitutes. However, this assumption overstatesthe costs imposed by the rule whenever the substitute actually costs lessthan the asbestos-containing product and there is no significant differencein product performance characteristics.  EPA attempted to gauge the possible effects of expected declines in theprice of substitutes on the overall cost of the rule. The analysis of costsof the actions taken in this rule assumes that the prices of substitutesfor asbestos products will decrease by 1 percent annually over the lifeof the 13-year period analyzed in the ARCM. However, the analysis alsoassumes that the cost of individual substitute products will always remaingreater than or equal to the price of the comparable asbestos-containingproduct, for the reasons described in the preceding paragraph. EPA believesthat the assumption of a limited 1 percent decline in the price of substitutesis a reasonable ``best estimate'' in light of the effects of the growingmarkets for such products, increasing competition and production know-howin these markets, and the likely development of new, more cost-effectivesubstitutes that have not been quantified for the ARCM. Costs estimated in the RIA include costs to consumers and costs to producers.Consumer losses due to the rule result from increases in costs incurredfor asbestos products or substitutes for asbestos products or from inferiorperformance of substitutes, to the extent that these latter costs couldbe quantified. It is estimated that consumers will incur $375.4 millionin losses as a result of the actions taken in this rule, for the periodof the analysis, spread across the retire consumer population. Producer losses due to this rule would accrue when producers are forcedto forego the portion of the return on their capital stock used to produceasbestos products. This occurs when the capital stock used in the productionand processing of asbestos-containing products either cannot be used orcannot be used as efficiently in the production of substitute products.It is estimated that the rule will result in $83.49 million in total producercosts. The rule will also result in some transition costs to workers who are displacedby product bans. These losses are incurred in the form of lost wages andjob search costs. EPA believes that these transition costs will be relativelylow compared to consumer and producer costs because of: (1) The amountof time allowed for companies to plan before the effective dates of mostbans and (2) the already occurring transition to non-asbestos substitutesby many former producers of asbestos products. The total costs of the rule were estimated first with costs discountedat 3 percent and benefits not discounted (hereafter 3 percent/0 percent)and then with both costs and benefits discounted at 3 percent (hereafter3 percent/3 percent). The results of both analyses will be cited throughoutthe text of this preamble. Both analyses support the actions taken in thisrule. The total estimated cost of the rule is $458.89 million. This costwill be spread over 13 years and a large population. Therefore, the impacton most persons will be negligible.  Estimated total costs of individual product bans are set forth in the followingTable VI:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,14</C><T4>Table VI_Cost of the Rule by Product Category Assuming a </T4>1 <T4>Percent Annual Decline in the Price of Substitutes</T4><H1>Product</H1><H1>Total cost (in $ million, discounted at  3 percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Asbestos/cement (A/C) sheet<D>2.66</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A/C shingles<D>23.57</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A/C pipe<D>128.03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Products not currently in U.S. production (asbestos protective clothingand vinyl/asbestos floor tile)<D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Paper products (commercial paper, rollboard, millboard, corrugatedpaper, and specialty paper)<D>3.73</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Felt products (flooring and roofing felt and pipeline wrap)<D>8.38</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Gaskets \1\<D>207.72</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Disc and drum brake pads for original equipment market (OEM) and brakeblocks<D>12.97</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Disc and brake pads for aftermarket (AM)<D>12.73</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Other asbestos friction products (automatic transmission components,clutch facings, and commercial and industrial friction products)<D>15.20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Coatings (roof coatings and non-roof coatings)<D>46.29</D><F>\1\ Does not include specialty industrial gaskets.</F></ITAG></ITAG>EPA also analyzed the costs of the rule without the assumption about thedeclining price of substitutes that is described in the preceding paragraphs.Under this scenario, the total cost of the rule would rise from $458.89million to $806.51 million.

The methodology used in this analysis for dealing with a lackof information tends by design towards overestimating costs and underestimatingbenefits. This ``cautious'' approach is taken to ensure that the analysisprovides a strong basis for the regulatory decision made in this rule.A commenter stated that EPA, in the analyses used to support the proposedrule, underestimated the costs of banning the manufacture, importation,and processing of asbestos-containing products. The commenter argued thatEPA overestimated the rate of development of asbestos substitutes, underestimatedfuture asbestos consumption rates, and erred in a number of other ways,discussed in more detail in the Response to Comments document, in estimatingthe costs associated with the various options described in the proposedrule.For the final rule, EPA has updated the data base used to support its analysisof the costs and benefits of the rule and has modified its analytical approachin response to comments. In addition, the decline in the rate of consumptionof asbestos in the U.S. has been more rapid in recent years than was predictedin EPA's models. Total annual consumption of asbestos in the U.S. droppedfrom a 1984 total of 240,000 metric tons to less than 85,000 metric tonsin 1987. This change suggests that the use of asbestos substitutes hasincreased markedly since the proposed rule was published.EPA has adopted several conservative assumptions to ensure that the rateof substitution is not overstated in the analysis of the rule's costs.The analysis embodies a low-decline baseline consumption approach. Thisapproach assumes that substitutes have already been adopted for those marketsectors for which substitution for asbestos was relatively uncomplicated.It also assumes a constant rate of asbestos consumption unless EPA is awareof specific instances in which substitution has been made. In addition,the analysis assumes that the price of a substitute for an asbestos productwill not fall below the price of the asbestos product for which it is beingsubstituted. Therefore, the analysis adopts a number of assumptions thatlikely overestimate the costs of the actions taken in this rule ratherthan underestimate them.2. <T3>Estimated benefits. </T3>The costs described above will be offset tosome extent by a number of avoided costs. While EPA did not attempt toplace a value on the loss of life itself, or on associated costs such as``pain and suffering,'' ``loss due to leisure time,'' or other similarfactors, EPA has estimated that the actions taken in this rule will resultin the avoidance of at least 202 quantifiable cases of lung and gastrointestinalcancer and mesothelioma when benefits are not discounted and at least 148cancer cases when benefits are discounted at 3 percent from the time ofexposure. These estimates assume the occupational exposure levels basedon other analogous exposure scenarios discussed in Unit V.A.3 of this preamble.These estimates do not, for reasons discussed in Unit V.A of this preamble,include the number of asbestosis cases and cases of other diseases avoided.In addition, EPA did not estimate losses due to lost work days or medicalcare costs. Thus the benefits of the rule (costs avoided by this rule)represent prudent estimates that likely understate actual benefits.

Therefore,benefits are understated to the extent that these exposures are not included.For example, some exposures result when asbestos fibers are released toair due to weathering of A/C products and other products used in exterioruses.Also, the analysis did not quantify the increased risk due to high concentration,episodic exposures to asbestos for many products. Further, additions toambient loading caused by the activities affected by this rule and theresultant risk reduction from this rule's actions could not be adequatelyquantified. The effect these factors would have on the calculation of benefitsis difficult to determine because of technological difficulties in quantifyingthe extent of these releases and the resultant exposures. However, theeffect could be significant because releases via these routes are frequentand, on aggregate, broad-ranging.EPA also analyzed the benefits that accrue due to the actions taken inthis rule if the analogous exposure analysis described in Unit V.A.3 ofthis preamble are not assumed. In this analysis, in all instances whereexposure is believed to exist, but specific exposure data are not available,EPA assumed no exposure. The figures in the following chart, therefore,understate the actual number of cancer-cases-avoided due to this rule tothe extent that available monitoring data used in the exposure analysisunderstates actual exposure to asbestos. In this analysis, estimates ofcancer-cases-avoided decrease from 202 cases to 164 cases if benefits arenot discounted and from 148 cases to 120 cases if benefits are discountedat 3 percent.

These estimates, assuming theoccupational exposure levels based on other analogous exposure scenariosdiscussed above, are 183 cases if benefits are not discounted and 134 casesif benefits are discounted at 3 percent.

Under both the best estimatescenario with occasional baghouse failure assumed and the maximum emissionscenario with no baghouse failure assumed, EPA believes that the manufacture,importation, processing, and distribution in commerce of these productspresents an unreasonable risk of injury to human health.   The rule will result in a number of other significant benefits. However,many of these benefits are either in the future and are relatively smallin current terms after discounting or are difficult to quantify. For example,costs avoided include the societal cost of the resources necessary to treatasbestos-related illnesses and the productivity lost as a result of asbestosdisease that will be avoided due to actions taken under this rule. EPAhas not estimated these costs avoided because they would be relativelysmall because the types of cancers reviewed in this analysis generallyresult in death after relatively short periods of treatment or hospitalization.In addition, this total would be further lowered when discounted due tothe fact that most asbestos-related diseases appear only after a long latencyperiod.   Continued manufacture, importation, processing, and use of the asbestos-containingproducts banned by this rule would result in environmental loading of asbestos.The effect of environmental loading is discussed in more detail in UnitV.A.3 of this preamble. The actions taken under this rule will reduce theincremental increase in ambient concentrations of asbestos and thus reducethe risk of asbestos exposure faced by the general population. EPA hasnot attempted to quantify these benefits, due to the difficulty and probableimprecision of such an analysis. However, EPA believes that the long-termbenefits derived from this incremental decrease in ambient concentrationsof asbestos will result in substantial benefits because of the large populationsthat are affected. EPA has also concluded that these benefits can be attainedthrough the source reduction actions taken in this rule, rather than byuse of other options considered. Further, due to the rule's bans, the substantial future costs associatedwith removal and disposal of asbestos-containing products that would haveotherwise been produced and used will be avoided. These included higherremoval, demolition, and disposal costs for asbestos products than thosefor non-asbestos products, as well as higher health risk expenses for asbestosproducts. Future removal, demolition, and disposal of asbestos constructionproducts will likely be higher because special precautions will probablybe necessary to meet OSHA, Clean Air Act (CAA), or other requirements.These costs can be substantial, but they have not been estimated for purposesof this rulemaking because estimates of the timing and frequency of buildingremoval or renovation would be speculative.Also, the continued use of asbestos will likely exacerbate the heavy burdenon courts and workman's compensation boards that have, in recent years,been inundated with claims related to harm caused by asbestos exposure.This rule, by reducing the occurrence of asbestos-related diseases, willeventually reduce the costs related to claims arising out of illnessesand deaths caused by asbestos exposure.Since the proposal, EPA has observed a rapid development of substitutesfor asbestos-containing products. EPA believes that this rule will furtherstimulate technological innovation in the development of substitutes forasbestos and that this strong trend toward use and acceptance of substituteswill continue.Different health benefits were estimated in support of the proposal thanthose development for the final rule. The number of cancer-cases-avoidedestimated for the proposal (approximately 1,000 cases and more, dependingon the regulatory option) is higher than the estimate for the final rule(202 and 148 cases if analogous exposures are assumed) for a number ofreasons: (1) Several product categories are not included in this finalrule estimates because they are no longer manufactured or imported in theU.S. (e.g., vinyl-asbestos floor tile). This change accounts for approximately475 of the cancer-cases-avoided quantified in the proposal rule. (2) Theproduction and exposure data supporting the rulemaking were updated forthe final rule. U.S. asbestos consumption has decreased and substituteuse had increased since the publication of the proposed rule. Therefore,the proposal's estimates of cancer-cases-avoided were higher than thosefor the final rule because consumption rates and resulting exposure totalswere higher at the time of the proposal. (3) Updated exposure assessmentswere used in the health benefits model. The updated data were lower forsome products than those used for the proposal, meaning that the proposal'sestimates of cancer-cases-avoided were higher than those for the finalrule. (4) The time frame used for estimating health benefits for the proposalwas 15 years: for the final rule, the period is 13 years. Therefore, thefinal rule analysis covered 2 fewer years of exposure, resulting in fewerestimated health benefits. (5) Some modifications were made to the healtheffects model used for the final rule [e.g., minor modifications, includingquantification of gastrointestinal cancer risk, and the use of a lowerdose response constant for mesothelioma (using an average of the dose responseconstants from a number of studies, rather than the constant from one largestudy)] that resulted in an estimate of benefits that was approximately20 percent lower for the final rule than for the proposal.Several commenters stated that EPA underestimated the benefits associatedwith the product bans described in the proposed rule. These commentersasserted that the analysis of benefits understanted risks because it didnot take into account diseases other than lung and gastrointestinal cancerand mesothelioma or exposures to families of asbestos workers, and failedto quantify factors like avoided pain and suffering and increased workerproductivity. EPA agrees that the benefits of the rule may be understated,possibly to a significant extent, in the supporting analysis due to technologicalor other limitations. These factors, however, have been considered qualitativelyin EPA's analysis.One commenter argued that EPA significantly overestimated the benefitsof the rule by overstating asbestos potency and exposure levels. The lungcancer and mesothelioma potency values used by EPA in its analysis of benefitsare well-supported and are consistent with those used by OSHA in reducingits PEL to 0.2 f/cc. The potency values for lung cancer represent the meanof the results of 11 human epidemiological studies on the effects of asbestosexposure. The potency values for mesothelioma represent the mean of theresults of 4 human epidemiological studies on the effects of asbestos exposure.In addition, the exposure estimates used in this analysis understate actualexposure for a number of reasons, as explained in Unit V.A.3 of this preamble.Therefore, EPA may have actually understated, not overstated, the benefitsof this rule.Some commenters argued that EPA, in the proposal, improperly failed todiscount benefits to be derived from the rule, and in support documentsfor a final rule, only discounted benefits until the time of the exposurethat results in the cancer rather than until the occurrence of the disease.Other commenters argued that EPA should not discount benefits, statingthat discounting the benefit of saving human life is inappropriate methodologyfor this rulemaking.This final rule provides estimated benefits both with and without discounting.Arguments can be made that estimating benefits without discounting is preferablein cases like this one where the primary benefits derived is the avoidanceof human cancer cases. However, arguments also can be articulated supportingthe discounting of benefits. EPA believes that if benefits in the formof cancer-cases-avoided are to be discounted, they are properly discountedto the time when risk is reduced or avoided. Since the benefit of a regulationto control a hazardous substance occurs at the time of the reduced exposure,EPA has concluded that the appropriate period over which to discount isuntil the time of exposure reduction. This approach was used in this caseafter extensive review of applicable literature and an examination of theinherent biases and features of other approaches.3. <T3>Small businesses.</T3> EPA has, pursuant to section 6(c)(1)(D) of TSCA,also analyzed the economic impact of this rule on small businesses. Therule will not have a significant effect on small businesses because thereare few such businesses affected by the rule and individual company producerlosses are not expected to be substantial since capital equipment for theproduction of asbestos-containing products has little remaining usefullife, is inexpensive, or can generally be converted at low cost to manufactureof alternative products. A small fraction of the manufacturers, importers,and processors subject to this rule are small producers and some couldbe adversely affected by the rule. In addition, a number of small governmentsmay be affected by the ban of some asbestos products, for example A/C pipe.However, the economic impact of this rule is generally spread widely throughoutthe economy and any concentrated effect will not be focused on specificmarket sectors or on small businesses.4. <T3>Evaluation of the rule's economic impact.</T3> The overall costs ofthis rule are significant. However, the overall benefits of the rule arealso significant, although many of the benefits cannot be easily quantified.The analysis performed to ascertain the economic consequences of the rulelikely overstates the costs of the actions. However, the analysis pointsout several important factors: (1) The societal benefit, or ``essentiality,''of asbestos has decreased, and continues to do so, as asbestos consumptiondeclines and substitutes for the mineral are developed for many applications;(2) most of the costs associated with the rule are short-term and spreadover a relatively large population; (3) the continued development of price-and performance-comparable substitutes for asbestos indicates that therule will not lead to either dramatic increases in consumer prices or decreasesin the availability of products affected by this rule; and (4) the producerand consumer costs imposed by this rule are offset by the rule's benefits(e.g., cancer-cases-avoided, medical costs, and lost productivity avoided),although many of these benefits are either difficult to quantify or toexpress in monetary terms.EPA, therefore, finds that, under the standards of section 6 of TSCA, thecosts of the rule to be reasonable in light of the unreasonably large numberof asbestos-related deaths and serious illnesses that would occur if theactions in this rule were not taken.E. Other Options ConsideredSection 6 of TSCA requires EPA to select the least burdensome means toreduce an unreasonable risk. This Unit describes EPA's evaluation of optionsthat would reduce or eliminate the unreasonable risk to human health posedby exposure to asbestos. Further responses to comments on this subjectcan be found in the Response to Comments document.The options considered include the one selected for the final rule, a staged-banof the manufacturing, importation, processing, and distribution in commerceof a number of categories of asbestos products. EPA selected a staged-banfor this final rule rather than one of the other regulatory options discussedin the proposal or identified in comments because these other options wouldeither fail to adequately reduce the unreasonable risk posed by asbestosexposure or impose an excessive burden. Conversely, the final rule's staged-banapproach prohibits, at different times, the manufacture, importation, processing,or distribution in commerce for uses of asbestos that pose an unreasonablerisk. Timing of these bans is based largely on the availability of suitableavailable or anticipated non-asbestos substitutes for the banned products.Therefore, the staged-ban approach takes into account the potential economiceffects of the various bans, while still eliminating the sources of therisk. Other options were discussed in the proposed rule or identified incomments, but were not selected for the reasons described below.Under two proposed rule alternatives, some product categories would bebanned soon after the effective date of the rule and the remaining productcategories would be ``phased down.'' This would be accomplished by institutinga permit system which would create limits on the U.S. mining of asbestosand the importation of asbestos and asbestos-containing products. Theselimits would be based on previous volumes of the affected activity andwould be managed by a system of issuing permits allowing gradually declininglevels of the indicated activities. The permits would be transferrable.This system would, over time, restrict the total amount of asbestos availablefor use in the U.S. and limit the amount used in imported products untilthe rule's objective of a complete phase out was achieved.In the analysis performed for this rulemaking, EPA concluded that a permitsystem approach would not be the least burdensome means of reducing theunreasonable risk posed by asbestos for all the products analyzed underthe rule. Most commenters who rendered an opinion on the issue opposedthe permit system options. Commenters stated that the implementation ofthese options could create significant administrative problems for EPAand industry, particularly in the area of imported asbestos products. EPAfound that implementing the proposal's permit system options for all ofthe product categories in the rule would result in high administrativecosts. EPA also believes that a permit system involving all of the productsaffected by this rule would be difficult to enforce.EPA concluded that some uses of asbestos and some product life cycle stagespose a substantially greater risk than others and that the permit systemsdescribed in the proposed rule would not necessarily control the highestrisk exposures (e.g., persons that produced or used products with highlevels of asbestos exposure could purchase permits). Therefore, EPA concludedthat the proposed rule's permit system would not adequately control asbestosexposure for the rule's product categories.Despite EPA's conclusion based on currently available information thata permit system approach is not viable for regulating all of the productsanalyzed under this rule, EPA recognizes that there are a number of inherentconceptual advantages to employing an economic incentive approach in regulatingthe risks posed by chemicals. Therefore, as a follow-up to EPA's reviewof the applicability of a permit system as a regulatory option in thisrule, EPA will perform several extensive analyses of the advantages anddisadvantages of using various economic incentive approaches, includingmarketable permit system alternatives, as possible mechanisms for reducinghuman health and environmental risks from chemicals. These studies willreview in greater detail the viability of employing such approaches underregulatory authorities such as section 6 of TSCA.One study will focus on economic incentive programs that could be appliedunder TSCA and other authorities, rather than, for example, concentratingon air-emission issues, as does the bulk of the available theoretical literature.The study will identify and evaluate criteria for determining which chemicalsor chemical products would be appropriate candidates for the use of economicincentive approaches under TSCA and other authorities. Factors consideredin identifying these criteria will include determining the characteristicsof a chemical's market, such as its production and use, that would makethe chemical a viable candidate for a permit system rather than a depositsystem. The study will also examine these criteria in the context of specificcandidate chemical substances.Another study will analyze administrative problems associated with economicincentive approaches with the aim of devising methods that provide equitableand efficient regulation of these chemical substances. For example, thestudy will examine issues related to imports which complicate implementationand enforcement of economic incentive approaches. The study will also examinemechanisms to overcome complications caused by these factors and evaluatethe type and level of assistance to EPA from other agencies (e.g., U.S.Customs Service) that would be necessary to implement and enforce an economicincentives approach.Based on the analyses performed during this and other rulemakings, thereis a continuum in the risks and benefits associated with product categories.Some product categories on the continuum have some characteristics (e.g.,a large number of specialized uses or a lagging rate of substitute development)that may make the products amenable to regulation through use of a economicincentive approach based on the criteria developed in the studies describedin the preceding paragraphs. Upon completion of these studies, EPA willreview this rule and other rules, based on the identified criteria andon then-available information about products and markets. For example,with respect to this rule, this review could determine whether (1) anyproduct categories not included within the rule's bans should be phasedout by use of an economic incentives approach, (2) any products bannedin Stage 3 for which a significant number of exemptions are likely mightbe more efficiently phased out via an economic incentives approach, and(3) substitute development could be more efficiently compelled by an economicincentive approach for any products that are the subject of an active exemption.EPA's review will determine whether any of these products exhibit characteristicsthat lead EPA to conclude that exposures could be more efficiently phasedout by use of an economic incentive approach. If, after review of thisor any other rule, EPA determines that an economic incentive regulatoryapproach is warranted for some of the categories, EPA may in the futureinitiate rulemaking under sections 6 and 8 of TSCA to amend such rulesto implement an economic incentive approach.Even within the stage-ban approach, EPA has considered a number of possibleoptions for the number of stages, the number of years between the stages,and the scheduling of product bans at various stages. The final rule followsthe 3-stage ban approach of the proposed rule. EPA has modified the timingof the ban from soon after promulgation and 5 and 10 years after the effectivedate of the final rule, as discussed in the proposed rule, to 1, 4, and7 years, respectively, after the effective date of the final rule. Thiswas done because of the passage of time since the proposed rule was publishedand because EPA's analysis of available data and comments indicates thatmarked advances have been made in the development of and conversion tosuitable substitutes for asbestos in most product areas. The timing forthe stages in the final rule are reasonable in terms of the current oranticipated availability of suitable substitutes, based on EPA's analyses.EPA rejected the option in the proposal of a limited 2-stage ban with aTSCA section 8(a) reporting requirement because that option would not sufficientlyreduce the unreasonable risk posed by asbestos exposure. In addition, thefinal rule does not include a ban on the mining and import of bulk asbestosbecause not all asbestos-containing products are included within the banson manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in commerce.However, the risks posed by these activities are expected to decline asthe demand for asbestos decreases due to the actions taken in this rule.Also, in scheduling products for the staged-ban, EPA has analyzed the relativerisks posed by the different asbestos-containing products and the probableavailability of non-asbestos substitutes. In the rule, the various asbestosproducts are scheduled to be banned at times when it is likely that suitablenon-asbestos substitutes will be available. For example, bans on asbestos-containingbrakes pads and drum brake linings are divided into a Stage 2 ban on theoriginal equipment market and a Stage 3 ban on the aftermarket becausesuitable substitutes might not be available for some aftermarket productsuntil Stage 3. The final rule's approach balances the need for a reductionin the unreasonable risk of exposure to asbestos with the economic effectsof bans on manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in commerce.The inclusion in the final rule of a provision allowing for exemptionsin limited circumstances is a means of taking into account the size anddiversity of the asbestos industry. EPA realizes that, despite EPA's projections,technology might not advance sufficiently by the time of a ban to producesubstitutes for a few specialized or limited uses of asbestos in some productcategories. In addition, other unforseeable circumstances may occur thatwould make a ban on a discrete product inappropriate at the scheduled date.In these circumstances, an exemption from the rule's bans may be appropriateif an applicant can show that one is appropriate following the proceduresdescribed in Unit III.E of this preamble. However, EPA believes that grantingexemptions will not be the norm. The procedures should be used only inexceptional cases and should not be viewed as a means of attempting topostpone a person's share of the economic consequences of the actions dictatedby the rule.Another option considered would involve an immediate ban of the manufacture,importation, processing, importation, and distribution in commerce of allasbestos products. Section 6 of TSCA requires that a range of factors,including the availability of substitutes and the relative costs of regulatoryoptions, be considered in addressing the reasonable risks posed by a chemicalsubstance. EPA rejected an immediate ban option because it would resultin potentially severe economic and societal effects. An immediate ban wouldnot account for the current unavailability of viable substitutes for someasbestos-containing products that provide significant benefit and wouldresult in high costs in those markets. Therefore, an immediate ban wouldnot be the least burdensome means to reduce the unreasonable risk posedby asbestos.EPA also considered requiring asbestos-containing products to be labeledas a means of reducing the risk posed by asbestos exposure. However, EPAhas determined that the risk-reduction benefits from a labeling requirementfor asbestos-containing products would not be substantial. For example,many of those that would potentially be exposed to asbestos from the labeledproducts would not have access to the warning labels. In addition, manyasbestos products are used in caustic or dynamic environments in whichlabels cannot survive. Commenters also argued that labels directly appliedto products can inhibit product performance. For example, if gaskets wererequired to be labeled, those who came into contact with the product packagingcould have access to the label. However, many gaskets are too small tobe effectively labeled. In addition, it would be unlikely that those exposedto the product during use or removal would have access to the label becauseit might not survive in a hot, fluid environment. The aim of the finalrule's labeling requirement is not to serve as a warning, but rather onlyto facilitate compliance with and enforcement of the rule. The drawbacksof labeling described above do not affect the use of labeling as a complianceand enforcement tool. The labels required by this rule are applied to productwrapping or packaging and are not intended to survive through the entireproduct life cycle.Several commenters suggested the consideration of options that would require``controlled use'' of asbestos rather than bans on manufacture, importation,processing, or distribution in commerce. These commenters argued that exposureto low levels of asbestos is not an unreasonable health hazard and thatEPA should undertake actions in a number of areas to require exposure controls(e.g., workplace controls for brake replacement and repair) rather thanenacting a product ban. Commenters also suggested that chrysotile fiberspose a lower hazard than other asbestos fiber types and that controlled-useactions would be more appropriate for chrysotile than would be source reductionactions.Controlled-use options were rejected because they would be ineffectivein reducing exposure at many points in the life cycle of asbestos products.As is discussed in Unit V.A of this preamble, EPA has found that exposureto even low levels of asbestos poses an unreasonable health hazard. Inaddition, some of the exposures of concern are not amenable to controls(e.g., ambient releases from asbestos friction products during use, frombrake replacement and repair work performed by consumers, or from weatheringof asbestos products exposed to an outdoors environment).In other instances, controlled-use aproaches create new exposures or moveexposure from one stage of the product life cycle to another. For example,even if asbestos is vented from a workplace, although workers are subjectto lower exposure levels, asbestos is still released to the outside ambientair, thereby creating potential exposures for passersby and surroundingpopulations.Further, many engineering controls either fail to reduce exposures to asbestosto levels that do not pose a significant risk or create workplace inefficienciesthat lead them to not be used. For example, respirators are difficult tofit properly and are often uncomfortable. Poor fit and intermittent usebecause of discomfort lead to unprotected workers. The problems are especiallyprevalent in negative pressure respirators, the type most commonly usedin workplaces because of their low cost (Ref. 16).Other agencies and EPA offices have or are currently establishing asbestosexposure control requirements for the workplace. However, because of theextent and nature of the risks posed by asbestos and limitations on availabletechnology and the jurisdictions of the regulatory entities, EPA believesthat even those control standards that are based on the best availabletechnology leave an unreasonable level of residual risk in some occupationaland non-occupational settings.Therefore, EPA has concluded that source reduction actions, like thosetaken in this rule, rather than controlled use approaches are necessaryto reduce the unreasonable risk posed by asbestos exposure. In addition,pursuant to the discussion in Unit V.A of this preamble regarding the relativehazards posed by the various asbestos fiber types, EPA has also concludedthat this rule's source reduction actions are more appropriate than controlleduse approaches for products containing chrysotile fibers.Some commenters expressed a concern that if EPA bans the manufacture, importation,or processing of some asbestos-containing products, the governments ofother countries will be compelled to take similar actions, although suitablenon-asbestos substitutes may not be available in those countries. The unreasonablerisk finding in this rule is based on a detailed analysis of the risksposed throughout the entire life cycle in the U.S. of the future manufacture,importation, processing, distribution, use, and disposal of the specifiedasbestos-containing products. The findings which support this rule arenot directly applicable to other countries in which factors relating torisk and cost may be significantly different.F. Summary of Individual Product CategoriesThis Unit describes EPA's unreasonable risk finding for each individualcategory of asbestos-containing products identified for this rule. It summarizesfor each individual product category available information regarding exposure,individual risk levels, the development of substitutes, the results ofEPA's analysis of the costs and benefits of a ban, and other qualitativefactors that were considered in EPA's unreasonable risk analysis for eachcategory. These discussions reflect public comments received on these subjects.Further responses to comments on these subjects can be found in the Responseto Comments document.In the product category discussions below, information regarding costs,benefits, and product substitutes is derived primarily from the RIA (Ref.21), which is discussed in Unit V.D of this preamble. Information regardingexposure levels is derived from EPA's Asbestos Exposure Assessment (Ref.29), Asbestos Modeling Study (Ref. 30), and Non-occupational Asbestos ExposureReport (Ref. 31), which are discussed in Unit V.A.3 of this preamble.Based on available information, EPA finds that the manufacture, importation,processing, and distribution in commerce of asbestos for use in each ofthe following product categories, except those discussed in Unit V.F.1of this preamble, presents an unreasonable risk of injury to human health.The discussions of EPA's findings, below, summarize: (1) The estimatedbenefits of the actions taken in this rule for each product category, (2)quantifiable asbestos exposure and lifetime risk levels for the product,(3) the projected availability of product substitutes, (4) a descriptionof qualitative factors that were considered in reaching EPA's unreasonablerisk conclusion for the product, (5) the estimated costs of the actionstaken, and (6) an explanation of any changes in EPA's approach to regulatingthe product since the proposal.The individual risk levels quantified for the product categories that aresubject to this rule are very high. An individual lifetime risk level of10^3 or greater has been quantified for many persons who are exposed duringthe primary and secondary manufacture of most of these products. Some otherphases of these products' life cycles also result in very high levels ofindividual risk. An individual lifetime risk level of 10^3 means that membersof the populations exposed to this level of risk stand a 1 in 1,000 chanceof developing cancer during their lifetime as a result of the exposures.EPA considers the risk levels quantified for this rule for asbestos exposuresto pose a substantial concern. EPA also believes that the risk levels quantifiedfor this rule represent an underestimate of the actual risk posed by asbestosexposure from these products. A number of exposures to asbestos and theresultant risks, for example, the risks posed by incremental increasesin environmental loading caused by the continued manufacture and importationof the asbestos products banned by this rule, are believed to be significant,but could not be quantified for purposes of this rule, often because oflimits in exposure monitoring technology. Despite this ``cautious'' approachto estimating risk, the exposure and risk that can be quantified are sufficientto make an unreasonable risk finding for purposes of this rule.The costs and benefits cited below include assumptions regarding anticipateddeclines in substitute prices (discussed in Unit V.D of this preamble)and exposures estimated by analogy for recognized, but unquantifiable,exposures (discussed in Unit V.A.3 of this preamble). EPA believes thatthis approach presents a prudent, representative analysis of the costsand benefits of the actions taken in this rule with some reasonable adjustmentsmade for unquantifiable exposures or market changes. However, even if theseassumptions are not used, EPA has concluded that the continued manufacture,importation, and processing of the asbestos-containing products that areidentified in the rule poses an unreasonable risk of injury to human health.a. <T3>Felt products. </T3>This grouping consists of the flooring felt, roofingfelt, and pipeline wrap product categories. All of these categories willbe banned in Stage 1. The benefits (in terms of cancer-cases-avoided) ofthe actions taken in this rule on these product categories are set forthin the following Table XI:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,10,10</C><T4>Table XI_Cancer-Cases-Avoided for Asbestos Felt Products</T4><H1>Product </H1><H1>Discount rate </H1><H2>3 percent </H2><H2>0 percent</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Flooring felt <D>0 \1\ </D><D>0 \1\</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Roofing felt <D>1.21 </D><D>1.51</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pipeline wrap <D>2.31 </D><D>2.86</D><F>\1\ No current U.S. manufacture or import.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Primary routes of exposure to asbestos from these products occur duringprimary manufacture, and product installation, repair, removal, and disposal.Quantifiable lifetime risk for these products from occupational exposureranges from an average of 7.4 x 10^4 for secondary manufacture of flooringand roofing felt to an average of 2.5 x 10^3 for the primary manufactureof roofing felt. EPA estimates that as many as 1,652 workers may be exposedto asbestos during the installation and removal of roofing felt, incurringindividual risks comparable to those for manufacturing. These exposureestimates do not take into account high peak exposure to which homeownersor others may be unknowingly subjected during removal or repair of theseproducts. EPA determined that accurately quantifying these exposures andthe resultant risks would be difficult and that sufficient other exposureand risk information is available regarding these products to make a findingof unreasonable risk.Effective substitutes currently exist for all three of these product categories.These products are largely no longer produced in the U.S., and flooringfelt is no longer imported in this country. In the proposal, flooring androofing felt would have been subject to the Stage 1 ban and pipeline wrapwould have been banned at Stage 3 or covered by the permit system. However,EPA received comments indicating that the product categories are not easilydistinguishable from one another and that suitable substitutes are currentlyavailable for pipeline wrap. EPA therefore concluded that a Stage 1 isappropriate for all three product categories.The total cost of the actions taken on these product categories are setforth in the following Table XII:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,14</C><T4>Table XII_Cost of the Rule for Asbestos Felt Products</T4><H1>Product </H1><H1>Total cost in $ million, discounted at 3 percent</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Flooring felt <D>\1\ 0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Roofing felt <D>7.31</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pipeline wrap <D>1.07</D><F>\1\ No U.S. manufacture or import.</F></ITAG></ITAG>EPA has concluded that a Stage 1 ban is appropriate for these product categoriesfor the following reasons: (1) Relatively high quantifiable exposure andindividual risk levels exist for these products; (2) these products posea high potential for ambient release during a number of life cycle stages,for example, during manufacture, installation, removal, and repair work;(3) homeowners and workers are potentially subject to uncontrolled exposuresduring removal and repair work; (4) the cost of taking these actions isreasonable because suitable substitutes exist for all of these products;and (5) while the quantified benefits of banning these products are relativelysmall, compared to other product categories banned by this rule, theseproducts are likely both to lead to a number of serious exposures thatcould not be readily quantified for this rule and to contribute significantlyto environmental loading.b. <T3>A/C sheet.</T3> This grouping consists of the flat and corrugated A/Csheet product categories. These categories will be banned in Stage 1. Theseproducts were proposed for a Stage 1 ban. The benefits (in terms of cancer-cases-avoided)of the actions taken in this rule on these product categories are set forthin the following Table XIII:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,10,10</C><T4>Table XIII_Cancer-Cases-Avoided for A/C Sheet</T4><H1>Product </H1><H1>Discount rate </H1><H2>3 percent </H2><H2>0 percent</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">A/C flat sheet <D>0.85 </D><D>1.05</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A/C corrugated sheet <D>0.12 </D><D>0.14</D></ITAG></ITAG>Primary routes of exposure to asbestos from these products occur duringmanufacture, installation, and repair. Approximately 53 workers are exposedto asbestos during primary manufacture of A/C flat sheet. EPA estimatesthat as many as 735 workers may be exposed to asbestos during the installation,repair, and disposal of A/C flat sheet, and that as many as 109 workersmay be exposed during installation and repair of A/C corrugated sheet.Quantifiable risk posed for these products from occupational exposure isestimated to range from an average of 6.2andmultiply;10^3 for the primarymanufacture of A/C flat sheet to 6.7andmultiply;10^3 for repair and disposalof flat and A/C corrugated sheet. Quantifiable risk from non-occupational,lifetime exposures to asbestos released during the manufacture of A/C sheetis estimated at 1andmultiply;10^4 for approximately 4,500 people and at greaterthan 1andmultiply;10^6 for over 200,000 people.EPA believes that the exposures quantified for these product categoriesare understated. Ambient release of asbestos occurs due to weathering ofthese products during outdoor uses. Cutting, drilling, and sanding takeplace during secondary processing, installation, repair, and maintenanceof these products and result in significant release of asbestos. Homeownersor others may be unknowingly exposed to significant levels of asbestoswhen they sand these products in preparation for repainting or removingthem. Worker exposure estimates for this rule assume compliance with OSHArestrictions, but EPA believes, based on some public comments, that theremay be some cutting of A/C products with power saws in violation of OSHArestrictions. Asbestos releases to the ambient air due to weathering ofthese materials during outdoor uses were not calculated and high peak exposuresoccurring during cutting or scraping of these products were not quantifiedfor purposes of the rule. EPA determined that accurately quantifying theseexposures and the resultant risks would be difficult and that sufficientother exposure and risk information is available regarding these productsto make a finding of unreasonable risk.Effective substitutes exist for all uses of these products. The total costsof the actions taken in this rule for these product categories are setforth in the following Table XIV:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,14</C><T4>Table XIV_Cost of the Rule for A/C Sheet</T4><H1>Product </H1><H1>Total cost in $ million, discounted at 3 percent</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">A/C flat sheet <D>2.37</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A/C corrugated sheet <D>0.29</D></ITAG></ITAG>EPA has concluded that a Stage 1 ban is appropriate for these product categoriesfor the following reasons: (1) Relatively high quantifiable exposure andindividual risk levels exist for these products; (2) these products posea high potential for ambient release during a number of life cycle stages;(3) homeowners and workers are potentially subject to uncontrolled, highpeak exposures during installation, repair, and removal; (4) the cost oftaking these actions is reasonable because suitable substitutes exist forall of these products; and (5) while the quantified benefits of banningthese products are relatively small, compared to other product categoriesbanned by this rule, these products are likely to lead to a number of seriousexposures that could not be readily quantified for this rule and to contributesignificantly to environmental loading.c. <T3>A/C shingles.</T3> This product category covers roof shingles and sidingcomposed of a mixture of cement and asbestos fiber. This category willbe banned in Stage 3. This product was proposed for a Stage 1 ban. Thebenefits (in terms of cancer-cases-avoided) of the actions taken in thisrule on this product category is as follows: 0.32 cases if benefits arenot discounted and 0.23 cases if benefits are discounted at 3 percent.Currently, A/C shingles are rarely used in new building construction andare used primarily for replacement, maintenance, and historical restoration.Primary routes of exposure to asbestos from products in this category occurduring manufacture, installation, repair, removal, and disposal. Quantifiablerisk posed by these products from occupational exposure is estimated torange from a lower bound of 3.7 andmultiply; 10^4 for installation to anaverage of 6.1 andmultiply; 10^3 for primary manufacturing. Quantifiablerisk from non-occupational, lifetime exposure to asbestos emissions releasedduring manufacturing is estimated at 2.1 andmultiply; 10^5 for approximately1,500 people and at greater than 1.0 andmultiply; 10^6 for approximately8,600 people. EPA believes that a number of factors contributed to exposurebeing underestimated for this category. Ambient releases result from weatheringof these products and high peak exposures potentially occur during cutting,sanding, scraping, and hammering of these products. EPA is concerned aboutunknowing, inadvertent high peak exposures for homeowners or others duringreplacement or repair of existing shingles and siding. Such exposures canresult from sanding, chipping, cutting, or other activities that resultin substantial fiber release. Asbestos releases to the ambient air dueto weathering of these materials during outdoors uses were not calculatedand high peak exposures occurring during replacement or repair of theseproducts were not quantified for purposes of the rule. EPA determined thataccurately quantifying these exposures and the resultant risks would bedifficult and that sufficient other exposure and risk information is availableregarding these products to make a finding of unreasonable risk.The traditional appeal of A/C products is their durability and their abilityto be fabricated. A number of non-asbestos products are available thatare effective substitutes from the perspective of performance. Suitablesubstitutes, including wood, aluminum, and vinyl sidings and asphalt, cedarwood, and tile shingles, exist for many applications of the products inthis category. However, suitable substitutes are not currently availablefor some products in this category. Therefore, EPA has scheduled the banof this product for Stage 3 rather than Stage 1, as originally proposed,to allow for the development of cost-effective substitutes while stilladdressing risks in a timely manner.The total cost of the actions taken in this rule for this product categoryis $23.57 million. EPA believes that this cost estimate may be overstated.This is because the cost analysis for this product category assumed thatwood substitutes would capture 32 percent of the A/C shingle market ifthe asbestos products were banned. This assumption was made largely becausewood is more physically attractive than other substitutes, although itis much more expensive and does not perform significantly better.EPA has concluded that a Stage 3 ban is appropriate for this product categoryfor the following reasons: (1) Relatively high quantifiable exposure andindividual risk levels exist for these products; (2) these products posea high potential for ambient release during a number of life cycle stages;(3) homeowners and workers are potentially subject to uncontrolled exposures;(4) suitable substitutes exist for many of these products and are likelyto exist for others by the time of the ban; (5) the cost of taking theseactions is reasonable, especially in light of the assumption made regardingthe portion of the market substituted for by wood shingles in the estimateof the costs, the time provided for substititue development, and the levelof ambient exposure posed by products in this category; and (6) while thequantified benefits of banning these products are relatively small, comparedto other product categories banned by this rule, these products are likelyto lead to a number of serious exposures that could not be readily quantifiedfor this rule and to contribute significantly to environmental loading.d. <T3>Other product categories that are currently out of production. </T3>Thisgrouping consists of the vinyl/asbestos floor tile and asbestos clothingcategories. These categories will be banned in Stage 1. These productswere proposed for a Stage 1 ban.These products are no longer produced in the U.S. and are currently importedin, at most, only small quantities. In instances in which these productsare still imported, EPA is concerned about the potential for uncontrolledconsumer exposure, for example, the sanding, cutting, and removal of vinyl/asbestosfloor tile. The fact that these products are no longer in commerce in theU.S. indicates that effective substitutes are available. Therefore, thecost of banning these products is minimal.EPA has concluded that a State 1 ban is appropriate for this product categoryfor the following reasons: (1) Relatively high quantifiable individualrisk levels would exist for these products were significant U.S. manufactureor importation to begin again; (2) these products pose a high potentialfor ambient release during a number of life cycle states; (3) homeownersand workers would be potentially subject to uncontrolled exposures weresignificiant U.S. manufacture or importation to begin again; (4) the costof banning these products is negligible because there is no current signficantmanufacture or import of these products and because suitable substitutesexist for them; and (5) these products are included within the ban to ensurethat their U.S. manufacture, importation, processing, or import does notresume.  e. <T3>Vehicular brakes. </T3>This grouping includes drum brake linings, discbrake pads and brake blocks used in new and existing motor vehicles. Themanufacture or import of 1994 or later model year motor vehicles containingasbestos drum brake linings or asbestos disc pads (hereafter referred toas the original equipment market, or OEM) will be banned in Stage 2. Asbestosbrake friction material manufactured, imported, or processed as replacementdrum brake linings or disc brake pads for light- and medium-weight (LMV)motor vehicles with brake systems designed to use non-asbestos frictionmaterial will also be banned in Stage 2. The manufacture, import, or processingof asbestos brake blocks for heavy-weight (HV) motor vehicles will be bannedin Stage 3. In addition, all friction material containing asbestos manufactured,imported, or processed as replacement parts for vehicles designed to useasbestos friction material (hereafter referred to as the aftermarket, orAM) will be banned in Stage 3.  The benefits (in terms of cancer-cases-avoided) of the actions taken inthis rule on these product categories are set forth in the following TableXV:   <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,8,8    </C><T4>Table XV_Cancer-Cases-Avoided for Asbestos Vehicular Brakes   </T4><H1>Product   </H1><H1>Discount Rate   </H1><H2>3 percent   </H2><H2>0 percent   </H2>    <ITAG tagnum="1">Drum brake linings (OEM)   <D>6.33   </D><D>8.38    </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Drum brake linings (AM)   <D>76.79   </D><D>106.26    </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Disc brake pads, LMV (OEM)   <D>0.75   </D><D>0.99    </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Disc brake pads, LMV (AM)   <D>11.58   </D><D>15.85    </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Disc brake pads, HV (OEM andamp; AM)   <D>0.16   </D><D>0.22    </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Brake blocks (OEM andamp; AM)   <D>7.31   </D><D>10.10   </D></ITAG></ITAG>   In the proposal, EPA discussed two approaches for regulating asbestos vehicularfriction material, either banning all such material in Stage 2 or via theoperation of a permit system. EPA stated that it would consider a classexemption for replacement parts under the proposal's staged-ban option. Asbestos brake friction products are some of the most widely-used asbestosproducts and are a source of broadly ranging exposures to asbestos. EPAhas quantified exposures to asbestos from the manufacture, installation,use, and repair of brake friction products. During the life cycle of theseproducts, both occupational and non-occupational exposures to asbestospost a lifetime risk of cancer mortality. The population at risk from theseproducts is larger than that at risk from any other asbestos product categoryfor which exposure has been quantified for this rule.  Occupational exposure to asbestos from the primary and secondary manufactureof friction products is high and affects many people. The 8-hour TWA exposurelevel quantified for the primary manufacture of all friction products is0.145 f/cc (Ref. 29). The lifetime risk from this exposure is estimatedto be 5.0 andmultiply; 10^\3\, with 2,779 workers exposed. The exposure levelfrom secondary manufacture is considerably less than from primary manufacture,because secondary manufacture of friction products does not involve cutting,grinding, and fitting of brake material. However, the TWA exposure levelfor secondary manufacture is still high, ranging upward from 0.446 f/cc(Ref. 29). The lifetime risk from secondary manufacture ranges from anaverage of 1.6 andmultiply; 10^\3\ for drum brake linings to an average of1.9 andmultiply; 10^\3\ for disc brake pads, with 3,038 workers exposed.Quantifiable risk from non-occupational, lifetime exposure to asbestosreleased during the manufacturing of drum brakes alone is estimated at1.0 andmultiply; 10^\4\ for 92,008 people and greater than 1 andmultiply; 10^\6\for 2 million people.  Occupational expoure from the installation and repair of asbestos brakepads/linings/blocks may result in significant exposure. The 8-hour TWAexposure level for the servicing of disc and drum brake systems is estimatedto average 0.05 f/cc (Ref. 29). The lifetime risk from this exposure is1.68 andmultiply; 10^\3\. There are an estimated 329,000 brake repair facilitieswhere an FTE population of 1,391,000 mechanics may be exposed to asbestosduring installation and repair of asbestos brake friction products. Exposureand, thus, risk have not been quantified for the disposal of asbestos brakefriction material.  EPA estimated that approximately 13 million do-it-yourself brake installationand repair jobs are done annually by consumers (Ref. 31). Exposure fromconsumer brake repair varies depending upon the technique used to repairthe brakes, whether the repair is done in a garage or outdoors, and otherfactors. Release of asbestos fibers into the ambient environment resultingfrom the braking action of asbestos vehicular brakes contributes to thesignficant risk of cancer mortality for members of the general population.EPA has quantified the non-occupational exposures from the use of threefriction materials: drum brake linings, disc brake pads (LMV), and brakeblocks. EPA estimates that the lifetime risk is one in one million for101 million Americans, on average.      EPA received a large number of comments concerning exposure associatedwith the use of asbestos-containing brakes. Several commenters stated thatthere is very little risk of exposure to asbestos fibers released frombrakes, because the asbestos is transformed to forsterite by the high heatgenerated from the use of brakes. EPA recognizes that only a small percentageof the asbestos in brakes is eventually emitted into the air. The remainderis either trapped in the brake assembly or is transformed into mineralssuch as forsterite by the heat of abrasion before release. However, asbestosis definitely released from brakes during brake use. The three studiesof brake emissions, which EPA relied upon in developing its exposure estimates,all used electron microscopy to obtain positive mineralogical identificationof the emissions' components. The studies found that between 0.017 and0.216 percent of the material released was asbestos. Although these percentagesare quite small, the total amount of asbestos released from brake use (approximately7 tons per year) is large because the total volume of brake emissions islarge.  There are devices which can control the release of asbestos during thenormal replacement of brakes. These devices, the enclosed cylinder/HEPAvacuum system and the compressed air/solvent spray system, are recommended,but not required, by OSHA as means for reducing exposures below OSHA'sPEL and action level (Ref. 16). The OSHA standard prohibits the use ofair hoses during brake repair. Under ideal conditions these controls maysignificantly reduce exposure. However, controls must be used consistentlyto be effective and additional exposures can be created during the disposalof asbestos-contaminated solvent or during replacement of HEPA vacuum filters.If the devices are used properly and exposures are reduced to the PEL orlower, EPA believes that the residual exposure can still result in an unreasonablerisk. The efficacy of controlled use as an approach to risk reduction isdiscussed in more detail in Units V.A. 3 and V.E. of this preamble. Several commenters stated that EPA should not ban asbestos friction products,arguing that engineering controls can provide sufficient protection fromthe risks of asbestos exposure. EPA believes that while these controls,if used consistently, can reduce exposure to the OSHA PEL, EPA's analysisindicates that exposure at levels even below OSHA's 0.1 f/cc action levelstill pose significant risk. In computing workplace exposures, EPA assumedcompliance with the OSHA standard when actual monitoring data was eitherunavailable or above the OSHA PEL. For example, the EPA exposure data forbrake repair facilities estimate asbestos exposure at 0.05 f/cc (Ref. 29).Even at this level, which is one half the OSHA action level of 0.1 f/cc,EPA, using the risk table in the 1986 OSHA rule, calculates a lifetimerisk of 1.6andmultiply;10^3. Given the substantial lifetime risk and EPA'sconcern regarding the consistent and proper use of these controls by mechanics(Ref. 50), EPA does not believe that use of controls during brake repairwill sufficiently reduce risk.  Additionally, a controlled use approach as an alternative to a ban of asbestosin friction material would not reduce general population exposures to asbestosoriginating from brake use. In addition, these controls would not typicallybe available to the estimated 13 million consumers who annually performdo-it-yourself brake jobs (Ref. 31). EPA has assessed the current availability of non-asbestos friction materialfor disc and drum brake system in various vehicle weight classes. Thisassessment can be found in Volume III of the Regulatory Impact Analysis(Ref. 21). To summarize briefly, use of non-asbestos friction materialsin recently-manufactured vehicles is increasing rapidly. There is nearlycomplete substitution for asbestos in disc pads used in recently-manufacturedmotor vehicles. Almost 100 percent of disc pads for newly manufacturedheavy-weight vehicles are asbestos-free. For light- and medium-weight vehicles,85 percent of the disc pads used in new vehicles are asbestos-free. Severalproducers estimate that by 1990, 90 to 100 percent of the disc pads fornew vehicles will be asbestos-free. Evidence also indicates that significant progress is being made in thedevelopment of substitutes for drum brake linings used in recently-manufacturedmotor vehicles. As noted by some commenters, substitution for asbestosin drum brake linings and brake blocks in new model vehicles appears tobe more difficult than for disc brakes in new model vehicles. However,according to some commenters, much research is ongoing and some substitutesare currently available for drum brakes in newly-manufactured vehicles.Several commenters stated that asbestos substitutes are more readily availablethan EPA has estimated and that full conversion to asbestos-free brakesin newly-manufactured vehicles would be feasible in the near future. Somecommenters pointed to the rapid conversion to asbestos-free brake frictionmaterial in the European market as proof of the technical feasibility ofbanning similar products in the U.S. For example, Sweden, the Federal Republicof Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, and Norway have either bannedor are phasing out the use of asbestos friction material.Primary substitutes include semi-metallic materials for disc brakes andnon-asbestos organic materials (including fiberglass, para-aramid, mineralfibers, steel wool and fibers, and resins) for drums. Opinions from commentersvary greatly concerning the availability of effective and economical substitutesfor brake friction products. While some commenters stated that there aresubstitutes currently available for most, if not all, brake friction products,other commenters felt that substitutes would be available within 5 to 10years of the time of the proposal for most, if not all, brake frictionproducts. Several commenters were more pessimistic about the future availabilityof substitutes. Other commenters indicated that adequate asbestos-freebrake blocks may be difficult to develop for new model heavy-weight vehiclesbecause the weight of the vehicle puts greater demands on the braking system.While many opinions were offered in comments and elsewhere about the progressbeing made toward the use of asbestos-free brake friction material, EPAdid not receive analytical or quantitative data from commenters documentingtechnical difficulties encountered regarding substitution for asbestosin brake friction material. EPA acknowledges the inherent research anddevelopment variability associated with technological innovation. As aresult, EPA decided to delay the ban on asbestos disc brake pads and drumbrake linings in new light- and medium-weight vehicles and in replacementdisc pads and drum brake linings for light- and medium-weight vehicleswith brake systems designed to use non-asbestos until Stage 2. Manufacture,import, and marketing of brake blocks for use in either new heavy-weightvehicles or as replacements will not be banned until Stage 3. These datesare within the range of time frames suggested by comments and the AmericanSociety of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) expert panel's recommendations fornew vehicles (Ref. 40). Specifically, ASME stated that ``* * * at the presentrate of technical progress, most new passenger cars can be equipped withtotally new non-asbestos frictional systems by 1991, and most light trucksand heavy trucks with S-cam brakes, by 1992. However, a few low-volumenew vehicle applications may not have acceptable non-asbestos frictionmaterials at that time. Heavy truck wedge brake blocks, medium drum brakelinings and many off-road vehicle brake linings may not be developed by1992.'' Comments submitted to EPA in 1986 in response to its proposal describedvarious lead time frames that would be necessary to permit the transitionto non-asbestos OEM friction materials. These schedules varied between2 and 10 years. The most common time frame pointed to was 4 to 6 yearsfor most friction products, with special considerations given to brakeblocks and disc pads for heavy vehicles. Several commenters requested timeframes in excess of 10 years be considered for these heavy vehicles. Keepingin mind that these comments were made in 1986, EPA believes that it isreasonable to assume that OEM brake friction material for light- and medium-weightvehicles and heavy-weight vehicles can be asbestos-free by the dates prescribedin the rule. Commenters generally agreed that it is easier to develop replacement asbestos-freefriction materials for use in vehicles that are intentionally designedto use such materials than it is to develop asbestos-free friction materialsfor use as aftermarket replacement products in vehicles currently in usethat have brake systems designed to use asbestos. A number of commentersaddressed the current availability and efficacy of asbestos-free aftermarketreplacements for vehicles designed to use asbestos friction materials.Some of these commenters maintained that substitutes are currently availablefor all friction material aftermarket applications. Some of the major producersof brake friction products, including aftermarket friction materials, nolonger produce asbestos brake friction material. One commenter stated thatasbestos replacements for heavy-weight vehicles are no longer availablefrom reliable U.S. producers. On the other hand, some commenters statedthat it would be infeasible, primarily for economic reasons, to developeffective asbestos-free substitutes for the aftermarket, while others indicated,in 1986 comments, that it would take 10 years to develop adequate aftermarketsubstitutes. These comments about the technical infeasibility of replacingasbestos friction material with asbestos-free friction material were notbased on performance data, but rather theoretical discussions and anecdotalinformation. Due to the lack of analytical information, EPA cannot estimatequantitatively the rate at which asbestos-free substitution is occurringfor the aftermarket products. EPA has delayed until Stage 3 the ban onaftermarket friction materials manufactured, imported, or marketed foruse in brake systems designed to use asbestos. EPA believes this delaywill permit time to address technological difficulties in developing aftermarketsubstitutes for vehicles designed to use asbestos. By the effective dateof the Stage 3 ban, many of the vehicles on the road will be asbestos-freebecause of the Stage 2 ban and the prior manufacture of asbestos-free vehicles.EPA believes that it is important to force technology to develop asbestos-freereplacements as rapidly as possible particularity in light of the factthat many commenters have pointed to the current availability of asbestos-freereplacement linings/blocks and have noted rapid progress in the developmentof alternatives to asbestos friction materials. EPA plans to monitor theprogress of substitute availability for aftermarket products, thus encouragingsubstitute producers and aftermarket manufacturers to report progress ortechnological difficulties that may necessitate modification of certainprovisions of the ban. Comments described technological replacement difficulties or economic disincentivesassociated with developing asbestos-free friction material replacementparts for older and antique cars or for specialty cars such as race cars.EPA will consider a class exemption for such vehicles if one is requested.Some commenters stated that a ban on asbestos use in the aftermarket forbrake systems designed for asbestos friction products will compromise theperformance of braking systems designed for asbestos brakes. Some commenterswent so far as to predict that there may be more deaths in vehicle accidentsdue to poor performance caused by premature substitution than from thehealth risk posed by continued use of asbestos in friction products. Severalcommenters stated that EPA has ignored the impact of an asbestos frictionproduct ban on highway safety and that risks associated with substitutionshould have been considered as part of the rule's analysis of costs andbenefits. One commenter urged EPA to confer with the National Highway TrafficSafety Administration (NHTSA) regarding possible motor vehicles safetyconsiderations associated with use of non-asbestos friction materials invehicular brake systems. EPA and NHTSA have met and discussed potentialeffects on vehicle safety if asbestos friction materials were banned (Refs.61, 62, and 63). NHTSA has no objection to the staged ban and technicalreview approach adopted for this rule (Ref. 28).  Evaluation of the safety concern regarding asbestos substitution voicedby these commenters is complicated by the fact that there are no federalsafety standards governing the performance of aftermarket brake frictionproducts. While the NHTSA promulgated safety performance standards in 1968for brakes in new vehicles, no similar standards exist for replacementparts. NHTSA received two petitions requesting that NHTSA promulgate safetystandards for the aftermarket. These petitions noted the present use ofinferior grade asbestos and non-asbestos friction materials and the inadvertentmismatching of aftermarket friction material to individual brake systems;the petitioners argued that there is a compelling need to establish performancestandards for the aftermarket. NHTSA granted a petition requesting thatNHTSA propose a standard requiring that all heavy truck brake linings berated and marked in accordance with the requirements of such a standard.Another petitioner requested that NHTSA establish safety standards formotor vehicle aftermarket brakes. While NHTSA denied portions of that petition,NHTSA announced its intent to keep abreast of developments by the Societyof Automotive Engineers, as well as other developments in the areas ofbrake lining performance, the relationship to traffic safety, and the needsof the motoring public. NHTSA will continue to examine these issues asresources permit and review and adjust its position, if appropriate. EPA believes that without safety standards for the aftermarket, commerciallyavailable aftermarket friction material may continue to be of inconsistentquality, regardless of whether asbestos or asbestos-free friction productsare used. EPA also acknowledges that a ban on asbestos in the brake frictionproduct categories may increase the uncertainty about brake performance.In light of the controversy surrounding the availability of effective substitutesfor aftermarket friction products, coupled with the rapid development andcurrent use of some asbestos-free substitutes and the lack of definitiveevidence to resolve the controversy, EPA has decided to delay the ban onasbestos in aftermarket brake friction products until Stage 3 to allowsufficient time to develop adequate substitutes. In spite of the relativelylow economic impact associated with an immediate ban of asbestos in thebrake friction products category and the high risk associated with asbestosexposure originating from asbestos friction products, EPA believes thatit is important to provide this 7-year lead time for the industry to developand produce safe and effective asbestos-free substitutes. Such an approachis consistent with some comments received by EPA. The ban on asbestos friction products will become effective in two stages:the OEM for cars and light trucks will be banned in Stage 2 and the OEMfor heavy vehicles and the AM for all vehicles will banned in Stage 3.This sequential ban accommodates the variable rate of development notedby commenters. Some commenters proposed many more stages than EPA actuallyadopted in this final rule. EPA was concerned that a complicated scheduleof effective dates for the bans would be burdensome without any real benefit.The 2-stage ban for asbestos brakes adopted in this rule represents timeframes that are generally consistent with dates proposed by commenters.While some controversy may continue to exist over the dates when substituteswill be available for different vehicle types, EPA believes that this ruleprovides sufficient lead time for the development of effective non-asbestossubstitute brakes. In light of these facts and the extensive risk posed by exposure to asbestosfrom vehicular brakes, EPA believes that it is appropriate and necessaryto ban asbestos in vehicular friction material. Nonetheless, as describedabove, EPA, in consultation with NHTSA, will monitor the pace of substitutedevelopment and undertake a technical review 5 years after the effectivedate of the rule, to ensure the availability of suitable non-asbestos aftermarketbrake products. After considering all of these issues, EPA believes thatthis is the best approach in light of the high risk posed by asbestos,the rapid development of replacement friction materials, the current useof non-asbestos brakes in European countries, the controversy concerningsubstitute availability and performance, and the current consideration,by NHTSA, of aftermarket safety standards. The total costs of the actions taken in this rule for these product categoriesare set forth in the following Table XVI: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,10</C><T4>Table XVI_Cost of the Rule for Asbestos Vehicular Brakes </T4><H1>Product </H1><H1>Total Cost (in $ million, discounted at 3 percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Drum brake linings (OEM) <D>7.13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Drum brake linings (AM) <D>8.79</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Disc brake pads, LMV (OEM) <D>3.56</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Disc brake pads, LMV (AM) <D>3.94</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Disc brake pads, HV (OEM andamp; AM) <D>0.33</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Brake blocks (OEM andamp; AM) <D>1.95</D></ITAG></ITAG>f. <T3>Other friction products. </T3>This grouping includes clutch facings,automatic transmission components, and the industrial and commercial frictionproducts categories. These products will all be banned at Stage 2. Thebenefits (in terms of cancer-cases-avoided) of the actions taken in thisrule on these product categories are set forth in the following Table XVII:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,8,8</C><T4>Table XVII_Cancer-Cases-Avoided for Other Friction Products </T4><H1>Product </H1><H1>Discount rate </H1><H2>3 percent </H2><H2>0 percent</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Clutch facings <D>1.05 </D><D>1.38</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Automatic transmission components <D>andless;0.01</D><D>andless;0.01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Industrial and commercial friction products <D>0.40</D><D>0.52</D></ITAG></ITAG>Primary routes of exposure to asbestos from these products occur duringmanufacture and repair. Quantified occupational risk posed by the manufactureand repair of these products ranges from an average of 1.46andmultiply;10^3for the primary manufacture of automatic transmission components to anaverage of 5.2andmultiply;10^3 for the primary manufacture of friction materials.Approximately 517 workers in primary and secondary manufacture and 116FTEs in installation, repair, and disposal are exposed to asbestos. Inaddition to these occupational risks, EPA has quantified significant non-occupationalreleases from the primary manufacturing of these three products. Monitoringdata are not available for the exposure resulting from the use of theseproducts, although EPA does believe additional exposures from clutchesand industrial and commercial friction products are likely. After assessing the current availability of substitutes and expert opinionsconcerning the predicted availability of substitutes, EPA believes thatsuitable substitutes will be available for clutch facings, automatic transmissioncomponents, and commercial and industrial friction products by the effectivedates of the bans. Over the last several year, EPA has noted the increaseduse of non-asbestos parts for these products, and believes further developmentis likely. The total cost of the actions taken in this rule for these product categoriesare set forth in the following Table XVIII: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,10</C><T4>Table XVIII_Cost of the Rule for Other Friction Products</T4><H1>Product</H1><H1>Total Cost in $ million, discounted at 3 percent</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Clutch facings<D>12.87 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Automatic transmission components<D>0.22 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Industrial and commercial friction products<D>2.11</D></ITAG></ITAG> The economic impact on this ban will be limited by the fact that most majorprimary manufacturers of asbestos friction products also produce asbestos-freesubstitute products. In fact, all of the U.S. manufacturers of asbestos-containingautomatic transmission components also produce asbestos-free products.Currently, asbestos-containing automatic transmission components currentlycomprise only one quarter of the present market. Considering the rapidsubstitution in this area and relatively low cost, EPA will ban the manufactureof automatic transmission components at Stage 2. EPA has concluded that a Stage 2 ban is appropriate for these product categoriesfor the following reasons: (1) Relatively high quantifiable exposure andindividual risk levels exist for these products; (2) these products posea high potential for ambient release during a number of life cycle stages;(3) workers and the general population are potentially subject to uncontrolledexposures; (4) suitable substitutes exist for many of these products andare likely to exist for others by the time of the ban; and (5) the costof taking these actions is reasonable. g. <T3>Gaskets. </T3>This grouping includes most of the beater-add and sheetgasket product categories. These products, except for specialty industrialapplications, will be banned in Stage 2. Specialty industrial gaskets arenot banned under this rule (see discussion at Unit V.F.l.x below). Thebenefits (in terms of cancer-cases-avoided) of the actions taken in thisrule on these product categories are set forth in the following Table XIX:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,8,8</C><T4>Table XIX_Cancer-Cases-Avoided for Gaskets \1\</T4><H1>Product</H1><H1>Discount rate </H1><H2>3 percent</H2><H2>0 percent</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Beater-add gaskets<D>21.48</D><D>28.34 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sheet gaskets<D>10.76</D><D>14.20 </D><F>\1\ Does not include specialty industrial gaskets.</F></ITAG></ITAG> Gaskets are materials used to seal one compartment of a device from anotherin applications such as engine and exhaust manifolds. Asbestos gasketsare used mainly to seal connections and prevent leakage of fluids betweensolid surfaces.  Primary routes of exposure to asbestos from these products occur duringmanufacture, repair of machinery containing an asbestos gasket, replacementof the gasket itself, and disposal. Exposure estimates (but not cost orbenefit estimates) used in this Unit reflect exposures quantified for allgasket applications, including the small specialty industrial gasket segmentof the gasket market that is not banned by this rule. An estimated 2,583workers are exposed to asbestos during primary and secondary manufacturingof asbestos gaskets. Quantifiable risk of occupational exposure to theseproducts ranges from an average of 7.35 x 10^4 for the secondary manufactureof beater-add gaskets to an average of 3.56 x 10^3 for the secondary manufactureof sheet gaskets. Quantifiable risk from non-occupational, lifetime exposuresto asbestos released during the manufacture of beater-add gaskets aloneis estimated at 1 x 10^4 for approximately 47,000 people and at greaterthan 1 x 10^6 for approximately 6 million people. EPA believes that theexposures quantified for these products are underestimated. Exposures thatoccur during gasket replacement and machinery repair, including activitieslike scraping of gaskets or on-site fabrication of gaskets, were not quantifiedby EPA. EPA determined that accurately quantifying these exposures andthe resultant risks would be difficult and that sufficient other exposureand risk information is available regarding these products to make a findingof unreasonable risk. According to comments, production of asbestos-containing sheet and beater-addgaskets has dropped significantly in most applications in recent yearsand non-asbestos substitutes already possess a large share of both gasketmarkets. Also, commenters indicated that the majority of the gasket marketwill be asbestos-free before the end of 1989. The economic impact of thisban will be limited by the fact that significant progress has been madein the development and availability of non-asbestos substitutes for mostgasket applications and that most, if not all, major primary manufacturersof asbestos gaskets also produce non-asbestos substitute products. Dueto the insufficiency of available price data, these recent trends, andthe resultant decreases in the costs of banning this product, are not fullytaken into account in the analysis of the benefits of banning these categories.Therefore, EPA believes that the actual cost of the actions taken on thesecategories is less than that indicated below. Gaskets were proposed for either a Stage 3 ban or a ban via the operationof a permit system. However, EPA has received comments indicating thatthe development of suitable substitutes has been more rapid than projectedfor most applications. EPA is also concerned that consumers and othersmay be subject to uncontrolled exposures during the repair and replacementof consumer applications of these products.The total costs of the actions taken in this rule for these product categoriesare set forth in the following Table XX:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,10</C><T4>Table XX_Cost Of The Rule For Gaskets \1\</T4><H1>Product</H1><H1>Total Cost in $ million (discounted at 3 percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Beater-add gaskets<D>111.20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sheet gaskets<D>96.52</D><F>\1\ Does not include specialty industrial gaskets.</F></ITAG></ITAG>EPA has concluded that a Stage 2 ban is appropriate for these product categories(except for specialty industrial gaskets) for the following reasons: (1)Relatively high quantifiable exposure and individual risk levels existfor these products; (2) these products pose a high potential for ambientrelease during a number of life cycle stages; (3) homeowners and workersare potentially subject to uncontrolled exposures during removal and replacementof gaskets; (4) the overall cost calculated for taking these actions isrelatively high, but is likely to be an overestimate because, accordingto commenters, suitable substitutes exist for many of these products andare likely to exist for others by the time of the ban; and (5) the schedulingof these products for a Stage 2 ban allows for the continued developmentof substitutes. Delaying the ban on these gaskets until Stage 3 or notbanning the use of asbestos in these products could hurt the efforts ofthe large numbers of firms that have already made significant progressin developing substitutes because some substitutes are more expensive thanasbestos-containing gaskets.Specialty industrial gaskets are excluded from this rule's bans. Theseapplications are not banned because of the high costs of a ban, due tothe lack of suitable substitutes for a number of specialized industrialuses, the relatively small benefits derived from a ban, and a number ofother factors described in Unit V.F.1.x.h. <T3>A/C pipe.</T3> This category will be banned in Stage 3. The benefits(in terms of cancer-cases-avoided) of the actions taken in this rule onthis product category are as follows: 3.17 cases if benefits are discountedat 3 percent and 4.38 cases if benefits are not discounted.A/C pipe is a product composed of cement and asbestos fibers and used primarilyto convey potable water in water mains, sewage in force main sewers, andvarious materials in industrial process lines (pressure pipe applications),as well as storm drain pipes and sewer pipes (non-pressure pipe applications).Thousands of miles of A/C pipe are installed in the U.S. annually. A/Cpipe comes in a wide variety of diameters, formulations, and weights designedfor different applications.Primary routes of exposure to asbestos from these products occur duringmanufacture and installation. A total of 286 workers is estimated to beexposed to asbestos during the primary manufacture of A/C pipe and as manyas 14,944 workers may be exposed during the installation and removal ofA/C pipe. Individual lifetime risks posed by these products from occupationalexposure are estimated to range from 6.11 andmultiply; 10^4 for installationand removal (a lower bound that assumes workers install and remove A/Cpipe 16 percent of their working hours) to an average of 3 andmultiply; 10^3for primary manufacture. Individual risk from non-occupational lifetimeexposure to asbestos released during manufacturing is estimated at 1 andmultiply;10^4 for approximately 30,000 people and at over 1 andmultiply; 10^6 forapproximately 2 million people. However, EPA believes that the exposuresquantified for this category are underestimated. Worker exposures thatoccur due to the cutting, drilling, or machining of pipe in possible violationof OSHA requirements or general population exposure because of possibleerosion of A/C pipe are not accounted for. U.S. production of A/C pipehas decreased significantly in recent years with the declines in sewersystem construction and other market factors, including the growing useof non-asbestos substitute products.Some commenters have stated that A/C pipe possesses a number of uniqueattributes, including lower energy requirements and friction loss, andgreater durability in certain environments than the substitutes identifiedin the RIA, and that therefore A/C pipe should not be banned in the nearterm. Available evidence suggests that products are currently availableas substitutes. The primary substitutes for A/C pipe are polyvinylchloride(PVC) and ductile iron pipe. There are a variety of asbestos-free concreteproducts, including prestressed and reinforced concrete pipes that mayalso be used as substitutes. All primary U.S. producers of A/C pipe alsoproduce direct substitutes made out of non-asbestos materials. A commenterindicated that a cement/substitute-fiber composition is under developmentand that the substitute fiber may replace asbestos in A/C pipe, thus permittingthe continued use of capital equipment currently used to produce A/C pipe.This would substantially reduce the costs and societal impact of banningA/C pipe.Some commenters have argued that if A/C pipe is banned, pressure may bebrought to replace or discontinue use of existing A/C pipe. EPA does notbelieve that installed A/C pipe should be replaced or that its use shouldbe discontinued. EPA's evaluation of the risk posed by A/C pipe, and byall products subject to this rule, is of absolute risk posed over the entirelife cycle of products to be produced in the future, not just risk posedby existing products during product use. EPA's primary concern, for purposesof this rule, is the risk posed by exposures during the life cycle stagesof A/C pipe from manufacture through installation. Expected risks laterin the product life cycle, for example those risks engendered from exposuresdue to eroding pipe, have not been quantified. Therefore, actions to removeor discontinue use of existing A/C pipe in response to this rule are notjustified.Other commenters argued that if A/C pipe is banned in the U.S., other countries,including those where viable substitutes for A/C pipe are not readily available,would be pressured to ban the product. EPA's unreasonable risk analysisfor this rule for A/C pipe is based not only on the risk posed during thelife cycle of the product in the U.S., but also on the availability ofviable substitutes in the U.S. and other factors. Therefore, the fact thatEPA finds in this rule that future A/C pipe production and use in the U.S.poses an unreasonable risk does not imply that a similar finding couldbe made outside of the U.S.A commenter argued that PVC and ductile iron pipe as primary substitutesfor A/C pipe pose greater health risks than those posed during the lifecycle of A/C pipe. EPA acknowledges that the individual lifetime cancerrisk associated with the production of PVC may be equivalent to that associatedwith the production of A/C pipe. EPA could not calculate individual lifetimecancer risk for the production of ductile iron pipe. Instead EAP couldonly compute population cancer risk for ductile iron pipe production becauseof the manner in which available risk data were presented. The populationcancer risk for the production of ductile iron pipe could be comparableto the population cancer risk for production of A/C pipe. While availableinformation permitted EPA to quantify the risks associated with the installationof A/C pipe, cancer risks from installation of ductile iron pipe or toPVC dust from installation of PVC pipe have not been identified. Whileindividual lifetime risks have been quantified for vinyl chloride (VC)leachate in drinking water, individual lifetime risks associated with asbestosin drinking water have not been specifically quantified. While the supportingdata are limited, based on a consideration of life cycle risks, EPA believesthat the available evidence suggests that substitution of A/C pipe withPVC and ductile iron pipe will present lower population cancer risks.i. <T3>Polyvinylchloride pipe. </T3>For the proposed rule, EPA concluded thatPVC pipe does not appear to present a health hazard comparable to asbestos,although VC, the monomer used to produce PVC, is a carcinogen. EPA alsoconcluded that while VC is a human carcinogen, it does not appear to presenta greater hazard than asbestos in the workplace or ambient environment.The PVC product itself presents little risk and workplace exposures areapparently adequately controlled (Ref. 39).EPA based this determination, for the proposed rule, on several factorsincluding the individual lifetime cancer risk of 10^4 for occupationalexposure due to inhalation of VC in the manufacture of PVC pipe (Ref. 39).In response to the proposal, a commenter stated that workers exposed viainhalation to VC at the OSHA's PEL of 1 ppm would have a potential individuallifetime cancer risk of 4 andmultiply; 10^3. The commenter noted that thisindividual lifetime cancer risk is based on EPA's Carcinogen AssessmentGroup's (CAG) published unit cancer risk of 2 andmultiply; 10^2 (mg/kg/day)^1for VC based on animal inhalation data. The commenter questioned the discrepancybetween the individual lifetime cancer risk estimation for VC of 4 andmultiply;10^3 and the lifetime cancer risk of 10^4 cited in EPA's support documentfor the proposed rule.The commenter is correct that CAG has published a unit risk number forinhalation exposure to VC. This unit risk number was derived from animalinhalation data. The individual lifetime cancer risk number, 10^4, citedin the support document for the proposal, was derived from epidemiologicaldata analyzed and reported by Nicholson et al. 1982 (Ref. 39). In summary,EPA believes that the expected individual lifetime cancer risk associatedwith the manufacture of PVC pipe may be equivalent to the individual lifetimecancer risk posed by manufacture of  A/C pipe. However, as noted in testimonypresented by a consultant for the Asbestos Institute at the 1986 legislativehearing, production of A/C pipe is significantly more labor intensive thanproduction of PVC pipe. Even if one assumes that the lifetime cancer riskfor production of A/C pipe and inhalation of VC in the manufacture of PVCpipe are comparable, the number of expected cancer cases (population risk)from production of PVC pipe will most likely be lower than the expectednumber of cancer cases associated with the production of an equivalentamount of A/C pipe.EPA recognizes that VC inhalation exposure in the workplace, is the mostsignificant exposure. Other potential exposures that could be present butare difficult to evaluate include: (1) VC leachate in drinking water, (2)VC emissions from PVC plants, and (3) inhalation of PVC dust. A commenternoted that ``exposure to VC by ingestion in drinking water (via leachingfrom the PVC water pipe or as a contaminant in the water supply from disposalof VC/PVC waste products) also occurs.'' Additionally, the commenter notedthat EPA should update its unit cancer risk value for ingestion given amore recent calculation by EPA's Office of Drinking Water.EPA acknowledges the presence of detectable levels of VC in drinking water;however, the amount of VC expected to leach into drinking water from PVCpipe is considered to be minimal (Ref. 43). It is estimated that nearlyall individuals (99 percent) using public water supplies are exposed toandless;1.0 mg/l of VC from all sources. At 1.0 mg/l, the excess lifetimecancer risk is about 6 andmultiply; 10^5 (Ref. 44). Since leaching of VCfrom PVC drinking water pipe is estimated to be minimal, the risks associatedwith any increase in the amount of VC leachate in drinking water as a resultof a ban of A/C pipe is also expected to be minimal.Exposure to respirable PVC dusts and fumes may occasionally be encounteredin the production of PVC or in the manufacture of PVC pipe. Exposure toPVC dust is associated with fibrotic lung changes and nonfatal lung conditions,such as bronchitis and pneumococcosis (Ref. 45).Analogous to its analytical approach to asbestos and fibrous substitutes,EPA limited its PVC assessment to health effects directly associated withVC or PVC. Effects from exposure to other chemicals (such as solvents,byproducts, intermediates, and adhesives) involved in the manufacture,installation, use or disposal of PVC pipe were not considered. For theproposal, EPA evaluated hazard and exposure data on some other chemicalsassociated with pipe production and use. However, as noted by a commenter,the hazard and/or exposure data for these other chemicals are too limitedto assess risk.On the basis of available evidence, on balance, EPA believes that the populationrisk associated with A/C pipe life cycle exposures are likely to exceedthe population risks associated with life cycle exposures to PVC pipe.A/C pipe presents risks throughout its product life cycle during manufacture,installation and repair, use and disposal because of the especially hazardousproperties inherent in asbestos, the environmental persistence of asbestosfibers, and the larger populations exposed. In contrast, PVC pipe presentsrisks largely during the manufacturing phase of PVC pipe.ii. <T3>Ductile iron pipe. </T3>For the proposed rule, EPA concluded that ductileiron pipe, as a substitute for A/C pipe, would not present a health hazardcomparable to that of asbestos (Ref. 39). Based on EPA's revised analysisof lifetime exposure associated with A/C pipe, one could argue that thenumber of excess cancer deaths associated with the production of ductileiron pipe and A/C pipe may be similar (Ref. 42). However, the excess cancerdeaths that may be attributed to ductile iron pipe may be overestimated(Ref. 42). The estimate of excess cancers was derived from epidemiologicaldata gathered on steel and iron foundry workers who may have had more diverseand higher exposures to toxic agents. Nevertheless, even if the cancerrisk associated with ductile iron foundries is similar to steel foundries,the estimate of cancer risk for ductile iron pipe is most likely an overestimatefor current exposure since historical exposures upon which the risks werebased were probably much greater. In contrast, ductile iron pipe is manufacturedfrom scrap metal which is not expected to result in exposures similar inmagnitude to those found in the steel and iron foundries. Given that thenumber of workers exposed to particular agents in particular job categoriescannot be determined, a precise occupational cancer risk comparison cannotbe made. In addition, available evidence suggests that risks during non-manufacturingstages of the product life cycle are greater for A/C pipe than for ductileiron pipe. Thus, EPA believes that fewer cancer cases would be expectedfrom the substitution of ductile iron pipe for A/C pipe than from the continuedmanufacture, processing, and use of A/C pipe.iii. <T3>Regulatory approach. </T3>The total costs of the actions taken in thisrule for this product category is $128.03 million. This cost is likelyan overestimate of actual cost in that it does not quantify the effectof the development of substitute fibers in cement pipe production. Useof a substitute fiber is expected to substantially reduce the costs andsocietal impact of banning this product.EPA has concluded that a Stage 3 ban is appropriate for this product categoryfor the following reasons: (1) relatively high quantifiable exposure andindividual risk levels exist for these products; (2) these products posea high potential for release of asbestos fibers during a number of lifecycle stages; (3) workers and surrounding populations are potentially subjectto uncontrolled exposures, especially during installation; (4) while thiscategory was proposed for a Stage 1 ban, EPA has concluded that it is appropriateto delay the ban until Stage 3 to allow more time for further substitutedevelopment; (5) the cost of taking these actions is reasonable becauseperformance and price suitable substitutes exist. Prior to the effectivedate of the Stage 3 ban, EPA will undertake a technical review to determinethe availability of non-asbestos substitutes for A/C pipe. EPA believesthat this is the best approach in light of the significant risk posed byasbestos; the possible risks posed by the current major substitutes, PVCand ductile iron pipe; and the development of further substitutes for A/Cpipe.i. <T3>Coatings.</T3> This grouping includes the roof coatings and cementsand non-roofing adhesives, sealants, and coatings product categories. Theseproducts will be banned in Stage 3. The benefits (in terms of cancer-cases-avoided)of the actions taken in this rule on these product categories are set forthin the following Table XXI:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s75,7.2,7.2</C><T4>Table XXI_Cancer-Cases-Avoided for Coatings</T4><H1>Product</H1><H1>Discount rate</H1><H2>3 percent</H2><H2>0 percent</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Roof coatings <D>1.08 </D><D>1.49</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Non-roof coatings <D>1.33 </D><D>1.84</D></ITAG></ITAG>These products are used for a wide variety of functions. Roof coatingsuses include waterproofing, sealing, and repair of roofs. Non-roof coatingsuses include adhesives, sealants, and coatings used in the building construction,automotive, and aerospace industries.Primary routes of exposure to asbestos from these products occur duringmanufacture, installation or application, and repair. A total of 582 workersis estimated to be exposed to asbestos during primary manufacture of asbestosroof coatings, and 553 workers are exposed during the primary manufactureof asbestos non-roof coatings. Quantifiable risk posed by these productsis estimated to range from 1.22andmultiply;10^3 for the removal of roof coatingsin built-up roofing (a lower bound that assumes less than full-time exposure)to an average of 3.52andmultiply;10-3 for the primary manufacture of non-roofcoatings. Quantifiable risk from non-occupational, lifetime exposures toasbestos released during the manufacture of roof coatings is estimatedat 6.27andmultiply;10^5 for approximately 1,000 people and at greater than1andmultiply;10^6 for approximately 450,000 people.However, EPA has concluded that the exposure quantified for this groupingare underestimated. EPA did not quantify exposures that occur during application,maintenance, and repair, including activities like spray application ofcoatings and sanding or removal of existing coatings or caulking. EPA alsodid not quantify releases to the ambient air due to the weathering of productsused in outdoor, sometimes harsh environments. Many products in this categorythat are used in outdoor environments eventually wear off or chip or flake,resulting in difficult to monitor ambient releases. If, as a means of representingthe possible effect of underestimated exposure during installation andremoval, it were assumed that as little as one-tenth of 1 percent of asbestosconsumed for these uses were released over the life cycle of the productsand exposure were assumed based on analogous product operations, the estimateof benefits would more than double for roof coatings (benefits would be3.57 cases at 0 percent and 2.59 cases at 3 percent) and would increasefor non-roof coatings (benefits would be 2.07 cases at 0 percent and 1.50cases at 3 percent).According to comments, non-asbestos substitutes possess growing sharesof both coatings markets. Available evidence suggests that suitable substitutesshould be available for most applications by Stage 3. One commenter, amajor producer of roof coatings, indicated that it had replaced asbestosin all of its formulations. Trends toward the greater use of non-asbestossubstitutes and probable decreases in the cost of substitutes are not fullytaken into account in the analysis of the benefits of banning these categoriesbecause of the unavailability of substitute use information at the timethe analysis was performed. Therefore, EPA believes that the actual costof the actions taken on these categories is less than that indicated below.Both coatings categories were proposed for either a Stage 3 ban or a banvia operation of a permit system. EPA has received comments indicatingthat progress has been made in the development of suitable substitutes.The total costs of the actions taken in this rule for these product categoriesare set forth in the following Table XXII:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s10,14 </C><T4>Table XXII_Cost of the Rule for Coatings</T4><H1>Product</H1><H1>Total cost in $ million, discounted at 3 percent </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Roof coatings <D>45.48</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Non-roof coatings <D>0.81</D></ITAG></ITAG>EPA has concluded that a Stage 3 ban is appropriate for these product categoriesfor the following reasons: (1) Relatively high quantifiable exposure andindividual risk levels exist for these products; (2) these products posea high potential for ambient release during a number of life cycle stages,including ambient releases due to weathering during outdoor use; (3) homeownersand workers are potentially subject to uncontrolled exposures during productapplication, maintenance, and removal; (4) the cost of taking these actionsis reasonable because suitable substitutes are expected to exist for allof these products by the time of the ban; and (5) while the quantifiedbenefits of banning these products are relatively small, compared to otherproduct categories banned by this rule, these products are likely bothto lead to a number of serious exposures that could not be readily quantifiedfor this rule and to contribute significantly to environmental loading.j. <T3>Paper products. </T3>This grouping includes the commercial paper, corrugatedpaper, millboard, rollboard, and specialty paper product categories. Theseproducts will be banned in Stage 3. The benefits (in terms of cancer-cases-avoided)of the actions taken in this rule of these product categories are set forthin the following Table XXIII:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,9,9 </C><T4>Table XXIII_Cancer-Cases-Avoided for Asbestos Paper Products</T4><H1>Product</H1><H1>Discount rate</H1><H2>3 percent</H2><H2>0 percent</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Millboard<D>0.42</D><D>0.58</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Specialty paper<D>0.10</D><D>0.14</D></ITAG></ITAG>Commercial and corrugated paper and rollboard are no longer commerciallyimported or produced in the U.S.The products in these categories are used for a wide variety of functions.They are frequently very similar in form, but differ primarily by specificend use. Product uses include thermal insulation, fireproofing, and fillfor a variety of applications, such as beverage and other filters. Asbestospaper products are also used as a component of other products, such asgaskets (discussed above).Primary routes of exposure to asbestos from these products occur duringmanufacture, installation, repair, removal, and disposal. A total of 668workers is estimated to be exposed to asbestos during primary and secondarymanufacturing of asbestos paper products. Quantifiable risk posed by theseproducts is estimated to range from an average of 7.35 andmultiply; 10^4for the secondary manufacturing of all paper products to an average of1.87 andmultiply; 10^3 for the primary manufacturing of millboard. Thereis potential for episodic, peak exposure during manufacturing activities.Respirators and strict workplace and cleaning practices must be observedto meet the existing OSHA PEL for these products. Quantifiable risk fromnon-occupational, lifetime exposure to asbestos released during the manufactureof millboard is estimated at 1 andmultiply; 10^4 for approximately 2,256people and at greater than 1 andmultiply; 10^6 for approximately 840,000people. EPA has concluded that the overall exposures quantified for thisgrouping are underestimated. EPA did not quantify exposures that occurduring installation, repair, and removal, including activities like cutting,drilling, and tearing performed by hand during installation, maintenance,removal, and disposal of existing products. EPA determined that accuratelyquantifying these exposures and the resultant risks would be difficultand that sufficient other exposure and risk information is available regardingthese products to make a finding of unreasonable risk.According to EPA's analysis and comments, three of the five paper productsin this grouping, commercial and corrugated paper and rollboard, are nolonger commercially imported or produced in the U.S. In addition, low-costsubstitutes exist for products in the millboard and the specialty papercategories. Therefore, available evidence suggests that suitable substitutesshould be available for most applications by the effective date of theStage 3 ban. The total costs of the actions taken in this rule for theseproduct categories are set forth in the following Table XXIV:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s10,15</C><T4>Table XXIV:_Cost of the Rule for Asbestos Paper Products</T4><H1>Product</H1><H1>Total cost in $ million, discounted at 3 percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Millboard<D>3.73</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Specialty paper<D>0</D></ITAG></ITAG>The paper product categories were proposed for either a Stage 3 ban ora ban via the operation of a permit system. Many of these products areno longer used in the U.S. and suitable substitutes are rapidly being developed,although the development of reasonably-priced substitutes for some specialtyuses might take a number of years. EPA is also concerned that consumersmay be subject to uncontrolled exposures during installation, maintenance,repair, and removal of products such as millboard. In addition, many ofthese paper products are very similar in form and bans would be difficultto enforce were the products in this grouping banned at different times.EPA has concluded that a Stage 3 ban is appropriate for these product categoriesfor the following reasons: (1) Relatively high quantifiable exposure andindividual risk levels exist for these products; (2) these products posea high potential for ambient release during a number of life cycle stages;(3) consumers and workers are potentially subject to uncontrolled exposures,especially during installation, maintenance, repair, and removal of theseproducts; (4) the cost of taking these actions is reasonable because severalof these products are no longer produced or imported in the U.S. and becausesuitable substitutes are expected to exist for all of these products bythe time of the ban; and (5) while the quantified benefits of banning theseproducts are relatively small, compared to other product categories bannedby this rule, these products are likely both to lead to a number of seriousexposures that could not be readily quantified for this rule and to contributesignificantly to environmental loading.One asbestos paper product category, high-grade electrical paper, is notincluded within the rule's bans (see Unit V.F.1.v). This product is notincluded for a number of uses of the product, thereby making the cost ofa ban very high relative to other products analyzed for this rule. In addition,high-grade electrical paper is reasonably discernable from other paperproducts.k. <T3>New commercial asbestos products. </T3>This grouping covers all newasbestos-containing products whose commercial manufacture, importation,or processing commences after the effective date of this rule. All suchnew uses will be banned from manufacture, importation, processing, anddistribution in commerce as of Stage 1, unless EPA grants an exemptionapplication for the product or use. In view of the following factors, EPAfinds that the use of asbestos in new products whose commercial manufacture,importation, or processing is initiated after the effective date of thisrule's bans poses an unreasonable risk of injury to human health: (1) Thedevelopment of substitute fibers, (2) the potential for high lifetime risksrelated to exposure to asbestos due to the manufacture, importation, processing,and use of new asbestos products, (3) the likely escalation of environmentalloading of asbestos if the manufacture, importation, processing, or distributionin commerce of new asbestos products were allowed, (4) the speculativebenefits of new uses of asbestos, and (5) the absence of cost related tomodification of existing capital equipment. Therefore, EPA finds that thebenefits of banning new commercial asbestos products outweighs the costsof such a ban. Should a new use of asbestos be developed which meets thecriteria applied to exemptions for existing asbestos products, set outin Unit III.E of this preamble and andSection;763.173, an exemption shouldbe applied for and may be granted. 1. <T3>Categories and activities not subject to this rule's ban. </T3>Thisgrouping includes acetylene cylinders, arc chutes, asbestos diaphragms,battery separators, high-grade electrical paper, missile liners, packings,reinforced plastic, sealant tape, specialty industrial gaskets, and textiles.These products were generally proposed for a third stage ban or a ban viathe operation of a permit system. These products are exempted from thefinal rule's bans because, based on currently-available information, EPAhas not found that they pose an unreasonable risk of injury to human healthunder the criteria of TSCA section 6. EPA will reconsider its decisionwhether to include these products within the ban if more information aboutthem becomes available. The following paragraphs discuss EPA's findings for the various productsin this grouping. i. <T3>Acetylene cylinder filler. </T3>These products are used as filler insteel cylinders used to store acetone in oxyacetylene torches. Benefitsderived by banning this product would total less than one-tenth of a cancer-case-avoided.Exposures during primary manufacture are low due to the enclosed natureof the product's production process. Exposures in stages of the product'slife cycle beyond primary manufacture are likely to be limited, relativeto other product categories, because the product is enclosed and thereis little exposure during product repair or disposal compared to otherproducts analyzed for this rule. EPA does not believe that a ban is appropriate for this product categoryfor the following reasons: (1) Current substitutes are more expensive thanasbestos products and little information is available on the relative performancecharacteristics of substitutes; therefore, reasonable cost, suitable substitutesmay not be available for all applications of these products; (2) this productcategory accounts for only a minuscule portion of U.S. asbestos consumption(approximately 584 tons in 1985); and (3) a ban on this product categorywould result in only minimal benefits because asbestos exposure is limitedin most life cycles stages, relative to other products analyzed for thisrule. ii. <T3>Arc chutes. </T3>These products are used to guide electric arcs inproducts including motor starter units in electric generating plants. Thebenefits derived from a ban on this product would total only a small fractionof a cancer-case-avoided. Although EPA has no data on exposure for productsin this category, exposures in product life cycle stages beyond primarymanufacture are likely to be limited, relative to other product categories,because the asbestos is bound in ceramic in the end use product. EPA does not believe that a ban is appropriate for this product categoryfor the following reasons: (1) Insufficient information was available regardingexposure to determine the benefits of banning this product; (2) this productcategory accounts for only a minuscule portion of U.S. asbestos consumption(approximately 13.5 tons in 1985). iii. <T3>Asbestos diaphragms. </T3>These products are used primarily in thechlor-alkali industry in the production of chlorine, caustic soda, andother products. Benefits derived by banning this product would total approximatelythree-tenths of a cancer-case-avoided. Exposure to asbestos during thelife cycle of this product is limited because the product is generallyfabricated on site, used saturated with solution, and disposed of whilewet. Asbestos is not prone to be released into the ambient air during stagesafter product fabrication. Further, insufficient information exists regardingthe availability of substitute products for diaphragms in existing chlorineproduction plants to justify a ban. The cost of modifying existing plantsto accept new membrane cell technology in response to a ban on asbestosuse in this product may be very high. Based on available information, thetotal cost of banning this product is estimated to total more than $2 billion.However, suitable substitutes now exist for asbestos diaphragms for usein more recently constructed chlorine product plants. Therefore, EPA specificallyrecommends that users of asbestos diaphragms use non-asbestos diaphragmcells in facilities that will accept them and in the design of new facilities.EPA does not believe that a ban is appropriate for this product categoryfor the following reasons: (1) Insufficient information was available todetermine whether suitable product substitutes will soon be available foruse in existing chlorine production facilities; (2) the cost of banningthis product category would be very high; (3) this product category accountsfor only a minuscule portion of U.S. asbestos consumption (less than 1,000tons in 1985); and (4) a ban on this product category would result in onlyminimal benefits because asbestos exposure is limited in most life cyclestages, relative to other products analyzed for this rule.iv. <T3>Battery separators</T3>. These products are used to insulate or separatethe polar terminals in batteries or fuel cells, primarily in highly-specializedmilitary and aerospace applications. The benefits derived from a ban onthis product would total only a small fraction of a cancer-case-avoided.Although EPA has no date on exposure to products in this category, exposuresin stages of the product's life cycle beyond primary manufacture are likelyto be limited, relative to other product categories, because asbestos isenclosed during use and disposal. In addition, because most uses are highlyspecialized and built to government specifications, it is doubtful thatsubstitutes will be developed or costs of a prospective ban will decreasesubstantially in the near future.EPA does not believe that a ban is appropriate for this product categoryfor the following reasons: (1) Insufficient information was available regardingproduct substitutes to determine the costs of banning this product, althoughavailable information indicates that the costs of a ban would be high;(2) this product category accounts for only a minuscule portion of U.S.asbestos consumption (approximately 1 ton in 1985); and (3) a ban on thisproduct category would result in only minimal benefits because asbestosexposure is limited in most life cycle stages, relative to other productsanalyzed for this rule.v. <T3>High-grade electrical paper</T3>. These products are used as electricalpaper insulation, primarily for high-temperature, low-voltage applicationssuch as motors, generators, transformers, and other heavy electrical apparatuses.The benefits derived from a ban on this product would total approximately0.4 of a cancer-case-avoided. The cost of banning this product would behigh because reasonably priced suitable substitutes do not exist for allapplications and a number of existing substitutes are very expensive. Thetotal cost of banning this product is estimated to total over $51 million.EPA does not believe that a ban is appropriate for this product categoryfor the following reasons: (1) This product category accounts for onlya minuscule portion of U.S. asbestos consumption (approximately 744 tonsin 1985); (2) the costs of banning this product would be very high, dueto the absence of reasonably priced substitutes; and (3) a ban on thisproduct category would result in minimal benefits.vi. <T3>Missile Liners</T3>. These products are used to coat the interiorsof rocket chambers, primarily in highly-specialized military and aerospaceapplications. Benefits derived by banning this product would total approximatelyfour tenths of a cancer-case-avoided. EPA has no information indicatingthat suitable substitutes are available. The total cost of banning thisproduct is estimated at almost $2 billion. Because most uses are highlyspecialized military uses, it is doubtful that substitutes will be developedand be certified for these uses or that costs of a prospective ban willdecrease substantially in the near future.EPA does not believe that a ban is appropriate for this product categoryfor the following reasons: (1) This product category accounts for onlya minuscule portion of U.S. asbestos consumption (approximately 700 tonsin 1985); (2) the costs of banning this product would be very high, becausemost uses are highly specialized military uses; and (3) a ban on this productcategory would result in minimal benefits.vii. <T3>Packings</T3>. Packings are used to seal fluids in devices where motionis necessary. Benefits derived from banning this product category wouldtotal less than one tenth of a cancer-case-avoided. Exposures in the productlife cycle stages beyond primary and secondary manufacture are likely tobe limited, relative to other product categories, because asbestos in packingsis generally saturated with lubricant during packing formation and withfluid during use and removal. In addition, there are many specialized usesof asbestos packings, including advanced technology and military applications.The cost of banning this product would be relatively high on a per unitbasis because suitable substitutes do not exist and are unlikely to soonbe developed for a significant number of packings applications and a numberof existing substitutes are very expensive. The total cost of banning thisproduct is estimated at $0.55 million.EPA does not believe that a ban is appropriate for this product categoryfor the following reasons: (1) this product category accounts for onlya small portion of U.S. asbestos consumption (approximately 125 tons in1985); (2) the costs per unit of banning this product would be relativelyhigh for the amount of benefits derived, due to the absence of substitutesof similar cost or performance characteristics for a number of applications;and (3) a ban on this product category would result in minimal benefitsbecause asbestos exposure is limited in most life cycle stages, relativeto other products analyzed for this rule.viii. <T3>Reinforced plastic. </T3>These products are used primarily for electro-magneticparts in the automotive and appliance industries and high-performance specialtyplastics. Benefits derived by banning this product category would totalapproximately four tenths of a cancer-case-avoided. Exposures in productlife cycle stages beyond primary manufacture are likely to be limited,relative to other product categories, because asbestos is encased in plasticin the end use products. In addition, the cost of banning this productwould be high because suitable substitutes do not exist for a significantnumber of plastics applications and a number of existing substitutes arevery expensive. The total cost of banning this product is estimated atalmost $35 million.EPA does not believe that a ban is appropriate for this product categoryfor the following reasons: (1) This product category accounts for onlya minuscule portion of U.S. asbestos consumption (approximately 812 tonsin 1985); (2) the costs of banning this product would be high, due to theabsence for a number of applications of substitutes of similar cost orperformance characteristics; and (3) a ban on this product category wouldresult in minimal benefits because asbestos exposure is limited in mostlife cycle stages, relative to other products analyzed for this rule.ix. <T3>Sealant tape. </T3>These products are used primarily to seal windowsand automotive windshields, in aerospace applications, and in the manufactureof insulated glass. Benefits derived by banning this product would totalless than one tenth of a cancer-case-avoided. Exposures in the product'slife cycle stages beyond primary manufacture are likely to be limited,relative to other product categories, because asbestos is contained inrubber in the end use products. In addition, the cost of banning this productwould be high because suitable substitutes do not exist for a number ofnon-automotive applications. A number of existing substitutes are veryexpensive and others do not perform as well as asbestos-containing products.The total cost of banning this product is estimated at almost $35 million.EPA does not believe that a ban is appropriate for this product categoryfor the following reasons: (1) This product category accounts for onlya minuscule portion of U.S. asbestos consumption (approximately 700 tonsin 1985); (2) the total cost of banning this product would be significantbecause of the absence of suitable substitutes for some uses; and (3) aban on this product category would result in minimal benefits because asbestosexposure is limited in most life cycle stages, relative to other productsanalyzed for this rule. <T3>Specialty industrial gaskets. </T3>The production of most asbestos-containinggaskets is banned in Stage 2 (see Unit V.F.g). Excluded from the rule'sbans are gaskets that are manufactured, imported, processed, or distributedin commerce for specialty industrial uses. This exclusion is limited toasbestos-containing gaskets that are designed for industrial uses in either(a) environments where temperatures are 750 degrees Fahrenheit or greater,or (b) corrosive environments. An industrial gasket is one designed foruse in an article which is not a ``consumer product'' within the meaningof the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA), 15 U.S.C. 2052 or for use ina ``motor vehicle'' or ``motor vehicle equipment'' within the meaning ofthe National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, as amended,15 U.S.C. 1381. A corrosive environmental is one in which the gasket isexposed to concentrated (pH less than 2), highly oxidizing mineral acids(e.g., sulfuric, nitric, or chromic acid) at temperatures above ambient.For example, gaskets used in automobiles or consumer products would notbe excluded from the rule's bans, even if a particular application wasdesigned for use in a corrosive environment or an environment of greaterthan 750 degrees Fahrenheit. On the other hand, gaskets used in industrialmachinery would be excluded from the rule's bans if the gasket applicationwere designed for use in a corrosive environment or in one of greater than750 degrees Fahrenheit. Gaskets are used to seal one compartment of a device from another in staticapplications. This portion of the beater-add and sheet gasket product categoriesis not being banned because: (1) According to commenters and the RIA, industrialapplications above 750 degrees Fahrenheit and industrial uses in corrosiveenvironments contain many specialized uses of asbestos gaskets, includingadvanced technology and military applications, and available informationindicates that substitutes for these industrial applications are less likelyto be available than for lower temperature, non-corrosive, or consumer(e.g., automotive) applications, (2) due to the nature of their applications,the potential hazards created by failure of specialty industrial gasketsmight be greater than for other categories, (3) these applications accountfor only a small portion of the gasket product categories and a very smallportion of U.S. asbestos consumption, (4) industrial applications haverelatively lower overall exposure levels and smaller exposed populationsthan do uses with potential consumer exposures, (5) the benefits resultingfrom a ban of these applications (approximately 6.6 cancer cases) wouldbe small relative to the benefits derived from including the rest of thegasket categories in the ban. The cost of banning these portions of thegasket categories would be high because available evidence indicates thatsuitable substitutes do not exist and are unlikely to soon be developedfor a significant number of applications and a number of existing substitutesare very expensive. The total cost of banning these applications is estimatedat approximately $95 million. xi. <T3>Textile products.</T3> These products are primarily intermediate textileproducts used in end products covered by other categories banned by thisrule, including friction products and gaskets. Because exposures relatedto the production of these products are largely eliminated by other actionstaken in this rule, EPA has determined that separate action on this categoryto be unnecessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Other EPA Statutes</ITAG>Section 6(c) of TSCA requires that if EPA determines that a risk of injuryto health or the environment could be eliminated or reduced to a sufficientextent by actions taken under another statute administered by EPA, EPAmay not promulgate a rule under section 6(a) of TSCA unless EPA finds thatit is in the public interest to protect against the risk by action underTSCA. EPA finds that no other law administered by EPA will eliminate orreduce to a sufficient extent the risks posed by asbestos exposure andthat it is in the public interest to use TSCA.Several EPA statutes have been used to limit asbestos exposure. On April16, 1973, EPA used the authority of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to list asbestosas a hazardous air pollutant, establish a ``no visible emission'' standardfor manufacturers, and ban the use of spray-applied, asbestos-containingmaterial as insulation in buildings. EPA amended this regulation to banasbestos-containing pipe lagging, by a rule published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of October 12, 1975 (40 FR 48292); and in 1978,extended the ban to all uses of sprayed-on asbestos by a rule publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of June 19, 1978 (43 FR 26372). The CAA rule,which was last amended on April 5, 1984 (49 FR 13658), also regulates theremoval of asbestos from buildings and the disposal of wastes generatedby removal. EPA proposed amendments to the rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of January 10, 1989 (54 FR 912) to enhance andpromote compliance with the current standard.However, the CAA has limitations. The CAA does not apply directly to indoorair in the workplace or home. Consequently, some additional uses of thatstatute may leave many workplace or home exposures inadequately controlled.Another EPA statute that could be used to reduce asbestos exposure is theSafe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Under the 1986 SDWA Amendments, EPA isrequired to set a National Primary Drinking Water Regulation for asbestos.In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 22, 1989, EPA proposed an SDWA maximumcontaminant level goal and National Primary Drinking Water Regulation maximumcontaminant level for asbestos in drinking water of 7 million asbestosfibers exceeding 10 microns in length. This regulation shortly. However,this regulation would necessarily ignore the inhalation risk posed by asbestosfrom sources other than drinking water and would therefore affect onlya small portion of overall exposure.An additional EPA statute that could be used to limit asbestos exposureis the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Under RCRA, EPA couldlist asbestos as a hazardous waste and subject disposal of asbestos togeneral RCRA requirements designed to reduce exposure. However, such actionunder RCRA would only reduce exposure during the disposal of asbestos andasbestos products.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Analysis Under Section 9(a) of TSCA</ITAG>Under section 9(a)(1) of TSCA, EPA is required to submit a report to anotherFederal agency when two determinations are made. The first determinationis that EPA has a reasonable basis to conclude that a chemical substanceor mixture presents or will present an unreasonable risk of injury to healthor the environment. The second determination is that the unreasonable riskmay be prevented or reduced to a sufficient extent by action taken by anotherFederal agency under a Federal law not administered by EPA. Secitn 9(a)(1)provides that when the Administrator makes these two determinations, EPAmust provide an opportunity to the other Federal agency to assess the riskdescribed in the report, to interpret its own statutory authorities, andto initiate an action under the Federal laws that it administers. Section9(a) of TSCA thus requires EPA to review other Federal authorities notadministered by EPA to determine whether action under those authoritiesmay prevent or sufficiently reduce the unreasonable risk. The followingUnit summarizes past and contemplated actions by other agencies and thendiscusses why those agencies are not able to prevent or sufficiently reducethe unreasonable risk presented by asbestos.A. Other Authorities Affecting AsbestosUnder the authority of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA, 15 U.S.C.2051), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has issued rules banningconsumer patching compounds (16 CFR Part 1304) and artificial emberizingmaterials (16 CFR Part 1305) containing respirable asbestos. The CPSC tookthese actions based on findings that the use of those products in the householdwould result in an increased risk of cancer. Earlier, the Food and DrugAdministration under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA, 15 U.S.C.1261) banned ``general-use garments containing asbestos other than garmentshaving a bona fide application for personal protection against thermalinjury and so constructed that the asbestos fibers will not become airborneunder reasonably foreseeable conditions of use'' (16 CFR 1500.17). TheFHSA is now administered by the CPSC.In 1980, CPSC issued a general order requiring persons to submit informationon the use of asbestos in certain consumer product categories. CPSC hasalso measured potential consumer exposure to asbestos from such productsas asbestos millboard, asbestos paper products, and stove door gaskets.CPSC submitted those data to EPA as part of this rulemaking. On September24, 1986 (51 FR 33911), CPSC issued labeling requirements for ``householdproducts containing intentionally added asbestos that, under any reasonableforeseeable conditions of handling and use are likely to release asbestosfibers.'' In 1986, in light of the EPA propose rule to ban certain asbestosproducts immediately and phase out others over 10 years, CPSC decided notto ban any additional consumer products containing asbestos under statutesthat it administers.OSHA began to regulate asbestos in the workplace in 1971 under the OccupationalSafety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 51, OSHAct). Since the first workplacestandard setting a limit of 12 f/cc was promulgated in May 1971, the workplacestandard has been periodically lowered, to 5 f/cc in 1972 and to 2 f/ccin 1976. An Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) establishing a PEL of 0.5f/cc was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of November 4, 1983 (48 FR 51086), but the ETSwas found invalid by a court. OSHA proposed a revised standard in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of April 10, 1984 (49 FR 14116). OSHA issueda final rule on June 20, 1986 (51 FR 22612), lowering the PEL to 0.2 f/ccand establishing new work practice requirements for both general industryand the construction sector. Both asbestos industry groups and unions challengedvarious provisions of the new OSHA rule. On February 2, 1988, the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued itsdecision in the consolidated appeals. The court upheld OSHA's finding thatasbestos exposure poses a significant risk and the feasibility of the newPEL and specifically rejected the asbestos industry groups' challengesto OSHA's risk assessment. However, the court found that there was notsubstantial evidence supporting OSHA's: (1) Ban on the spraying of asbestos-containingproducts, (2) rejection of a lower PEL for certain major subgroups of industry,(3) rejection of a short-term exposure limit (STEL), and (4) rejectionof certain specific provisions recommended by participants in the rulemaking(e.g. smoking control provisions, bilingual labels, and more stringentrespiratory protection requirements). The court ordered OSHA to establisha STEL, to consider a lower PEL for certain industry sectors where it maybe feasible, and to consider several other specific changes suggested byrulemaking participants. In response to this court decision, OSHA amendedits Asbestos Standard to incorporate an Excursion Limit (EL). This amendment,which was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 14, 1988 (53 FR 35610), limits short-termexposures to 1 f/cc over a half-hour period. OSHA has not either finalizedor proposed any other changes in its Asbestos Standards.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), acting under the MineSafety and Health Act, has adopted workplace standards designed to protectworkers engaged in pit and underground mining and milling (30 CFR 71.202).The MSHA standard was last amended in 1976 and calls for a PEL of 2 f/cc.State and local public employees are generally excluded from coverage underthe OSHAct. However, under section 19 of the OSHAct, OSHA has approvedState plans for 23 States and 2 territories, thus effectively extendingOSHA protections to State and local public employees in these jurisdictions.EPA has promulgated a rule to establish requirements similar to those ofthe OSHA Asbestos Construction Standard for State and local public employeesnot covered under a State plan who conduct asbestos abatement work. However,other public employees, such as fire fighters, are not covered by thatrule.B. EPA's Determination Under Section 9(a) of TSCAEPA is not required under section 9(a) to submit a report to other agencieson the asbestos risks described in this document since EPA has determinedthat such risks cannot be prevented or reduced to a sufficient extent takenunder a Federal; law not administered by EPA. Certain activities involvingasbestos present risks that fall under the jurisdiction of a number ofdifferent Federal laws such as the OSHAct, the CPSA, and the CAA, but noone statute, other than TSCA, can adequately address all the risks posedthroughout the life cycle of asbestos. Referral would result in fragmentedassessment and control of risks and potentially duplicative regulatoryefforts. Furthermore, even if EPA were to refer asbestos exposure risksto other agencies, taken by those other agencies would still leave a substantialresidual risk, resulting in an adverse effect on public health. Only EPAunder TSCA can stop the build up of asbestos in the environment. EPA'sreasons for reaching these conclusion are set forth below.1. <T3>Interpretation of section 9(a) of TSCA. </T3>The comprehensive natureof TSCA has long been recognized. TSCA allows regulation of a chemicalsubstance based on all of its risks and, thereby, allows the Governmentto remedy the deficiencies in other statutes that can deal only with partsof the risk. (Statement of the President on signing S. 3149 Into Law, October12, 1976, Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents, vol. 12, No. 42,Oct. 18, 1976, at 1489; S. Rep. No. 94-698, 94th Cong. 2d Sess. at 2).The need for a total exposure, multi-media approach to chemical regulationand the dangers of a fragmented regulatory approach were recognized evenduring the early Congressional hearings on TSCA. See, for example, the1973 Senate Hearings at 212-214 and the 1972 House Hearings at 65-67. Noother single law provides authority to deal comprehensively with multi-mediahazards.In particular, Congress designed TSCA to deal with chemical substancesfor which the most appopriate remedy would be a total ban on their manufacture,importation, processing, and distribution in commerce. In this regard,Congress focused on the risk of asbestos and the dangers of fragmentedregulation of asbestos during the legislative hearings. See the 1971 SenateHearings and 1973 Hearings. Asbestos risks were described in the workplaceand in over 3,000 uses that could present risks to the general population(H.R. Rep. No. 94-1341, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., at 5 (1976). Members of Congressbelieved it intolerable that no agency could deal comprehensively withchemical risks, including the risk from asbestos. See 1973 Senate Hearingsat 319-320 (Letter from Senator Tunney to Dow Chemical Company); 1975 SenateHearings at 131-133 (Remarks of Senator Tunney).2. <T3>Capability of other Federal authorities to deal with the combinationof asbestos activities. </T3>EPA's analysis of the jurisdiction over therisks presented by asbestos among a number of agencies and statutory authoritiesis set out below. OSHA has authority under the OSHAct to control risk presentedto private sector manufacturing, construction, and service employees fromworkplace exposures, and may approve State plans covering State and localpublic employees. CPSC has authority under the CPSA and FHSA to controlrisk presented to consumers from consumer products. The Mine Safety andHealth Administration has authority under the Mine Safety and Health Actconcerning risk presented during the mining and milling of asbestos. Stateand local public employees in about half the States (such as fire fighterswho may wear asbestos clothing) are not covered by either OSHA regulationsor OSHA-approved State plans.EPA has concluded that asbestos is appropriate for TSCA action rather thanreferral to other agencies. It is a substance for which there is broadexposure to populations in numerous situations_in the workplace, throughlong- and short-term ambient concentrations, and from consumers products.With the exception of TSCA, there is no single authority to deal with allof these multiple exposures. No one of the other potential Federal regulatoryauthorities, in looking at its specific part of the overall exposures,can either evaluate or deal with the totality of the risk presented. OSHAmay set exposure limits for workers, but there may be venting of asbestosfrom the workplace into the atmosphere. EPA, under the CAA, may regulateambient emissions, but not workplace or consumer exposures. In each case,only a fraction of the risk is controlled. Only EPA under TSCA can lookacross the range of asbestos use to evaluate whether exposure presentsan unreasonable risk. There is no other Act that affords such authority.Further, only action under TSCA can stop the build up of asbestos in theenvironment.3. <T3>Residual risks. </T3>Even if other Federal agencies took additionalaction to reduce the risk associated with asbestos during the various stagesof the life cycle of asbestos products, a substantial and unreasonableresidual risk would still remain.Large populations outside of OSHA jurisdiction are at risk from exposureto asbestos. State and local public employees, such as fire fighters, arenot protected by OSHA regulations in about half of the States. The generalpopulation is exposed to asbestos into the ambient air as a result of releaseduring the manufacture, processing, use, repair, and disposal of asbestosproducts. As discussed more fully in Unit V.A.3 of this preamble, asbestosreleased into the ambient air can build up in the environment. EPA is concernedabout this environmental loading.Further, even if OSHA achieves strict compliance with its PEL of 0.2 f/ccand its new EL of 1 f/cc, a substantial and unreasonable residual riskwould remain. OSHA recognized that a substantial risk remained with a PELof 0.2 f/cc. OSHA estimated that persons exposed to this level over a workinglifetime of 45 years would face a risk of 7 in 1,000 of developing cancer.However, OSHA concluded that this was the lowest exposure level that wastechnologically feasible in asbestos workplaces. As stated above, OSHAhas been ordered to consider a lower PEL for certain general industry sectorswhere it may be feasible. However, technical limitations on asbestos exposuremonitoring seem to limit OSHA from establishing a PEL lower than 0.1 f/cc.Indeed, the union groups that asked the court to order OSHA to adopt alower PEL only requested a PEL of 0.1 f/cc. Workers exposed to a levelof 0.1 f/cc still face a substantial risk. OSHA calculates that such workersface a risk of 3 in 1,000 of developing cancer when exposed over a 45-yearworking lifetime.In addition, it is likely that the OSHA PEL of 0.2 f/cc and EL of 1 f/ccwill be exceeded in many cases since it is particularly difficult to applythe PEL in the construction and service sectors. Many of the workplaceexposures to asbestos occur downstream in the construction and servicesectors rather than the manufacturing sector. Over 80 percent of workersexposed to asbestos are in the construction and service sectors. Employeesin those sectors often do not know when they are exposed to asbestos becausethey do not know that they are working with asbestos products (Ref. 34).Attempts at compliance and OHSA's compliance inspections are also difficultin the construction and service sections since employees frequently donot have a fixed work site. Between July 1, 1986 and June 30, 1987, OSHAcited 534 alleged violations of the asbestos rule for general industryand 427 alleged violations of the rule for the construction sector. OSHAinspection data show that 91 of the 655 asbestos monitoring samples takenby OSHA from July 1, 1986 through April 30, 1988, had exposure values abovethe OSHA PEL of 0.2 f/cc. While respirators were in use in many of theestablishments with air concentrations higher than the PEL, 20 percentof these establishments were cited for violations of respiratory protectionguidelines or for violations of the PEL (Ref. 49). As stated earlier, OSHAamended its Asbestos Standards to incorporate an EL on September 14, 1988.EPA does not believe that the EL will have a significant effect on thesignificant risk posed by asbestos in the workplace. A more detailed discussionof this may be found in Unit V.A.3 of this preamble. Finally, many asbestoscontrol measures, in particular, the use of respirators or increased workplaceventilation, only shift the asbestos exposure to another population forwhich no exposure controls exist. For example, if ventilation is used,substantial quantities of asbestos would be released to the ambient environmentwhere it would continue to present a risk both to other workers and thegeneral population.Similarly, CPSC cannot evaluate or deal with the totality of the risk presentedby asbestos. CPSC may ban or require safety standards for asbestos-containingconsumer products based exclusively on risk to consumers. CPSC is unableto consider risk to other groups from releases of asbestos during the lifecycle of those products. In addition, CPSC has indicated that it does notplan to enact further bans on asbestos-containing products.After carefully analyzing other Federal authorities, EPA concludes thataction under TSCA is appropriate to reduce the unreasonable risk to humanhealth posed by asbestos. Use of other Federal authorities cannot reducerisk to a reasonable level because: (1) Even together, they cannot reducethe total volume of asbestos or asbestos products in commerce or limitthe ongoing buildup of asbestos in the environment, (2) Even together,they cannot protect all of the many population groups at risk, and (3)They all have jurisdictional gaps, both individually and collectively.  <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Enforcement   </ITAG>Section 15 makes it unlawful to fail or refuse to comply with any provisionsof a rule promulgated under section 6 of TSCA. Therefore, any failure tocomply with this rule would be a violation of section 15. In addition,section 15 of TSCA makes it unlawful for any person to: (1) Fail or refuseto establish and maintain records as required by this rule; (2) Fail orrefuse to permit access to or copying of records, as required by TSCA;(3) Fail or refuse to permit entry or inspection as required by section11 of TSCA.   Violators may be subject to both civil and criminal liability. Under thepenalty provision of section 16 of TSCA, any person who violates section15 could be subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for each violation.Each day of operation in violation of this rule could constitute a separateviolation. Knowing or willful violations of this rule could lead to theimposition of criminal penalties of up to $25,000 for each day of violationand imprisonment of up to 1 year. In addition, other remedies are availableto EPA under sections 7 and 17 of TSCA, such as seeking an injunction torestrain violations of this rule and seizing any chemical substance ormixture manufactured or imported in violation of this rule.   Individuals, as well as corporations, could be subject to enforcement actions.Sections 15 and 16 of TSCA apply to ``any person'' who violates variousprovisions of TSCA. EPA may, at its discretion, proceed against individualsas well as companies. In particular, EPA may proceed against individualswho report false information or cause it to be reported.   <ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Confidentiality   </ITAG>Section 14(a) of TSCA allows a person who submits information to EPA toassert a claim of confidentiality if release of the information would revealtrade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. Underthis rule, claims of confidentiality can be asserted only at the time informationis submitted in an exemption application and only in the manner specifiedin andSection; 763.179. EPA's procedures for processing and reviewing confidentialityclaims are set forth at 40 CFR Part 2, Subpart B.   Any person who claims information contained in an exemption applicationas confidential is required to provide two copies of its application: acomplete copy of the application including all information claimed as confidentialand a ``sanitized'' copy from which all confidential information has beendeleted. EPA will place the applicant's sanitized copy in the public file.EPA will also issue a notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>requesting comments on the exemption request.  Persons claiming information as confidential should do so by circling,bracketing, or underlining it and marking it ``CONFIDENTIAL.'' EPA willdisclose information subject to a claim of confidentiality only to theextent permitted by section 14 of TSCA and 40 CFR Part 2, Subpart B. Ifa person does not assert a claim of confidentiality for information atthe time it is submitted to EPA, EPA may make the information public withoutfurther notice to that person.   In addition, persons claiming information as confidential in exemptionapplications must respond in detail to the substantiation questions inandSection; 763.179(d) at the time the application is submitted to EPA. Ifa claim is unaccompanied by the required substantiation at the time itis submitted to EPA, the company will be notified that the unsanitizedcopy of the application will be placed in the public file.   EPA is committed to the public disclosure of as much nonconfidential informationsubmitted in exemption applications as possible. Requiring up-front substantiationof confidentiality claims and continued close scrutiny of such claims throughthe established claim review process will ensure that as much informationas possible is released. Public interest in the information in exemptionapplications and the need for public participation in the review of applicationsjustifies this approach. Up-front substantiation obviates the need forfollow-up substantiation by submitters resulting from EPA review or Freedomof Information Act requests and thereby facilitates public participationin the process of reviewing exemption applications.   <ITAG tagnum="84">X. Rulemaking Record   </ITAG>EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control numberOPTS-62036). A public version of the record, without any confidential businessinformation, is available in the TSCA Public Docket Office, from 8 a.m.to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The TSCA PublicDocket Office is located in Room NE-G004, 401 M Street, SW., Washington,DC.   This record contains information considered by EPA in developing this rule.The record includes: (1) All <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices, (2) relevant support documents, (3)reports, (4) memoranda and letters, and (5) hearing transcripts, responsesto comments, and other documents related to this rulemaking.   <ITAG tagnum="84">XI.

Regulatory Assessment Requirements </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 Under Executive Order 12291, EPA has determined that this rule is a ``MajorRule'' and has prepared an RIA. The RIA estimates that this rule will costapproximately $458.89 million, or $806.51 million if a 1 percent annualdecrease in the price of substitutes is not assumed. The RIA also estimatesthat the rule will, over the 13-year period analyzed, avoid at least 202cancer cases, if benefits are not discounted, and 148 cancer cases, ifbenefits are discounted at 3 percent. If analogous exposures are not assumed,the estimates of cancer-cases-avoided are 164 cases, if benefits are notdiscounted, and 120 cases, if benefits are discounted at 3 percent. Asis stated in Unit V.D. of this preamble, EPA believes that these costsare reasonable and that the rule is the least burdensome way of reducingthe unreasonable risk posed by exposure to asbestos from the manufacture,importation, processing, use, and disposal of asbestos-containing products. This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview, as required by Executive Order 12291.B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b),the Administrator may certify that a rule will not, if promulgated, havea significant impact on a substantial number of small entities and, therefore,does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. EPA has analyzed the economic impact of this final rule on small businesses.A summary of this analysis appears in the RIA and Unit V.D of this preamble.Based on the discussion in that Unit, EPA certifies that this rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.C. Paperwork Reduction Act The reporting and recordkeeping provisions of this final rule have beensubmitted to OMB for approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.3501<T3> et seq.</T3> These requirements are not effective until OMB approvesthem and a technical amendment to that effect is published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average less than 2 hours annually per firm over the 3-year period reviewedfor the analysis of regulatory burden. This burden estimate includes thetime for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information. This estimate of annual burden is a relatively low figurebecause of the small number of firms affected by the regulatory actionstaken during the period reviewed for the analysis of regulatory burden. Send any comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect ofthis collection of information, including suggestions for reducing thisburden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 401 M Street., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to theOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management andBudget, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 763 </ITAG>Asbestos, Environmental protection, Hazardous substances.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated July 6, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.
