Five majorissues have been identified for more detailed discussion: transport ofcarbon in oceans, the use of tracers in ocean carbon storage studies,the role of sea ice in air/ocean carbon transfer, river transport ofcarbon to the oceans, and ocean carbon chemistry. Some general conclusionsare as follows. The capacity of the ocean surface layer to take up additionalCO/sub 2/ is limited by the supply of carbonate ion available to reactwith it. Thus the rate of CO/sub 2/ uptake will be determined largelyby the nature and the rate of circulation to and from the deeper ocean.The densest water that penetrates to the greatest depths is formed atrestricted locations, mainly in the Antarctic and North Atlantic. Precipitationof CaCO/sub 3/ from brines in annual high-latitude sea ice can also resultin a direct CO/sub 2/ carbon transfer to the ocean depths. Photosynthesisin the photic zone reduces the amount of dissolved carbon and is largelycontrolled by nutrient concentration. Biologically induced changes insurface water composition probably have a major influence in reducingthe amount of atmospheric CO/sub 2/. In investigating the ocean behaviorof carbon, a limited number of radionuclides and chemical tracers havebeen found useful. As the CO/sub 2/ content of the atmosphere increases,it should become possible at some point to detect the resulting changesin seawater composition. Better understanding of increased atmosphericCO/sub 2/ effects would then follow. 57 refs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
