(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The weather in the Sunshine Statecould be the critical factor as America's manned space programlooks to new life Thursday with the launching of shuttle Discovery.   ``The potential is there'' for frequent delays because of toughnew weather constraints imposed after the Challenger disaster 2{years ago, says Launch Director Bob Sieck.   Never mind hurricanes. A stray cloud, a stiff wind or a showercould ground the shuttle as surely as a mechanical breakdown.   ``Based on historical statistics, there's a 60 percent chance wewill go'' on schedule, mission commander Frederick H. Hauck saidupon arrival at Cape Canaveral on Monday on arain-and-lightning-delayed flight from Houston.   ``The bird is ready and we're ready,'' said Hauck. But, headded, ``We're going to keep our fingers crossed on the weather.''   The Florida peninsula is subject to fast-changing,sometimes-unpredictable storms during the summer-autumn changeover,particularly around this seaside spaceport.   Thursday's forecast called for scattered and broken clouds,widely scattered showers, a temperature of 85 degrees andsoutheasterly winds of 10-15 knots.   The new restrictions that would ban liftoff include:   _ Moderate rain or other precipitation in either takeoff orlanding areas.   _ Lightning within 10 miles of the launch pad 30 minutes beforeliftoff.   _ A temperature below 37 or above 99 degrees Fahrenheit.   _ Surface winds 24 knots, or 17 knots from the South.   Launch managers say stray clouds that drift near the pad from asfar away as the Gulf Coast, 150 miles away on the other side of thepeninsula, would keep the shuttle grounded. There can be nolightning-producing clouds within 10 nautical miles of the launchsite.   Cold weather was found to be a key factor in the Challengerdisaster, preventing a seal on a right booster rocket joint fromdoing its job of stopping the escape of gases which ignited theorbiter's main fuel tank.   Responsibility for safe launch conditions is in the hands of theAir Weather Service detachment at nearby Cape Canaveral Air ForceStation. It is in constant touch with meteorologists at weatherfacilities all along Discovery's planned flight path.   The Air Force weather watchers rely on sounding rockets thatgather information in the atmosphere 250,000 feet up, weatherballoons carrying instrument packages, wind towers, lightningsensors as far west as the Walt Disney World area about 50 milesaway, radar antennas that scan the ocean and satellite data.   But man is critical to the system, particularly because of thevolatile conditions in the area, said Air Force Col. John T.Madura, staff meteorologist for the Eastern Space and MissileCenter.   Madura has final responsibility for giving a go-for-launchsignal, or aborting the liftoff, because of weather conditions.   ``No constraints go from red to green unless I say so,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
