The samples were annealedwithin the temperature range 0-700/sup 0/C at temperature intervals of100/sup 0/C. The line shape parameter, 5, was calculated from the Dopplerbroadened annihilation spectrum and plotted as a function of annealingtemperature. In both alloys, 5 shows an increase with temperature inthe initial stages before the onset of crystallization of the amorphousstate and then appears to saturate. The conclusion may be drawn thatthe amorphous alloys undergo some structural relocation below the crystallizationtemperature and that 5 increases due to the detrapping of positrons;beyond the crystallization temperature, the almost constant value of5 is a reflection of an apparently constant positron trapping rate.
