At the end of the three-month odyssey, launched by a militarysummons for her 12-year-old son, the family waded across the RioGrande and asked for asylum at a rural barbed-wire-encircledgovernment compound _ America's new Ellis Island.   Instead, they were rejected, then arrested.   After resigning his Nicaraguan government job over differenceswith the Sandinistas, Ramon Aguirre tried to open a business inManagua, but the government shut him down.   Unable to sleep, unable to feed his wife and daughter, Aguirreand his family headed north, only to be robbed three times in Mexicoand arrested at the U.S. border where they, too, asked for asylum aspolitical refugees.   Now the Aguirres share a pale green 12-by-12 foot room withanother Nicaraguan family at a converted government agriculturewarehouse, where aliens do their wash on stones and children line upfor juice from Red Cross workers usually dispatched to naturaldisasters.   ``I didn't think it was going to be like this. I can't go back _they'll kill me,'' Aguirre said through a translator. ``I don't knowwhat's going to happen to us.''   What is going to happen?   After months of a massive influx of Central Americans and weeksof wrangling over changing U.S. policy on how to handle them, thatquestion remains unanswered, though officials see a few certainties:the human flood will continue, possibly underground, and it willstrain local areas' ability to provide for the newcomers.   As many as 100,000 Central Americans may enter the United Statesthis year, officials say. Most wade across the Rio Grande, whereclothes, letters to God and even an unused airline ticket can befound on the grassy banks, left behind in haste or happiness.   They seek a new life in a new land, sometimes following a dustyroad to Casa Oscar Romero, a church-run shelter, sometimes nevermaking it past the river's edge before arrest by the Border Patrol.   After a policy change last week, they most often end up living indetention, either under Army-green tents surrounded by barbed wireat a military-style base, or at the converted warehouse, wherechildren play in the yard, fathers line up to use the single payphone, mothers try to fight off boredom and uncertainty.   Some spend the chilly nights huddled under blankets in a shabbyold shed with red plastic walls on two sides.   Refugees seeking political asylum _ more than half of themNicaraguans _ were at first turned loose while their applicationswere processed, free to join friends and relatives in Miami or LosAngeles, New York or Houston.   In December, the Immigration and Naturalization Servicerestricted the asylum-seekers to south Texas, but that produced asqualid squatters camp.   Now, aliens are given a single interview that can be as short as10 minutes and, after being denied asylum the same day, they arearrested and held on $1,000-$4,000 bonds pending appeal.   They pile up in detention centers here, the closest entry pointby land to impoverished and war-scarred countries to the south.Central Americans now outnumber Mexicans trying to illegally enterthe country here by as much as 9-to-1 some days, Border Patrolagents say.   At the end of last week, more than 1,000 were being held at twoINS detention barracks here in the southern tip of Texas.   The turmoil created by this eight-month-old influx is widespread,even contributing to the racial tension in Miami that exploded inriots during Super Bowl week.   Local officials here and in Miami complain they can't providehomes, jobs and schooling for this newest migration wave. Problemswith the shifting and sometimes contradictory policies, as well asfeeding and clothing the people detained here, continue to mount asfederal officials scramble to enforce an asylum law drafted in 1980to accommodate 500 applications, not 100,000.   Catholic bishops in Texas even likened the detention to``concentration camps,'' and immigration experts say the currentplans are similar to how the thousands from the Mariel Cubanflotilla were handled. The circus-like tents used for detention,they say, could end up being permanent, and many here on all sidesof the issue agree that long-term solutions have yet to be proposed.   At the heart of the matter, experts say, is a continuing paradoxover U.S. immigration policy, which has a tradition of welcomingthose less fortunate _ ``your tired, your poor, your huddledmasses,'' as the Statue of Liberty's inscription says _ and yet nowturns away those in need.   The Bush administration has tried to deter the barrage ofimmigrants by loudly rejecting their political asylum applications.INS officials say these immigrants flee poverty, not persecution.   But critics of the policy say economics and politics were in factmarried by the Reagan administration, which used economic sanctionsand arms for the Contras to exert political pressure on Nicaraguaand devastate that nation's economy.   ``When they thought about economic pressure, they neverenvisioned this,'' said Jose Hinojosa, a political scientist andimmigration expert at Pan American University in Edinburg, Texas.   Those denied asylum will be deported, even to Nicaragua, afterappeals have been exhausted, the INS said.   Refugees say their countrymen will keep coming, and those whowork with the refugees say these newcomers will go underground.   ``Some people may simply try to go around the system. It'shappened before, it will happen again,'' said Sister Norma Pimentel,co-director of Casa Oscar Romero, an internationally known shelterfor aliens. ``They won't stop coming. This is just going to make itmore difficult for them.''   The Central American stampede is not only the result of continuedeconomic deterioration there, but also a 1987 memo fromthen-Attorney General Edwin Meese.   Meese directed INS officials to issue work permits to Nicaraguanswhile their political asylum applications were pending. Wordtraveled back to Central America, and last summer, numbers ofimmigrants began a swift rise.   ``They created the boom,'' said Jonathan Moore, a ProyectoLibertad attorney working with asylum applicants. ``They've lurchedfrom one extreme to the other.''   Said INS spokesman Duke Austin: ``We think that a veryunfortunate sign was sent (by the Meese memo).''   Unless an alien falls into a preference group either by familyrelations or special skills, there is no way to legally immigrate tothe United States. Political asylum becomes the one legal way in.   Now, attorneys complain that in its rush to slam the asylum doorshut, the INS is prejudging all asylum claims as ``frivolous'' _ theterm INS Commissioner Alan Nelson used to describe most claims _ andrejecting endangered refugees.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
