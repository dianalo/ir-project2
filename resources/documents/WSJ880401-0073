<DOC><DOCNO> WSJ880401-0073 </DOCNO><HL> Business Brief: Fedders Corp. </HL><SO> </SO><CO> FJQ </CO><TEXT>   Fedders Corp. expects to report that first-quarter earnings, before tax-loss carry-forwards, rose to the &quot;range of 20 to 23 cents&quot; a share from 15 cents a share a year ago. In the year-earlier quarter, comparable profit from operations totaled about $2 million. Net income totaled $3.3 million, or 24 cents a share.    Sal Giordano Jr., chief executive officer of the Peapack, N.J.-based air conditioner maker, also told analysts that first-quarter sales will exceed $55 million, compared with $35 million a year ago.    He attributed the gains in part to new customers and to restoring distributors' inventories that were depleted during last summer's spell of hot weather. Mr. Giordano added that two major competitors have closed U.S. plants during the past six months, and said Fedders' 1988 sales will reflect a rise in export sales.    Fedders shares rose 12.5 cents yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, to $9.125. </TEXT></DOC>
