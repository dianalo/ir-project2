But both U.S. and Austrian officials question whether enforcement of the measures passed by Parliament last month will actually shut off the illegal flow of sensitive goods across Austria's borders to its communist neighbors.    &quot;I can't say we'll completely stop illegal transfer. But we are making it as difficult as we can,&quot; says Gustave Fischer, technology-control chief in Austria's Economics Ministry.    Technology transfer has been a sore spot in Austrian-U.S. relations since the Reagan administration began a world-wide campaign in 1981 to deprive the Soviets of high-technology products that could have strategic military and industrial uses. Although Austrian officials describe the problem as minor, their U.S. counterparts disagree. &quot;Austria is considered an important point of diversion into Eastern bloc nations. There have been several flagrant cases,&quot; a U.S. source says.    Consequently, the U.S. and its allies have excluded neutral Austria from the list of countries to which certain materials or products can be exported without complex licensing procedures.    Austrian companies complain the restrictions and licensing delays put them at an unfair disadvantage just as Austria's appetite for U.S. technology is increasing. &quot;We badly need American high-tech,&quot; says Harald Hartung of the Association of Austrian Industrialists. &quot;The percentage of purely Austrian technology is minimal.&quot;    Until 1985, companies based in Austria could import and re-export anything they could get their hands on. &quot;We knew about the export of sensitive goods, but we had no legal means to interfere,&quot; says Harald Vavrik, technology-transfer chief in the Foreign Affairs Ministry.    The trade law was tightened in 1985, but it still contained numerous loopholes, and alleged violations continued in areas such as microchips, optical precision glass and sophisticated metals.    &quot;We were often considered the guilty ones,&quot; the Economics Ministry's Mr. Fischer says. &quot;It didn't matter from where or how goods came in and left. Austria was the last link in the chain.&quot;    Under the new legislation, which will take effect Jan. 1, Austria hopes for the same unlimited access to Western high technology as enjoyed by Switzerland and Sweden, two other neutral nations that beefed up their regulations in 1986.    The laws will require all Austrian-based companies to obtain an Austrian export license for goods monitored by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom. Austrian customs officials will have the right to check all cargo suspected of violating the regulations, even in duty-free or transit areas.    Jan Stankovsky, East-bloc expert at the Vienna Institute for Economic Research, acknowledges his country &quot;will have to make up for past failures.&quot; Officials of both the U.S. and Austria have expressed reservations about Austria's willingness to risk displeasing the Soviets. The two countries still have no bilateral agreement on judicial assistance.    Moreover, checking every shipment in Austria's heavy truck traffic would be physically impossible without creating a traffic jam &quot;halfway into Germany,&quot; as one official says. And recent Cocom violations in Norway and Japan are evidence that rules alone are no panacea.    Nevertheless, Mr. Stankovsky is confident the new laws soon will lead to a lifting of the Cocom restrictions on Austria. &quot;The Austrians are going far to meet U.S. demands,&quot; he declares. </TEXT></DOC>
