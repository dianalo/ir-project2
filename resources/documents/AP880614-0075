Ariane-4, which is to blast off Wednesday from the EuropeanSpace Agency's space center in Kourou, French Guiana, was declaredready for service on Saturday. Fueling of the rocket began Sunday.   The new generation rocket is designed to serve as Europe's``workhorse on the world launch services market until the end ofthis century,'' according to officials at Arianespace, thecommercial arm of the 13-nation European Space Agency consortium.   The rocket will on its inaugural launch carry an internationalpayload of three satellites into orbit, demonstrating the vehicle'sspace readiness to potential customers.   Capable of carrying heavier payloads than previous Arianes, therocket is the most sophisticated the Europeans have ever produced.Its design allows engineers to strap on different configurations ofsolid and liquid boosters, tailoring the vehicle to a client'sspecific budget and needs, the agency said.   Developed over the past six years at a cost of $575 million,Ariane-4 can carry a maximum load of 4.6 tons into orbit. Ariane-3,the previous generation, had a maximum capacity of 2.8 tons.   Arianespace already hauls half the world's commercial payloads.As of May 25, the company held 67 launch contracts worth $3.4billion.   The United States and Japan have barely entered the race. But inthe coming years, Arianespace faces competition from the AmericanTitan-4 made by Martin Marietta Corp., Atlas-Centaur built byGeneral Dynamics and Delta made by McDonnell Douglas _ as well asfrom the Soviet Proton, the Chinese Long March and the JapaneseH-2, now under development.   The United States had been depending on its space shuttles asthe chief launchers of commercial satellites until Jan. 28, 1986,when the shuttle Challenger exploded just after liftoff, killingall seven crew members.   There has not been a shuttle launch since. The next one isexpected late this summer.   Even when the shuttles resume regular flights, their focus willbe on military and scientific missions, rather than commercialoperations.   However, the Delta-2 will begin commercial flights this fallwith the Titan-3 scheduled to begin early next year. TheAtlas-Centaur is scheduled to take off with paying customers in themiddle of 1989.   Previously, U.S. rockets lifted mostly military and scientificloads under supervision of the U.S. Air Force or the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration.   Arianespace officials consider the Titan rocket their toughestcompetitor in the world market of about 25 launches a year. TheTitan is the only U.S. rocket able to haul satellites weighing morethan 2.7 tons.   The main U.S. challenger may turn out to be the new Delta-2,which will be bigger and more powerful than the current model.   Arianespace plans to build and launch 70 of their new rocketsbetween now and 1995, when the Ariane-5 will be ready to fly.   One of the three satellites due to be sent into space onWednesday, the Meteostat-P2, will be placed in orbit to furnishweather data to 16 European countries.   The 1,529-pound satellite will monitor weather over most ofEurope, Africa, the Middle East and the eastern half of SouthAmerica. It replaces Meteostat-F2, launched in 1981, which untilrecently sent back pictures of earth every half hour.   The 330-pound Amsat-3C, known by the nickname Oscar-13, willserve the needs of amateur radio operators around the world.   PAS-1, a satellite owned by the American telecommunicationscompany Pan American Satellite, will further telecommunicationsservice at a moderate cost between Latin America, the United Statesand Europe.   It also will provide some Latin American countries with theability to create national television networks.</TEXT></DOC>
