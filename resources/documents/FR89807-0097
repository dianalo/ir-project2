Notice of the proposal was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 26, 1989.\2\<NOTE/> No comments were received.\3\<NOTE/> This order approves the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. Sect. 78s(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26742 (April 18, 1989),54 FR 18062.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ In addition, NSCC's Important Notice No. A3039, datedAugust 19, 1988, described the proposal, and NSCC received no comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Description of the Proposal</ITAG>The proposed rule change consists of modifications to Section I (captioned``Trade Input and Comparsion'') of NSCC's Procedures.\4\<NOTE/> The main purpose of the proposal is to redesign NSCC's ListedEquity Comparison System in order to accelerate the trade comparison process.This proposal is being made in conjunction with companion rule proposalsby the American (``Amex'') and New York Stock Exchanges (``NYSE'') thatmandate: (1) Automated trade correction systems, and (2) the comparisonor close out of transactions on the day after the trade date (<T3>i.e.</T3>, ``T+1'').\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Trade comparison, or the matching of the buy and sellsides of a securities transaction, is the process after a trade has beenexecuted by which broker-dealers or their agents confirm with each otherthe trade's terms (<T3>e.g.</T3>, security, number of units, and price) and the existenceof a contract. This process results in a compared trade. Comparison isthe first of the three basic steps in processing a securities transaction(the other two being clearance and settlement). <T3>See </T3>Division of Market Regulation, The October 1987 Market Break,10-2 to 10-4, (``Division Report''); NSCC Procedures, Sect. II.A.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The NYSE and Amex proposals call for phasing in theseT+1 comparison programs over a period of about 14 more months (togetherwith certain companion programs, some of which are now being implemented)and the gradual elimination of the comparable existing manual programs.NYSE and Amex expect to have the main elements of their T+1 programs phasedin and operating by December 31, 1989 and to have the T+1 programs completelyphased in by September 1990. <T3>See </T3>NYSE Rule 130, Order Approving Proposed Rule Change, SecuritiesExchange Act Release No. 26627 (March 14, 1989), 54 FR 11470 [File No.SR-NYSE-88-36]; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change, Release No. 26773(May 1, 1989), 54 FR 20227 [File No. SR-NYSE-89-03]; Proposed Amex Rule719, Notice of Proposed Rule Change, Release No. 26741 (April 18, 1989),54 FR 18058 [File No. SR-Amex-89-05].In general, NSCC's proposal would shorten the comparison cycle for allAmex and NYSE regular-way,\6\<NOTE/> systematized and non-systematized equity trades.\7\<NOTE/> It would implement an initial match routine on the nightof trade date and move up the trade resolution process by one day. NSCCstates in its filing that the proposal would apply only to NYSE and Amextransactions in equity securities (<T3>i.e.</T3>, stocks, rights, and warrants).\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ A ``regular-way'' transaction means settlement on T+5,the ordinary time-frame for settlement of transactions in stocks, rights,and warrants, and certain other securities. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>NYSE Rule 64(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ A ``systematized'' or ``locked-in'' trade refers to atrade in an automated system. Under the locked-in comparison method, theentity (<T3>e.g., </T3>the exchange) that operates the system or its specialistsbecome the contra-side to each half of the trade. A ``non-systematized''trade refers to traditional two-sided comparison where trade input datacome from the buying and selling brokers to the clearing agency. <T3>See </T3>Division Report, 10-3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The Commission notes that NSCC's use of the term ``equitysecurities'' to mean stocks, rights, and warrants is for the purposes ofthis rule proposal only and does not constitute a comprehensive definitionof the term. <T3>See </T3>section 3(a)(11) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28">The proposal, with technical variations, also would apply to regularway trades in equity securities listed on NYSE and Amex that occur over-the-counter(``OTC'') or on the other exchanges. </ITAG><T3>See </T3>proposed NSCC Procedures, Sect. II.C.<ITAG tagnum="28">The Commission notes that by a previous rule filing, NSCC receivedauthorization for similar accelerated comparison procedures that are applicableto non-systematized equity transactions executed in the OTC market andon securities exchanges other than NYSE and Amex. </ITAG><T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26783 (May 4, 1989), 54FR 20221.Specifically, the proposal provides that NSCC clearing members must submitall transactions to NSCC no later than 2:00 a.m. on the day after the tradedate (<T3>i.e.</T3>, on ``T+1''), which is a proposed acceleration of 11 hours(from 1:00 p.m. on T+1).\9\<NOTE/> Clearing members could delete, through NSCC, uncompared tradesonly until 2:00 a.m., a proposed acceleration of 13 hours (from 3:00 p.m.on T+1). As information is received, NSCC will perform a series of matches,the results of which will be reflected on regular-way contract lists by4:00 a.m. on T+1 for automated output and by 7:00 a.m. for printed output.\10\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ All times in the proposal refer to New York time.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ NSCC's ``clearing member reports'' (also known as ``contractsheets'' and ``contract lists'') list compared trades, uncompared trades,and advisory trades. Uncompared trades are trades by a clearing memberthat have not been matched. Advisory trades are trades submitted by thecontra-side, against the member, that have not been matched. <T3>See </T3>NSCC Procedures, Sect. II.B; Division Report, 10-3.NSCC will route the results of the comparison process to the exchangeswhere resolution of uncompared trades will occur. NYSE and Amex will transmitthe results of their adjustment processing to NSCC by 5:00 p.m. on T+1.\11\<NOTE/> These results will be reflected by NSCC on adjustment contractsthat will be available to NSCC members by 8:00 p.m. on T+1.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ As part of this and related rule changes, the exchangeshave developed their own automated trade correction systems that will eliminatethe need for adjustment processing as currently performed by NSCC. <T3>See, supra</T3>, note 5 and accompanying text.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Rationale</ITAG>NSCC states in its filing that the proposal, by shortening the comparisoncycle, would: (1) Increase the efficiency of the post trade comparisonprocess, and (2) shorten the length of time that investors and NSCC clearingmembers are exposed to the risk of market fluctuations on uncompared trades.The NSCC states that, consequently, as required in section 17A(b)(3)(F)of the Act, the proposal would protect investors and the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion</ITAG>The Commission believes that this proposal is consistent with the Act.The proposal, by shortening the comparison cycle for NYSE and Amex equitytrades, would reduce the risk exposure to investors and to NSCC clearingmembers as well as contribute to the prompt and efficient clearance andsettlement of securities transactions. NSCC's proposal, together with itscompanion filing,\1\\2\<NOTE/> marks the first major overhaul to its comparison system sincethe 1970s.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ <T3>See, supra</T3>, note 8.The Commission notes, as a general matter, that the goal of prompt andefficient clearance and settlement of securities transactions (includingthe comparison of securities transactions) and the use of automated systemsin pursuit of this goal are expressly contemplated in section 17A(a)(1)of the Act. Congress stated in that provision that inefficient proceduresfor the clearance and settlement of securities transactions impose unnecessaryrisks and costs on investors and that prompt and accurate clearance andsettlement are necessary for investor protection.Congress further stated in sections 6(b)(5) and 17A(b)(3)(F) that the rulesof exchanges and clearing agencies, respectively, should be designed topromote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securitiestransactions. Moreover, in section 17A(a)(2) of the Act, Congress directedthe Commission to use its authority to facilitate a national system forthe prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.The risks posed by uncompared trades came under intense scrutiny followingthe Market Break of October 1987.\1\\3\<NOTE/> During the Market Break, uncompared trades on all securitiesmarkets (including the primary exchanges) increased substantially and,for several reasons, became a major stress point in the clearance and settlementprocess. First, uncompared trades required special labor-intensive treatment(``exception processing'') under working conditions already rendered chaoticby record trading volume.\1\\4\<NOTE/> Second, the rate of uncompared trades did not remain at itsusual percentage of trading volume, but as trading volume increased to2\1/2\ times normal levels during the week of October 19-23, uncomparedtrades doubled as a percentage of total trades.\1\\5\<NOTE/> And, third, the record market volatility (primarily downward)threatened to impose financial penalties on those firms that could notresolve trade comparison errors quickly, or at any rate before settlementwith their customers on T+5.\1\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Division Report, 10-5 to 10-13; Report of the PresidentialTask Force on Market Mechanisms 51-52, Study VI at 48-49 (January 8, 1988)(``Brady Report''); Interim Report of the Working Group on Financial Markets,Appendix D at 6 (May 1988) (``Working Group Report'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ <T3>See</T3> Division Report, 10-5. During the Market Break, the exchangesand NSCC took unusual steps to resolve uncompared trades. During the weekof October 19, 1987, NYSE required its member organizations and specialiststo meet in the morning before trading opened, in the evening after tradingclosed, and on weekends to resolve uncompared trades. NYSE and Amex closedtrading two hours early on Friday, October 23 through Friday, October 30to allow firms to catch up with the their back office work. NSCC extendedits 6:00 p.m. deadline to as late as 1:00 a.m. for its clearing membersto report the resolution of uncompared trades, and NSCC was open on Saturday,October 23 to receive reports of compared trades for processing on thefollowing Monday. <T3>See id.</T3> 10-9. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ For NYSE executions during the week of October 19,1987, T+2 uncompared trades processed by two-sided comparison increasedfrom an average rate of 4.6% to 9.7%. <T3>See</T3> Division Report, 10-7.<ITAG tagnum="28">For NYSE executions on October 19 and 20 (the peak volume days with604 million shares and 608 million shares, respectively), T+2 uncomparedtrades for two-sided input increased from an average of 4.6% to 12.6% and10.2%, respectively. In artithmetic terms, however, uncompared trades onT+2 increased from a daily average of 8,000 to 56,626 and 49,413 for executionson October 19 and October 20, respectively. </ITAG><T3>See id.,</T3> Table 10-1 at 10-59. <T3>See also</T3> Barady Report, Study IV at 48.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ <T3>See</T3> Division Report, 10-5 to 10-6. In terms of price volatility,on Monday, October 19, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (``DJIA'')closing value had declined a record 508.32 points (22.6%, also a record)from its previous close, <T3>i.e., </T3>from 2246.74 to 1738.41. After two more daily reversalsof over 100 points, the DJIA closed out the week on Friday, October 23,1987, at 1950.76 a net 5-day decline (from Friday, October 16)) of 259.98points (13.2%). <T3>See id.</T3>, Appendix D at Tables 2 and 3.Based on the experience of October 1987, with its unprecedented tradingvolume and price volatility, the Commission concluded that, among otherthings, effecient markets will require same-day, floor-derived trade comparison.\1\\7\<NOTE/> Thus, NSCC'S proposal (which will shrink the comparisioncycle from T+2 to T+1), while it does not meet the Commission's final objectiveof same-day comparison, is consistent with the Commission's desire to shortenthe comparision cycle. NSCC's proposal also furthers the recommendationsof the Working Group Report, which concluded that the development of on-linetrade matching systems would enhance the capacity of market participantsto monitor their exposure.\1\\8\<NOTE/> The proposal, moreover, is consistent with the intermarketclearing and credit mechanisms espoused by the Brady Report to reduce marketexposure to clearing corporations.\1\\9\<NOTE/> The Commission favors the efforts of this proposal to reducethe length of the comparison cycle. The Commission also expects that NSCCwill consider its proposed comparision system not to be a final goal butonly a near-term phase in its efforts toward the development and implementationof a same-day comparison system. In this regard, the Commission notes thatclearing members rely on NSCC's two sided comparison system to processthe majority of their listed trades in corporate equity securities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ <T3>See</T3> Securities and Exchange Commission Recommendations regardingthe October 1987 Market Break, contained in Testimony delivered by DavidS. Ruder, Chairman, SEC, before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housingand Urban Affairs, 23-24 (February 3, 1988). <T3>See also</T3> Division Report, 10-12; Working Group Report, AppendixD at 6.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ The Working Group Report called for same-day, floor-derivedcomparison of securities transactions. <T3>See</T3> Working Group Report, Appendix D at 6.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ <T3>See</T3> Brady Report at 64-65.To summarize, the proposed rule change, by shortening the NSCC's comparisoncycle, would make NSCC's comparison procedures: (1) safer with regard tothe risks of market price volatility, and (2) more efficient in terms ofthe time and expense involved in trade processing. Further, the proposalwould help protect investors and other persons that safeguard investors'funds and facilitate their transactions. Moreover, the Commission believesthat the proposal is consistent with the Act, particularly sections 6(b)(5)and 17A of the Act, and that it warrants approval.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons discussed in this order, the Commission finds that theproposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulationsthereunder.<T3>It is therefore ordered, </T3>pursuant to section 19(b) of the Act,that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR-NSCC-89-04)be, and hereby is, approved.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
