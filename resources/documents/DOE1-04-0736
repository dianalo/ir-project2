<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-04-0736 </DOCNO><TEXT>An investigation was made of catalytic polarographic currents of hydrogenin acid dilute solutions of W(VI) with excess of mandelic acid. The natureof the current was studied, and a scheme for the catalytic process isproposed. The reduction of hydrogen ions is catalyzed by the complex[W(OH)HM]{sup 2+} adsorbed on the dropping mercury electrode.</TEXT></DOC>
