White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said leaders of thefailed coup did not seek assistance from the United States and thatnone was offered.   ``We have traditionally stopped short of this kind of militaryinvolvement and it was a decision to do that again in this case,''he said Wednesday.   However, amid sharp criticism from Congress about Bush's refusalto act, one administration official said the United States wouldhave been happy to intervene if the coup leaders had requested it.   ``The (U.S. military) people down there were under instructionsto look for an opportunity to be of help and it never showed up,''said the official, insisting on anonymity. ``Not only that, it wasrejected.   ``As I understand it, if they were asked for assistance tosupport a pro-democracy movement, they would have done it,'' theofficial said. ``You can't just march in on your own. That's whathas gotten America a bad name for 100 years in Latin America.''   The official noted that U.S. forces took up positions on a keyhighway and a bridge, posing an obstacle for reinforcements forNoriega's loyalists. ``It wasn't that we were just sitting on our(rump),'' the official said.   While Bush has repeatedly urged the Panama Defense Forces (PDF)to depose Noriega, Fitzwater said, ``We have never said orexpressed any opinion in terms of direct involvement with a coup oranything like that.''   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney raised doubts about theauthenticity of the uprising, particularly in light of the factthat the coup's leader, Maj. Moises Giraldi Vega, was a closeconfidant of Noriega and had helped quash a 1988 rebellion.   ``This might well have been a setup,'' Cheney told reportersjust before briefing lawmakers on Capitol Hill.   He did not elaborate on that point although anotheradministration official said ``we didn't know what his (Giraldi's)motivation was.'' The official, who declined to be identified, saidGiraldi's past allegiance ``caused people to say, `Can we be surethis guy's legit?'''   As the coup unfolded Tuesday, Cheney met at the White House withBush and other national security officials. A Pentagon officialsaid various military options were discussed with the president.   Another official said, ``When it appeared Noriega might havebeen dethroned ... there were several options considered, none ofwhich was going in and getting him.''   Fitzwater said that ``just about everything'' about the coupargued against U.S. military involvement, especially lack ofreliable information.   He said the United States had been tipped off about the coupattempt during the weekend by ``a third party.'' Cheney said thatin view of Giraldi's association with Noriega, it was ``not at allclear this was even a valid report.''   U.S. officials said they were astonished to learn that therebels had Noriega in custody for several hours Tuesday but thenreleased him. One official said American officials told the coupleaders that the United States would be happy to take custody ofNoriega and have him stand trial on drug trafficking charges.   However, the coup leaders said they wanted, instead, to makeNoriega retire.   Cheney said, ``Clearly they were not of the mind to turn himover to us,'' adding that the rebels' intent had not been to expelor extradite Noriega, he said.   ``It was not a pro-democracy group that had taken over the PDF.It was more of a power struggle within the PDF itself,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
