The internal document found significant non-compliance withground water monitoring requirements, but a report released publiclyby the EPA last month painted a ``rosy picture,'' according to theEnvironmental Defense Fund.   An EPA official said the group's complaint was overstated and outof date.   The fund released two documents, one the internal report of theagency's ground water monitoring task force submitted in 1987 andthe other, published in October of this year, entitled ``HazardousWaste Ground Water Task Force: 1987 Status Report and 1988-1989Program Recommendations.''   The task force was formed in 1984 and disbanded in 1987.Originally assigned to investigate ground water montoring at 58sites, it completed field work at 24 before turning over the task toother EPA offices.   Kathie Stein, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund,said the 1988 document ``waters down the findings and conclusions ofthe task force and paints an overly rosy picture in an effort tomake the American people believe that the EPA has the situationunder control.''   After 1984 amendments tightened federal hazardous waste laws,only about 250 facilities decided to remain in operation.   The 1987 document said that in the experience of the task force,``the majority of monitoring well systems ... are not capable ofimmediately detecting or assessing a release from a disposal unit.''That phrase did not appear at the corresponding point in the 1988document.   The later document, instead, contained this phrase: ``All 24facilities had some defects in either the construction or locationof their monitoring wells.''   J. Winston Porter, EPA's assistant administrator for solid wasteand emergency response, said ``a lot of things that were pointed out(in the internal report) were true, and what came out of this was amajor uprgade'' of monitoring at hazardous waste facilities.   But to claim that the internal report was watered down for publicconsumption, he said, ``Is a lot of nonsense. People get hold ofinterim draft reports and if they find one iota of difference, theycharge whitewash. ... This wasn't a draft, this was partial input.We didn't use all of it.''</TEXT></DOC>
