Amajority finally elected the rascally Mr. Edwards, but manybemoaned the fact there was no other alternative to Mr. Duke.But there could have been if people had been able to vote for&quot;None of the Above,&quot; and thereby force a new election withnew candidates. It's time Americans were given the chance to&quot;just say no&quot; at the ballot box.   Last month, a Mason-Dixon poll found 66% of Louisiana'svoters favored adding NOTA to the ballot. It probably wouldhave won, since 58% of the voters said they wouldn't vote forMr. Duke &quot;under any circumstances,&quot; and 40% felt the same wayabout Mr. Edwards. No doubt voters in many other states andin many other races have often wished for a veto power overall candidates.</LP><TEXT>   How would NOTA work? Let's say the campaign convincesvoters that neither major-party candidate merits theirsupport, and there is no viable alternative. If a pluralityor majority of voters plump for NOTA, the election would haveto be rerun with the previous candidates barred fromparticipation. The parties would have an incentive tonominate new candidates who would be more appealing to theelectorate.   Voters in Eastern Europe have already enjoyed the benefitsof a form of NOTA. In Poland's semi-free election in 1989,the ruling Communists made the mistake of allowing voters tocross off the names of candidates they rejected -- even ifthey were unopposed. Many voters gleefully did just that, anddefeated dozens of Communists, including the incumbent primeminister. Boris Yeltsin says that Russian democracy wasimmeasurably helped by the fact that voters could use amodified form of NOTA in the partially rigged 1989 elections.Some 100 unopposed Communist apparatchiks were eventuallydefeated.   In the U.S., Nevada has given voters a NOTA option since1976. That year, NOTA &quot;won&quot; a GOP congressional primary. In1980, NOTA finished second in the state's Democraticpresidential primary, beating out Ted Kennedy. Last year, itplaced second in both primaries for Governor. But Nevada'slaw is flawed in that a NOTA win can't force a new election,so it only allows voters to vent their frustrations. Itsbackers believe NOTA would have greater impact if giventeeth, and if the ballot language were changed to the morepositive &quot;Favors a New Election.&quot;   Like term limits, NOTA strikes many on both the right andleft as a way to reinvigorate the stagnant waters of Americanpolitics. Ralph Nader has lent his name to a write-incampaign in next year's New Hampshire primary so voters canshow their disgust with Washington. &quot;I want a vote for me tobe counted as `None of the Above,'&quot; he told us.   The conservative Manchester Union Leader supports addingan actual NOTA line to the ballot. &quot;It's the only time we'veagreed with Ralph Nader and the Boston Globe,&quot; jokes NackeyLoeb, the paper's publisher. State legislators have submittedNOTA bills in Iowa, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Vermont. TheLouisiana Legislature rejected one just five months beforeDavid Duke won a spot in the runoff for Governor.   NOTA would be far more effective than campaign-financereform in reducing the overwhelming advantages of incumbency.In many races second-rate incumbents win by beatingthird-rate challengers. With NOTA, a sitting officeholdercould lose to the proverbial &quot;empty chair&quot; even in ahopelessly gerrymandered, one-party district. And if NOTAjust came close to winning, even the most entrenchedincumbents would get the message that it's time to pay closerattention to the folks back home.   Finally, we suspect that adding NOTA to the ballot wouldimprove the nation's abysmal voter turnout. NOTA might evendiscourage highly negative campaigning, since candidateswould be running for the approval of voters, and not just tooffend fewer people than their opponents. When confrontedwith the option of &quot;bad vs. worse,&quot; NOTA would allow peopleto say, &quot;Give me a better choice.&quot; Isn't that one of thethings that American democracy should be all about?</TEXT></DOC>
