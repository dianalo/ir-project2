In an extension of the work where the properties of 31multiplets were analyzed in the framework of first order asymptotic theory,a new analysis has been performed using the properties of the 53 classifiedmultiplets. The result of this analysis again shows the inadequacy offirst order asymptotic theory for describing the eigenfrequency spectrumand clearly demonstrates the necessity of using second order asymptotictheory. 30 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
