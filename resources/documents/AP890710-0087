A source at the banned Sudanese Journalists' Union identified thefreed men as Sidahmed al-Khalifa, editor and publisher of Al-Watantri-weekly, and Mohammed Medani Tewfik, editor and publisher of theweekly Al-Rai.   The publications are among about 50 privately owned newspapersand magazines shut down by the soldiers who overthrew Prime MinisterSadek el-Mahdi in a bloodless coup on June 30.   Al-Khalifa was arrested for publishing an interview with formerPresident Gaafar Nimeiri, the military dictator overthrown in a 1985coup who was a foe of el-Mahdi's government.   Tewfik was detained for publishing news of military operations,violating a ban on news reports of the fighting against rebels inthe south.   Also today, Sudan's new leader, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmedel-Bashir, was quoted as saying southern Sudanese in his 15-memberSalvation Revolution Council can help negotiate an end to the war.   The Kuwait daily Al-Anbaa also quoted el-Bashir as reiterating inan interview in Khartoum that he does not believe Sudan is ready formultiparty democracy, and that the ruling council will consider waysof ``involving the public in governing the country to the exclusionof any parties or sectarianism.''   El-Bashir was quoted as saying the armed forces ``understand theviewpoint of the people's movement (the rebels),'' but that peacetalks can be held only without conditions.   ``We have just to sit at the negotiating table,'' he toldAl-Anbaa.   Rebel officials have contacted junta members in Khartoum in thepast two days to inquire about proposed peace initiatives, he said.   They include a one-month armistice and an amnesty for all whofought the government for political reasons since 1983, when therebellion began.
