U.S. Memories said the finalists, chosen from 57 locations in 15states, were picked on the basis of financial, business, andquality-of-life considerations.   ``What set the finalists apart was that they showed a verybalanced approach to satisyfing our needs,'' said Sanford Kane,president and chief executive officer of U.S. Memories. ``Thesefour locations came closest to meeting most of our siterequirements and excelled in several areas.''   The consortium of seven companies said its mission is to produce4-megabit DRAMs _ Dynamic Random Access Memory _ computer chips, toraise the U.S. market share. DRAMs, it said, are an increasinglycritical technology for which the United States is dependent onJapanese sources.   DRAMs are used in microwave ovens, cars, VCRs, computers andsupercomputers, and most defense projects.   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he expects a tough fight amongthe finalist for the manufacturing complex, which would employ3,000 people when it begins operation in 1993, with anticipatedsales of $1 billion by 1994.   U.S. Memories said its current plans are to chose and announce afinal site by the end of November, breaking ground by the end of1989 and to begin shipping its product by mid-1991.   Austin in January 1988 landed the much-sought Sematechsemiconductor research consortium. Kane had been chairman of thesite selection committee for Sematech, a jointly funded effort bythe Defense Department and private industry.   Companies in the consortium include Advanced Micro Devices Inc.,Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., InternationalBusiness Machines Corp., Intel Corp., LSI Logic Corp., and NationalSemiconductor Corp.   Other states submitting bids for the plant were Arizona,California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, NorthCarolina, Oregon, Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky, Minnesota andVirginia. The 15th state submitting a bid could not be immediatelydetermined.</TEXT></DOC>
