The experimental sequenceof operations is controlled by a supervisory program, which coordinatessoftware running on Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX computers,Hewlett--Packard (HP) UNIX-based workstations, and HP b-smcapsASIc-smcapsdesktop computers. An interprocess communication system (IPCS) allowsprograms to communicate with one another in a standard manner regardlessof program location in the network or of operating system and hardwaredifferences. We discuss the design and implementation of this data-acquisitionsystem with particular emphasis on the coordination model and the IPCS.</TEXT></DOC>
