The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said an estimated average of 16.9 million wage and salary workers belonged to unions last year, down from 17 million in 1985 and in 1986. Union membership has leveled off in the past two years, the bureau said, after plunging 3.1 million in the preceding five-year period.    Mainly because of an increase in total employment, union membership declined to 17% of the work force in 1987 from 18% in 1985 and 17.5% in 1986, the report showed. Union members' portion of total employment has fallen steadily in the post-World War II period, from a high of about 35% in 1945.    The report was based on estimates from the Census Bureau's continuing Current Population Survey. </TEXT></DOC>
