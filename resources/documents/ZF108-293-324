(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Mac IIfx: Fast Times at Apple ComputerandM;It's hard to imagine anyone complaining about the Mac IIci's performance, butyou'll probably start hearing rumbles of discontent real soon.andP;  Apple's firstproduct announcements of the decade represent a huge leap in performance andshould put to rest any lingering doubts about the Mac's ability to competeagainst PC-compatible machines running Windows and Presentation Manager.andO;Collectively, the Macintosh IIfx, three new Macintosh display cards, and anew version of A/UX promise to launch the Mac into entirely new markets.andP;  Butto really appreciate what Apple has achieved, consider this:andM;Fact: The Mac is a better windowing environment than the glitziest DOSmachine.andP;  Even a stock IIcx can outperform a 33-megahertz 80386-based unitrunning Windows, but because earlier Macs lacked that flashy 33-megahertzclock speed, most users don't realize this.andM;Fact: As the number of displayable colors has spiraled upward, the Mac'sdisplay speed has spiraled downward.andP;  In 24-bit mode, even simple textdocuments -- without any color -- can't refresh without rippling.andP;  So Macusers who want to take full advantage of their favorite computer's graphicabilities have settled for degraded performance, reinforcing their feelingsthat the Mac isn't the fastest thing on the block.andM;Fact: Only nerds love UNIX.andP;  Typical Mac users, given the choice betweenusing UNIX and having poison oak on the soles of their feet, have a hard timechoosing.andP;  Unfortunately, UNIX is still the operating system of choice formany high-end workstations and mainframes.andP;  And if the Mac is going tochallenge -- or even connect to -- machines in these markets, it'll have tospeak UNIX.andM;Wicked FastandM;The new Mac IIfx is now Apple's top-of-the-line machine, outperforming theIIci by 70 to 100 percent.andP;  A Mac II look-alike with six NuBus slots, theIIfx is the Macintosh for serious engineering, 3-D graphics, multi-mediaeffects processing, and other CPU-intensive tasks.andM;The IIfx owes its speed to several developments.andP;  Apple surprised everyone(even us) by using a 40-megahertz 68030 CPU, skipping the 33-megahertzvariety altogether, and combining it with a 40-megahertz 68882 floating-pointprocessor for numerically intense applications.andM;You can impress your friends with the megahertz figure, but don't overlookthe IIfx's other enhancements.andP;  The motherboard contains a 32K cache ofsuperspeedy SRAM (static RAM) that keeps the CPU at top efficiency.andP;  (To seewhat role hardware cache has in performance, see the reviews of Fast CacheIIci and MaraThon Racer in this issue's StartUp section.)andM;Input and output processing has also been accelerated with three new chips.andO;Two are dedicated to controlling the serial ports, ADB ports, and the FDHDfloppy-disk drive, freeing the CPU from performing low-level I/O tasks.andP;  Thistranslates into faster serial-port functions, such as Local-Talk and modemcommunication.andP;  Your hard-disk drive and other SCSI devices will run fasterwith the IIfx.andP;  A SCSI/DMA controller chip enhances the SCSI bus by providingdevices on the bus with direct access to memory.andP;  This frees the CPU forsimultaneous, or &quot;latched,&quot; reads and writes from the IIfx's newly designedSIMMs.andM;A sound port on the back of the IIfx produces 44.1-kilohertz (CD-audio rate),8-bit, stereo-sampled digital audio for multi-media buffs.andP;  A ProcessorDirect Slot for third-party boards is built in to the motherboard for futureapplications, offering faster CPU access than does a NuBus slot.andO;Unfortunately, it's different from the PDS on the SE, SE/30, and IIci, whichare, in turn, different from each other.andM;For Mac II and IIx users covetous of the IIfx, Apple will have an upgradeprogram that will let you swap your old motherboard for the new one.andP;  Pricingwas not available at press time, but knowing Apple's past upgrade policies,it won't be cheap.andP;  In addition, you won't be able to use your old SIMMs.andO;The new 80-nanosecond SIMMs have 64 pins instead of the normal SIMMs' 30.andO;Apple says that several third-party manufacturers have committed tomanufacturing the new SIMMs, but don't expect the supply to be plentiful --or cheap.andP;  Because the Mac IIfx is expected to list in the $10,000 to $12,000range, expensive SIMMs may be the least of your worries.andM;Video SimplifiedandM;Three new display cards represent both an expansion and a contraction ofApple's line.andP;  Instead of selling seven cards, Apple has decided to shrinkits offerings to just four: the previously released Monochrome Display Cardand the three new boards.andP;  All the new Macintosh Display Cards automaticallyrecognize and configure themselves to work with any Apple monitor.andP;  Theysupport RS-170 standard timing for output to interlaced-video products suchas TVs and VCRs.andP;  This makes them easily compatible with composite-videodevices (although you'll still need an NTSC convertor).andP;  But the big news isthat Apple has conquered the palette/performance paradox.andM;With the Mac IIfx's increased computing speed and 32-bit QuickDraw's 16.7million colors, Apple had to boost the video-display speed, and doing thatmeant taking a RISC.andP;  The Macintosh Display Card 8 .andP;  24 GC is a combinationdisplay card/graphics coprocessor that incorporates an Am29000 RISC chipon-board.andP;  The 29000 runs at 30 megahertz and speeds up performance tobetween 5 and 30 times that of conventional systems, so you can see complexgraphics nearly as quickly as the IIfx can generate them.andP;  Unlike other RISCcoprocessors that require customized applications, the 8 .andP;  24 GC will workwith any applications -- without software modifications -- and &quot;32 bit clean&quot;programs will perform even better.andM;On bootup, a special file downloads a RISC-optimized version of QuickDrawdirectly to the board's 2 megabytes of VRAM (video random-access memory).andO;From that point, the 29000 takes over and pages information in 64K blocksinto the 64K SRAM cache on-board.andP;  Apple estimates that swapping will occuronly about 3 percent of the time, so performance shouldn't be noticeablyaffected.andP;  And for even better performance, the card has two SIMM sockets foradding 2 megabytes of DRAM (dynamic RAM) now and, eventually, up to 8megabytes with third-party 4-megabyte SIMMs.andP;  These are special double-sidedSIMMs.andP;  Although Apple will release the specs to third-party manufacturers,it will probably be the only source for some time.andP;  Although exact pricingwasn't set at press time, the card is expected to list for around $2,100 whenit's available this summer.andM;And for users who need color but don't have a crying need for the 8 .andP;  24GC's speed, the Macintosh Display Card 4 .andP;  8 and 8 .andP;  24 provide anupgradable 8- to 24-bit-color answer but without the RISC corprocessor or thehigh degree of expandability.andP;  The 8-bit 4 .andP;  8 card displays up to 256colors on an Apple color monitor and up to 16 grays on Apple's monochromemodels.andP;  The 8 .andP;  24 is a 24-bit card that displays up to 16.7 million colorson Apple's color monitor and 256 grays on Apple's monochrome monitors.andP;  Withthe addition of 2 megabytes of VRAM SIMMs, a basic 4 .andP;  8 model (expected tocost about $700) can grow to a full 24-bit unit (expected to list for about$1,000).andM;UNIX with a Human FaceandM;Although what Apple has achieved with A/UX 2.0 may not be as earthshaking asrecent events in Eastern Europe, the sight of a normal Macintosh windowrunning a UNIX application under MultiFinder is nearly as startling.andP;  A/UX2.0 fulfills the promise of opening the Macintosh up to UNIX withoutalienating Mac users who can still see and use their familiar desktop andapplications with virtually no performance degradation (Apple estimates thegap at around 2 percent).andM;With the Mac IIfx and the 8 .andP;  24 GC display card, Mac users need no longersuffer from performance anxiety.andP;  And with A/UX 2.0, UNIX need no longer be ahostile territory.andP;  So if you hear any rumbles of discontent, they might becoming from disgruntled DOS users.andM;Russell Ito is currently searching for a mortgage on a Mac IIfx.andP;  John Rizzotorture-tests new Macintoshes (among other things) as MacUser's technicaleditor.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
