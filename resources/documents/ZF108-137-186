General Services Administration.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Federal IRM Managers Should Heed PredecessorsandM;We all know people who get their Christmas shopping done before Thanksgiving.andO;They usually are the ones who buy Christmas cards and wrapping paper athalf-price right after New Year's Day.andM;They not only have a strong sense of the future and the need to plan for it,but also they believe in early action.andP;  In case you are not aware of it, thefederal government has people like that in its ranks as well.andM;I thought of this recently when I reread the GSA publication, the SeniorFederal IRM Manager: Major Roles and Responsibilities as We Move into the1990s.andP;  From its title, it's obviously topical.andP;  The publication date?andO;November 1987 -- more than two years ago.andM;The specific stimulus for this publication was not the approaching end of thedecade of the 1980s.andP;  It was prompted by the prospect of a new administrationafter the 1988 elections.andM;Career managers in the federal government are only too familiar with thephenomenon of newly appointed executives coming into an agency at thebeginning of a new presidency, struggling to understand how the governmentworks, formulating their programs and then leaving after two to three years-- just about the time they realize what they should have been doing.andM;This may be even more true of information resources management executivesthan of program managers.andM;The political appointees who are designated senior agency officials for IRMusually hold the position of assistant secretary for management oradministration and have many other duties that lay claim to their time.andP;  Theyrarely have experience with managing information technology and even lesswith the specific function of federal IRM.andM;To carry out their responsibilities as designated senior officials forimplementation of the Paperwork Reduction Act, they depend on the careersenior IRM managers who report to them.andP;  The GSA report, then, outlines theroles and responsibilities of the senior agency official for IRM almost asmuch as it does the same for the senior IRM manager.andM;The decade of the '80s had a special significance for federal IRM managers.andO;The IRM function evolved as a result of the implementation of the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980.andP;  This report is largely a &quot;lessons learned&quot; summary ofthe key roles and responsibilities of senior IRM managers as viewed by fourseasoned veterans of federal IRM: Glen Haney at Agriculture, Oscar MuellerJr.andP;  at Interior, Reed Phillips at Commerce and GSA's Frank McDonough.andM;Lessons LearnedandM;Part of the report deals with the key characteristics of the senior IRMmanager.andP;  It says he must be able to sell plans, negotiate effectively andbring decisions to closure.andP;  He must be politically astute and mustunderstand complex issues, both technological and procurement-related.andM;The report suggests that to gain the tangible skills required for theposition, &quot;.andP;  .  .  the senior IRM manager must have had the opportunity tobe involved in all aspects of IRM.andM;This includes experience in the federal ADP and telecommunicationsacquisition process, the federal budget process, policy formulation andimplementation, knowledge of records management theory and practice andinformation management concepts, experience with central management agencies,familiarity with strategic planning, technical expertise in the variousinformation technologies and knowledge of the federal procurement process.&quot;andM;'Politically Astute'andM;But the report is less helpful in explaining what it means to be &quot;politicallyastute&quot; and how one gets that way.andP;  The report acknowledges that it is notone of the tangible skills and suggests that it means &quot;caable of dealing withthe dynamic political environment of an agency.&quot;andP;  That's not much help.andM;If you're a cynic, you might agree with George Bernard Shaw, who had acharacter in one of his plays say, &quot;He knows nothing and thinks he knowseverthing.andP;  That clearly points to a political career.&quot;andM;Or with Don Marquis, whose character Archy, the cockroach, typed thisarchygram (in lower as usual), &quot;did you ever/notice that when/apolitician/does get an idea/he usually/gets it all wrong.&quot;andM;Or maybe with Winston Churchill, who explained, &quot;Political skill is theability to foretell what is going to happen tomorrow, next week, next monthand next year.andP;  And to have the ability to explain why it didn't happen.&quot;andM;All of the above, of course, contain some element of truth.andP;  But the subjectof politics is too important to dismiss with a few caustic comments.andP;  I'lldiscuss it again soon.andM;Tattered FabricandM;Meanwhile, it seems to me that the IRM fabric of the federal governmentstarted to unravel in 1987 as senior agency officials began to leave theReagan administration in the middle of President Reagan's second term.andM;In many organizations the positions were filled with acting administrators.andO;Some of the current information technology acquisition and managementproblems in specific agencies can be traced back to the erosion of controlover the IRM function that resulted from this loss of institutionalknowledge.andM;The situation today?andP;  All the senior agency officials for IRM in the majoragencies were appointed during the last 12 months, and most of them duringthe last six months.andP;  A great many of the senior IRM managers also are new totheir positions; in a few notable cases, that position in the agency isvacant.andM;More than one-third of all of the higher-level IRM positions in the federalgovernment as published in the Federal IRM Directory have changed since ayear ago.andP;  This is a brand-new start for IRM in the federal government.andM;These are the people who will spend well over $100 billion of the taxpayers'money during the next six or seven years.andP;  It's not a trivial issue.andM;The Bush administration has to pick up where the Reagan administration leftoff, repair the damage done by the slow transition and move on with the jobof using information technology to do the work of government.andP;  A good placeto begin would be to read this GSA report about the roles andresponsibilities these managers have under the laws of our country.andM;Then the administration should put together an IRM program for the governmentas a whole.andP;  It may still be early in 1990, but Christmas is not that faraway.andP;  If we're going to spend all that money, I'd like to think we've done agood job of preparing our shopping list.andM;In particular, I'd like to see John Sununu, Bush's chief of staff and&quot;enforcer,&quot; pay some personal attention to how that list gets put together.andO;It shouldn't be treated as business as usual, and his background inengineering and science may be just what's needed.andM;Frank Carr retired from the General Services Administration in 1988.andP;  Ascommissioner of GSA's Information Resources Management Service, he was thefederal government's top information technology procurement official.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
