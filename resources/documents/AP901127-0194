The companies said in September they plan to create jointventures in Italy, Spain and Portugal for their paper productsbusinesses, notably diapers and sanitary napkins. Also, Proctersaid it would buy all of Finaf's activities in Britain.   The Commission asked the companies to hold off until it issatisfied ``there is no breach'' of EC fair competition rules.   A Commission official said the accord could create or strengthendominant positions by the two companies and received a complaintabout the planned venture from Peau Douce SA, a French diapermaker.   Peau Douce argued Procter's deal with Finaf would violatecompetition rules and asked for interim measures to stop theagreement from taking effect.   The EC treaty bans undertakings that prevent, restrict ordistort fair copetition in the 12-nation trade bloc.   Procter andamp; Gamble, which is based in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Finafhave been in touch with the Commission since before they announcedplans for their linkup.   David Veitch, a spokesman at Procter andamp; Gamble's Europeanheadquarters here, said, ``It has always been our intention not toimplement this agreement until the competent authorities have beenheard.''   The EC Commission official said discussions with the twocompanies were continuing and if these ``go satisfactorily, we canresolve the problem without going further to law.''   Veitch said under the deal with Finaf, the two companies were``to merge their paper product business'' in Italy, Spain andPortugal.   Procter andamp; Gamble, the maker of Pampers, is a leading diaperproducer. But Veitch said the company ``was a relatively smallplayer in Europe'' in sanitary napkins and other personal hygienepaper goods.   ``The purpose of the agreement (with Finaf) was to accelerateour entry'' into those products in Europe, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
