The disclosure by the operator of nursing homes was a substantial reversal from the company's view in May that securities analysts were right in forecasting increased profit in 1987 totaling between 80 cents and $1.05 a share.    Robert Van Tuyle, chairman and chief executive officer, said yesterday in an interview that the fourth-quarter loss likely will be wider than the loss of the year-earlier quarter. Mr. Van Tuyle didn't elaborate on the loss for the year but said that revenue for the latest quarter totaled about $530 million and $2 billion for the year. He said final details won't be available until early next month.    In the 1986 fourth quarter, Beverly Enterprises had a net loss of $1.6 million on revenue of $526.4 million. Net income for the year totaled $44.9 million, or 71 cents a share, after a $6.5 million charge for debt redemption. Revenue was $2.02 billion.    In the first nine months of 1987, the company had a net loss of $8.1 million on revenue of $1.59 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Beverly Enterprises closed at $6.75, down 25 cents.    Mr. Van Tuyle said Beverly Enterprises plans to cut its 2,000-member managerial staff by about 300 employees in the first quarter of 1988. The company has a total of about 106,000 employees. These staff reductions, together with related costs cuts, are expected to cut overhead by more than $20 million annually, he said.    Still, the company expects losses for the first half of 1988. Mr. Van Tuyle said that, depending on labor costs, these first-half losses may be more severe than the $11.7 million shortfall in the first six months of 1987.    Mr. Van Tuyle said increased salary levels, combined with greater use of expensive temporary employees, have boosted labor costs by more than $100 million annually.    He also said competition for low-skilled workers, particularly in Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle and parts of Florida, has forced up the company's wage rates.    As well, occupancy rates at the company's nursing homes averaged 88% last year --somewhat below the 90% rate forecast internally. That shortfall reduced revenue by about $38 million from the forecast amount, Mr. Van Tuyle said. </TEXT></DOC>
