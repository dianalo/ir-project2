The timber market will be situated in northeasternHeilongjiang province, where forestry is a major industry.The official newspaper didn't specify a starting date.Wholesale markets also are being considered for coal, rubber,farm machinery, building materials, chemical products andnonferrous metals.   Beijing also is drafting a program to phase outartificially low fixed prices for raw materials.   The moves provide another indication that Chinese leadersare serious about resuming market-oriented economic reformsthis year. Beijing began experimenting with wholesale marketsin 1990 when it opened a national wheat market in Zhengzhouin central China. It has since opened similar markets forrice, corn and other farm products.                                                                                                          INVESTMENTS IN SOUTH KOREA                                                                                                          Foreign investment in South Korea last year jumped 73% to$1.39 billion from a year earlier, boosted partly by smallerwage increases and stable labor-management relationships.After the local distribution market was opened to directforeign investments last year, the service sector attracted$325 million, up 48%, in 178 projects, up 12%. Manufacturinginvestments climbed 84% to $1.07 billion on a 20% drop inprojects to 109. Investments by U.S. enterprises, the largestgroup of foreign investors, fell 6.7% to $296 million, and byJapanese slipped 4.2% to $226 million. Europeans' investmentssoared to $823 million from $207 million in 53 projects, up26%.                                                                                                          HONG KONG FAILURES INCREASE                                                                                                          Personal and corporate bankruptcies last year in Hong Kongrose sharply to a combined total of 629, the highest levelsince the 699 recorded in 1985. Companies enteringliquidation proceedings climbed 21% to 346 from a yearearlier, and individual filings increased 35% to 283.                                                                                                          JAPANESE BANK-AD CURBS EASED                                                                                                          Japan's banking federation plans to ease restrictions onadvertising and abolish them in March 1993. Banks now areallowed only 375 seconds of air time monthly on eachtelevision station. This limit will be raised in April to 525seconds, a ceiling that will be eliminated next year. Banksalso will be able to advertise in the first four pages ofmagazines and the first third of newspapers, both off-limitsnow. The federation established the regulations in 1954 toavoid government imposition of similar measures because ofconcern that smaller banks couldn't compete with big ones.                                                                                                          SMALL JAPANESE FIRMS GLOOMY                                                                                                          Smaller Japanese companies grew more pessimistic in thequarter ended Dec. 31, as the slowing economy damped demand.A government index, based on 17,500 firms, worsened to minus6.8 from minus 0.2 in the previous quarter. The indexsubtracts percentages of firms that are pessimistic fromthose that are confident. Tokyo said efforts to buttressflagging confidence hinge on lending-rate cuts for smallerfirms, which projected even bleaker prospects for the currentquarter.                                                                                                          SUBIC MAY BECOME FREE PORT                                                                                                          Philippine President Corazon Aquino suggested turning theSubic naval base into a Hong Kong-style free port to cushionthe economic effect of a U.S. military pullout by December.She said the U.S. Navy repair yard and ammunition depot 50miles northwest of Manila could become &quot;the nucleus of agrowth center&quot; in the Philippines. She ordered a study onconverting the 14,400-acre base to commercial uses, such as aspecial economic zone. Subic's closure would leave 38,000Filipinos jobless and eliminate $350 million a year inbase-generated business.

Japan said a record 123,529 students quit public andprivate high schools in 1990, for a 2.2% dropout rate amongthe total of 5.6 million pupils. . . . Vietnam said itspopulation has grown to 69.3 million -- 80% of them live inrural areas -- from 64.4 million in 1989. Hanoi, seeking moreprosperity through market-economy experiments, is trying toreduce the country's population growth rate of 2.2%, one ofthe highest in the region, to 1.7% by the year 2000.</TEXT></DOC>
