With all the recent publicity about the U.S.'s growing garbage problem, waste-disposal companies have done extremely well in recent months. Nevertheless, most analysts who follow the solid waste industry assert that disposal-firm stocks remain generally undervalued.    These analysts maintain that current prices still don't fully reflect the fundamental strengths of disposal firms. For instance, with their banks of landfill, disposal firms are &quot;sitting on an asset that can't be duplicated&quot; because of cost and local opposition to new sites, says Merrill Lynch's William Genco. Moreover, says Chicago Corp.'s Kay Hahn, disposal firms will never have a problem with excess inventory, nor be overtaken by technological advances -- garbage-burning plants not withstanding.    &quot;We're going to see a fundamental change in the way (disposal-firm) stocks are valued&quot; that better reflects these strengths, predicts Bret Maxwell of First Analysis Corp.    To be sure, with a landfill comes the risk of running afoul of ever-tightening federal and state environmental regulations. But Ms. Hahn says the big publicly traded landfill firms are trying to anticipate the tougher regulations by voluntarily increasing environmental safeguards.    Moreover, Ms. Hahn says, the Mom and Pop outfits -- which still account for roughly 75% of all U.S. landfill operations -- simply won't have the money to keep up with mandated environmental improvements. Thus, Ms. Hahn forecasts, many small landfills will be forced to close over the next few years, leaving the big guys poised for steadily rising profits.    Analysts generally rate Waste Management as the best buy in the group. Ms. Hahn says Chicago-based Waste Management &quot;concentrated on landfill early on.&quot; As a result, it now &quot;has the greatest landfill bank there will ever be,&quot; she says.    Kidder Peabody rates Waste Management a &quot;1,&quot; which is the Wall Street firm's strongest buy recommendation. Kidder's Jeffrey Klein recently wrote that &quot;growth oppportunities continue to exist (for Waste Management) as roughly 50 of the 150 largest solid-waste markets haven't been penetrated.&quot; Mr. Klein also likes the fact that, under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Waste Management's tax rate will fall from 48.5% in 1986 to 40% by 1988.    Pittsburgh-based Chambers Development is also a big favorite of analysts. They say the company's Pennsylvania landfills are ideally located to capitalize on the garbage crisis in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania -- probably the three states currently with the worst problem.    That Chambers is already selling at 47 times earnings may scare off some investors, the analysts concede. Moreover, some note that the company's earnings have been built in part on an unusually low tax rate of about 20%, partially the result of tax loss carry-forwards. Still, analysts stress that Chambers has the only landfill to be permitted in Pennsylvania in the last seven years. In that same time, Pennsylvania closed hundreds of other landfills.    In addition, maintains Richard Martin of Mabon Nugent, because Chambers began as a geotechnical construction company, it has the expertise in geology and hydrology needed to make its landfills environmentally safe.    Chambers recently signed a long-term contract to dispose of Passaic County, N.J.'s trash starting later this year, when Passaic starts sending it to Pennsylvania by train. Even after Passaic begins burning its trash in a waste-to-energy plant in a few years, Chambers will dispose of Passaic's ash, another potentially broad market.    Garbage burning is being touted by vendors as an alternative to landfill, but in Passaic County and elsewhere, incinerators will generate an ash residue equal to about 20% of the original volume. That ash, which will be more toxic than the original garbage, plus other waste that can't be burned, will still have to be buried somewhere.    Moreover, even the most optimistic assessments of the future of waste-to-energy say such plants will be able to take care of only 30% to 40% of the nation's trash by the year 2000. That leaves a lot of garbage for a handful of landfills, given the absence of any other disposal technology on the horizon.    Analysts are less enthusiastic about Western Waste Industries and Laidlaw Industries because they primarily collect and haul garbage, rather than dispose of it. &quot;They don't have the underlying leverage&quot; that firms with landfill banks have, Mr. Maxwell says. But Ms. Hahn says Carson, Calif.-based Western Waste has started moving in the right direction with its recent acquisition of a big landfill in Riverside, Calif.    Another company getting favorable but somewhat guarded reviews is Browning-Ferris Industries. Merrill Lynch has an &quot;aggressive buy&quot; on the company and Kidder has given it a &quot;1.&quot; But a recent Kidder report on the firm acknowledged that there probably will be &quot;investor uneasiness&quot; resulting from lawsuits recently filed against the firm by federal and Louisiana regulatory agencies over a hazardous waste -- not garbage -- site in Livingston, La. </TEXT></DOC>
