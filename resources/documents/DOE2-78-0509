Two systems of declutching or partiallyloading the total engine accessory package, the crank clutch and thetwo-speed accessory drive, are examined in this study. The study objectiveswere to determine the benefits of these systems on a typical North Americanpassenger car. A series of tests was devised to evaluate the overallperformance of the vehicle under various conditions. Tests were performedwith the accessory package in full ratio, one-half ratio, one-third ratioand the declutched mode so that a comparative evaluation could be obtained.The tests performed were cold start performance, acceleration performance,EPA fuel economy, and constant-speed fuel economy. Also, the individualaccessory torques were determined in order to provide insight into therelationship between the amount of fuel saved to the reduced load onthe engine and design criteria of crank clutches and two-speed accessorydrive units. Results of this investigation indicate a definite improvementin cold start and acceleration performance with the accessories declutchedor driven at reduced speed. EPA and constant-speed fuel economy werealso improved with the reduced accessory speeds. Disadvantages of thesystem included lack of coolant circulation, and lack of power steering,during the declutched mode. These disadvantages could be eliminated ifonboard computers currently becoming available are incorporated intothe system. 31 figs., 22 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
