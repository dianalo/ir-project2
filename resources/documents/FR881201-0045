The proposal, known as theCalifornia-Oregon Transmission Project (COTP), would have the purpose ofexpanding the bidirectional capability of the Pacific Northwest-PacificSouthwest Intertie transmission system and help serve California's needfor economical power, would facilitate the Pacific Northwest's desire tosell surplus power, and would meet the need for maintaining and increasingthe reliability of the existing transmission system.The California-Oregon Transmission Project (COTP) proposal is to constructand operate approximately 340 miles of transmission lines, three substations,a series compensation station, communication facilities, and to modifytwo existing substations. The specific portions of this proposal that involveNational Forest System lands include:Construction of a new 500 KV AC transmission line and associated facilitiesfrom the California-Oregon border area to the proposed Olinda Substationnear Redding, California, approximately 58 miles of which crosses NationalForest System lands.Modification of existing and construction of a new communication systemand associated facilities on National Forest System lands.The Department of Energy, Western, and the Transmission Agency of NorthernCalifornia, were designated as lead agencies for the development of thefinal EIS/EIR for the California-Oregon Transmission Project (DOE/EIS-0128).The USDA Forest Service was a cooperating agency in the development ofthis joint EIS/EIR.<ITAG tagnum="84">Decision</ITAG>Based on the analysis and information contained in the Draft, Supplementto the Draft, and Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), it is mydecision to select the North D Alternative for the 500 KV powerline andassociated improvements on National Forest System lands. It is also mydecision to authorize the construction of the project under a Special-UsePermit with appropriate clauses and stipulations, as shown in the attachedexhibit, and to issue an easement for the right-of-way covering the operationand maintenance of the transmission line and associated facilities afterconstruction is completed.The North D Alternative consists of the following route segments discussedin the EIS/EIR which cross National Forest System lands between the Oregonborder and Redding, California (a general description of the route follows):<ITAG tagnum="23">N-10K </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">N-10L </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">N-10M1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">N-10M2(A)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">N-10M2(A1) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">North 2B</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">N-10Alt5(B) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">N-10Alt5(D)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">N-10Alt5(C) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">N-7Alt1(A)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">N-7Alt1(B) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">North 3J</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">N-8A(3) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">N-8C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">N-8Alt2(A)</ITAG>Alternative North D crosses onto National Forest System lands southeastof the town of Newell in Modoc County, near Casuse Mountain. It then travelsin a southwesterly direction across portions of the Doublehead and BigValley Districts of the Modoc National Forest, crossing into Siskiyou Countynear Border Mountain. The route crosses onto the McCloud District of theShasta-Trinity National Forest about two miles southwest of Snell Butte.About two miles southeast of Hambone Butte, the route crosses about one-halfmile of the Shasta National Forest administered by the Hat Creek Districtof the Lassen National Forest, where it turns and proceeds in a westerlydirection. Approximately three miles west of Bear Mountain Lookout, theroute turns south toward Dead Horse Summit, turning to the southwest againabout one mile southeast of Curtis Meadows, where it crosses Highway 89.From this point it crosses mostly private lands, crossing into Shasta Countyabout three miles before it reaches Grizzly Peak. From Grizzly Peak itturns to the south, staying to the east side of Little Meadows. The routecrosses onto the Shasta Lake District of the Shasta-Trinity National Forestnear Stump Creek Butte, and continues south. After crossing private landsin the Flat Woods area, the route crosses about two miles of National Forestland near Hogback Mountain and then proceeds to the south across privatelands toward Redding, California.<ITAG tagnum="84">Routing Alternatives Considered</ITAG>Four major routes, North A, B, C, and D, were analyzed in the Draft EIS/EIR.Alternative North A travels generally south down the east side of ShastaValley, then southeast (staying north and east of Mount Shasta) to aboutsix miles past Ash Creek Butte, where it then turns south toward GrizzlyPeak. Alternatives North B and North C both come south through the ButteValley area. North B passes near the town of Macdoel, while North C staysto the east of Dorris. Both join just to the northeast of Tennant, andcontinue south to the Ash Creek Butte area, where they then follow thesame route as North A. All routes have the same location from Grizzly Peakto the forest boundary. To arrive at the point where the four major routeswere analyzed in the EIS, a full range of route segments and alternativeswere considered on National Forest System lands. Routing guidelines whichtook into account engineering, earth sciences, water quality, biologicalresources, visual resources, socioeconomics, land status, land use, culturalresources, and electrical/magnetic effects were applied in order to developpreliminary routes. After public review, revised preliminary alternativeroutes were identified, and a second round of route review and revisionwas initiated.Additional modifications and adjustments were made during the impact assessment.Multidisciplinary comparisons were done between the different route alternativesin order to identify the preliminary environmentally superior as well asthe preliminary project preferred alternatives in the Draft EIS/EIR, issuedin November, 1986.Public and Agency comments on the Draft EIS/EIR resulted in a Supplementto the Draft, issued in June of 1987. The Supplement was issued in orderto get public review of proposed new routing options and an alternate SouthernOregon Switching Station site. Seven new route options within AlternativeNorth D north of Redding were analyzed in the Supplement in a similar manneras were the routes in the Draft EIS/EIR.The Final EIS/EIR incorporated all analyses made the for the Draft EIS/EIRand the Supplement to the Draft, and indentified the environmentally superiorand project preferred alternatives for the COTP. The Forest Service participatedin and reviewed the route selection process throughout, and my decisionsreflect that involvement in the route selection process, as well as theimpact assessment and the review of public comment as described below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Alternatives Considered</ITAG>A full range of alternatives were considered for the entire project, asdescribed in the Phase II Report of Volume 2A of the draft EIS/EIR, supplementto the draft, and Section 1.2.2 of Volume I of the final EIS/EIR. Numerousroutes within the basic alternatives were also considered, as describedin the EIS/EIR sections listed above. Some other alternatives consideredare as follows;<T3>No Action</T3>_The no action alternative would have no environmentalimpacts in the short run. In the long term, participating utilities wouldundertake other transmission construction projects, and the operation ofthe western region transmission system would continue to be subject tothe effects of outages of the existing AC intertie and operating restrictionson the interconnected system.<T3>Upgrade Existing 500 KV Pacific AC Transmission Intertie</T3>_Thisalternative considered upgrading two existing 500 KV Pacific AC Intertielines to provide two 2,400 MW AC lines, an increase of 800 MW on each line.This alternative would have fewer environmental impacts, but is rejectedbased on physical, economic, and outage/reliability problems.<T3>DC Transmission_</T3>This alternative would replace the COTP with asecond DC transmission line. The environmental impacts of this alternativewould be similar to those from the selected alternative. This alternativewould require multi-tap DC technology for the multiple points of deliveryfor the COTP, and would have substantially higher costs.<T3>Parallel Existing Intertie Lines_</T3>This alternative considered usingthe existing right-of-way of the Pacific AC Intertie lines. This alternativedoes not meet the reliability criteria requiring separation of the newline sufficiently from the two existing lines.<T3>East of Existing Intertie Lines_</T3>These options considered placingthe COTP to the east of the existing Pacific AC Intertie lines. This wouldrequire that the COTP cross the existing lines twice north of Olinda Substation.These options were not considered further due to system reliability concernsand technological difficulties associated with the crossovers.<T3>Underground Construction_</T3>Underground construction was considered,but rejected due to economics, reliability, and feasibility. Undergroundtransmission would have a greater environmental impact in terms of soildisturbance. Underground transmission of 500 KV lines for long distancessuch as this is still an unproven technology.<T3>Nontransmission Alternatives_</T3>A variety of nontransmission alternativeswere considered, as discussed in section 2.5.2 of the draft EIS. Many combinationsof generation and conservation technologies and programs could be developedto provide 1,600 MW of additional capacity to the COTP participants. Generationtechnologies which could individually or in combination, be compared tothe Combined Projects include the following conventional large centralstation facilities and renewable resource or preferred technology facilities:<T3>Conventional Generation Technologies_</T3>Coal-fired; nuclear; combustionturbines; combined cycle (oil or natural gas); large hydroelectric (newdam and reservoir); refurbishment of existing oil and gas-fired capacity;compressed air energy storage; pumped storage hydroelectric.<T3>Renewable and Preferred Technologies_</T3>Cogeneration; biomass (woodresidue, agricultural waste, municipal solid waste); small hydroelectric;photovoltaic; solar thermal; geothermal; wind turbines; solar space heatingand cooling; residential, commercial, and industrial load conservation;load management.These nontransmission alternatives would not provide for bidirectionalcapability, and would not facilitate the Pacific Northwest's desire todistribute surplus power.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reasons for Selection</ITAG>Impact assessment for the EIS/EIR identified some major resource impactsand concerns for the route segments on National Forest System lands. Majorenvironmental issues pertinent to my decision are the protection of oldgrowth timber, total amount of commercial timber impacted, protection ofsensitive wildlife species habitat, minimizing resource impacts in geologicallysensitive areas, and that the route best meets public demands for reliablebulk electrical power transmission.Old growth timber areas provide important habitat for wildlife speciesdependent on old growth forests, as well as ecological diversity, and ofthe routing alternatives considered, North D minimizes impacts to old growthtimber. Total commercial timber resources impacted by each alternativewere analyzed, and Alternative North D would impact less commercial timberthan alternatives A, B, and C.Protection of sensitive wildlife species and their habitats was also animportant consideration. In particular, impacts to sensitive species suchas Goshawk and spotted owls were analyzed during the impact assessment.The North D alternative route avoids spotted owl network territories designatedto maintain viability of the species, and minimizes impacts to Goshawks.A variety of other important wildlife areas are crossed, but impacts areadequately mitigated through use of seasonal construction activity closuresand road management, as outlined in the EIS/EIR.Alternative A would have major impacts associated with possible line collisionsby the bald eagle and other sensitive raptors. Alternative A also passesnear a bald eagle nest territory, and would pass through a spotted owlmanagement area near the McCloud River. Alternative B passes within a mileof bald eagle winter roost and a nest near Coleman Lake and the KlamathRiver. Collision potential is high with this alternative as well, and thesame spotted owl management area impacted by alternative A would also beimpacted by alternatives B and C. Alternative C also impacts bald eagleroost sites near Bear Valley, and moderate collision potential exists foreagles moving across the line to Butte Valley foraging areas. AlternativeD passes on the east side of the Klamath Basin, which also supports highpopulations of migratory waterfowl and wintering bald eagles, but collisionpotential here is not significant because use of the corridor area is lowand topography shields birds from collisions. Alternative North D passesthrough the Glass Mountain Known Geothermal Resource Area, as well as theGiant Crater Lava Flow area, but careful placement of towers will mitigateany impacts or concerns regarding lava tube collapse, and the transmissionline should not effect or be affected by the known geothermal resourcearea. Alternatives A, B, and C all would be subject to potential geologicrisks associated with Mount Shasta and earthquake faults in the Tennantarea.Alternative North D also minimizes impacts on recreation and visual resources.Alignment and design considerations reduce the visual impact (see mitigationslisted below), and crossing of high use scenic roads such as the PowderHill Road to Medicine Lake is avoided. Alternatives A, B, and C cross throughthe visually sensitive areas of Shasta Valley and Butte Valley.<ITAG tagnum="84">Issues Raised by Public Comment</ITAG>Major issues pertinent to National Forest System lands were raised by thepublic during the review periods, as described below. Many of the routeoptions presented in the Supplement to the Draft EIS/EIR were developedin response to these issues.A major concern of many commentors was the overall impact on timberland.The powerline right-of-way represents a permanent loss of productive timerland,and many landowners and communities in the study area are economicallydependent on the timber resource. Alternative North D was selected in partbecause of fewer overall impacts on forest lands. For instance, route segmentN-10M2 is located on less productive timerland than N-10 Alt.5. The lossof timber on the National Forests represents less than one-half of onepercent reduction in the long-term sustained yield and allowable cut forthe affected Forests.Transmission system reliability and its effects on the location of therouting alternatives was another major issue. The Forest Service has addressedthe need for separation from the existing intertie based on concerns forsystem reliability and good engineering and technological considerationsrelated to minimize the potential for a three line outage. Sufficient separationof the COTP from the existing intertie is an issue where fire has significantpotential for causing a simultaneous three line outage. This aspect ofthe transmission reliability issue is adequately resolved through selectionof the N-10M route option (a route option closer to the existing intertiethan originally proposd in the Draft EIS/EIR), and with the implementationof a fuels management plan and fire response plan. The fuels managementand fire response plans will be developed jointly by TANC and the ForestService. Separation for other reasons such as natural or man-caused disasterswas also considered in assessing the need for separation from the existingintertie.A second aspect of transmission system reliability relates to the feasibilityof crossing the two existing intertie lines with this powerline. Proposalsto cross the existing intertie and put the new line to the east were carefullyanalyzed, but were not considered feasible because of the technical problemswith crossovers. Crossing the existing intertie results in reduced reliabilityby having all three lines in a position where a single event could causea three line outage at the point of crossover.Visual impacts of the transmission line were also a major public concern.Routing guidelines emphasized minimizing visual impacts through carefulsiting. Full application of measures to reduce the visibility of the towersand conductors, as well as selective clearing of the right-of-way, willbe done to minimize the visual impacts.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmentally Preferred Alternative</ITAG>The environmentally preferred alternative on National Forest System landsis alternative North D. The No Action and Nontransmission alternatives,while having no or little impact in the short term, would both lead inthe long term to proposals for additional power and transmission projectsthat would have at least the same, or significantly greater impact on NationalForest System lands. The North D route, as developed through this EIS/EIRand with the required mitigations, is the preferred route in terms of havinglower overall impact on the human environment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Mitigation</ITAG>All practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from theselected alternative have been adopted. The full list of mitigation measuresadotped are listed in section 1.1.5 of the final EIS. The following isa summary of the key resource areas that are mitigated:Threatened, Endangered, and Sensitive plant and animal species: Constructionof new access roads will be minimized in stream drainages which supportspecial-status aquatic species such as Redband Trout, or in areas thatsupport sensitive plants or threatened, endangered, or sensitive wildlifespecies; preclude access roads in sensitive areas until after biologicalsurveys are completed and mitigation coordinated with appropriate agencies;avoid siting of transmission line towers, access roads and/or constructionwork areas in those unique or sensitive plant communities to the maximumextent possible; avoid disturbance to nests and dens; restrict activitiesduring breeding periods that could disturb species sufficiently to causereproductive failure and other important activity timeframes.Floodplains and wetlands (Ref. Executive Order 11990): Site structuresto span wetland areas and floodplains, place access roads outside wetlandareas, and avoid use of heavy equipment in wetlands.Loss of timberland due to right-of-way clearing: Use directional fellingon right-of-way; minimize locating right-of-way on ridgetops where potentialwindthrow is maximized; emphasize selective clearing removing only tallgrowing vegetation which could interfere with the conductors; prepare avegetation management plan which will consider clearing requirements andlong-term right-of-way management needs; off-site mitigation such as reforestationor other timber stand improvement treatments on timber sites currentlynot in production.Visual resource management: Use non-specular conductors; minimize vegetationclearing along roads and highways, rivers, trails and residential areas;minimize sitings of towers on ridgelines/hilltops; feather edges of right-of-wayclearing; use opaque porcelain insulators; darken tower steel will be usedwhere it can be expected to reduce impacts.New road construction: Minimize new access road construction; close allroads not needed for long-term maintenance activities.Archaeological resource protection: Site structures to span sites; planaccess roads to avoid these sites and monitor construction to minimizeimpact; if site cannot be avoided, scientific excavation to recover dataor stabilization and protection of sites; consult with Native Americansconcerning potential mitigation measures; if cemeteries cannot be avoided,arrange for reburial.The Forest Service will, through permit administration, monitor complianceto ensure that the terms of the permit are met. A Compliance MonitoringPlan developed by the proponent (TANC) and the lead agency (Western) willtrack responsibility and accomplishment of mitigation for the entire project.The lead agency will ensure that the applicable mitigation measures areincluded in construction contracts. Construction inspectors for the leadagency will verify that the mitigation measures are implemented.Mitigation of impacts of the selected alternative on Floodplains and Wetlandsis addressed in the final EIS, Volume I, Section 1.1.5. All potential impactsto wetlands on National Forest System lands are fully mitigable. A Memorandumof Agreement between Western Area Power Administration, the TransmissionAgency of Northern California, the California State Historic PreservationOfficer, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation specifies theprocess for documenting and fully mitigating archaeological and culturalresource impacts for the project.Impacts to threatened and endangered species on National Forest Systemlands are fully mitigatable as described in the mitigation section of thefinal EIS. The Final Biological Opinion by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Servicerequires that prior to the season of construction, a survey be conductedfor potential bald eagle nest sites near the Pit River crossing on NationalForest System lands, and for potential perigrine falcon use of a site atHorse Mountain in the Klamath Basin. Shield wires will be marked at allPit River crossings with aviation marker balls to increase their visibilityto bald eagles and perigrine falcons. All disturbed sites will be repeatseeded as necessary until restored to pre-project conditions.This decision is subject to appeal in accordance with the provisions of36 CFR 211.18.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 15, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Paul F.
