We have notified the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) of our determinationsand have directed the U.S. Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidationon all entries of the subject merchandise from Thailand as described inthe ``Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.The ITC will determine, within 45 days of the publication of this notice,whether these imports materially injure, or threaten material injury to,a U.S. industry.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> May 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Eleanor Shea or Nancy Saeed,Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, InternationalTrade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and ConstitutionAvenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 377-0184 or 377-1777.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Final Determination </ITAG>We determine that ball bearings from Thailand are being, or are likelyto be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided insection 735(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1673d(a))(the Act). The estimated weighted-average dumping margins are shown inthe ``Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.We also determine that critical circumstances do not exist with respectto imports of ball bearings from Thailand, as outlined in the ``CriticalCircumstances'' section of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Case History </ITAG>Since our notice of preliminary determination (53 FR 45334, November 9,1988), the following events have occurred. Respondents and petitioner requestedthat the final determinations in all of the antidumping duty investigationsof antifriction bearings (AFBs) be postponed until not later than 135 daysafter the date of publication of the preliminary determinations, pursuantto section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act. On December 2, 1988, we issued a noticepostponing our final determinations until not later than March 24, 1989(53 FR 49581, December 8, 1988). That notice also announced the schedulingof the public hearing in these investigations. Verification of the questionnaire responses of NMB Thai, Ltd. and PelmecThai, Ltd. (NMB/Pelmec Thai) was conducted in Thailand and the United Statesduring December 1988 and January 1989. A public hearing was held on February 17, 1989. Petitioner and respondentfiled pre-hearing briefs on February 15, 1989, and post-hearing briefson February 28, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule</T3> (HTS), and all merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date is nowclassified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). TheDepartment is providing both the appropriate <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated</T3> (TSUSA) item number(s)and the appropriate HTS item number(s) with its product descriptions forconvenience and Customs purposes. The Department's written descriptionof the products under investigation remains dispositive as to the scopeof the products covered by this investigation. This determination covers ball bearings, mounted or unmounted, and partsthereof (ball bearings). For a complete description of these products,see Appendix A to the ``Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than FairValue: Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and PartsThereof from the FRG'' (hereinafter referred to as Appendix A), which ispublished in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. <ITAG tagnum="84">Class or Kind of Merchandise </ITAG>Subsequent to the initiation of this investigation, the Department determinedthat the products under investigation constitute five separate classesor kinds of merchandise. After consideration of all comments, arguments,and information submitted by the parties, we find no reason to alter thatdecision. For a full discussion of our position on class or kind of merchandise,see Appendix B which is referred to below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Standing </ITAG>We determine that petitioner has standing with respect to each of the fiveclasses or kinds of merchandise described in Appendix A. For a full discussionof standing, see Appendix B which is referred to below. <ITAG tagnum="84">General Issues </ITAG>Appendix B to the ``Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value:Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereoffrom the Federal Republic of Germany'' (hereinafter referred to as AppendixB) contains detailed discussions of all issues timely raised by partiesto the proceeding in each of the concurrent antidumping duty investigationsinvolving AFBs from nine countries. The first part of that Appendix addressesall general issues raised during these investigations and our treatmentof these topics. The general issues discussed therein are listed below.1. Class or Kind of Merchandise 2. Standing 3. Products Covered 4. Basis for Cost of Production Investigations 5. Market Viability 6. Alternative Reporting Requirements 7. Critical Circumstances 8. Administrative Protective Order Issues Following the discussion of general issues, all remaining comments areaddressed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation </ITAG>The period of investigation (POI) is October 1, 1987 through March 31,1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons </ITAG>To determine whether sales of ball bearings from Thailand to the UnitedStates were made at less than fair value, we compared the United Statesprice to the foreign market value as specified in the ``United States Price''and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. For the reasons outlined in the ``Foreign Market Value'' section of thisnotice, in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, we have determinedthat use of the best information available is appropriate for NMB/PelmecThai. For purposes of this investigation, we have relied on verified constructedvalue information as the best information available.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price </ITAG>For those sales made directly to unrelated parties prior to importationinto the United States, we based the United States price on purchase price,in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act. In those cases where sales were made through a related sales agent in theUnited States to an unrelated purchaser prior to the date of importation,we also used purchase price as the basis for determining United Statesprice. For these sales, the Department determined that purchase price wasthe most appropriate determinant of United States price based on the followingelements: 1. The merchandise in question was shipped directly from the manufacturerto the unrelated buyer, without being introduced into the inventory ofa related selling agent; 2. This was the customary commercial channel for sales of this merchandisebetween the parties involved; and 3. The related selling agent located in the United States acted only asa processor of sales-related documentation and a communication link withthe unrelated U.S. buyer. Where all the above elements are met, we regard the routine selling functionsof the exporter as merely having been relocated geographically from thecountry of exportation to the United States, where the sales agent performsthem. Whether these functions take place in the United States or abroaddoes not change the substance of the transactions or the functions themselves.Where the sale to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importationinto the United States, we based United States price on exporter's salesprice (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. In order to meet the minimum reporting requirement of 33 percent (<T3>see</T3>, Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B),NMB/Pelmec Thai had to report both identical and similar home market matcheswhich we used in our fair value comparisons. We calculated ESP based onpacked, c.i.f., and delivered prices to unrelated customers in the UnitedStates. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for freight forwardingexpenses, marine insurance, U.S. duty, U.S. inland freight, and U.S. brokerageand handling expenses, in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act.We also made deductions, where appropriate, for discounts. We made furtherdeductions from ESP, where appropriate, for U.S. credit expenses and indirectselling expenses including advertising, warranty expenses, inventory carryingcosts, product liability expenses, and all other general indirect sellingexpenses pursuant to section 772(e) (1) and (2) of the Act. NMB/Pelmec Thai calculated the product liability expense based on the yearlyexpense. We recalculated this expense for the period of investigation basedon information obtained at verification. For inventory carrying costs, NMB/Pelmec Thai did not report the periodbetween production and transit in its calculation. We therefore includedthis period in our recalculation of this expense based on information obtainedat verification. (<T3>See</T3>, Credit and Inventory Carrying Costs section of Appendix B.)Due to minor clerical errors found at verification, we recalculated freightforwarding and indirect selling expenses incurred in Thailand and in theUnited States. During verification, we found that NMB/Pelmec Thai had purchase price saleswhich had been reported as ESP sales. Therefore, for purposes of this determination,we have treated those sales as purchase price. For purchase price transactions,we deducted from the gross unit price, where appropriate, freight forwardingexpenses, marine insurance, U.S. duty, U.S. inland freight, and U.S. brokerageand handling expenses in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act.We also made deductions, where appropriate, for discounts. <ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>Based on information reported in the questionnaire response, we preliminarilydetermined that the Thai home market was viable. However, during verificationwe found that NMB/Pelmec Thai had misreported three types of sales in itshome market database. These are: (1) Sales to Singapore which are re-importedinto Thailand; (2) bonded warehouse-to-bonded warehouse sales; and (3)cancelled sales. With respect to the sales to Singapore that were re-imported into Thailand,we found at verification that NMB/Pelmec Thai had knowledge that thesesales were ultimately destined for delivery and consumption in Thailand.However, knowledge is only one factor that we considered in determiningwhether these sales are appropriately home market or third country sales.We also considered the other, unusual circumstances surrounding these transactions.For example, because these sales were exempt from certain taxes and importduties associated with other home market sales, the prices of these saleswere not typical home market prices. In addition, the goods are physicallyexported from Thailand, and the first sale to an unrelated party takesplace in Singapore. Lastly, these sales earn export subsidies and are consideredexports by the Government of Thailand for purposes of maintaining exportstatistics. All of these factors combined outweigh the importance of knowledgeof the final destination in the determination of whether these sales areproperly considered home market or third country sales. Therefore, we havedetermined that these sales are appropriately considered third countrysales.A large percentage of NMB/Pelmec Thai's home market sales of ball bearingsare made from its own bonded warehouse to the bonded warehouse of a relatedoriginal equipment manufacturer (OEM) in Thailand. Bonded warehouses inThailand are by their very nature for exportation and, as such, bondedwarehouse sales between related parties cannot be considered domestic sales.Our treatment of these sales in this investigation is not inconsistentwith our treatment of these same sales in the concurrent countervailingduty investigation. In that case, we did not include such sales in ourcalculation of export subsidies because we could not determine with certaintythat the merchandise involved in these transactions was, in fact, exported.(<T3>See, DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 4 </T3>in the <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Partial CountervailingDuty Order: Ball Bearings and Parts Thereof from Thailand </T3>which ispublished in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.)With respect to certain other sales included in NMB/Pelmec Thai's homemarket database, we found at verification that these sales were cancelledand, therefore, should not have been reported.Excluding the sales exported to Singapore and re-imported into Thailand,the bonded warehouse-to-bonded warehouse sales, and the cancelled salesfrom the total volume of NMB/Pelmec Thai's home market sales, we determinethat the home market was not viable and, therefore, does not serve as theappropriate basis for foreign market value. (<T3>See </T3>also, Market Viability section of Appendix B.) In the absenceof a viable home market, our preference is to base foreign market valueon third country prices. However, because we did not determine until afterverification that the Thai home market was non-viable, we did not obtaininformation on NMB/Pelmec's third country sales. Therefore, as best informationavailable, we have relied on verified constructed value data to calculateforeign market value.We calculated the foreign market value based on constructed value in accordancewith section 773(e) of the Act. The constructed value included the materials,fabrication, general expenses, and profit. The constructed value submittedby NMB/Pelmec Thai was relied upon, except in the following instances wherethe costs were not appropriately quantified or valued. (1) The depreciationexpense was increased to reflect the economic useful life of assets. (2)The interest expense was adjusted by reducing the interest income reportedby the respondent for income which was not related to operations. (3) TheGandamp;A expenses were adjusted to reflect Gandamp;A expenses of corporateheadquarter operations which had not been fully allocated to the subsidiary.(4) The actual general expenses were used since these exceeded the statutoryminimum requirement of ten percent of materials and fabrication. (5) Imputedcredit and inventory carrying costs were included in selling expenses;therefore, the interest expense reflected on the companies' books was reducedfor a portion of the expense related to these activities in order to avoiddouble-counting.Because the home market is not viable, we do not have data representativeof home market profit to include in our constructed value calculations.However, had there been sufficient time left in the investigation to request,analyze, and verify data on sales to third countries, the Department wouldhave established foreign market value on the basis of third country salesin light of the non-viability of the Thai market. Since third country salesdata would otherwise have been used, the Department has determined it isappropriate to calculate profit based on the third country sales data whichis available. Consequently, in the absence of complete information on thirdcountry sales, we have used, as best information available, data pertainingto the sales to Singapore as the basis for calculating profit.For comparisons involving ESP transactions, we deducted all direct sellingexpenses from the constructed value. We made further deductions from theconstructed value for indirect selling expenses up to the amount of theESP cap. For comparisons involving purchase price transactions, we madean adjustment to constructed value pursuant to andSection; 353.15 of theCommerce Regulations for differences in circumstances of sale between thetwo markets. This adjustment was made for differences in credit expenses.We added U.S. packing to the constructed value for both purchase priceand ESP transactions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion</ITAG>For comparisons involving purchase price transactions, we made currencyconversions in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a)(1). For comparisons involvingESP transactions, we used the official exchange rates in effect on thedates of U.S. sales, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act, asamended by section 615 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. All currencyconversions were made at the rates certified by the Federal Reserve Bank.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances</ITAG>On August 1, 1988, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' existwith respect to imports of the subject merchandise from Thailand. Section735(a)(3) of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determinethat:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) (i) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise wasimported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.</ITAG>Pursuant to section 735(a)(3)(B), we generally consider the following factorsin determining whether imports have been massive over a relatively shortperiod of time: (1) The volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends(if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted forby imports.Because the Department's import data pertaining to the subject merchandiseare based on basket TSUSA categories, we requested specific data on shipmentsof the subject merchandise as the most appropriate basis for our determinationsof critical circumstances. Furthermore, we believe that company-specificcritical circumstances determinations better fulfill the objective of thecritical circumstances provision of deterring specific companies that maytry to increase imports massively prior to the suspension of liquidation.We have asked all respondents in each of the AFB investigations to supplymonthly volume shipment data from January 1986 through the present in orderfor the Department to base the critical circumstances determinations oncompany-specific data. Based on our analysis of the monthly shipment datasubmitted by NMB/Pelmec Thai, we have found that imports of ball bearingshave not been massive over a relatively short period of time. Therefore,we find that the requirements of section 735(a)(3)(B) have not been metand that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to imports ofball bearings from NMB/Pelmec Thai. <ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>We verified the information used in making our final determination in accordancewith section 776(b) of the Act. We used standard verification proceduresincluding examination of relevant accounting records and original sourcedocuments of the respondent. Our verification results are outlined in thepublic versions of the verification reports which are on file in the CentralRecords Unit (Room B-099) of the Main Commerce Building. <ITAG tagnum="84">Interested Party Comments </ITAG>As noted above, all comments raised by parties to the proceedings in theantidumping duty investigations on AFBs from nine countries are discussedin Appendix B. <ITAG tagnum="84">Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation </ITAG>We are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidationof all entries of the subject merchandise from Thailand, as defined inthe ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are entered,or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publicationof this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Normally, we would instruct the U.S. Customs Service to require a cashdeposit or the posting of a bond equal to the weighted-average amount bywhich the foreign market of ball bearings from Thailand exceeds the U.S.price, which in this investigation is 20.40 percent for NMB/Pelmec Thaiand all other manufacturers, producers, and exporters of ball bearingsfrom Thailand. However, Article VI.5 of the General Agreement of Tariffsand Trade provides that ``[n]o * * * product shall be subject to both antidumpingand countervailing duties to compensate for the same situation of dumpingor export subsidization.'' This provision is implemented by section 772(d)(l)(D)of the Act which prohibits assessing dumping duties on the portion of themargin attributable to an export subsidy, since there is no reason to requirea cash deposit or bond for that amount. Therefore, the bonding rate inthis investigation will be reduced by the rate attributable to the exportsubsidies found in the concurrent countervailing duty determination. Accordingly,for duty deposit purposes, the bonding rate is zero for NMB/Pelmec Thaiand all other manufacturers, producers, and exporters of ball bearingsfrom Thailand. The cash deposit or bonding rate established in the preliminary determinationshall remain in effect with respect to entries or withdrawals from warehousemade prior to the date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The suspension of liquidation will remain ineffect until further notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">ITC Notification </ITAG>In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the ITCof our determination. In addition, we are making available to the ITC allnonprivileged and nonproprietary information relating to this investigation.We will allow the ITC access to all privileged and business proprietaryinformation in our files, provided the ITC confirms that it will not disclosesuch information, either publicly or under administrative protective order,without the written consent of the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.If the ITC determines that material injury, or threat of material injury,does not exist with respect to the products under investigation, the proceedingwill be terminated and all securities posted as a result of the suspensionof liquidation will be refunded or cancelled. However, if the ITC determinesthat such injury does exist, the Department will issue an antidumping dutyorder. This determination is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act (19U.S.C. 1673d(d)).<ITAG tagnum="6">Jan W.
