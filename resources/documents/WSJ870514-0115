Mr. Keating's economic statement, three months ahead of the national budget's release in August, is designed to keep this year's deficit near the target of $2.5 billion, or 1.5% of gross domestic product, and reduce it to less than 1% next year, indicating a deficit as low as $1.42 billion. GDP measures a nation's output of goods and services, minus foreign income.    Mr. Keating said the measures will reduce growth in government spending to its lowest pace in 30 years. He said recurrent government spending will be trimmed $1.9 billion, of which $713.5 million is to come from reductions in federal grants to the states.    He said the government will raise $285.4 million by eliminating exemptions from sales tax and customs duty now granted to some government-owned enterprises. In addition, an estimated $713.5 million will come from the sale of government assets, including part of the Australian embassy site in Tokyo, leases of international airport terminals, a naval dockyard, a substantial part of a government aircraft factory, surplus defense property and government offices.    The market reaction to the government's spending plans was favorable. While the opposition criticized the government's spending plans for relying too heavily on one-time savings, rather than cuts in recurrent spending, business reaction was generally favorable.    Mr. Keating projected the country's economy would grow 2.5% in the next fiscal year, slightly faster than this year's 2% pace. He forecast consumer prices will rise 7.25% next year from the current inflation rate of about 9%, while the average unemployment rate will remain at the current level of about 8%. </TEXT></DOC>
