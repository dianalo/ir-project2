EPA is entering into the agreement under the authority of section 122(g)and 107 of CERCLA. Section 122(g) authorizes early settlements with <T3>de minimis </T3>parties to allow them to resolve their liabilitiesat Superfund sites without incurring substantial transaction costs. Underthis authority, the agreement proposes to settle with parties in the Cannonscase who are responsible for less than one percent of the waste volumeat each of the four sites with which they are associated. Settling Parties will be required to pay their volumetric shares of thegovernments' response costs at the four sites, including costs incurredby the government to date and the costs expected to be incurred at thesites in the future. Settling Parties will also be required to pay a settlement premium in additionto their respective volumetric shares of the expected response costs ateach site to compensate for the risks that are posed by settling beforeall costs are known. These settlement premium payments will total approimately2.08 times the Settling Parties' shares of the expected future costs atthe four sites. The amount of each Settling Party's premium payment iscalculated by multiplying .60 times the Party's volumetric share of thetotal response costs at the four sites. Finally, Settling Parties will be required to pay a base settlement chargeto reimburse the government for transaction costs incurred in conductingthe settlement negotiations leading up to this proposal.In exchange for these settlement payments, the governments covenant notto sue for further civil or administrative liabilities in connection withthe four Cannons sites. The covenant also extends to all federal and statenatural resource damage liabilities with the exception that Settling Partiesmay be called upon to fund assessments of damages to natural resourcesunder the trusteeship of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA) at the Bridgewater, Plymouth and Nashua sites if data gathered inthe next thirty months does not eliminate the need for damage assessments.The Environmental Protection Agency will receive written comments relatingto this agreement for thirty days from the date of publication of thisnotice.A copy of the proposed administrative settlement agreement may be obtainedin person or by mail from the EPA's Region I Office of Regional Counsel,J.F.K. Federal Building, Boston, Massachusetts, 02203.
