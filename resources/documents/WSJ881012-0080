Mr. Tartikoff has been NBC Entertainment president since 1980, the longest tenure of any TV executive in such a post. He had been widely rumored to be planning to leave NBC to run a production company in the next two years.    NBC also signed new contracts with four of Mr. Tartikoff's lieutenants, including Warren Littlefield, the No. 2 executive in the entertainment division, and John Miller, the advertising vice president.    Mr. Tartikoff is credited along with former NBC president Grant Tinker with pushing NBC from last to first place in the ratings by relying on high-quality shows that took a long time to build an audience.    NBC also announced the creation of a new group, headed by Mr. Tartikoff, to coordinate programming among the sports, news, stations and entertainment divisions. The group will include NBC Sports President Arthur Watson and News President Michael Gartner. </TEXT></DOC>
