However, Seifert said that in all likelihood Young will be out longer.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  YOUNG OUT AT LEAST 2 MORE WEEKS, BUT SEIFERTEXPECTS IT TO BE LONGER  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Seifert said he will decide Saturday morning if Young will be placed oninjured reserve and whom the team will sign as a third quarterback behindSteve Bono and rookie Bill Musgrave.;   Young -- who injured the medialcollateral ligament in his left knee Sunday against Atlanta -- was examinedThursday and will be re-examined today, when the stabilizing cast he iswearing will be removed. A decision on arthroscopic surgery may be madetoday.;   The likely scenario is that a player such as rookie linebacker JohnJohnson (who has a neck injury) will be placed on injured reserve Saturday toopen a roster spot for Musgrave and that Young -- regardless of surgery --will be placed on injured reserve to open up a spot for a veteran quarterback,who would be signed Monday.;   The 49ers should get some help Sunday from anexperienced quarterback. Seifert said Joe Montana will be in New Orleans andmay signal in plays from the sideline. Montana, who had elbow surgery a monthago, is wearing a flexible cast that should allow him to relay signals.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ANN KILLION, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911108  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  249  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, November 8, 199100313027,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
