A House-Senate conference committee, finishing its work with twomarathon sessions lasting late into the evening, decided Thursdaynight to reject Bush's complex plan to exclude $50 billion inrescue spending from the deficit.   Bush, asked at a news conference today about the Sandamp;Llegislation, said every day the Sandamp;L crisis remains unresolved,``it's costing Americans. Some estimates have been $10 million to$30 million dollars a day.''   Asked if he could foresee any need to veto Sandamp;L legislation, Bushsaid, ``It won't come to vetoing the Sandamp;L because we have 40-plusvotes in the Senate that, staying firm, will see our proposalprevail. The House, as you know, has disagreed with us, but I'mconfident that we will do all right on that one.''   The agreement sends the legislation to the full House and Senatefor votes next week. However, the Bush administration has raisedobjections and senators warned that Republicans could block theplan in the Senate.   Nearly six months ago, Bush asked Congress for emergency actionto close or rescue hundreds of failed, but still-operating, savingsinstitutions.   Under the compromise, the government's largest-ever bailoutwould involve spending $166 billion, including interest, over thenext 10 years _ the vast majority of it from taxpayers.   The bill includes a number of provisions to prevent a recurrenceof what analysts call the worst financial crisis since theDepression.   It requires Sandamp;L owners to risk more of their own capital toabsorb losses before government deposit insurance kicks in. Sandamp;Lswould have to devote more of their assets to financing housing anddisclose how well they serve minorities and the poor. They alsowould be prevented from using deposits to invest in high-yield,high-risk junk bonds.   The bill would enact the most sweeping restructuring of theregulatory bureaucracy since the 1930s. It would dismantle the Sandamp;Lagency, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, dividing its dutiesbetween an office in the Treasury Department and the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp., now solely a bank regulator.   The conferees decided to defy Bush on his funding proposal.   The administration argued that the Democratic plan, whichinflates the budget deficit but exempts it from triggeringautomatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law, will inspire acongressional spending spree on other programs.   Democrats, however, say their plan allows the government toborrow the needed Sandamp;L money at a lower cost and is a more honestway to account for the spending.   The five-member Senate delegation had been split 3-2 in favor ofthe Bush plan, with Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., joining the twoRepublicans on the panel.   But, after 5{ hours of debate and the House rejection of aSenate compromise offer, Cranston shifted his position and joinedSens. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., inaccepting the House plan.   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., chided his fellow conferees foreffectively postponing the difficult question.   ``It will result, I fear, in a stalemate, not in thisconference, but on the Senate floor,'' he said.   Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, an ardent opponent of the Housefunding plan, says he has the support of 40 other Republicans,enough to block the compromise package under that chamber's rules.   And even if the full Senate goes along with the House, Bush'sadvisers have threatened to recommend a veto.   White House Budget Director Richard Darman told reportersThursday that he favors a veto, joining Treasury Secretary NicholasF. Brady who has previously threatened to push for one.   Brady, however, stopped short of such a threat in commenting onthe agreement, which he called ``an excellent product.''   But, he added, ``The administration's position on financing isperfectly clear and remains unchanged. We continue to activelyoppose the House financing plan which requires a Gramm-Rudmanwaiver.''   Riegle noted that Sandamp;L losses are mounting at a rate of $20million a day and warned against holding up the badly needed billuntil after Congress returns from its August vacation.   House Democrats gave in to Cranston's plea to let the topfederal Sandamp;L regulator, M. Danny Wall, stay in his job withoutSenate reconfirmation.   At confirmation hearings, Wall would be sure to face questionsabout his role in delaying regulatory action against LincolnSavings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., which has sincefailed and likely will require millions of dollars in governmentaid.   Such questions would be uncomfortable for Cranston and Rieglebecause they accepted campaign contributions from Lincoln's owner,Charles Keating, and later intervened with regulators on Lincoln'sbehalf. Riegle has since returned Keating's contribution, butCranston has not.</TEXT></DOC>
