Garcia</HL><DD> 06/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices rallied yesterday, following gains in the bond market and the dollar.    The stage for the advance was set by trading in Tokyo overnight and in Europe early yesterday. Although bond prices and the dollar plunged Tuesday on news that Paul Volcker was stepping down and Alan Greenspan would succeed him as Federal Reserve Board chairman, foreign investors bought U.S. bonds and dollars. U.S. stocks also moved higher in foreign trading.    &quot;We had the 'Paul Volcker-isn't-dispensible decline' on Tuesday,&quot; said Larry Wachtel, a market strategist with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. &quot;And we had the 'Alan Greenspan-isn't-so-bad rally'&quot; yesterday, he said.    &quot;The pronouncements from Washington seem to indicate that it will be business as usual with Greenspan at the Fed,&quot; said Gerald Simmons, a managing director with Smith Barney Harris Upham in New York.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 42.47 points to 2320.69, faring better than the broader market indexes. Traders said demand by U.S. institutional investors was scattered, but they were interested in buying technology, drug, retailing, bank, chemical and paper stocks, among others.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.01 to 293.47, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index moved up 2.50 to 165.27.    Advancers outpaced losers on the New York Stock Exchange, with a better than 2-to-1 lead, as volume rose to 164.2 million shares from 153.4 million Tuesday.    James Andrews, head of institutional equity trading at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, said his clients were relieved that the uncertainty over whether Mr. Volcker would be replaced as Fed chairman had been removed from the market.    Because yesterday's volume was far from the robust levels of early 1987 and advancing issues didn't have an overwhelming lead over decliners, Mr. Wachtel didn't call the advance the start of a new rally. He would like to see one or two more sessions of higher prices before becoming convinced.    John Connolly, a portfolio strategist with Dean Witter Reynolds, said Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief that foreign reaction to the Greenspan appointment has been positive so far.    But he said that the current high level of interest rates could affect the stock market. Mr. Connolly fears the longer that bond yields stay at lofty levels, the more pressure there is for lower-yielding stocks to give ground.    Technology stocks were among yesterday's star performers, but Hewlett-Packard and Control Data failed to join the pack.    Control Data sank 2 5/8 to 29 1/4 on trading of more than 1.2 million shares. The computer maker said its 1987 profit should be $20 million to $25 million lower than originally expected. In 1986, Control Data had a loss of $264.5 million on revenue of $3.35 billion.    Hewlett-Packard fell 1 7/8 to 62 1/8 in active trading. Morgan Stanley's Carol Muratore was said to have changed her recommendation on the stock to sell from neutral.    Cray Research slid 5 5/8 to 92 3/4. Company officials said the decline might have been triggered by comments from Chairman John Rollwagen at a Sanford C. Bernstein meeting in New York. Mr. Rollwagen said that analysts' earnings estimates for the company were &quot;too high.&quot; He was repeating comments that he made at Cray's annual meeting May 19.    Retailing stocks posted hefty gains. Dayton Hudson rose 2 7/8 to 50 5/8 on more than 2.2 million shares. DeBartolo Corp. denied rumors that it was accumulating Dayton Hudson stock.    J.C. Penney rose 1 1/8 to 51 1/2, K mart added 1 3/8 to 60 3/8, Federated Department Stores advanced 3/4 to 46 1/4, F.W. Woolworth gained 1 1/8 to 49 1/4 and Sears Roebuck moved up 1 1/4 to 51 1/4.    Oil stocks weren't left out of the rally. Crude oil prices in the futures market rose, with the July contract up 17 cents to $19.86 a barrel.    Auto stocks were higher, with General Motors up 2 to 86 3/8, Ford ahead 3 1/4 to 94 5/8 and Chrysler up 1 1/8 to 35 1/2. Auto sales in late May fell 1.9% on a daily-rate basis. There were eight days in the latest period and nine a year earlier.    Southland Corp. rose 4 1/4 to 58. There were continued takeover speculation about this company. But the company said it wasn't aware of any reason for the increase.    Gold and mining stocks gave up some of the gains they posted Tuesday in the wake of the Greenspan nomination.    Eastman Kodak moved up 2 to 79. Kodak unveiled a family of products that allow capturing and storing images on floppy disks instead of film. The products are intended for commercial and professional use. The company also plans to reduce its product line 30% by 1989.    Du Pont gained 2 3/8 to 113 3/4. A Du Pont unit and Molecular Biosystems introduced a test for detection of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus. Molecular Biosystems rose 1 1/2 to 13 1/2.    Morse Shoe jumped 4 1/8 to 46 1/2. The company agreed to a management-led buyout at $47 a share.    Other shoe company stocks moved up in sympathy with Morse. Stride Rite gained 1 1/2 to 37 1/2 and Shaer Shoe rose 3/4 to 16 1/4. Shaer reported its earnings jumped to 52 cents a share from one cent for the second quarter ended April 30.    Wickes rose 1/4 to 4 with more than 7.1 million shares changing hands on the American Stock Exchange. The stock was recommended by E.F. Hutton.    Gulf andamp; Western added 1 5/8 to 84 1/2. Traders noted the good reviews for the company's latest movie, &quot;The Untouchables.&quot; Smith Barney raised its earnings estimates for Gulf andamp; Western based on strong revenues from &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II,&quot; which opened a few weeks ago.    Gillette closed up 1/4 to 32 1/2 on more than three million shares after trading as high as 33 7/8 early yesterday. Shearson Lehman Brother analyst Andrew Shore attributed the surge in Gillette in the past two sessions to buying by Japanese investors in anticipation of the stock being listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Speculation that a suitor might emerge further drove up the price, he added. The company confirmed that it is planning to file an application to be listed on the Tokyo exchange.    Harcourt Brace Jovanovich's when-issued shares began trading, moving up 1 1/8 to 10 1/4 on more than 3.6 million shares. These shares represent value of the Harcourt stock after the company distributes a $40-a-share special dividend to shareholders, one step in a complex recapitalization plan adopted nearly two weeks ago. Harcourt's regular shares rose 1 1/2 to 58 1/8 in heavy trading.    Becor Western moved up 1/2 to 14 3/4 in active trading. The company said it is uncertain whether it will ask its shareholders to vote on a proposed leveraged buyout led by management and Goldman Sachs because of a competing offer from Lynch. </TEXT></DOC>
