Inc. announced a joint marketing program under which Visa cardholders can use their account numbers to place long-distance calls.    The companies said the program, called VisaPhone, eliminates the need for a separate calling card. VisaPhone charges will appear as a line item on a customer's monthly Visa statement, and MCI separately will mail details of each call.    MCI said that both domestic and international calls will be billed at standard MCI rates as well as special discount rates for residential and small-business customers who subscribe to the PrimeTime and Supersaver calling plans. MCI and Visa wouldn't disclose the potential value of their alliance.    In recent months, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., which has issued 40 million of its own ATandamp;T calling cards, has been studying several ways to enhance them, including using the cards as a joint telephone and general credit card. A spokesman said a decision hasn't yet been made.    MCI and Visa are planning to introduce the service in phases, beginning in October. Initially, MCI along with banks that issue Visa cards will be selecting 30 million top-rated cardholders for a six-month pilot. The companies are especially interested in cardholders who travel a lot and are likely to use the calling-card service while on the road. To reach this market, the companies are relying on highly targeted direct mail, according to Timothy Price, MCI's vice president of sales.    The companies then anticipate making the VisaPhone service available to all 120 million U.S. cardholders in the first half of 1990, and toward the end of 1990 will begin mass merchandising the service. MCI figures it will step up its marketing as the program is rolled out, expanding to telemarketing, print and television ads.    MCI already has an arrangement with American Express under which customers' long-distance calls from the home phone and from the MCI calling card can be billed through American Express. Mr. Price wouldn't say whether MCI plans to expand that service along the lines of VisaPhone, but he added that &quot;there is nothing exclusive&quot; about the arrangement with Visa.    MCI expects a hefty boost in its own customer base from the Visa arrangement. Mr. Price said that 60% of customers who use MCI through other calling programs have signed up for MCI residential service, and he expects the Visa link to encourage similar migration to MCI residential service.    Beyond that, the technology used to integrate Visa's financial network and MCI's phone network could be applied to other payment systems, Mr. Price said. </TEXT></DOC>
