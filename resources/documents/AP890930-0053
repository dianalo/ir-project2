King Fahd, in an opening address read by Foreign Minister PrinceSaud al Fasisal, called on the Christian and Moslem lawmakers toset aside their differences and end fighting that has killed morethan 150,000 people.   ``Now that the situation has shifted from the arena of warriorsto the negotiators' table, it is high time we moved from tradingartillery shells and accusations to hasten the peacemaking,'' theking's message said.   Fahd is a member of a three-nation committee mandated by the22-member Arab League to end the bloodletting and reconcileLebanon's feuding factions.   An Arab League-sponsored peace plan included a Sept. 22cease-fire that ended the latest round of fighting between Syrianforces and Christian army units under Gen. Michel Aoun, who headsthe Christian Cabinet. More than 920 people have died in the lastsix months of intensive shelling in Lebanon.   Fahd, King Hassan II of Morocco and President Chadli Bendjedidof Algeria formulated the seven-point peace plan that includes a``national reconciliation charter'' of political reforms that theLebanese parliamentarians will debate.   The Fahd speech delivered at the Conference Palace in thismountain resort said the blueprint is ``a realistic and practicalbasis for a solution'' to the conflict that broke out in 1975.   The Taif meeting is the first by Lebanon's parliament outsidethe country.   By holding the talks on neutral ground, the Arab League hassought to reduce sectarian pressures on the legislators which havebeen a major factor in the collapse of earlier initiatives.   The Fahd message to the parliamentarians said: ``The night ofLebanon's tragedy has gone on much too long, and the dawn ... willcome sooner or later. The decision is up to you. Lebanon and allLebanese will be the winners if you agree among yourselves. Theworld is closely following your historic meeting.''   Some of the Lebanese deputies who arrived in Taif late Fridaysaid the meeting would last three-to-10 days.   Conference sources said 63 of Lebanon's 73 surviving legislators_ 33 Christians and 30 Moslems _ were attending the Taifconference. Three Shiite Moslem and seven Christian deputies failedto show up.   ``No one has refused to come, but some gave medical reasons fornot attending,'' Saud said.   Twenty-five of the deputies in the 99-seat Parliament have beenkilled or died of natural causes since the last elections in 1972.Another seat was held by Amin Gemayel, whose six-year term aspresident expired on Sept. 22, 1988. The war has preventedelections since then and Lebanon has no head of state.   Christian-Moslem differences split the government into the rivalcamps.   Before the deputies left the Lebanese capital Beirut on Friday,Lebanon's acting prime minister, Salim Hoss, said the Taif meeting``could be the last chance for peace in Lebanon.''   Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini told reporters upon arrivingin Taif: ``We are determined to reach a unified concept on theissue of political reform to achieve national reconciliation.''   While agreeing to the meeting, Christians said they would notdiscuss political reform unless Syria agreed to a timetable forwithdrawing its 40,000 troops from Lebanon. They arrived under a1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate but soon allied with Moslemmilitias in fighting the Christians.   Syria has said it will not consider a withdrawal until a unitedgovernment emerges in Lebanon and the Moslems are given a largershare of power in constitutional reforms.   The proposed reforms call for Lebanon's Maronites, the dominantChristian sect, to surrender the privileges they have held sinceindependence from France in 1943. They would share power equallywith the country's Moslems.   In 1943, the Christians were considered the majority. ButMoslems now comprise an estimated 55 percent of Lebanon's 4 millionpeople.   The latest outbreak in fighting began in March, when Aounblockaded illegal militia-run ports saying they deprived the stateof more than $100 million yearly in lost revenues. TheSyrian-Moslem alliance responded by blockading the 310-square-mileChristian enclave in and around Beirut.</TEXT></DOC>
