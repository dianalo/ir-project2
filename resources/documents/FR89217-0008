The first change makes it clear that, if a state member bankhas filed its Report of Condition and Income (``Call Report'') electronically,the signatures on the published copy of the Call Report must be the sameas the signatures on the hard copy retained in the bank's files. The secondchange replaces the current requirement that a state member bank submita certification of publication to its Reserve Bank with a requirement thatit retain a copy of its published Call Report in its files and make itavailable to examiners upon request. The last change deletes outdated referencesin Regulation H to a report form concerning state member bank affiliates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>March 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Rhoger H. Pugh, Manager (202/728-5883),Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation; for users of the TelecommunicationsDevice for the Deaf (TDD) only, Earnestine Hill or Dorothea Thompson (202/452-3544);Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20th and ConstitutionAvenue NW., Washington, DC 20551.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In order to reduce processing timeand expense as well as paperwork burdens, the federal banking regulationsallow banks to file their Call Reports electronically provided the banksretain a signed hard copy of each Call Report submitted in electronic form.This policy has rendered certain Call Report publication requirements containedin the Board's Regulation H (12 CFR Part 208) contradictory or inappropriate.The Board is adjusting the publication requirements and related provisionsin its Regulation H to account for electronic submission of the Call Report.Currently, andSection; 208.10(a)(3) of Regulation H requires that all signaturesin the published copy of a state member bank's Call Report be the sameas those on the original Report filed with its Federal Reserve Bank althoughthe signatures on the printed staement may be typewritten or otherwisecopied. Because the electronic copy of the Call Report does not have actualsignatures, a state member bank filing electronically cannot technicallysatisfy this requirement. Therefore, the Board is amending andSection; 208.10(a)to require that, in the case of a state member bank filing its Call Reportelectronically, the signatures in the published copy be the same as thoseon the hard copy of the Call Report retained by the state member bank.Currently, andSection; 208.10(a)(4) of Regulation H requires that each statemember bank must submit to its Federal Reserve Bank a copy of the publishedCall Report attached to a certificate of publication. This submission isused to ensure that each state member bank publishes its Call Report asrequired. The published copy is in a form prescribed or endorsed by theFederal Reserve and duplicates the original copy (either in electroniccopy or hard copy form) which each state member bank must submit to itsFederal Reserve Bank. To reduce the burden caused by duplicative filings,both hard copy and electronic copy, the Board is deleting the requirementthat banks must submit the published version of their Call Reports andto replace it with a requirement that each state member bank retain a copyof the published Call Report in its files to be made available to examinersupon request.Currently, andSection; 208.10(b)(2) and (3) of Regulation H specifies thatpublished reports of affiliates should appear, when requested by the Board,on information collection forms that have expired. The Board is removingreferences to the obsolete forms.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.
