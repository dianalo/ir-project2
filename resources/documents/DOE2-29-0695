For most of thesecountries, energy is oil based, with consequent high costs. Their smallsize tends to mean such energy is inefficiently used, partly due to aninability to use economies of scale. Uses of this energy include transportfuel, low-grade energy for crop drying and industrial processes, anddiesel electric power generation. Overall, little electricity is used,or available, yet the electricity cost is disproportionately high. Trinidad,with its oil resources, is an exception. Nevertheless, all the islandshave possible alternative energy sources that have not been exploitedto any great extent. 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
