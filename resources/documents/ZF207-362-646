 In fact, ina number of areas, an incredible amount has happened since our last majorconference, the Desktop Publishing Conference.andM;Because the March Seybold Seminars focus on &quot;professional,&quot; &quot;high-end&quot;applications, we cover most of the discussions and product demonstrations inour companion Seybold Report on Publishing Systems.andP;  In this issue we willsummarize only highlights that we think will be of particular interest toReport on Desktop Publishing readers.andM;Seminar basics.andP;  This year's March seinars consisted of two back-to-backsessions.andP;  A three-day seminar focusing on industry-wide issues was followedby two concurrent application-oriented two-day seminars: one for producers oflong documents and the other for newspapers and magazines.andP;  In addition, some65 companies were invited to demonstrate new and/or prototype products.andM;In all, some 1,135 people attended the three-day session and 950 attended theapplication session.andP;  Approximately 3,000 seminar attendees, press,exhibitors and exhibitor guests attended the equipment demonstrations.andM;Seminar themes.andP;  The topics that attracted the most attention during the weekincluded:andM;*A major change in the landscape on PostScript and font issues.andP;  The worldsuddenly looks very different from the way it did after the SeptemberConference.andP;  There were important developments from almost every player inthe font/page description melee.andM;* A great deal of interest (and some progress) in low- and mid-range color.andO;High-end vs.andP;  &quot;good enough&quot; color debates stirred a fair amount of heat onboth sides of the issue.andP;  Here als o there were important developments--andsome very important issues raised.andM;* Considerable interest in means of customizing programs to the requirementsof a particular application.andP;  Both system developers and users talked aboutthe importance of users customizing systems to their requirements.andM;* Quickening interest in and significant progress in electronic distributionof information.andP;  &quot;Publishing without paper&quot; is finally becoming real.andM;* An acceptance that for better or worse the Department of Defense CALSinitiative will shape the long-document market.andP;  CALS will reach far beyondthe defense industries.andM;* Almost complete acceptance of the &quot;fourth wave&quot; concept.andP;  Every high-endvendor and almost every user now accepts that future publishing systems ofall sizes and shapes will be built on mainstream computing platforms ratherthan on proprietary, turnkey hardware/software systems.andM;* Surprising consensus on how publishing systems will be built anddistributed.andP;  Almost everyone now envisages a three-tiered publishing systemsindustry: (1) retail distribution; (2) value-added resellers and customintegrators; and (3) system companies that assemble systems making extensiveuse of software modules purchased from a variety of sources.andM;Disagreement.andP;  There was also a key area of disagreement: to what extent isall of publishing driven from the desktop?andM;Coverage.andP;  As mentioned above, we will discuss all of these topics in greaterdepth in the next two issues of The Seybold Report on Publishing Systems.andP;  Inthe meantime, we will summarize in this Report some of the crucial aspects ofthe PostScript/font and color discussions.andP;  We will also have a few commentsabout the question of the extent to which publishing is driven from thedesktop.andM;The challenges to PostScriptandM;If there is one thing that everyoine in the publishing industry is agreed on,it is that PostScript is the dominant fact of life for imaging devices.andP;  Itis widely criticized for its slowness, and it is sneered at for its handlingof color screens at certain angles.andP;  But everyone uses it, and no one daresignore it.andP;  Every vendor that doesn't already use PostSCript has plans forincorporating PostSCript into its product line (though some vendors are stillnot ready to announce their plans).andP;  Alternative page description languageslike Interpress and PCL, although they might once have looked likechallengers, are now relegated to low-end or niche markets.andP;  To allappearances, PostScript has become fundamental technology for the publishingindustry.andM;Or has it?andP;  Although the publishing industry has gone for PostScript in a bigway, the computer industry is still debating the question.andP;  Everyone is nowcoming to realize that you really want to use the same imaging model (and thesame fonts!) for screen display and for output.andP;  If you do not do this, youwill inevitably have disparities between what you see on the screen and whatyou get on hard-copy output.andP;  You will also pay a price in the extraprocessing overhead involved in converting one imaging model into another.andM;Screen imaging models.andP;  There are two ways that you can get the same imagingmodel for screen and output: you can drive the output imaging model back tothe screen, or you can drive the screen imaging model out to the printer.andO;Adobe has done the former with Display PostScript.andP;  As we have beenpredicting for some time, Microsoft and Apple are doing the latter by turningtheir respective screen imaging models into output printer languages.andM;PCL Level 5.andP;  The other factor that must be considered is, of course, thelong-awaited Level 5 extension to Hewlett-Packard's PCL LaserJet commandlanguage.andP;  As important as PostScript is for publishing, PCL printes (most ofwhich are used for relatively straightforward office tasks) greatly outsellPostScript printers.andP;  And, largely for cost/performance reasons, a lot ofusers publish on PCL printers.andM;When PCL finally gets scalable fonts and support for HPGL graphics it willbecome a much more credible language for less demanding publishingapplications.andP;  The installed base will make it impossible to ignore.andM;Driven from the desktop.andP;  Cal Bauer, president of Bauer Enterprises, createda storm of controversy among the high-end publishing crowd attending theSeminars when he challenged the publishing industry to recognize thathigh-end publishing, although a specialized application in its own right, isdriven by what people are doing on their desktops.andP;  The standards of theoffice become the standards of the publishing industry, not the other wayaround.andP;  The reasons are simple.andM;* Cost.andP;  For the foreseeable future, the lowest-cost publishing systems (atevery level of quality) will be developed using mass-marketcomponents--desktop computers designed for office use.andP;  These systems willalso use specialized equipment where there are no good mass-market solutions,but that will be less and less necessary.andP;  System vendors (and theircustomers) who ignore this reality face a competitive disadvantage.andM;* Customers.andP;  Those segments of the publishing industry that take in workfrom customers must accept the data formats that their customers are using.andO;If a customer has proofed his work on a low-cost laser printer, the high-endsystem must match that result--not because it is &quot;correct,&quot; but because it iswhat the customer expects.andM;The playing field for this contest is the entire desktop computer industry;publishing in only one small corner of it.andP;  The major players will beMicrosoft, Apple, Sun and (we think) Next.andM;The publishing industry is perhaps not yet accustomed to seeing itself as asegment of the larger computer industry.andP;  There are still many who seepublishing as a separate industry, even as a craft all its own.andP;  We agreewith Bauer that this no longer is the true state of affairs.andM;But publishing does have a critical role to play in the computer industry,because it is a demanding application that pushes the limits of thetechnology.andP;  In the coming contest, the industry will need to assure that theimaging models that ultimately win are adequate to the requirements ofhigh-quality publishing.andM;Apple QuickDrawandM;We believe that it was Steve Jobs who first convinced Adobe to go into thepage description language business.andP;  It was certainly Apple that madePostScript a publishing standard; it became one because Apple introduced areasonably priced laser printer that had text and graphics capabilities thatalmost no high-end typesetter or imagesetter could match.andM;Linotype wisely decided to make a high-resolution version of the LaserWriterfor applications needing higher quality, which meant that people could relyon the LaserWriter as a proofer.andP;  this established a set of expectations thatcould only be met by using PostScript applications and PostScript printers.andM;However, since Jobs left, Apple has become increasingly less single-minded inits support for PostScript.andP;  It has concentrated instead on enhancing its ownQuickDraw screen imaging software.andP;  It has already indicated that it will beadding support for 24-bit color to QuickDraw this spring.andP;  At the Seminar,Apple indicated that it will also add (at a later date) support for scalableoutline fonts.andP;  This will make QuickDraw a much more attractive language foroutput as well as screen display.andM;Apple has already released a QuickDraw laser printer.andP;  Unfortunately, all theLaserWriter IISC has done in the publishing arena is point up how limitedQuickDraw now is.andP;  But as QuickDraw gets better, it will become more viableas an alternative to PostScript.andP;  By next year, we expect that users who liveentirely within an Apple world will find QuickDraw output devicesincreasingly attractive alternatives to PostScript.andP;  This could, in fact, getrather messy.andP;  Apply users may have to pay close attention to what fonts(PostScript or QuickDraw) were used to produce which documents.andP;  (More onthis--and the likely way out--later.)andM;Microsoft GPIandM;When Microsoft designed OS/2 and Presentation Manager, it assumed that itwould have to cope with a wide variety of display screens and output devices.andO;It therefore took pains to isolate the application software developer fromspecific display devices.andP;  The application software developer writes to thePresentation Manager Graphic Presentation Interface (GPI).andP;  &quot;Device drivers&quot;written by the manufacturers of the various devices (screens, printers, etc.)andO;translate GPI commands into the specific commands required to drive theirdevices.andP;  (Microsoft Windows for MS-DOS has a similar approach, but it uses asimpler Graphic Device Interface [DGI] graphic language.)andM;Writing good device drivers turned out to be a lot more difficult thanMicrosoft had anticipated, so it has enlisted the help of Bauer Enterprises.andO;Bauer has developed a toolkit that makes it far easier to write MicrosoftWindows (MS-DOS) and Presentation Manager (OS/2) device drivers.andP;  It willsell this toolkit to people who want to prepare device drivers to supportspecific devices.andP;  Then Bauer will test and certify the results.andP;  Driversthat pass Bauer certification will be distributed by Microsoft.andM;Exiting devices.andP;  GPI is necessarily independent of any particularresolution, since it must support Hercules, CGA, VGA, Moniterm Viking and ahost of other PC displays, as well as all the printer types that anyone mighttry to hook up.andP;  In fact, Presentation Manager makes no assumptions about anycapabilities of the device it is driving.andP;  Rather, it can query the printeror screen (through its driver software) about its capabilities and thenrender images accordingly.andM;This provides an interesting contrast with Adobe's position on PostScript,which is that every PostScript device must implement the full PostScriptlanguage.andP;  This stance virtually guarantees that PostScript will be reservedfor top-of-the-line products, while Microsoft's approach spans all marketlevels.andM;Scalable fonts, dumb devices.andP;  In order to provide greater functionality forlow-end raster devices (dot-matrix printers and inexpensive laser printers),Bauer will build into its toolkit support for outline-to-bitmap font scalingroutines and the ability to print the font bit maps generated by theseroutines in graphic mode on a dot-matrix or laser printer, or to downloadcharacter bit maps to a laser printer that supports this.andM;GPI native mode.andP;  In addition, Microsoft is currently working with severalprinter manufacturers who are developing printers that can interpret nativeGPI format data.andP;  If OS/2-Presentation Manager does become as important inthe office and publishing markets as we expect, native-mode GPI printers arealmost inevitable.andM;GPI shortcomings.andP;  At the moment, GPI has several shortcomings as a printerlanguage (and as a truly flexible screen imaging language).andP;  The most seriousof these is that, like the current implementation of Apple QuickDraw, itrequires pre-sized bit-mapped fonts.andP;  It has no means of dealing withresolution-independent outline fonts and/or scaling fonts.andP;  It is also waybehind PostScript in such crucial areas as support for halftoning ofcontinuous-tone images and color images.andM;These shortcomings, combined with the fact that the Microsoft managersresponsible for OS/2 and Presentation Manager clearly do not understandeither the font or the graphic issues, led many Seminar attendees to concludethat GPI is hopelessly behind PostScript as an imaging language for seriouspublishing applications.andM;We think that it would be terribly short-sighted to write GPI off socavalierly.andP;  Microsoft is rapidly becoming aware of what it needs to do, andit is now moving rapidly to address the font issues in particular.andP;  At theconference, it issued what amounted to an open &quot;let's talk&quot; invitation to allcompanies with font technology.andP;  One font technology vendor commented to us:&quot;At this Seminar, scalable fonts moved from 'this is a problem we have toaddress some time' to 'this is an urgent priority' on Microsoft's prioritylist.&quot;andM;GPI printers.andP;  Since Microsoft has not yet selected any font technology, theinitial GPI laser printers will have to solve this problem on their own.andP;  QMSis expected to have one of the first such devices (see p. 27).andP;  Since QMSowns Imagen, we expect that QMS will use the Imagen font technology in itsprinter.andP;  (Imagen, by the way, holds license rights to use the Linotype fontlibrary.)andM;Hewlett-Packard PCL Level 5andM;HP admitted at the Desktop Publishing Conference in September 1987 that iswas working on a &quot;Level 5&quot; extension to its Printer Command Language (PCL).andO;This will include support for HPGL vector graphics and Compugraphic fontscaling technology.andM;PCL Level 5 is still not available.andP;  When it is, it will offer a relativelystraightforward upgrade path for the hundreds of thousands of LaserJet users.andO;Compugraphic has also said that it will offer compatible PCL Level 5typesetters.andP;  Since it now offers Adobe PostScript as well, CG is banking onthe expectation that service operations who process input from desktopsystems will need to be compatible with both the LaserWriter (PostScript) andthe LaserJet (PCL Level 5).andM;However, the additional capabilities of PCL Level 5 may well require moreprocessing power and/or more memory (and hence higher cost) in a PCLcontroller.andP;  Until the language and the upgrade path are announced, it willbe unclear exactly how much impact PCL Level 5 will have on the market.andM;PostScriptandM;Adobe, of course, is not sitting still.andP;  It continues to enhance PostScript.andO;And it continues to add licensees.andP;  At the Seminars it announced:andM;1.andP;  Linotype's Saturn.andP;  Linotype announced the RIP III PostScript controller(also called the Saturn controller) for L200P, L300 and L500 imagesetters.andO;It is not exactly a quantum leap upward in speed, since it is based on a68020, as is the current Atlas design.andP;  But it will roughly double (in somecases, even triple) the processing speed for halftones, due tobetter-optimized algorithms and larger working memory.andP;  Linotype points outthat halftoning speed is especially critical in processing color separationfilms.andM;The Adobe algorithms for processing text and line graphics had already beenfairly well optimized in the Atlas controller, so little improvement will befound there.andM;2.andP;  RISC processors.andP;  Adobe does have high-speed PostScript controllers basedon several different RISC processors.andP;  (Only Weitek was mentioned by name.)andM;We consider this to be very significant.andP;  Adobe implementations running onhigh-speed processors such as the Weitek chips would significantly undercutthe position of clones that are relying on Weitek (or other RISC chipimplementations) for their competitive advantage.andM;3.andP;  Font library.andP;  Adobe announced that it has licensed Monotype,Compugraphic and Varityper to prepare fonts in PostScript format.andP;  Thisshould open up the Adobe font library considerably and address one of themost oft-voiced user requests.andM;We will discuss this in more detail shortly when we turn our attention totype fonts.andM;4.andP;  Font character sets.andP;  Adobe also announced that two new Adobe Originaltype fonts will be available in a much larger &quot;professional&quot; character setthat will include fractions, small caps, old style nnumbers and ligatures.andM;5.andP;  Color improvements.andP;  In the color session, Adobe announced substantialimprovements to its color screening algorithms and hinted at discussions withHell on the crucial Hell patents in this area.andP;  (See &quot;Color&quot; later in thisarticle.)andM;6.andP;  Canon joins the fold.andP;  Canon has licensed Adobe PostScript and will bringout a family of Adobe PostScript printers.andP;  This is of particular interestbecause Canon makes a wide range of printers, from the ubiquitous 8-ppm SXengine (used in both the LaserWriter II and LaserJet II) up to 50-ppmmachines--including color as well as monochrome printers.andM;Canon has also licensed the Phoenix PostScript implementation.andP;  Our initialassumption was that Canon had dumped Phoenix in favor of Adobe.andP;  But it soonbecame clear that Canon will probably offer both Adobe PostScript and PhoenixPostScript implementations and let the market decide which one wins.andM;Sun Microsystems.andP;  As we have mentioned several times in the past, weconsider Sun Microsystems to be the most important PostScript &quot;clone&quot; vendor.andO;Sun has implemented its own version of Display PostScript as the basis forits News windowing system.andP;  The major piece of the puzzle Sun has beenmissing is scalable font technology.andP;  This piece fell into place when itacquired Folio this past summer (see &quot;Font Wars&quot;).andM;At the Desktop Publishing Conference in September, Sun's president, ScottMcNealy, allowed as how it would be natural for Sun to offer printers thatcould be driven directly from its workstations and file servers (a la Next).andO;In March, Sun and Folio announced open licensing of the Folio technology,which threatens to undercut Adobe (see below).andM;Yet at the Seminar, Sun's Bill Joy was surprisingly conciliatory towardsAdobe.andP;  We think that it should be clear to both that they are really in thePostScript boat together.andP;  They both face a challenge from OS/2-PresentationManager--GPI, and from X Window in the Unix world.andP;  It would be interestingto see the two most important PostScript implementators find a way to worktogether for the common good.andM;Font warsandM;If things are moving rapidly on the page desciption language front, they havebeen moving at breakneck speed in the closely related arena of fonts and fonttechnology.andM;Six months ago at the Desktop Publishing Conference in September:andM;* PostScript was the fact of life for anyone needing more sophistication thanPCL provides.andM;* The Adobe font library and the Adobe font technology represented the mostimportant barrier to would-be PostScript clones.andP;  A complete, fullyLaserWriter-compatible implementation of PostScript is no trivialaccomplishment.andP;  Relatively few companies have truly succeeded in pulling itoff.andP;  But having accomplished this, clone vendors found that it was notenough.andM;Full Adobe compatibility (the ability to output a file prepared for an AdobePostScript printer) means full font compatibility as well as PostScriptlanguage compatibility.andP;  But Adobe fonts are encrypted.andP;  They cannot be usedon non-Adobe controllers.andP;  And, without knowledge of the proprietary Adobeencryption and hinting schemes, neither could other vendors prepare fontsthat could be read into Adobe controllers and treated as if they were Adobefonts.andP;  The only way of getting non-Adobe fonts into an Adobe controller wasto encode them as normal PostScript graphics.andP;  These &quot;Type Three&quot; fonts takeup appreciably more storage, are filled by the Adobe controller usingdifferent routines (which can make them look very different), and do notcontain the &quot;hints&quot; required to render text sizes well at modest resolutions.andM;* Adobe announced that it would hire on the spot any programmer who couldbreak the encryption routine.andP;  This, is turned out, was not a good bet.andM;Six months later, the picture has changed completely.andM;Bitstream writes Adobe format fonts.andP;  At the Seybold European Conference inDecember (less than three months after the &quot;wel'll hire anyone who can breakthe encryption&quot; boast), Bitstream announced that it had broken the encryptionand would sell all of its fonts in encrypted (but un-hinted) Adobe format.andM;At the March Seminars it showed the first 300 faces converted to encryptedAdobe (Type One) format.andP;  This allows users to read Bitstream Adobe-formatfonts into Adobe controllers.andM;RIPS reads Adobe fonts.andP;  In the product demonstration area, PostScriptclone-maker Raster Image Processing Systems (RIPS) gave impressivedemonstrations of its ability to use Adobehs encrypted Type One fonts in itsnewest clone product.andP;  It had a large number of Adobe faces, including Stoneand Sonata, and was printing with them in response to visitors' requests.andM;We imagine that the rest of the PostScript cloners are watching to see whatAdobe's reaction will be.andP;  For the past several years, Adobe's officialposition has been that its fonts are only licensed for use in Adobecontrollers.andP;  If Adobe does not attack RIPS with a lawsuit promptly, everycloner will feel free to follow RIPS' pathway.andP;  If Adobe does sue, it invitesyears of litigation and might lose in the end.andP;  (We should note, however,that Adobe has a great many more resources than does RIPS--a real asset whenit gets down to lawyer talk.)andM;Folio's F3.andP;  Sun formally introduced its TypeMaker outline-generation andTypeScaler font-scaling technology.andP;  We reported the details last month (Vol.andO;3, No.andP;  7).andP;  There are two essential components to the Folio technology:andM;* TypeMaker is a program that automatically converts font outlines fromexisting formats into the Folio F3 format, automatically inserting thescaling hints as it goes.andM;TypeMaker will be licensed to any type foundry that wishes to convert itsfonts to F3 format.andP;  Thus far, Monotype, Linotype, Berthold, Bigelow andamp; Holmesand ITC have signed licenses.andP;  Other vendors will almost certainly followsuit.andM;* TypeScaler.andP;  The second program will accept F3 format fonts from anysource, scale them and generate the bit maps required for screen display orprinter output.andP;  The routine appears to be relatively fast and to producegood output.andM;As mentioned earlier, Sun will use the TypeScaler technology as part of itsNews windowing system in its own workstations.andP;  In typical Sun fashion, thetechnology will be freely licensed to anyone else who wants it.andP;  The F3 fontformat will be published, so that font foundries can create F3 format fontson their own even if they do not license TypeMaker.andM;F3 font libraries.andP;  It appears that a significant number of the major typefoundries (including those that represent the core of the Adobe font library)are licensing TypeMaker.andP;  (The fee is reportedly $200,000 plus royalties onall F3 format fonts sold.)andM;Because the process is automatic, the foundries say that they will beconverting their entire libraries to F3 format in relatively short order.andP;  Weexpect that within a year, more faces will be available in F3 than in Adobe'sformat.andP;  To avoid chaos, Linotype has promised that it will retain the samecharacter sets and the same font metrics for F3 format fonts and for AdobePostScript fonts.andM;Using the fonts.andP;  TypeScaler will also be licensed freely to anyone who wantsto use the technology for screen display or output.andP;  This means, for example,that a PostScript clone vendor could build the TypeScaler technology into hisproduct, then tell his customers to buy F3 format fonts on the open market.andM;In response to our question on the subject, Linotype agreed that there isnothing to stop a user who has a PostScript clone printer or typesetter thatcan read F3 format fonts from going to the computer store and buying LinotypeF3 format fonts to run in his machine.andM;As far as we can tell, this means that if clone vendors adopt the Foliotechnology, their customers should be able to buy ITC, Linotype or Monotypefaces that match the Adobe versions of the same faces.andM;Font technologiesandM;Other developments on the font scene:andM;* Bitstream became the third vendor to show a fast, compact screenrasterizing algorithm (following The Company's Nimbus-Q [see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  6]and Sun's F3 TypeScaler).andP;  It calls its program Speedo.andP;  The Speedo demos wesaw were not quite as polished as Nimbus-Q and TypeScaler, nor as fast, butBitstream is still optimizing its code.andM;It is really a four-horse race.andP;  Agfa Compugraphic's Intellifont software hasbeen used for screen rendering in G.O.andP;  Graphics' and Archetype's productsfor some time.andP;  We believe it is neither as fast nor as compact as Speedo orMimbus-Q, but CG is surely hard at work remedying that.andM;* Letraset announced that it will market a font design program developed byA.B.andP;  Vista under the code name Fred Font Machine.andP;  The program, which runson any Macintosh with 1 MB of memory, can autotrace the edges of scannedlogos, insert hints, create kerning tables and generate both bitmapped Macscreen fonts and downloadable PostScript fonts.andM;Among its features are the ability to tie several weights of type into asingle Mac font family and to produce colorized type.andP;  It can also exportletterforms in EPS and PICT formats, so they can be further manipulated byprograms like Illustrator 88.andP;  Before its final release, the program willalso support the LetraStudio format, naturally.andM;It is not as sophisticated a program as, say, Ikarus.andP;  But based on our lookat the pre-release version, it will be fairly easy to use.andP;  Letraset willprobably release it at the August Macworld Expo.andP;  Pricing has not been set,but it is likely to be near the $500 mark.andM;Sorting it outandM;All in all, the world looks remarkably different after the Seminar than itdid after the Desktop Conference in September.andP;  The closed world of AdobePostScript and Adobe fonts is rapidly giving way to an open world.andP;  It looksas if things will shake out as follows.andM;1.andP;  There will probably be several important screen imaging models/outputdescription languages:andM;* PostScriptandM;* QuickDrawandM;* GPIandM;* PCL Level 5 (output printers only, not screen display)andM;At the moment, PostScript still looks like the only system-independentlanguage.andP;  It will be supported by both Microsoft and Apple.andP;  It is unlikelythat Apple will support GPI printers or Microsoft will support QuickDrawprinters.andM;2.andP;  Fonts will be decoupled from imaging and output technologies.andP;  Most userswill have access to fonts from a variety of sources.andP;  Most font foundrieswill sell their fonts in more than one format.andP;  They will try to make surethat all versions of a font are compatible with each other.andM;3.andP;  A few font formats and font technologies will prevail.andP;  The likelyfavorites are:andM;* Adobe PostScript formatandM;* Sun/Folio F3 formatandM;* Apple QuickDraw format (which we believe has been determined, but not yetannounced).andM;* Microsoft GPI format (which we believe has not yet been determined and willprobably be licensed from someone else).andM;* (Possibly) Compugraphic Intellifont format as used in PCL Level 5LaserJets.andM;The open question at this point is Microsoft.andP;  As we mentioned earlier,everyone will be courting Microsoft.andP;  Everyone, we believe (with the possibleexception of Apple), will eventually try to open up their font formats to getas broad acceptance as possible.andP;  Although both Bitstream and The Companyhave licensed their technologies broadly, we are still unclear as to how theywill fare as the font market is reshaped and redefined over the next year orso.andM;Implications.andP;  In short, we are heading towards a world in which there willbe a modest number of font formats, each used with one or more graphicimaging technologies.andP;  Font vendors will most likely &quot;publish&quot; their fonts inmany (or all) of these formats, and will undertake to ensure that these fontsare compatible--same character sets, same character shapes, same fontmetrics--from format to format.andP;  Users will be able to buy fonts in theformat of their choice from a wide variety of sources.andM;This is not the &quot;universal vendor-independent font format&quot; that many peoplehave dreamed of, but it is a lot better than what we have had!andM;Intellectual propertyandM;But implicit in this dream is a problem most users treat far too lightly.andP;  Ithas become increasingly evident over the past year that digitized type fontsenjoy very little legal protection--especially in the U.S.andP;  Typesettermanufacturers have always stolen each other's font designs by having a typeshop set a sample alphabet on film (complete with separator characters whichmark character baselines and side-bearings), then redrawing or redigitizingthe character outlines.andP;  (A time-honored technique that Bill Garth, thefounder of Compugraphic, once referred to as &quot;the traditional method.&quot;)andM;Digitized type has made the task a lot easier.andP;  Professor Michael Harrison ofBerkeley described a program he had worked out which reads Adobe characteroutlines from an Adobe controller and redigitizes them.andP;  Harrison, who hastaught cryptography at Berkeley, says that he could have broken the Adobeencryption in a week.andP;  He chose the digital equivalent of &quot;the traditionalmethod&quot; after Adobe refused to license its fonts to him.andM;The program is available on tape distribution to anyone who wants to use itfor research purposes.andP;  It is available for $10,000 to anyone who wants toput it to commercial use.andM;Another attendee told us that he has broken the Adobe encryption and is ableto read Adobe font outlines at will.andM;Shaky ground.andP;  In general, the legal status of digitized fonts is not clear.andO;The current U.S.andP;  copyright law provides that unless a design can existindependently of its utilitarian aspects, it cannot be copyrighted.andP;  It alsosays that &quot;mere lettering&quot; is explicitly not eligible for protection.andM;Shrink-wrap license agreements may give some protection.andP;  But then again,they may not.andP;  Shrink-wrap software license agreements have been ruledinvalid in a few jurisdictions, and legal theorists are divided on whether a&quot;take it or leave it&quot; license printed on a mass-market product constitutes avalid contract.andM;Why worry?andP;  Not all of the users at the Seminars appeared very worried by allof this.andP;  But unless font designers and font foundries can get paid for theirwork, there will not likely be many new faces--or many high-quality faces.andM;A bill to change this situation failed to pass in the last session ofCongress, partly due to opposition from users of type designs--that is,typographers--who feared that infringement lawsuits would be brought againstthem for using the widely copied designs based on Times Roman and Helvetica.andM;The British model.andP;  There is some hope that a special copyright act for typedesigns, based on the British model, might be able to pass.andP;  The British lawprovides that purchasers and users of stolen designs cannot be prosecuted,but that sellers and importers are fully liable.andP;  The protection lasts onlyten years and carries a mandatory-licensing proviso.andP;  It also specifies ajury-of-peers approach to determining whether a design is original or copied,and it has a grandfather clause that exempts all designs that existed at thetime the law was passed.andM;Still, Congress may not be sympathetic.andP;  (It is estimated that roughly 20,000Roman-alphabet font designs have been created since Gutenberg's time.andP;  Shoulda Congressman understand why we need more?)andP;  In that case, what should a fonthouse do to recover its investment in a new design?andM;Bitstream takes the position that its font designs are intetwined withexecutable code, which is copyrightable.andP;  We have our doubts about how usefulthat approach is.andP;  It surely marks bit-for-bit copying as piracy.andP;  But it isstill vulnerable to the &quot;traditional method.&quot;andM;We think that the ultimate answer will have to lie in the domain ofmarketing, not law.andP;  Good designs that are aimed at the mass market--pricedlow, packaged conveniently, distributed widely and compatible with lots ofscreens and printers--will generate more revenue than equally good expensive,encrypted, narrowly marketed fonts that only work with one brand of printer.andM;The stakes.andP;  This is the time when the future of both page descriptionlanguages and digitized type is being determined.andP;  Things are moving rapidly,and many of the important players have a less-than-perfect understanding ofthe issues.andM;The publishing industry will simply have to cope with this situation, sincethe standard-setting process is being driven by the much wider officecomputing market.andP;  In Cal Bauer's view, the best thing for publishers to dois let Apple and Microsoft (and HP, IBM, OSF, etc.) know what functions andfeatures are needed for publishing work, so that the standards we get will begood ones.andM;Desktop ColorandM;Developments in desktop color are not quite as dramatic (or as chaotic) asthose on the page description language and font fronts, but this field too ismoving at a rapid pace.andM;Paul Brainerd of Aldus provided an intellectual framework which was used formuch of the discussion and debate that swirled around the seminar sessionsand the demonstration area.andP;  He divided the color market into three tiers:andM;* High-end prepress (magazines, annual reports, etc.).andP;  This is served by thetraditional high-end prepress color separation industry.andM;* Mid-range (marketing materials, brochures, flyers, etc.).andP;  This, Brainerdthinks, will be served by high-resolution color PostScript output.andM;* Low-end (newsletters, comprehensive proofs, etc.).andP;  This, Brainerdbelieves, will be served by laser printer and copier output.andM;Any user (and any product) may span one or more of these categories.andP;  Allshould be able to work together.andP;  Increasingly, even the high-end systemswill be driven by work coming in from the desktop.andM;Differentiating factors.andP;  The crucial distinguishing factors separation thesemarket tiers may be: (a) the quality (sharpness, resolution, evenness) of thecolor image; and (b) the accuracy and consistency of color reproduction.andM;There was general agreement that the low-end applications can be served byapproximate color.andP;  Red is red, blue is blue.andP;  There was also generalagreement that the high end requires extraordinarily precise control overcolor.andP;  Images must be balanced for the specific printingplate/press/ink/paper combination to be used for the final run.andP;  Even themost carefully calibrated display screens cannot be trusted to present acompletely faithful representation of the colors in the printed job.andM;The main controversy lies in the middle.andP;  What is &quot;good enough&quot; color?andP;  Howdo you get it?andP;  Can desktop tools (and PostScript) be cost-effective inproducing it?andM;We will summarize the discussion on all of these points in our Seybold Reporton Publishing Systems coverage of the Seminars.andP;  But there are severalimportant developments we would like to share with our Desktop Reportreaders.andM;PostScript color outputandM;Four key issues tend to get intermixed in any discussion of output of colorseparations on high-resolution PostScript recorders.andP;  We tried to disentanglethem in the seminar discussions.andP;  They are:andM;1.andP;  The capabilities of typesetters as imagesetters.andP;  An output recorder thatdoes just fine for text and line graphics may do much less well for screentints and halftones.andP;  David Spencer has discussed in these pages many ofthese issues as they relate to plain-paper laser printers.andP;  The same problemsmust be dealt with in high-resolution output recorders as well.andM;Color output only compounds the problem.andP;  Registration and repeatabilityissues that are not significant in monochrome output become crucial when youare outputting color separations of screen tints or pictures.andM;Linotype contended that it has made continual improvements to the design ofthe Linotronic 300 recorders to make them more suitable for color output.andP;  Asit had in September, it claimed that changes made within the past months makethe machine entirely suitable for color output recording.andM;Others argued that a start/stop machine like the Linotronic has inherentproblems, and that a better approach is to buffer the entire image, thenexpose the output film in a continuous pass without starting and stopping.andM;Everyone agreed that the large drum machines used in high-end color systemsproduce the best results.andP;  Large, expensive flatbed machines with lots ofmechanical precision should be next best.andM;2.andP;  PostScript color screening algorithms.andP;  Everyone has complained thatPostScript does not generate &quot;proper&quot; color separation screens.andP;  Adobeexplained why, and it introduced what it believes are some viable workaroundsin the form of nonstandard color separation screen angles (more on this in amoment).andM;3.andP;  The speed of PostScript color separations.andP;  Everyone complains thatPostScript color separations are slow.andP;  This is largely a matter ofprocessing speed.andM;As mentioned earlier, Linotype introduced at the Seminars a faster RIP IIIversion of its current 68020 controller.andP;  This will help, but it will notsolve the problem.andP;  For cost-effective color output, users are really goingto need the much faster PostScript processors that are now in the pipeline.andM;4.andP;  Skills and experience.andP;  There is a growing consensus that consistent,quality output of color requires knowledge and discipline that the typicaltypesetting service bureau simply does not have.andM;Some may learn how to deal with color.andP;  But it is equally likely thatcompanies that already understand color reproduction may begin to move intothe PostScript color output recording service business.andM;PostScript color screeningandM;Some companies are now working around the speed and quality limitations ofPostScript color screening, bypassing PostScript for this function.andP;  Userssuch as Anya in Spain and vendors such as Bestinfo perform separations andscreening in their own software before sending files to a PostScript outputrecorder.andM;Another approach is to pass the file to a prepress system.andP;  Aldus introducedat the Seminars its Open Prepress Interface (OPI), which provides a means ofincluding in PostScript page files (in the form of structured comments)information about non-PostScript color images that will be processed directlyby a color prepress system.andM;Adobe solutions.andP;  Adobe addressed some of the criticisms about PostScriptcolor screening by introducing at the Seminars new, non-standard defaultcolor separation screen angles that it says avoid moire problems.andM;But Adobe (and, we believe, just about everyone else in the market) is reallyconstrained by basic patents held by the high-end color vendor Hell.andM;Hell patents.andP;  News of the pivotal position of the Hell patents came as ashock to many Seminar attendees.andP;  Hell has a series of patents that coverscreening techniques involved in quality color separation.andP;  These patentscover the screening techniques themselves, not the methods by which youcalculate the screens.andP;  A knowledgeable observer should be able to tellwhether or not a vendor is infringing on the patents simply by examining filmoutput, without knowing what calculations were performed to produce thatoutput.andM;The patents appear to be very important.andP;  It is extraordinarily difficult toproduce high-quality screened color output without infringing on at leastsome of them.andP;  (We are not experts, but we suspect that even the new Adobecolor screen angles may violate one of the Hell patents.andP;  Some output we haveseen from other vendors looks as if it may violate other patents.)andM;The other high-end color vendors (Crosfield*, Dainippon Screen and Scitex)have all licensed the Hell patents.andP;  None of the mid-range companies(including Adobe) has done so.andM;Adobe/Hell love feast.andP;  When we invited Dr. Wellendorf of Hell up to thestage to discuss the Hell patents, we were struck by the mutual complimentsexchanged between Hell and Adobe.andP;  It was apparent that the two companieshave talked, and that they have mutual respect for each other's expertise.andO;Hmm ...andM;Open Prepress InterfaceandM;In addition to its work in PostScript color separations (see Aldus underExhibits, below), Aldus introduced at the Seminar a means of passing imagepositioning, sizing and cropping information from desktop page makeup systemsto high-end color prepress systems.andM;In essence, Aldus embeds image placement and manipulation information as aheader to an Encapsulated PostScript file.andP;  The color prepress system thatreceives the file is expected to interpret these instructions and manipulatethe image that has been scanned at the high-end system as requested by thedesktop user.andP;  The high-res image would then be merged into the specifiedlocation on the page.andM;Quark (Visionary) and Letraset (DeskLink RSG) have already built similarcapabilities into their products.andP;  The most important difference is thatAldus is making its specification public (Open Prepress Interface) in thehopes that it will be adopted by everyone (including its competitors).andM;Thus far, Crosfield, Dainippon Screen and Diadem have said that they willsupport OPI.andP;  Since the proposal is new, none has had time to work outspecifics as to how it will support OPI and when it will offer that support.andO;Other vendors, including Hell, have said that they will respond to marketpressure.andP;  If they have demand from customers, they too will undoubtedlysupport OPI.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
