A lone Member has now decided to risk the angerof the House leadership by ripping away the veil of secrecy.   In the 1950s and 1960s, autocratic House committeechairmen routinely bottled up civil-rights bills and refusedto let them come to a floor vote. Today, popular billsranging from amendments to balance the budget and ban flagdesecration are routinely buried in committee because theliberal House leadership opposes them and wants to avoidvotes that could be used against incumbents.</LP><TEXT>   There is only one real way a majority of Members can bringlegislation to the House floor if it is blocked in committee:They must produce a discharge petition. If 218 Members -- aHouse majority -- sign a discharge petition, the relevantcommittee must either vote out the bill or agree to a floorvote. However, only 19 of 347 discharge petitions havesucceeded.   This is because the list of Members who have signed apetition is kept secret -- until the required 218 sign. OnlyMembers can view the list, and then only briefly to makecertain their name is on it.   They must first go to the Clerk's desk in the Housechamber. They are handed a statement signed by the Clerk andSpeaker informing them that disclosing the names of signers,or the number of names, is &quot;strictly prohibited under theprecedents of the House.&quot; The sole precedent is an arbitrary1931 prohibition by Speaker John Nance Garner that was nevermade part of official House rules.   This restriction has made it easy for Speakers to squashdischarge petitions. Whenever the list comes close to 218names, the Speaker routinely pressures Members to drop off.The list's secrecy allows them to conceal their timidity fromthe voters.   Rep. Chuck Douglas, a former New Hampshire Supreme CourtJustice, says the petition's secrecy is in direct conflictwith honest and open government. &quot;This covert list allowsMembers the best of two political worlds,&quot; he told us. &quot;Theycan publicly support a measure, like protecting the flag,while quietly withholding their names from the petition thatwould accomplish that.&quot;   He notes that during last year's popular effort to repealSection 89 of the tax code, 309 of the 435 House Memberssigned on to a repeal bill, but less than half that numbersigned the discharge petition, largely to avoid angeringHouse leaders.   Mr. Douglas has decided to break up this cozy protectionfor hypocrites. He has just filed a discharge petition toforce a vote on his amendment to ban flag desecration. Whilehe is obliged to not reveal the names of signers, he hasannounced he will disclose the names of any Members who claimto have signed the petition but do not actually do so.   He plans to do the same with a second discharge petitionto force a vote on a balanced-budget amendment. It has 246co-sponsors, but Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooksrefuses to release it. Rep. Douglas expects a lot of pressurefrom his colleagues to back down, but he has no intention ofbudging.   The secret discharge petition is only the latest exampleof how House Rules -- or in this case merely a precedent --are used to shield Members from accountability. We tried torequest documents on the history of the discharge petition'ssecrecy by using the Freedom of Information Act, but wereinformed that Congress has exempted itself from that law aswell.</TEXT></DOC>
