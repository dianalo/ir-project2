Garcia </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX ECO </IN><TEXT>   As analysts and economists pored over last week's developments, with their portents of accelerating inflation and rising interest rates, it was difficult to find an optimist on Wall Street.    Thursday's news of a wider-than-expected trade deficit in February rocked the stock market. And while bargain-hunting helped lift stock prices Friday, the report of a jump in producer prices last month also was unsettling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 76 points last week, wiping out the bulk of the 108-point gain posted the previous week.    The outlook on inflation and rates &quot;bodes very negatively for the stock market,&quot; says Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co. andamp; Economic Advisors.    Steven Einhorn, a portfolio strategist with Goldman Sachs in New York, says the widening of the February U.S. merchandise trade deficit to $13.83 billion from $12.44 billion in January indicates &quot;improvement in the trade picture will be slow in coming, and it's not likely to be a smooth process.&quot;    He calculates that on a seasonally adjusted basis, there was an average trade gap of about $14 billion in each of the first two months of this year. That's about the level at which that deficit has hovered for nearly two years, he says. Thus, Mr. Einhorn concludes that the dollar is vulnerable to further declines because there has been so little improvement in the trade deficit.    A weak dollar and some signs that the higher cost of imports is beginning to creep into producer and consumer prices could drive up bond yields, some economists say. Others say the Federal Reserve might be forced to adopt a tighter credit policy and push short-term rates higher to shore up the dollar.    &quot;If it hurts the bond market, it can't be good for the stock market,&quot; Mr. Einhorn says.    David Hale, chief economist for Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, says long-term Treasury bond rates could stay close to 9% in the next few months. Those rates jumped about 25 basis points, or a quarter of a percentage point, in the past few days to stand just below the 9% level as the week ended.    But Mr. Hale doesn't see rates climbing high enough to choke off growth and cause a recession. He expects central banks around the world to help support the dollar through intervention.    Because some of the U.S.'s major trading partners fear that a change to a Democratic administration in Washington could lead to more protectionist trade policies, Mr. Hale says, &quot;the central banks of Taiwan, Japan and most European countries are de facto Republican action committees.&quot; Those allies, he says, &quot;don't want to see us have a recession in an election year&quot; and therefore will intervene to support the dollar.    Mr. Sinai says he was disturbed at the muted reaction of foreign stock markets to Thursday's plunge in U.S. bond and stock prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 5% Thursday, but the Nikkei index of 225 Tokyo Stock Exchange issues lost less than 1% Friday.    &quot;That's the international community saying the prospects for the next two to three years look a lot better in other markets than in the U.S.,&quot; Mr. Sinai says. He says he believes foreign investors already are moving away from U.S. markets.    That could be the start of a troublesome trend, Mr. Sinai says: &quot;If foreigners are giving up on the U.S. markets and moving their money into other countries, such as Japan and the United Kingdom, those portfolios aren't going to change overnight. That could reinforce the continued underperformance of the U.S. equity markets.&quot;    But not everyone was equally disturbed by last week's economic reports. Michael Metz, a market strategist with Oppenheimer andamp; Co., contends that the market's sharp drop may indicate that investors already anticipate somewhat higher rates, perhaps half a point higher on long-term bonds.    Although he's not expecting stocks to be really robust, Mr. Metz says, &quot;This is a market that incorporates very little downside risk. But of course, that may be my epitaph.&quot;    Barton Biggs, a market strategist with Morgan Stanley in New York, says he still has his balanced portfolios equally divided between bonds and stocks, with nothing in cash. &quot;I don't think one month's trade number changes the world,&quot; he says, &quot;although it doesn't make (investors) any happier when they see the reports.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity   A firmer dollar and some bargain-hunting helped the stock market snap back from Thursday's plunge. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 8.29 to 2013.93.    However, the rebound was primarily in the 30 blue-chip industrials. Nearly 1,000 New York Stock Exchange-listed issues declined, while 573 advanced. The broader market barometers were mixed: Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.02 to 259.77, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index slipped 0.14 to 147.00.    Big Board volume rose to 234.2 million shares from 211.8 million Thursday. It was the busiest session since March 18, when 245.7 million shares changed hands.    Texaco gained 1 3/4 to 48 5/8. The oil company said it will sell an additional $2 billion of assets under its reorganization plan and reinstated its quarterly dividend of 75 cents a common share. The payout had been suspended while Texaco was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings.    Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel jumped 4 3/8 to 15 3/8. The company agreed to pay $60 million in cash and provide a $25 million note to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. to settle all pension claims arising from the company's Chapter 11 proceedings.    J.P. Stevens fell 1/2 to 67 5/8 as the company recommended that its holders accept a $68.50-a-share takeover offer from Odyssey Partners. West Point-Pepperell, which leads a competing group that has offered $67 a share, eased 7/8 to 30 5/8.    Resorts International gained 5/8 to 32. Resorts Chairman Donald Trump and Merv Griffin reached an understanding in principle Thursday that would result in all Resorts holders other than Mr. Trump receiving $36 a share; Mr. Griffin would acquire Resorts, and Mr. Trump would get the Taj Mahal hotel and casino in Atlantic City, N.J. </TEXT></DOC>
