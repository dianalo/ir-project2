But its teammate on the Navy project, McDonnell DouglasCorp., avoided taking such a charge and posted a $57 millionprofit.</LP><TEXT>   Had McDonnell Douglas taken a charge plus an adjustmentfor upgrades it's making on the T-45 Navy trainer jet, theembattled defense contractor would have had a net loss of$109 million. The company is filing claims against thegovernment for reimbursements it believes are due on thoseprograms; it included an estimate of the value of thoseclaims in its earnings report.   General Dynamics is joining in the claims against theNavy, but didn't include a provision for any possiblerecoveries.   Industry observers say McDonnell Douglas's more optimisticapproach, while an acceptable method of accounting, couldcome back to haunt the nation's No. 1 defense contractor. &quot;IfDouglas were truly honest, they'd know they're not going toget a 100% adjustment from the Navy,&quot; said First BostonCorp.'s Peter Aseritis. &quot;Will they get half of that?Possibly. Sixty percent? Possibly, but not likely.&quot;   A Navy spokesman in Washington said the service &quot;doesbelieve that the A-12 contract is solid and doesn't requirerevision.&quot;   Pentagon officials familiar with the issue said thatultimately, Navy brass may agree to cover at least part ofthe companies' claims because the A-12 is one of theservice's top-priority programs. &quot;But the final shape of anyagreement is still hard to see,&quot; said one official.   John McDonnell, McDonnell Douglas's chairman, said that&quot;at this point, we do not believe we have losses inherent onthe program.&quot; He noted that the company chose its tack afterconsulting with numerous outside auditing and legal experts.   But the fact that General Dynamics chose a moreconservative outlook for the financial fate of the A-12raises a question for investors: Whose vision of the futureis correct?   Part of the difference between the methodologies used bythe firms, both based in St. Louis, reflects several factors:General Dynamics has used a higher cost estimate for what itwill take to complete its portion of the plane; McDonnellDouglas, which recently launched a cost-cutting drive, thinksit can complete its share of the A-12 more cheaply thanGeneral Dynamics has given it credit for; General Dynamicshas to reverse $24 million of earnings it had recorded on theA-12 program, while McDonnell Douglas never booked anyexpected profits; and McDonnell Douglas doesn't write downany general and administrative expenses until they occur.   General Dynamics's $450 million pretax charge on the A-12included 50% of the company's current estimate of the team'santicipated overruns from the $4.8 billion contract ceilingand the fixed price of the initial production lot of planes.McDonnell Douglas said its loss on the A-12, had itregistered one, would have been $89 million.   Some analysts noted that McDonnell Douglas can ill-affordto post a poor quarter now. The company, which earlier thisweek said it will eliminate as many as 17,000 jobs this year,recently negotiated an estimated $4 billion line of creditwhose terms are tied to the company's net worth. &quot;If they'dtaken a similar write-off to what General Dynamics did, thatwould have reduced the line of credit by about $600 million,&quot;said Paul Nisbet of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   McDonnell Douglas's $57 million net income was equal to$1.49 a share, and included $16 million from the sale of thecompany's computer-servicing business. A year earlier, thecompany had a net loss of $48 million, or $1.25 a share.Revenue rose 22% to $4.12 billion from $3.37 billion.   Operating losses at the company's transport aircraftsegment in Long Beach, Calif., narrowed to $33 million from$152 million, when the company took a stunning $93 million inwrite-offs on its C-17 military cargo and KC-10 tankerprograms. The company is still dogged by high developmentexpenditures on the MD-11 tri-jet as it gets ready forfederal certification by year end.   There were some bright spots. Mr. McDonnell noted that thecompany's MD-80 line posted a small profit, compared with anoperating loss of $34 million a year ago. Most importantly,the company delivered an impressive 34 of the narrow-bodyjetliners in the latest quarter. &quot;From an-ability-to-deliverpoint of view, the worst is over,&quot; Mr. McDonnell said.   The chairman added that he has been frustrated by WallStreet's reaction to the company's job-reduction plan,insisting that the cutbacks &quot;are going to contributesubstantially to our future strength.&quot;   He implored the financial community to &quot;look at thepotential&quot; at McDonnell Douglas, noting that if the companyachieves merely half its goal of paring $700 million a yearfrom the cost structure, that would add nearly $6 a share toearnings. &quot;The message I'd like to get across is look at theopportunity,&quot; Mr. McDonnell said, promising &quot;fairly quickresults&quot; from the cost-savings program. He noted, too, thatbacklog continued to swell in the latest quarter.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,McDonnell Douglas closed at $43, up $1.75. Also on the BigBoard, General Dynamics finished at $31.50, off 12.5 cents.   In addition to the A-12 charge, General Dynamics's $240million loss, or $5.75 a share, included a separate $50million write-down for estimated overruns on the Armysingle-channel ground and airborne radio system, or Sincgars.A year ago, net was $58.4 million, or $1.39 a share. Salesrose 3.7% to $2.62 billion from $2.53 billion.   The quarter included improvement in the projected recoveryschedule for F-16 deliveries by the company's Fort Worth,Texas, division and a continued strong performance by CessnaAircraft, which makes business jets.   Separately, Los Angeles-based Northrop Corp. postedsecond-quarter net of $29.3 million, or 63 cents a share. Ithad a loss of $78.1 million, or $1.67 a share, a year earlierafter a $150 million loss provision on a classified researchand development contract in its missiles and unmanned vehiclesystems business segment. Sales inched up to $1.41 billionfrom $1.4 billion.   ---   Andy Pasztor contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
