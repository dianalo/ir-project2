Disturbance can be definedas any relatively discrete event in time that disrupts ecosystem community,or population structure and changes resources, substrate availability,or the physical environment. The spread of disturbance across a landscapeis an important example of a functional characteristic that is influencedby landscape heterogeneity. Few studies have been done on the relationshipbetween landscape pattern and disturbance. Landscape heterogeneity mayenhance or retard the spread of disturbance, and disturbances may generatelandscape patterns. However, a general theory to predict the effectsof landscape pattern on disturbance propagation has not yet emerged.This paper presents a conceptual framework for studying the effect oflandscape pattern on the spread of disturbance. Generalizations are thendeveloped from simulation experiments based on percolation theory. 19refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
