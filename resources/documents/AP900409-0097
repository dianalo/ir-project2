(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ron Haugen's view of partisan politics ispretty flexible, so he served as a delegate to both the Republicanand Democratic state conventions over the weekend.   ``I didn't really know what party I liked so I thought I'd go toboth conventions and see,'' the 29-year old Northwood farmer saidSunday from the floor of the Democratic convention.   Haugen was a bit embarrassed when reporters noticed him at bothconventions. ``Is it illegal?'' he asked. ``I don't want anypublicity.''   He said he attended the Democratic convention in legislativeDistrict 19, a Republican stronghold.   ``In our district if you can crawl through the door you're adelegate,'' he said of the Democrats. The district was allowed tosend 23 delegates to the state convention but could muster onlyeight, he noted.   He didn't attend the Republicans' district convention but wasselected as a delegate to the state meeting anyway, he said.   Republican state Rep. Dagne Olsen of Larimore said District 19Republicans weren't aware Haugen also would be a delegate to theDemocrats' convention.   Olsen said she didn't think party rules even addressed thequestion of whether Haugen's double duty was allowed.   ``But I don't think he should make it a habit,'' she said.   Haugen said he'll study the platforms of each party beforedeciding which he likes best.   ``But I don't know,'' he added. ``I'll probably forget aboutpolitics next year.''</TEXT></DOC>
