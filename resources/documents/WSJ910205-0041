Speaker Foley has just announcednew pay ceilings for House staffers. Following on a 29%increase in pay for Members of the House to $125,100 a year,the chamber's top staff aides will now be eligible to receiveas much as $115,000 a year. That's 13% higher than the payfor Senators, though admittedly staffers don't have as manyopportunities as Senators to collect speaking fees fromspecial-interest groups. Still, measured against thebenchmark established by Washington to discuss tax policy andthe like, Capitol Hill surely must now be regarded as asanctum of &quot;the rich.&quot;</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
