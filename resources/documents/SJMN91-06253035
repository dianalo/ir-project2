The initial fundingwon't cover the cost of purchasing all 560 acres, Windmiller said. Theconservancy expects purchases to average about $1,000 an acre.;   Thepurchases could take several years to complete, provided the property ownersare willing to sell. The state will have to negotiate with several propertyowners who hold parcels ranging from 20 acres to 80 acres in size.;   So farthe property owners have expressed interest in the project, but are beingcautious, Windmiller said.;   &quot;The main reason is the economy. They don't knowwhere it's going to go next. They have invested money and they want to seewhat's going to happen to their investment,&quot; Windmiller said.;   Theconservancy, formed to preserve the best archaeological sites in the nation,considers the Tehachapi Archaeological Site one of its highest priorities. Thesite contains 17 significant archaeological areas, Windmiller said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Daily News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Tehachapi  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910909  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  379  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, September 9, 199100253035,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
