Taking adequate care of our8-month-old requires us to be father and mother almost full time, and we don'tsee how it can work any other way right now. When should the transition backto husband and wife begin taking place, and do you have any tips on how tomake it a smooth one?;    A You're absolutely right! The needs of infants andyoung toddlers are such that it's difficult, if not impossible at times, to beanything other than father and mother. This very necessary state of affairsputs the child smack-dab at the focal point of attention in the family. As aresult, the child's first understanding of how the world works isself-centered -- the world revolves around him.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FROM PARENT BACK TO PARTNER: EASING THE TRANSITION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Family ClipboardFamilies TodayParentingJohn Rosemond is a family psychologist in private practice in North Carolina.  </MEMO><TEXT>     The child's needs for attention begin to diminish toward the end of thesecond year as self-help skills expand and the need for autonomy emerges. Thisis the best time to begin reclaiming the roles of husband and wife.;    Thistransition provokes a temporary, albeit often tumultuous, disruption of thechild's sense of security. If this transition is successful, the child beginsto base security on the perception that his parents are powerful enough toprovide for and protect him in all circumstances, which enables the child tobegin moving away from parents and toward the discovery of self-competence.;   Unfortunately, the transition often is less than completely successful. Thechild's protests so intimidate some parents that they abandon the effort inmidstream, and the child never fully divests of self-centeredness.;   Unfortunately, our culture doesn't support the transition from parent topartner. For more than a generation, we've encouraged parents -- especiallyfemale parents -- to believe it is their duty to pay attention to theirchildren. According to the myth, the more attention you pay a child, the moreyou inflate the child's self-esteem. This fiction sustains children at thecenter of attention and turns families upside down, inside out and backward.;   How can you accomplish the transition? By making time for the marriage on aregular basis. By not catering to the child's whims, whether emotional ormaterial. By expecting obedience, and enforcing it firmly but gently. Byacting like you know what you are doing.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  John Rosemond column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910421  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4L  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  428  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday April 21, 199100112105,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
