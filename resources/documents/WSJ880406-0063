The geothermal energy concern didn't give a value for the plant, although a spokesman said two similar plants already being built in the Niland area are valued at about $90 million each. Magma has part ownership of one plant already operating there. The spokesman said it hadn't been decided who the participants in the fourth plant would be.    Separately, Magma said Geothermal Resources International Inc. of Santa Rosa, Calif., had missed a required payment under the company's option to develop some leaseholds held by Magma. The amount of the missed payments wasn't disclosed, but Magma said if the payment aren't received within 15 days, existing agreements between the two companies will terminate. A Geothermal Resources spokeswoman confirmed that the company had missed a required payment but declined further comment &quot;at this time.&quot;    The agreements with Geothermal Resources relate to an option it has to develop as many as two power plants in the East Mesa area of Imperial County, Calif., and to purchase Magma's current East Mesa plant. Magma declined to comment on what steps it would take if the payment isn't received. </TEXT></DOC>
