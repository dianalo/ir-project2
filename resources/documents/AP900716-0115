Gorbachev as a statesman for withdrawingobjections to a united Germany's membership in NATO.   Bush said Gorbachev's action ``strengthens efforts to buildenduring relationships based on cooperation.''   A senior White House official called Gorbachev's statement ``abig step. It seems quite significant that they have said for thefirst time that they are willing to see Germany unified in NATO.''   Another administration official said Gorbachev's successes atthe recent Soviet Communist Party congress, where he strengthenedhimself politically, had put him in a stronger position to allowfull German membership in NATO.   ``It looks like he's coming around,'' the official said. Bothofficials, insisting on anonymity, noted there still are otherproblems facing German unity.   Gorbachev announced his position in a joint statement withvisiting West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.   Moscow's opposition to a united Germany in NATO had posed one ofthe biggest obstacles to German unification. Gorbachev had insistedthat a unified Germany be neutral or a member of both the WesternNATO alliance and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.   However, the joint statement read by Kohl said, ``A unifiedGermany, in exercising its unrestricted sovereignty freely and byitself, decides if and which alliances to which it wants tobelong.''   Kohl said he had told Gorbachev that a united Germany wants tobe part of NATO, and that he was sure East Germany agreed.   ``Unified Germany receives complete sovereignty,'' Gorbachevsaid.   Bush, in his statement, said he welcomed Gorbachev's remarks.   ``This comment demonstrates statesmanship and strengthensefforts to build enduring relationships based on cooperation,''Bush said.   The president said Gorbachev's action ``can be seen as aresponse, perhaps in part, to the outcome of the NATO summit inLondon where the alliance displayed its readiness to adapt to thenew realities in Europe and reach out to former adversaries in theEast.''   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Paris for talks onGermany, said, ``We have to make sure that we see exactly what wasagreed to.''   Otherwise, Baker was extremely enthusiastic. ``This is the rightdevelopment for all of Europe,'' he said.   In recognition of reduced East-West tensions, NATO agreed totailor its nuclear and conventional forces to the rapidly shrinkingmilitary threat from Moscow.   NATO also proposed a non-aggression declaration with members ofthe Warsaw Pact and declared that nuclear weapons would be usedonly as a last resort.   Bush said the Helsinki Final Act, which ratified the post-warboundaries of Europe, guaranteed Germany's right to choosemembership in the Western alliance.   ``We think this solution is in the best interests of all thecountries of Europe, including the Soviet Union,'' Bush said.   At their summit last month, Gorbachev had told Bush that he wasopposed to a united Germany belonging to the Western alliance.However, Gorbachev did not challenge Bush when the president said,``we are in full agreement that the matter of alliance membershipis, in accordance with the Helsinki Final Act, a matter for theGermans to decide.''   Based on that, administration officials began saying thatGorbachev was leaning toward acceptance of a united Germany in NATO.   Baker said Gorbachev's move had been anticipated, but not untillater in the summer. ``I think we should be optimistic that itwould give significant impetus to the overall process'' of Germanunification, he said.   Baker and Soviet Foreign Minster Eduard Shevardnadze will meetTuesday in the third in a series of talks on German unification.The session will focus on Germany's border with Poland amid Polishconcerns that a reunified Germany might try to recover territory itlost at the end of World War II.   Prior to that, he will meet Tuesday with West German ForeignMinister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.</TEXT></DOC>
