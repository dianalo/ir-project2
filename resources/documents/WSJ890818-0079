Wigton and Timothy L. Tabor, former risk arbitragers at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., following an agreement to plead guilty to mail fraud by Robert M. Freeman, a Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. partner.    The three men were arrested together in February 1987 on insider-trading charges, accused of conspiracy to violate securities laws, securities fraud and other charges. Those arrests followed a series of plea agreements made by former investment banker Dennis Levine, takeover speculator Ivan Boesky and former Kidder investment banker Martin Siegel.    The same-day arrest of Messrs. Wigton, Tabor and Freeman was one of the more talked-about Wall Street events at the time. The impending case, called a &quot;blockbuster&quot; by other attorneys, was to be the case that would spread the insider-trading scandal to some of the most respected houses on Wall Street.    The incident was particularly humiliating for the now 54-year-old Mr. Wigton, who was placed against an office wall, frisked, led away in tears and handcuffed.    Three months later, charges against the three men were dropped when prosecutors, led by U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, asked a federal court to dismiss the indictments. At the time, the government said it intended to seek new expanded indictments of the three.    But yesterday, Benito Romano, Mr. Giuliani's successor, announced that charges won't be filed against Messrs. Wigton and Tabor.    At a news conference, Mr. Romano said the two men's arrests in February 1987 were premature. &quot;We would have been better off not to have proceeded with the arrests so early,&quot; Mr. Romano said.    Messrs. Wigton and Tabor couldn't be reached for comment. But their attorneys expressed anger over the two-year ordeal. For Mr. Wigton, &quot;it was frightening, terrorizing, humiliating,&quot; said Stanley Arkin, his attorney. &quot;He's entitled to a sincere and profuse apology, especially from Giuliani, who presided over this.&quot;    Mr. Wigton, the former head of risk arbitrage and over-the-counter trading at Kidder, has remained on Kidder's payroll, the firm said. A spokeswoman said he is currently negotiating with Kidder about another trading job with the firm. Mr. Arkin said his client wouldn't pursue charges against the government.    Andrew Lawler, Mr. Tabor's attorney, added that &quot;a terrible misjudgment was initially made when Mr. Tabor was arrested more than 2 1/2 years ago without a full investigation having been conducted. That decision has caused Mr. Tabor incalculable personal and professional damage.&quot;    Mr. Tabor, a Rhodes scholar who left Kidder in early 1986, was dismissed as Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s head of arbitrage at the time of his arrest. He was arrested at his Manhattan apartment and jailed overnight in the Metropolitan Correctional Center.    Since that time, he has struggled to find work, his attorney said, and was unemployed for &quot;a significant period of time.&quot; Last year, he managed to get consulting work &quot;in the financial area,&quot; said Mr. Lawler, who said he couldn't be more specific.    The government's original indictment against the three men alleged unlawful trading in the stocks of Unocal Corp. and Storer Communications Inc. The government later indicated it would seek an expanded indictment that would charge illegal trading in the stocks of at least nine companies involved in takeovers.    Criminal defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt, of New York, who was not involved in the case, said the prosecutor's handling of the case was unusual from beginning to end.    &quot;It's very, very rare that you would arrest anyone, cuff them in public and take them from their offices as a show of power and then dismiss your own charges, announce that you're continuing the investigation, and finally concede that it was all a colossal screw-up,&quot; said Mr. Lefcourt.    He added that the case &quot;tends to confirm the worst fears about the misuse of power in the U.S. attorney's office.&quot;    &quot;It's appalling that these lives were so thoroughly and unconscionably ruined by conduct that was premature and unfounded,&quot; Mr. Lefcourt said. He went on to say that although Mr. Giuliani has conceded that it was wrong to arrest Messrs. Wigton and Tabor, now he needs to concede that it was also wrong to charge them.    &quot;He owes them not only an apology, but also he needs to help them put their lives back together,&quot; Mr. Lefcourt said.    Mr. Giuliani, who is currently running for the Republican nomination for mayor of New York, couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
