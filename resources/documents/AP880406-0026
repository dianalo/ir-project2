Former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya said Hispanics representingvarious countries of origin couldn't even agree 20 years ago onwhat to call themselves.   ``We've moved beyond that,'' he said Tuesday at the NationalHispanic Leadership Conference. ``It's an evolving process.''   The conference, which meets during presidential election yearsand represents 21 national organizations, drew Hispanic leadersfrom across the country to Washington this week to draft a nationalagenda.   ``We've got a good cross-representation of Hispanics from acrossthe United States,'' said Pablo Sedillo, NHLC chairman.   ``Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Mexican-Americans, Central and SouthAmericans are participating, Democrats and Republicans,conservatives and liberals. We're proving we can come together andwe are going to make a difference,'' Sedillo said.   More than 3.5 million Hispanics are expected to vote inNovember's general election, according to the group.   More than 300 delegates attending the conference were set tovote today on an agenda leaders hope will be included in theDemocratic and GOP platforms.   ``The issues that are going to be recognized and come out ofthis conference will speak very clearly and concretely as to what apresidential candidate should be doing to represent the needs ofHispanics _ education, employment, housing, civil rights, health,''said Sedillo, of Santa Fe, N.M.   ``We are arriving at a consensus ... that will be very strong,''Anaya said.   In its draft agenda, the NHLC calls for steps to stem the highschool dropout rate _ only 50.9 percent of Hispanics complete highschool compared with 77.7 percent of the general population.   ``If I had to single out any one thing that would be it _ tokeep our youth in school,'' said Al Zapanta of Dallas, director ofgovernment affairs for ARCO Oil and Gas Co.   ``We have to educate them so they can take their rightfulposition in society,'' he added. ``We keep filling the bottom rung,but they're not moving up.''   The conference also seeks a one-year extension for undocumentedaliens to apply for amnesty and wants the president to immediatelysuspend the deportation of Salvadoran and Nicaraguan nationals fromthe United States. And it wants a Hispanic appointed to the SupremeCourt.   Employment, housing and health are also high on the agenda formany of the leaders, concerned about the poverty and livingconditions of many Hispanics.   ``There are places in this country where there is a Third Worldsituation _ in the (Rio Grande) Valley, northern New Mexico, thebarrios of L.A., the Bronx of New York,'' Sedillo said.   ``The whole idea is that we as Hispanics want to join inpartnership with the government, with the private sector. It's timethat they recognized the talent and resources we have within ourown community. It's important we add the question ofself-sufficiency. The community wants no handouts _ we want to joinin partnership,'' Sedillo said.</TEXT></DOC>
