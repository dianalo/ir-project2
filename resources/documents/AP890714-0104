The initial session of the 15th world economic summit began atthe new glass Louvre pyramid, now the main entrance andarchitecturally controversial structure in front of the famed museum.   The first order of business was a picture-taking session for the``class photo'' of President Bush and the leaders of Britain,France, West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada.   Even before the summit began, Bush won a victory on a contentioustrade issue with Japan. Reversing course, Japan agreed to hold talkswith the United States on a broad range of trade barriers, which theadministration contends are a major cause of the $52 billion U.S.trade deficit with the Asian nation.   On the other hand, Bush maneuvered unsuccessfully to obtain afinal agreement between Mexico and its commercial bank lenders onrestructuring Mexico's foreign debt of more than $100 billion.   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari told Bush that nodeal is in sight, despite French President Francois Mitterrand'swarning that ``Mexico is on the edge of an explosion because of theweight of its debt.''   Today's first session of the Big Seven industrial democraciescoincides with the climax of three days of festivities marking the200th birthday of the French Revolution.   The salute to the July 14, 1789, storming of the Bastille, whichmarked the beginning of the revolution, began with a military paradedown the Champs Elysees, the most famous thoroughfare in Paris.   Heavy tanks rumbled past the VIP viewing stand as Mirage jetfighters screamed overhead, trailing streams of red, white and bluesmoke _ the colors of the French flag.   With more than two dozen heads of state and government invited tothe festivities, there was an extraordinary gathering of worldleaders from nations rich and poor.   Bush, leader of the world's wealthiest nation, got a front rowparade seat next to President Hossain Mohammed Ershad of Bangladesh,representing one of the world's poorest.   Bush began the day with a hurriedly arranged meeting with Salinason his country's commercial lenders. Afterward, White House chief ofstaff John Sununu reported there was no early prospect for a finalagreement.   Sununu said Mexican officials want ``to get it done correctlyrather than trying to rush it,'' and the White House believes``there is no requirement to leave the summit ... with anagreement.''   The United States offered a loan of $1 billion to $2 billion tohelp Mexico seal an agreement, preferably before the economic summitends on Sunday, but Sununu said the negotiations remained snaggedover details.   Mitterrand, who is pushing a rival plan for solving the ThirdWorld debt problem, said in a French TV interview that Mexico'sforeign debt has carried that country to the brink of an explosion.   ``No one has an interest in this explosion taking place, whichwould mean more misery for a suffering people,'' he said. ``We arecontributing, I am contributing, as far as possible so that apositive answer could be given in the coming days.''   The 15th economic summit marks Bush's debut at the annualgathering of the leaders of the United States, Japan, Britain,France, West Germany, Canada and Italy. Leaders of some of the ThirdWorld countries attending the Bastille celebration urged theprosperous nations to hold a summit between rich and poor nations.   Mitterrand has been harshly criticized in the press here for theextravagence of the bicentennial celebration, as well as for holdingtwo separate dinners tonight for have and have-not nations.   Bush, through a spokesman, rallied to Mitterrand's side.   ``I don't think the president sees any difficulty at all in theway the French have laid out their plans, their celebrations, ortheir hosting of the summit meeting,'' said Sununu.   Bush hoped the summit would let him assume the mantle ofleadership on economic and environmental issues, much as he did onmilitary matters in May with a troop reduction proposal at the NATOsummit in Brussels.   Following his stops this week in Poland and Hungary, Bush plannedto press for a coordinated economic aid program to reward the twoEast Bloc nations for democratic reforms. Among other steps, Bushwas expected to express support for new loans and debt reschedulingto ease their financial woes.   China's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy students in TiananmenSquare and subsequent repressions also were on the agenda. Itappeared likely the leaders would approve a statement of concernabout events in China rather than endorse any collective sanctions.   Sununu said Bush would welcome a summit statement reiteratingpreviously expressed condemnations and concerns about human rightsviolations in China.   ``We know of no specific proposals that go _ that even brings allof the countries up to the levels that the president has gone, muchless going further,'' Sununu said.   The United States has cut off military sales and technologytransfers to China, urged a freeze on international loans forBeijing and restricted U.S. diplomatic contacts.   The summit will turn to economics and other subjects on Saturdayand Sunday. Bush is seeking an international agreement on tacklingproblems of global pollution.   Other leaders had their own agendas.   Attempting to overcome a sex scandal which has shaken hisgovernment, Japanese Prime Minister Sosouke Uno came armed withnearly $40 billion in aid to improve the global environment andprovide financial support to lessen the staggering $1.2 trilliondebt burden carried by developing countries.   Mitterrand has his own rival plan for Third World debt. So doesBush.   Nicholas Brady, Bush's treasury secretary, unveiled a strategyMarch 10 to encourage commercial banks to voluntarily forgive aportion of developing nations' bad debt.   Security problems of protecting the ``Big Seven'' summit leaderswere compounded by the presence of more than 30 presidents and primeministers who are Mitterrand's guests for the bicentennialfestivities.   Fanning out over an 80-mile circle around Paris, 30,000 securityforces erected a protective cocoon around the leaders. While anobservation blimp hovered over the crowds, sharpshooters kept watchfrom rooftops and troops armed with ground-to-air missiles kept aneye on the skies.</TEXT></DOC>
