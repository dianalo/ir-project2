In Rome, the 12-member European Community imposed an embargoagainst imports of Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil. It also banned exports ofweapons to Iraq, suspended that country's preferential trade statusand froze Iraqi assets.   Warships from France, the United States and Great Britainsteamed toward the Persian Gulf to reinforce international forcesalready in the Gulf region, but Arab nations warned against foreignintervention in the crisis.   However, Arab diplomatic efforts foundered Saturday. Arableaders postponed a summit planned Sunday in Saudi Arabia todiscuss Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.   And the 45-nation Organization of Islamic Conference on Saturdaydrafted a resolution condemning the Iraqi action and demanding theimmediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces.   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said Saturday that Francewould consider supporting a naval blockade of Iraq or disruption ofits oil pipelines if diplomatic efforts and sanctions areineffective.   The United States, which on Thursday imposed an embargo on oiland other Iraqi imports, reportedly approached Turkey and SaudiArabia about cutting Iraq's oil pipelines to the Mediterranean andthe Red Sea. Iraqi pipelines run through both countries.   But Turkey's president, Turgut Ozal, told reporters: ``There hadbeen no demands from the United States for the closure of thepipeline. Such a demand is out of question.''   In Tokyo, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told President Bush thatJapan would impose sanctions against Iraq if the United Nationsvotes to do so. The United States has proposed that the U.N.Security Council impose sweeping economic and military sanctionsagainst Iraq, and U.N. diplomats discussed it Saturday.   Japan also joined nations freezing Kuwaiti assets to block theIraqi-backed government's access to them.   Britain, the United States, France, West Germany, Italy,Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway and Luxembourg have frozen Kuwaitiassets. Britain announced Saturday it was joining France and theUnited States in blocking Iraqi assets.   The Soviet Union, Iraq's biggest arms supplier, froze weaponsshipments to Baghdad on Thursday. Italy and Czechoslovakia havealso halted arms deliveries.   Moscow and Baghdad have had a friendship treaty since 1972, butthe Soviet press denounced the Iraqi government Saturday as a``totalitarian regime.''   On Friday, the United States and the Soviet Union made anunprecedented joint condemnation of Iraq and called on allcountries to cut arms supplies.   In Beijing, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen indicated Saturday thatChina would not join the United States and other nations inimposing sanctions.   ``The issue should be solved within the scope of inter-Arabrelations,'' the official Xinhua News Agency paraphrased Qian assaying.   On Friday, Egypt and the Gulf Cooperation Council _ Kuwait,Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman _condemned the invasion and called for immediate Iraqi withdrawal.   Iran, which fought a eight-year war with Iraq, condemned theinvasion but said Baghdad's Western and Arab backers were to blame.   A Tehran radio commentary Saturday said a solution had to befound that would avoid giving the United States an excuse tointervene militarily.   ``Foreign military intervention, more than economic and militaryembargos, will make the Persian Gulf a flashpoint,'' it said.   ``The world, and especially the backers of the Iraqi regime,were warned that military arming of Iraq, and providing alleconomic and political means to strengthen this regime, will havevery dangerous effects for the future of the region,'' the radiosaid.   The British government said it was ``extremely skeptical'' thatIraq would meet its pledge Friday to begin withdrawing its troopsfrom Kuwait this weekend.   ``This is unacceptable. We want an unconditional return to thestatus quo. This means that the royal family must be restored,''said a Foreign Office spokesman, referring to Kuwait's oustedmonarchy.   In Aspen, Colo., British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher saidshe would travel to Washington on Monday to meet with Bush over theinvasion.   In Israel, Defense Minister Moshe Arens warned Saturday thatIsrael will act against Iraq if it moves its forces into Jordan.   ``We are ready, we are prepared and we are strong,'' he said onIsrael radio. ``We have a significant deterrent capability and wecan guard our interests.''</TEXT></DOC>
