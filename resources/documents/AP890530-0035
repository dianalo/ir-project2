AHN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scores of radical students abandoned afive-day hunger strike today because of exhaustion, but about 60students said they would continue the protest over the mysteriousdeath of a student leader.   Police said two shipyard workers set themselves on fire inritual suicide bids Monday because of a labor dispute. They saidone died and the other was in critical condition.   The two set themselves ablaze at the Daewoo Co. shipyard at KojeIsland off the south coast, where workers are demanding pay raises.   About 60 students continued to go without food today in thecompound of Seoul's Roman Catholic Myongdong Cathederal as riotpolice ringed the area but made no move to intervene.   More than 200 other students abandoned the protest or left totake weaker protesters home to provincial cities, leaders said.   Student leaders said they they would not quit the hunger strikeand that they expected other students to join them. Five studentswere hospitalized after collapsing during the protest.   A government official, who declined to be named, saidauthorities did not intend to intervene to stop the hunger strikebut police might reconsider if any of the hunger-strikers becomesseriously ill.   The cathedral, headquarters of the Catholic church in SouthKorea, is regarded as a sanctuary. It is often used to stageanti-government protests because police will not enter the compoundfor fear of angering the church.   About 300 radicals began a hunger strike at the cathedral lateThursday to demand the government admit that police killed studentleader Lee Chol-kyu.   Lee's body was found earlier this month in a reservoir near thesouthern city of Kwangju.   The government released a report today concluding that Leeslipped and fell into the reservoir after fleeing from a policeroad block. The death was accidental and there was no evidence ofpolice involvement, the report said.   Police said Lee ran away when stopped at a roadblock outsideKwangju.   Dissident groups claim police tortured and killed Lee, who hadserved a prison term for anti-government activities and was wantedon charges of writing articles praising communist North Korea.   Police said today that about 200 people were injured Mondaynight in Kwangju when riot police broke up a protest march by some5,000 protesters calling for the fall of the government.   In the labor dispute on Koje Island, officials said Lee Sang-mo,20, a welder, died after setting himself on fire and jumping off a40-foot building. An unidentified worker, who set himself on fire afew hours earlier, was in critical condition.   Workers at the financially troubled shipyard are demanding payraises of 50 percent and more. Daewoo officials say large raisesare impossible because the yard is losing money due to the poorstate of the ship industry.   Suicide is sometimes used in South Korea as a form of protest toshame the government or employers and create martyrs.</TEXT></DOC>
