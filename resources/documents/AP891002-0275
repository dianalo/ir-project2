The fauna isall but inedible. Even penguin eggs are too greasy for breakfast.The plants are minuscule lichens. And what comes in must be carriedout.   Travelers today find Capt. Robert Falcon Scott's hut as he leftit in 1911, with unrusted tins of Huntley andamp; Palmer's biscuits linedup on dust-free shelves. Cold, clean air preserves almost anything.   Environmentalists rage at garbage dumps that accompany alengthening string of military and scientific outposts, includingthe sprawling U.S. McMurdo Station.   The Greenpeace environmentalist group set up a base near McMurdoto monitor developments. Its members came to blows with Frenchsoldiers building a runway across from a penguin rookery near theSouth Magnetic Pole.   The group accuses the Americans, among others, of killing marinelife with sewage and refuse. If scientists cannot protect theenvironment, Greenpeace argues, oilmen and miners will be worse.   Near the end of September, word filtered out that 44,000 gallonsof diesel fuel leaked from a pipe at the U.S. Amundsen-ScottStation at the South Pole. The leak was discovered in August.   U.S. officials said it would seep into the ice with noenvironmental damage. But Foreign Minister Gareth Evans ofAustralia called it a perfect example of why Antarctica had to beprotected.   In the early 1970s, when politics heated in Antarctica, claimantnations hurried to strengthen their positions.   Argentina leased a Greek ship, with deck chairs but no radar,for cut-rate tourism. Chile built a hotel. Last year, the firstcommercial flights landed at the South Pole.   Now Australian entrepreneurs propose ``Project Oasis'' _ arunway for 747 jet aircraft, a five-story hotel and a hovercraftdock.   When the mineral convention was signed, some specialists arguedthat controlled exploitation was better than no accord at all. Ifanyone broke the moratorium, no international law would apply.   Ideas included carrying out oil in submarines, rather thantankers, to minimize risk.   But the picture changed in January when an Argentine supplyship, the Bahia Paraiso, nosed into waters marked on charts``dangerous ledges and channels'' and tore open its double hull.   The crew and all 81 tourists escaped, but an estimated 170,000gallons of its 250,000 gallons of fuel oil leaked onto marinehabitats, eventually killing seals, penguins and other marine life.   Salvage crews were able to stop the leakage but oil stillremains in the ship's tanks.   The Argentine navy reported after a reconnaissance flight overthe area in early September that the Bahia Paraiso is still agroundin ice-free waters and listing at about 140 degrees.   Capt. Raul Pueyrredon of the Argentine navy said the airmen``saw no evidence of leakage nor any visible ecological damage.''   He added that he was not sure how much oil remained in thevessel but that ``it was very little.''   In a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner inMay, the Environmental Defense Fund, an American organization thatdescribes itself as non-profit, said the Bahia Paraiso still hadabout 70,000 gallons of fuel on board when the Southern Hemispherewinter set in and still poses a threat to Antarctica's environment.   ``Antarctica's worst environmental disaster has become aforgotten oil spill,'' the letter said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 8</NOTE></DOC>
