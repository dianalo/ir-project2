Robert J. Barbera, chief economist for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said, &quot;It's the first clear sign that the economy is going to be lackluster this year.&quot; Cynthia Latta of Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm, suggested that slower hiring, particularly at factories, reflects a build-up in inventories late last year.    But Mrs. Norwood and some other economists said the report, though certainly not a sign of strength, didn't send a clear signal. Hiring has been unusually strong in the last three months, so a smaller increase in January wasn't a surprise, Mrs. Norwood noted. &quot;We need another month or two of data,&quot; she said.    James Cochrane, chief economist for Texas Commerce Bankshares Inc., Houston, added that late December layoffs by state and local governments -- a customary maneuver to bring down year-end headcounts -- dragged down the employment number. Government employment fell by 67,000 in December while private payrolls grew by 174,000, a smaller increase than in recent months, the Labor Department said.    Separately, the Federal Reserve Board said consumer borrowing in December rose $4.45 billion, or at an annual rate of 8.8%, after climbing at rates of 5.2% in November and 5.7% in October.    In December, auto loans increased by $2.52 billion, or at an annual rate of 11.7%. Credit-card borrowing soared by $2.32 billion, or at an annual rate of 19.4%. A Fed economist suggested this large increase may reflect slower growth earlier in the year as consumers used home-equity loans to pay off credit-card balances. All the increases are seasonally adjusted.    For all of 1987, consumer borrowing was up 6% to $621.44 billion, unadjusted for seasonal variations. That's far slower growth than the 10.5% increase reported for 1986.    Total non-farm employment rose to 103.7 million in January from 103.6 million in December and 100.9 million in January 1987. All figures in the unemployment report are adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations.    Manufacturers' payrolls rose by 25,000 to 19.4 million, largely because of hiring by export-producing industries. Employment in service industries, including government, rose by 146,000 to 78.5 million. Excluding government, service employment rose 213,000 to 61.3 million. Most of this growth came within the retailing sector, where employers made smaller than usual post-Christmas cutbacks.    The 5.8% jobless rate of January and December was down from 5.9% in November and from 6.7% in January 1987. A different measure of unemployment, including the military as employed, also was unchanged in January, at 5.7%.    The Labor Department's survey of households, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, showed a 384,000 increase in people with jobs and a 68,000 rise in those who are unemployed and looking for work.    ---   Here are excerpts from the Labor Department's employment report.
