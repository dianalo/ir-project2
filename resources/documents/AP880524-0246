(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL will have to go off the air and closeits theme park as early as next month if contributions to thetelevision ministry keep dwindling, the new trustee told a U.S.Bankruptcy Court judge Tuesday.   After the hearing, PTL contributors made tearful pleas totrustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton to allow banished PTL founder JimBakker to appear on the cable TV network to solicit donations theysaid would save the ministry.   ``Everybody else has tried and failed _ why not Bakker?'' saidPaul Wood, a spokesman for a group of PTL's Lifetime Partners, themajor contributors to the ministry.   Bakker resigned in March 1987 as the story of his tryst withJessica Hahn and her hush money payments was about to break. Heturned over control to the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who resigned inOctober after accusing Bakker of using ministry funds to livelavishly.   Wood said contributors he represents had pledged $81 millionthat would be turned over to the ministry once Bakker was allowedon the PTL network ``to ask for forgiveness.''   Benton told the contributors, several of them weeping as theypleaded with him in the courtroom, that his objective was to savePTL.   ``My primary duty is to get the creditors paid,'' he added.   PTL, with current debts of about $130 million and assets of $160million, filed for reorganization and protection from creditors inbankruptcy court in June 1987. Benton, who was appointed Friday tosucceed former Christian Broadcasting Network executive David Clarkas trustee, was in court to gain approval of a plan to liquidateassets to the extent necessary to pay debts.   After telling the judge about the ministry's declining income hesaid, ``The next step is to shut down, and that I'm prepared todo.''   But Benton said after the hearing he wouldn't rule out theproposal allowing Bakker's limited return once he saw it inwriting, ``if it's the best and logical next step for theministry.''   PTL attorney Bradford Leggett said if the contributors had asmuch financial backing as they claim, the logical thing to do wouldbe to put their money together and present a proposal to buy PTLand pay its debts.   Wood acknowledged later that they couldn't raise the moneywithout getting Bakker on the network.   In the hearing before Judge Rufus Reynolds, Benton said, ``We'reconsiderably short of money now, and we're going to have to havesome money soon to operate. Contributions have about dried up.''   In the past three weeks, contributions have dwindled from$60,000 a day to $40,000 a day to $22,000 a day last week, Bentonsaid. It costs $27,000 a day just to pay the network affiliates, hesaid later.   ``We have the problem of keeping the doors open,'' Bentontestified, adding that they also may not be able to keep airing the``PTL Club'' TV show, the primary method of gathering contributionsthat pay for operating expenses.   Marjorie Gray, a Lifetime Partner who said she has donated$36,000 to PTL, told Benton that the reason people stopped givingis that they aren't happy with the leadership.   She also said contributors are disheartened by PTL'snegotiations with non-religious buyers _ including NationalBasketball Association expansion franchise owner George Shinn, whowants to build a sports complex on the grounds.   Reynolds said he approved the concept of a revisedreorganization plan filed last week that called for the trustee toliquidate PTL's assets as necessary. The proposal outlined plans tosell the 2,300-acre Heritage USA theme park in Fort Mill and allowa separate, non-profit corporation lease the property required tooperate its church and network television programs.</TEXT></DOC>
