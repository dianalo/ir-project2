Assistant Secretary Charles E. Hess, who oversees science andeducation programs, said he has named Gary R. Evans as his specialassistant for global change issues. Evans has been deputyadministrator of the department's Agricultural Research Service.   ``There are climate experts who claim the 1988 drought wasevidence that global warming has already begun,'' Hess said. ``Aconclusive link has not been proven, but the threat of globalwarming from heat trapped by so-called greenhouse gases is too muchof a risk to ignore.''   Gases include carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane,nitrogen oxides and halons, he said in a statement. Some of thegases also seem to be causing a thinning of the high-level ozonelayer, which filters out a large part of the ultraviolet rays whichcan limite the growth of sensitive crops.   Evans will coordinate activities among seven USDA agencies andthe land-grant universities as part of the department's efforts toprotect crops and forests, Hess said.   Department studies, some dating back to the 1950s, have shown``substantial damage to crops and forests from atmosphericpollutants, including low-level ozone,'' he said.   Evans and other USDA scientists represent the department on theIntergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, which was formed lastNovember in Geneva, Switzerland by the United Nations EnvironmentalProgram and the World Meteorological Organization.</TEXT></DOC>
