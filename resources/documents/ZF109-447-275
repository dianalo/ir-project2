(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Several forces lie behind NASA's decision to make the Software SupportEnvironment (SSE) a part of its Space Station Freedom project.andP;  The agency'sexperience indicates that an increasingly larger proportion of new programcosts goes to software development, integration and maintenance, according toLockheed.andP;  This is partly due to a growth in the size and complexity ofsoftware packages.andP;  For example, millions of lines of code will be requiredto write software for life-support, power-distribution and many other spacestation flight and ground systems.andM;&quot;The agency needed to integrate software developed for the program bygeographically dispersed contractors using different host computers,workstations and software tools,&quot; says Linn Ready, deputy program manager atLockheed Missiles and Space's SSE System Project.andP;  &quot;NASA wanted assurance thesoftware met high reliability standards.&quot;andM;Solution: Lockheed relies on consistent categories of tools and procedures todevelop and sustain space station software.andP;  These include:andM;*  Software production standards;andM;*  Hardware specifications;andM;*  Documentation policies;andM;*  Training materials;andM;*  Computer aided software engineering (CASE) tools.andM;NASA space centers, contractors and their subcontractors use SSE.andP;  If currentdiscussions bear fruit, so will the agency's international partners.andM;if everything goes as planned, SSE will reduce the cost of developing andintegrating the complex software associated with the project.andP;  Maintenancecosts should also be cut.andM;SSE will be capable of evolving over the decades of expected space stationuse.andP;  And it will be easier to migrate SSE-based software from developmentlaboratories to the Data Management System (DMS) on the space station.andP;  TheSSE Development Facility (SSEDF), located at Lockheed Missiles and Space'sHouston office, has overall responsibility for specifying, maintaining,managing and distributing the rules and tools that comprise the system.andO;Compilers, debuggers and CASE packages are among the software engineeringproducts under review by this unit.andM;&quot;SSE does not constitute a single development cycle,&quot; says Ready.andP;  Instead,it is being produced in a series of operational increments.andP;  We can't waituntil we have the final version of SSE out on the street, because contractorsare working on software now.andP;  Each release is a new version, about every sixmonths, and goes through the standard NASA review cycle.andP;  Each release alsohas more functionality than its predecessors.andP;  Our tools are evolving all thetime.&quot;andM;Space station software is not written in the Development Facility.andP;  Softwaredesign, documentation and code testing are among the functions carried out atSoftware Production Facilities  (SPFS) established at contractor sites andNASA space centers.andP;  Each Production Facility maintains a subset of SSE toolsand procedures relevant to its mission and available to application-softwaredevelopers.andP;  At least 12 SPFs may be available.andM;Test and validateandM;&quot;We look first for SSE tools among products on the market that meet spacestation requirements,&quot; says Ready.andP;  &quot;When necessary, we provide SSE userswith customized code.&quot; Cadre Technologies Inc., Iconix Software, InterleafInc., Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp. and Scribe Systems are among the vendorswhose off-the-shelf products are currently included in SSE.andM;&quot;We identified many of these programs when we wrote our proposal to undertakeSSE,&quot; Ready continues.andP;  &quot;Since winning the contract, we have people knockingon our door all the time.andP;  A laboratory is set up at the Development Facilityto evaluate competing tools that might find their way into later SSEversions.&quot;andM;One of Lockheed's own tools in this process is an analytical program providedby Science Applications International.andP;  This program identifies SSErequirements and tracks them against the pieces of code presumed to satisfysuch requirements.andM;Lockheed expects to develop over 700,000 lines of code for the project.andP;  Suchcode, as well as application software produced by other contractors, will bewritten in Ada-which was chosen by NASA several years ago as the principalprogramming language for space station software.andP;  &quot;Ada compilers for SSE mustimplement the full language,&quot; says Ready.andP;  &quot;No subsets will be allowed.&quot;andM;Several platforms and other equipment have also been selected for the SPFs,although the exact mix of devices will vary with each site.andP;  Host computers,for instance, may be either Digital Equipment Corp.'s VAX 8820 or IBM Corp.'s3090, or compatible architectures.andP;  Software design workstations may be drawnfrom Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh II, the DN 3XXX family fromHewlett-Packard Co.'s Apollo System Division and IBM's PS/ 2.andP;  Productionsites use Ethernet-based transmission control protocol/internet protocol(TCP/IP) local area networks (LANs) to connect SSE-related devices.andM;Training and support are significant components of SSE.andP;  &quot;Users vary infamiliarity with our tools,&quot; says Ready.andP;  &quot;We send a training team out witheach new version of SSE to every SPF.andP;  These teams train developers on themost recent program changes.&quot;andM;Lockheed also maintains a user help-desk for the SSE community and a productdemonstration facility in Houston.andP;  A computer-based training course,covering many SSE software development programs, has been built for theproject by Wicat Systems to promote self-paced learning.andM;Lockheed continually examines upgrades of third-party software already partof SSE and the availability of superior products.andP;  Any changes in Lockheed'sSSE contract  triggered by such studies are initially processed in theHouston office of Mike Gremillion, NASA's SSE project manager.andP;  One recentchange: The inclusion of the R1000 Ada-based, software-development processorfrom Rational in the generic SPF system.andM;The Rational machine incorporates compilers, a design facility anddocumentation capabilities tailored to Ada code development.andP;  &quot;TheR1000]automates most development of Ada code and produces designdocumentation,&quot; says Gremillion.andP;  &quot;It also allows us to trace developed codeback to the requirements defined for a given software configuration.andP;  Thatmakes it easier to periodically update code.&quot;andM;Rational also brings another advantage to SSE.andP;  &quot;This device implements nowwhat we were planning to deliver in the next two years,&quot; says Gremillion.andO;&quot;That helped us catch up, because we had fallen behind schedule.&quot;andM;Lockheed's team is adding incremental configuration-management capabilitiesto the system, with delivery to SPFs starting next year.andP;  Configurationmanagement is especially important in the space station: One version of aprogram may be in operation, another may be undergoing testing and a thirdcould be in development.andP;  Software engineers must identify and keep track ofthese versions.andM;Standards are also under continuing review by Lockheed.andP;  Currently, forexample, Lockheed is looking at possible components of a common userinterface.andP;  These components include a user interface command language fromthe University of Colorado, the X Window System for graphics andwindow-management and the Open Software Foundation's Motif, a higher layergraphical user interface (GUI).andM;Select the backbone networkandM;Network services for SSE are likely to evolve.andP;  All SPFs and the ProductionFacility will eventually interconnect over NASA's Program SupportCommunications Network (PSCN), making possible electronic delivery of codeand documentation throughout the space station community.andM;&quot;Originally, we chose the PSCN's X.25 packet-switching service for the SSEbackbone network,&quot; says Rocki Singh, SSE program manager at Ford Aerospace.andO;His company carries out systems engineering, testing, maintenance and customprogramming for SSE communications.andM;X.25 was appealing on several grounds.andP;  As an international standard, iteases hookup to NASA's foreign partners networks.andP;  And X.25 allows forefficient sharing of bandwidth among many users, which is useful if yourtraffic doesn't justify laying in a dedicated line.&quot;andM;There have been problems in getting X.25 service at the speeds SSE requested,which included 56K bits per second (bps) for the Development Facility'snetwork link.andP;  Singh's group is studying PSCN-Internet, which makes 56K bpsavailable throughout the network, among other data rates.andM;According to Singh, &quot;PSCN-Internet uses TCP/IP and other protocols.andP;  None ofthese is truly an international standard, but PSCN-Internet administratorsare committed to an international standard.&quot;andM;1999.andP;  A space odyssey You must like close spaces, but the food isn't badandM;Why build o space station? NASA has several answers.andP;  Space Station Freedomwill be a research laboratory and an observation platform ...andP;  a provingground for international cooperation ...andP;  a test bed for advanced automationtechnology .andP;  .  .  a service and assembly facility for satellites and spacevehicles ...andP;  a symbol of notional vitality ...andP;  and, at some point in thenext century, a staging base for spaceships that will take us back to themoon and on to Mars.andM;The structure that embodies these visions doesn't look like the huge,doughnut-shaped affair, complete with Hilton Hotel, featured in the film&quot;2001.&quot; Picture instead a giant Tinker Toy construction in space and you havea good idea of how NASA plans to build the real thing.andM;The space station is envisioned as a 508-foot-long integrated truss,consisting of 16-foot-long tubes joined by corner-lock assembly fittings.andO;Structural elements mounted on this frame include:andM;*  Four 14-by-44-foot pressurized modules in which crew members live andwork;andM;*  Four small, pressurized cylinders (or resource nodes) that interconnectthe crew modules and contain command and control systems for stationutilities and services;andM;*  A docking mast for the space shuttle on one of the resource nodes;andM;*  Air locks and logistics carriers (store rooms) for supplies and equipmentcarried up by the shuttle;andM;*  External attached payloads;andM;*  A heavy-duty manipulator arm and special-purpose dexterous manipulator,developed by Canada], to help assemble and service station elements, moveequipment and supplies, and load and unload the shuttle;andM;*  The flight telerobotic servicer, a sophisticated robotic system forprecise manipulations needed in assembly, maintenance and inspection;andM;*  A propulsion assembly for periodic reboosting of the station to counteratmospheric drag and avoid collisions with space debris;andM;*  Photovoltaic solar arrays and associated electrical power equipment thatcan generate an average of 75 kilowatts of continuous power;andM;*  Heat rejectors to ward off the 1,00 F to 3,600 F solar-inducedouteratmospheric temperatures.andM;Life on the high frontierandM;In addition to the core structure, three free-flying platforms will beassociated with the station: two unmanned polar platforms for earthobservation and a man-tended free flyer for microgravity research.andM;The space station will be positioned 150 nautical miles to 270 nautical milesabove the earth.andP;  Twenty-eight flights of the space shuttle ore scheduled totransport structural elements, payloads and expendable supplies to theorbital construction site.andP;  NASA hopes to expand the station's baselineconfiguration with a boom-like structure to assemble and service vehiclestraveling to the moon and Mars.andM;An international crew of eight will live and work in the space station for upto six months at a time, according to current NASA plans.andP;  A HabitationModule to be provided by the United States will contain crew quarters.andP;  Threeother facilities will hold rack-mounted payloads and station equipment.andO;They'll be;andM;* A U.S.andP;  Laboratory Module,andM;* A Japanese Experimental  Module;andM;* And  the  European  Space Agency's Columbus Attached Pressurized Module.andM;Studies in life and materials sciences, astrophysics, technology developmentand commercial applications will take place in the modules.andP;  Specificexperiments could involve, for example, the growth of large, pure crystals,formulation of new alloys and observations of how crew membersphysiologically adapt to life without gravity.andM;Life aboard the  space station will have its amenities.andP;  A separate crewcompartment on the  habitation module, for instance, offers  a private spaceto each crew member, separate from the galley and health-care units placed inon open area.andP;  And gone ore the days of toothpaste-tube dinners.andP;  Foodsupplies will include frozen meals, snacks and some fresh fruits andvegetables.andP;  &quot;Dining under the stars&quot; takes on new meaning in this setting,as a NASA publication notes.-Dennis Livingston</TEXT></DOC>
