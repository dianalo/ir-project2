The locations where the researchtook place were in and near Amsterdam, Netherlands. The research is aimedat traffic and transport in relation to a decentralization policy andat space heating in relation to the organization policy. The data, relevantfor the research, are surveyed in 10 research locations. The energy consumptionand transport costs are retrieved for 150 households, while also relevantcharacteristics of the households are surveyed. At municipal and provincialenergy companies consumption data for natural gas and electric powerare also retrieved. Characteristics of the ten research locations havebeen collected by using existing municipal statistical data and inventorieson the spot. The main conclusion is that the influence of the urbanizationpolicy on energy conservation will be limited. Within environmental planningbetter instruments can be pointed out (zoning plan, building plan) totake energy conservating measures. 27 figs., 8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
