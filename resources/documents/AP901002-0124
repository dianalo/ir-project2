The French news agency Agence France-Press quoted Taylor'srebels as saying their forces were pushed back nearly four milesand that the guerrilla army was threatened with encirclement.   Task force soldiers advanced behind a barrage of heavyartillery, backed by government troops and by a rival rebel factionunder Prince Johnson, who broke with Taylor last February.   The force began the two-pronged offensive Monday night afterTaylor's rebels attacked Johnson's fighters and lobbed rockets atremnants of slain President Samuel Doe's army holed up in hispresidential mansion.   The multinational army, joined by Doe's soldiers, forced therebels back from strategic positions near the mansion, starting aretreat.   To the north of besieged Monrovia, task force soldiers were ledacross swamps by Johnson rebels for an attack in which they seizedTaylor's front line facing Monrovia port. The West African army hasits headquarters in the port.   Hundreds of civilians fled fighting that followed a weeklongcease-fire called by Taylor.   The 5,000-member task force is the strongest in Monrovia, armedwith fighter-bombers, tanks and armored cars. Johnson has pressedthe force to take action, saying he would launch an all-out assaulton the forces of Taylor and Doe unless it intervened.   Similar threats led the task force to evacuate about 1,000people from Doe's mansion after Johnson's men killed Doe on Sept.10.   The Economic Community of West African States sent soldiers fromNigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Gambia and Sierra Leone to Monrovia on Aug.24 to enforce a truce in the civil and tribal war, in which atleast 5,000 civilians have been killed.   Refugees said in Lagos, Nigeria, that rebels from both factionsin Monrovia are merciless and seem to enjoy murdering civilians.They said people in the capital are dying of starvation, whileothers are slaughtered without reason.   George Matey, 28, of Ghana, said: ``I have never seen humanbeings being killed as they are being killed in Liberia. They werejust slashing people's throats and it was fun to them. All thestreets were littered with bodies.''   Matey was among 7,000 hungry and penniless nationals of Nigeria,Ghana, Guinea and Liberia who arrived Monday from Monrovia aboardthe Nigerian cargo ship River Majidun.   An additional 10,000 refugees, mainly Ghanaians and Nigerians,left Monrovia by sea Monday, headed for Takoradi, in Ghana, andLagos.   Task force soldiers initially said their role ruled out takingthe offensive, to the extent they did not fire a shot when Johnsoncaptured and wounded Doe in a surprise attack on the West Africanforce's headquarters.   Johnson's men nightly watch a film of Doe's last tortured hours,the French newspaper Liberation reported Tuesday.   Its Africa editor, Stephen Smith, wrote he was among guestsinvited to view ``scenes bristling with horror . . . blood clotsfrom the torture; zoom shots of a face disfigured by fear, ananguished, gaping grin twisted onto a mouth murmuring pitiablecalls for mercy.''   Many in the audience had seen the film before and called for theoperator to hurry over ``boring episodes,'' Smith wrote.   Doe died at about 3.30 a.m. on Sept. 10, and for two weeks hisbody was on display before it was taken to Johnson's headquarters,according to the film.   ``My men threw it in a hole, back there, behind the house,''Smith quoted Johnson as telling him.   Johnson and Doe's officers support a West African plan to imposea cease-fire and install an interim government of non-combatants toorganize fair elections in this West African nation of more than1.7 million people.   Taylor has opposed the transitional administration, and declaredhimself president.   Nigerian Brig. Gen. Joshua Dogonyaro, the new task forcecommander, asked the United States to persuade Taylor to agree totalks, a task force statement said Tuesday. It said Dogonyaro madethe appeal when he called on U.S. Ambassador Peter de Vos lastFriday.   De Vos told reporters Tuesday the United States was continuingits role of passing messages between the warring sides, but wouldnot otherwise intervene.</TEXT></DOC>
