TATRO</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOD, Israel (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Audeh Rantisi remembers that on a Sundaymorning in July 1948 an Israeli soldier came to the door and toldhis mother the family would have to leave the house and go to thecenter of town.   Audeh's father George, a soapmaker and landowner, locked thefront door of the four-room stone house, put the keys in his pocketand started walking. He thought he would be home in time for dinner.   But their footsteps on the dusty road took them into thePalestinian Diaspora, and Audeh's parents did not return to live inLod.   They were among the 600,000 to 760,000 Arabs who left towns andvillages in what is now Israel during the first Arab-Israeli war,according to Benny Morris, an Israeli historian who has studied thePalestinian refugee problem.   The 1948 war started when Israel declared its independence andArab countries attacked the new nation. There was no state thatbelonged to the Palestinians, and many Palestinians who lived inthe area that is now Israel left on the advice of Arab leaders orto escape the war zone.   Arabs who identify themselves as Palestinians now number roughly4.7 million. About half of the Palestinians live in theIsraeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, in the Israeli-annexedsection of Jerusalem or inside the borders of Israel. About 766,000still live in refugee camps.   The rest are scattered.   A 15-month Palestinian uprising that began in December 1987 inthe Israeli-occupied territories and a decision by the UnitedStates to talk with Yasser Arafat's Palestine LiberationOrganization have made the Palestinians and their future a mainelement of the quest for peace.   Because Palestinians living abroad seek the right to return totheir homes, most of which were long ago destroyed or belong toIsraeli families, the Palestinian Diaspora poses one of thethorniest peacemaking problems.   Israeli politicians of the right and left are united in opposingthe return of Palestinians to what is now Israel, and many Israelisare concerned about an influx of former guerrillas andimproverished camp dwellers to a Palestinian state created from theWest Bank and Gaza Strip.   ``The Palestinian can be, and has been, a Kuwaiti, a Jordanian,a Syrian, an American, a European. But he never, under anycircumstances, gave up that identification of being aPalestinian,'' said Dr. Mahdi Abdul Hadi, director of thePalestinian Academy for the Study of International Affairs inJerusalem.   For Audeh Rantisi, then 11, his three younger brothers and twosisters, leaving their home meant joining a stream of thousands ofother Palestinians uprooted from Lod and Ramle on July 12-14, 1948.   ``We didn't realize what was happening until we were out oftown. We hadn't taken anything with us, no money, no papers, noclothes. Nobody thought we were being evicted for good,'' saidAudeh, who is now an Episcopal pastor and political activist in theWest Bank town of Ramallah.   According to Israeli historical accounts, Israeli soldierscleared the towns to secure the strategic highway linking Tel Avivand the besieged city of Jerusalem during the battle forindependence.   The Rantisi house later was rented by the Israeli government toa Jewish family who immigrated from Morocco and was recently torndown to make way for modern apartments. In one of history'sironies, a Palestinian family had begun a Diaspora and a Jewishfamily had returned from the Diaspora.   Other Rantisi family members owned land at Lod where jetairliners now take off and land at Ben-Gurion International Airport.   Like other refugees, the Rantisis dispersed throughout theworld, first driven by war to the West Bank and later seekingrespite abroad from the Israeli occupation or in search of betteropportunities for jobs and education.   Audeh and his two sisters stayed in the West Bank, which Israelseized from Jordan in 1967. But his three brothers moved toToronto, Canada. Elias, 48, works for a candy company, Mahfouz, 41,is an architect and Philip, 46, is a cabinet maker who first wentto Canada after working in Kuwait.   Audeh's daughter Susan, 20, is studying biology at a college inAurora, Ill., and Hilary, 16, goes to a girls' preparatory schoolin Bucknell, England.   Two cousins, Johnny and Isa, are goldsmiths in Amman, Jordan,where they fled after their Beirut shop was ruined in Lebanon'scivil war. Cousin Jamil still runs a grocery in the embattledLebanese capital of Beirut, and cousin Hany operates thetraditional family soapmaking business in Cairo, Egypt.   Other relatives live in San Francisco, Chicago and Kenosha,Wis., where Jacob and John own the Uptown Restaurant.   The only branch of the family to remain in Lod, where only 8,000of the 41,000 residents are Arab, is headed by Ibrahim ``Abu Isa''Rantisi, 86.   Over a cup of coffee laced with cognac, he said the Rantisifamily had lived in Lod since coming from the Mediterranean islandof Crete hundreds of years ago. About 20 percent of Palestiniansare Christians and most of the Rantisis are Greek Orthodox.   Abu Isa watched his grandchildren play with Israelis in thestreets of the mixed neighborhood and said he was resigned toliving as part of a minority in a Jewish state.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
