Tateho, a medium-sized manufacturer of insulating materials, disclosed Sept. 2 that it would report about 20 billion yen ($142.2 million) in losses from unauthorized speculation by company executives in Japanese government bond futures.    Prior to the disclosure, in a move that drew little attention at the time, Nikko Securities Co., Tateho's principal underwriter, sold a net total of 1.4 million Tateho shares on the Osaka Stock Exchange in August, dwarfing transactions by other major securities companies.    The selling became frantic Sept. 2 with Nikko unloading a net 702,000 shares for the day. Exchange authorities stopped trading in Tateho when the share price fell 300 yen ($2.10), the maximum daily decline allowed by exchange rules.    &quot;This certainly seems like a case of insider trading,&quot; Masakazu Kobayashi, an author and critic of Japan's securities industry, says. &quot;It's a case where a big securities company had to know a little manufacturer was speculating on securities. They knew how bad their finances were, and then they went and sold off shares. But then, Japanese don't really know what insider trading is.&quot;    Officials of the Ministry of Finance and the Osaka Stock Exchange have said they are investigating possible insider trading by Tateho and by Nikko and other companies and investors with close ties to the chemical concern.    Nikko says it didn't engage in any insider trading in Tateho shares.    Although Japan is under pressure from the U.S. to toughen its position on insider trading and other securities violations, policing of the markets remains passive here. Profiting from confidential information, although it is illegal, isn't considered seriously taboo.    Japanese securities laws are patterned on those in the U.S., but violators have been prosecuted in court only five times in the past 39 years. Instead, authorities prefer to hold potential abuses in check through administrative guidance and warnings that carry no penalties.    &quot;The Finance Ministry will go this far to investigate the Tateho case, but then they'll obscure the issue,&quot; Seijiro Watanabe, a Tokyo lawyer who represents individual investors, says. &quot;This approach is unique to Japanese capitalism. If this were the Securities and Exchange Commission, they'd prosecute.&quot;    The Tokyo Stock Exchange says its staff of 26 investigators looks into an average of about 800 incidents of suspicious trading a year and issues warnings to listed companies or member brokerages about 30 to 40 times a year.    There have been four or five cases of members being suspended for violations in the past 10 years, Yoshiaki Kinoshita, director of the exchange's trading-surveillance department, says. But details of disciplinary action by the exchange aren't made public.    The Tateho trading inquiry is being handled by a staff of nine investigators at the Osaka exchange, which is the world's third largest stock exchange in total capitalization, after the Tokyo and the New York stock exchanges.    &quot;We've never had a case like this,&quot; Soichi Kiyohara, director of the Osaka exchange's trading-surveillance department, says. &quot;We're still finding out who sold the shares to whom.&quot; He says his staff works without computers, reviewing written records of transactions by hand.    Meanwhile, Japanese regulatory and industry officials are grappling with the problem of defining insider trading.    &quot;It's an information world,&quot; Hiroshi Kurihara, a managing director of the Japan Securities Dealers Association, says. &quot;It's only natural that people try to catch information before anybody else and use it to their advantage. The question is where that information came from.&quot;    ---   Tokyo and London Activity   Tokyo share prices edged up on moderate volume Friday, boosted by buying in telecommunications-related issues.    The Nikkei stock average gained 33.03 to 24828.27. The Tokyo Stock Exchange first section index rose 3.53, or 0.17%, to 2052.49. Volume was 850 million shares, compared with 550 million Thursday.    Traders said the gain in the telecommunications sector reflected speculation about the market effects of a second issue of 1,950,000 shares of Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone, which is expected in November. NTT rose 120,000 to 2,740,000 yen ($19,255) a share.    Tateho Chemical rose 100 to 746. There were rumors that Kyocera, the world's largest maker of ceramic jackets for computer chips, was buying the shares in preparation for a takeover bid. Tateho's products include some silicon substances used in semiconductor manufacture. Kyocera, which denied the rumor, fell 20 to 6,330.    London shares closed at their highs on late buying by market makers responding to Friday's rise on Wall Street. The 100-share index gained 8 to 2261.2 but ended the week with a loss of 13.7. The Financial Times 30-share index closed 2.5 higher at 1763.8. The gold mines index rose 4.1 to 453. Volume jumped to 751.4 million shares from 482.2 million Thursday.    &quot;People had discounted most of the bad figures on the (U.S.) trade deficit,&quot; one dealer said in explaining the brevity of the market's downturn after the $16.47 billion July trade gap was disclosed.    Wellcome gained 24 to 486 pence ($8.01) a share. The company said it was expanding distribution of Retrovir, a drug intended to combat acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Most other drug stocks gained, with Beecham up 11 at 547 and Glaxo Holdings up 4 at 1,684.    Elsewhere, stocks closed at a record high in Hong Kong and rose in Sydney, Singapore, Frankfurt and Brussels, fell in Milan and were mixed in Paris, Zurich and Amsterdam.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
