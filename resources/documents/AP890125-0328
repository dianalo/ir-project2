Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, in television interviewsWednesday morning, said a proposal under review by his departmentwould impose an insurance fee of 25 cents for every $100 indeposits. But, he stressed that the option has not been forwardedyet to Bush.   Brady did not say how the fee would be collected, but hisspokesman, Arthur Siddon, said the fee could be imposed directly ondepositors, or it could be paid by the institutions as an increasein the insurance premium they already pay.   The fee, or premium, would apply to all federally insuredfinancial institutions: banks, Sandamp;Ls and credit unions, Siddon said.   Meantime, the General Accounting Office is preparing a reportwhich says that some of the nation's largest accounting firms failedto uncover fraud and mismanagement at Sandamp;Ls, The Washington Postreported in its Thursday editions.   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, examined the auditsof a dozen failed Sandamp;Ls which were given ``clean audits'' _ meaningno problems were found _ shortly before the Sandamp;Ls went under, thenewspaper said.   Bush, in an interview, appeared to dispute a suggestion the feecould be considered a tax, thus violating his ``Read my lips: No newtaxes'' pledge.   ``I will answer the question with a question. Is (it) a tax whenthe person pays the fee to go to Yosemite Park, using the park? ...There will be a lively debate on this,'' Bush said.   John Sununu, White House chief of staff, said an increase indeposit insurance premiums ``does not pass the duck test andtherefore is not a tax.'' Sununu was referring to a statement byBudget Director Richard Darman, who told Congress that if a proposedrevenue increase was widely perceived by the public as a taxincrease it would not be proposed, saying, ``If it looks like a duck... it's a duck.''   Sununu suggested that the option under consideration could beconsidered a ``modernization'' of deposit insurance premiums, whichhistorically have proved to be too low.   Federal regulators pledged more than $38 billion last year toclose 205 insolvent Sandamp;Ls. More than 350 other insolvent institutionsremain open and billions of dollars more will be required.   The Treasury Department is working on a plan for Bush that wouldraise money and institute reforms to prevent the problem fromreoccurring. Sununu said Bush could select a plan as early as nextweek.   Members of Congress said they have been contacted by TreasuryDepartment officials over the last week or so seeking their reactionto a variety of money-raising ideas.   One option would impose a user fee on mortgage borrowers. Othersinvolve various ways to borrow the money, either on or off budget,with the Treasury paying the interest.   But the deposit fee option, reported in Wednesday editions of TheWashington Post, stirred a furor in the industry and in Congress.   The Post, quoting unidentified sources, said the fee could raise$9 billion a year, which would cover interest payments on the $20billion to $30 billion the government will have to raise for severalyears.   ``The thing is dead on arrival for one reason: It puts animposition of a burden on the depositor and creates an unlevelplaying field against insured financial institutions,'' said Rep.Stan Parris, R-Va., a senior member of the House Banking Committee.   ``I haven't found one member who thought it had any merit,''Parris said, warning that the fee could send deposits flowing intomoney market mutual funds and other uninsured investments offered bybrokerage firms.   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., a senior member of the Senate bankingpanel, called the idea ``incredibly ill-advised.''   ``I will only vote for this idea posthumously and only then ifsomeone casts by proxy against my direct wishes expressed in my lastwill and testament,'' Heinz said.   ``I think it's one of the more absurd ideas that has come downthe pike,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a banking committeemember. ``At a time when we're trying to encourage people to save,to penalize them is nonsensical. ... Politically it's going to beblown out of the water.''   However, other members of Congress said the trial balloon shouldnot be summarily dismissed.   ``I think it underscores how bad all the alternatives are,'' saidRep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa. ``The nature of the solutions is they aregoing to be uncomfortable. All will pinch. ... Our choices arepotentially increasing taxes, potentially increasing the budgetdeficit or some sort of deposit insurance premium increase.''   ``You have to ask yourself what is the least obnoxious of all thealternatives,'' said Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y. ``I don't think itshould be precluded at this time. Some people want to put theirheads in the sand and pretend there's no problem or pretend it won'tbe costly to solve. But there's no free lunch.''   Bank executives, in particular, promised to lobby hard againstthe idea.   ``Taxing bank customers to bail out the savings and loan industrywould be a gross injustice. Ford wasn't asked to bail out Chrysler.Newark wasn't asked to bail out New York,'' said Donald G. Ogilvie,executive vice president of the American Bankers Association.   Robert Dugger, chief economist of the association, warned thatcustomers would end up paying even if the institution paid the feerather than the depositor.   ``One of the things that will happen is that interest rates ondeposits will have to go down if the tax is collected through thebanks. A 5{ percent rate will become something like 5 percent,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
