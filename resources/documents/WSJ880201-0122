The 110-page review of leveraged-buyout activity in the 1980s was done for the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which is conducting hearings on leveraged buy-outs.    The report also says Congress should consider reviewing the adequacy of shareholder and bondholder rights in connection with leveraged buy-outs and takeovers. In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid off with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    The report also shows that the number of completed leveraged buy-outs increased to 308 in 1986 from 99 in 1981. More significantly, those transactions accounted for only 4.6% of the value of all merger and acquisition activity in 1981, but 21.5% of the total value of such activity in 1986.    Without reaching any conclusions, the report suggests that the large amount of debt incurred in all those transactions raises questions about the long-term viability of the acquired concerns and about &quot;the stability of the financial markets in general.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
