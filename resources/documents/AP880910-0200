But the government's massive fraud accusations againstinvestment giant Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. threaten to rock thepublic's already shaky trust in the fairness of the stock market.   By refocusing the 2-year-old insider trading investigation on amajor securities firm, the charges leveled by the Securities andExchange Commission elevated the scandal well beyond the simplegreed of individuals like Ivan Boesky and Dennis Levine.   In so doing, the government heightened public doubts about thevenerable institutions that control the securities business andshape the market's role in the American economy.   Although many investment professionals think the move againstDrexel by the SEC reflects an aggressive government effort to makethe markets fairer, others say that at least for now, the chargesare likely to further erode ordinary Americans' confidence instocks and other securities.   That could mean less business for brokers, less long-terminvesting, more difficulty for companies trying to raise money togrow, rising unemployment, mounting debt and a fall in America'seconomic might, some strategists argue.   ``There's no question this comes at a bad time,'' said PerrinLong, a securities industry expert at Lipper Analytical SecuritiesCorp. in New York. ``It probably lowers confidence as far as theaverage investor is concerned, below what their already-lowconfidence may be.''   Although Long and others said they believe the securitiesindustry in general and Drexel in particular will ultimatelysurvive, ``the sad thing is, if Wall Street doesn't prosper, it'shighly unlikely the country will prosper ... There's a close tie-inall the way around, and it benefits both not to have our imagetarnished. It's a sad situation.''   The staggering civil suit filed by the SEC last Wednesdayagainst Drexel and key employees _ notably its high-yield,high-risk ``junk bond'' unit chief Michael Milken _ accused them ofa vast array of frauds ranging from insider trading to stockmanipulation to client-cheating.   The defendants denied the charges, vowed to vigorously fightthem in court and predicted vindication.   As outlined by the SEC, Drexel engaged in systematic, arrogantabuse of its position as a leading investment firm, calling intoquestion why it is in business in the first place.   ``I would say this particular news story or incident isn'thelpful in terms of bringing the small investor back,'' saidWilliam Gross, managing director of Pacific Investment ManagementCo. of Newport Beach, Calif., which manages a $17 billion portfoliofor large institutional clients such as pension funds.   ``The more headlines you see on trials about insider trading _I'm not commenting on the veracity of this suit _ the more theindividual investor subscribes to the theory that you can't win,''Gross said.   The SEC action had been expected for months and both the stockand bond markets showed little outward reaction. But it raised thelikelihood that the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office will soonbring criminal charges, which would be far more serious and couldpossibly cripple Drexel's ability to do business.   The firm's difficult position also recalls the demise of E.F.Hutton Group Inc., the once-mighty retail brokerage devastated byfraud charges that arose from a check-kiting scandal three yearsago. A debilitated Hutton was sold to Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.last year.   This analogy hasn't been lost on Drexel, which has undertaken anunprecedented television campaign for support, stressing what itcalls the firm's role in raising money for projects ranging fromday-care centers to middle-income housing.   But the SEC move and possible criminal charges may nullify theeffect of that campaign. They also are bound to incite a spree ofsuits from investors who claim they lost money on stocks allegedlymanipulated by Drexel and other defendants.   ``There are two levels of awareness in the marketplace _ youhave the professionals close to the industry who were aware thiswas there, and when it happens, it's a non-event,'' said John W.Bachmann, chairman of the Securities Industry Association. ``Thenthere are the people who heard it along the way and weren't aware,and in that group, it's not a plus.''   Some say the combined effects of all the litigation andpublicity already have made Drexel a tainted household word, muchin the same way that Boesky, the speculator-felon who ledauthorities to the investment firm, became synonymous with WallStreet insider trading a few years ago.   John Markese, vice president and research director for theAmerican Association of Individual Investors in Chicago, said hebelieved the Drexel story and other accounts of alleged securitiesfraud likely would help drive customers away from retailstockbrokers and into large mutual funds, which have greaterdiversity and strength.   But ultimately, he said, the federal crackdown on Wall Streetexcesses probably would help many investors regain some degree ofassurance that the markets aren't totally rigged, regardless ofwhether Drexel exonerates itself.   ``The small investor is always at the bottom of the informationladder. That has always been true, and cases like this point up howtall that ladder is,'' Markese said. ``I think the SEC is trying tomake it a shorter and quicker information flow, so that's allgood.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Rick Gladstone covers business ethics andpractices for The Associated Press.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday Sept. 11</NOTE></DOC>
