The filtering and      level-changing circuit is arranged, in particular, to achieve band-pass      filtering in order to prevent aliasing effects which might arise during      the sampling of the signal by subsequent switched-capacitance processing      circuits, and to attenuate low-frequency components of the signal. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to an interface circuit for use between a      sensor with capacitive impedance, particularly a piezoelectric      accelerometric sensor, and a circuit for processing the signal provided by      the sensor, particularly a filtering circuit with switched capacitors. </PAR><PAR>  Piezoelectric accelerometric sensors are used, for example, in systems for      detecting pinking (knocking) in Otto-cycle internal combustion engines for      motor vehicles.

The sensor has a reference terminal      r and a signal terminal s. In the embodiment illustrated, the terminal r      is connected to earth while the terminal s is connected to the input 1 of      an interface circuit, generally indicated IC, interposed between the      sensor and a circuit 2, such as a filtering circuit with switched      capacitors, for the subsequent processing of the sensor signal. Since the      terminal r of the sensor S is connected to earth, the useful signal      available at the terminal s in use is a signal which varies relative to      zero. </PAR><PAR>  As already stated, the reference terminal r of the sensor S could, however,      be connected to a potential other than earth, for example to a      direct-current voltage supply, and in this case the useful signal would be      a signal whose amplitude would vary relative to the level of that      direct-current voltage. </PAR><PAR>  The interface circuit IC, which is connected as a whole to a direct-current      voltage supply V.sub.DD and to earth, as shown in the conceptual diagram      of FIG. 1, comprises essentially an amplitude limiter 3 connected to a      circuit, generally indicated 4, for filtering the signal and changing its      level. </PAR><PAR>  The amplitude limiter 3 limits the input signal and protects the interface      circuit from excess voltage. </PAR><PAR>  The circuit for filtering the signal and changing its level comprises an      inverting amplifier including </PAR><PAR>  an operational amplifier A whose non-inverting input is connected to a      direct-current reference voltage V.sub.R which is lower than the supply      voltage V.sub.DD and equal, for example, to V.sub.DD /2, </PAR><PAR>  a capacitive impedance circuit Z.sub.1 connected between the inverting      input of the operational amplifier A and the amplitude limiter 3, and </PAR><PAR>  a capacitive impedance circuit Z.sub.2 connected between the inverting      input and the output of the operational amplifier A. </PAR><PAR>  Assuming that the amplitude limiter 3 operates in the linear region of its      characteristic, the transfer function of the interface circuit IC, between      its input and its output, is given by </PAR><EQU>  V.sub.o /V.sub.in andequals;-Y1/Y2andequals;-H.sub.lp .multidot.H.sub.hp </EQU><PAL>  in which </PAL><PAR>  V.sub.in is the voltage input to the interface circuit, </PAR><PAR>  V.sub.o is the voltage output by the interface circuit, </PAR><PAR>  Y1 is the admittance of the circuit Z.sub.1. </PAR><PAR>  Y2 is the admittance of the circuit Z.sub.2, </PAR><PAR>  H.sub.lp is a term representing a low-pass filtering function, and </PAR><PAR>  H.sub.hp is a term representing a high-pass filtering function. </PAR><PAR>  The circuit 4 as a whole thus changes the signal to a d.c. signal and has a      low-pass filtering effect. This circuit is thus able both to limit the      band width of the signal supplied by the sensor (which prevents aliasing      effects in the subsequent sampling of the signal by switched-capacitance      filters) and to have a low-pass filtering effect which attenuates the very      low-frequency components of the signal which are of no interest. </PAR><PAR>  The whole interface circuit IC can be produced in integrated form on a      single substrate by CMOS technology, for example, in the manner which will      now be described with reference to FIG. 2. In this drawing, parts and      components already described above have again been given the same      alphabetical and numerical symbols. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment of FIG. 2, the amplitude limiter 3 comprises two      transistors MP1 and MP2 produced by CMOS technology. The transistor MP1      has its source connected to the input terminal 1 through a resistor      R'.sub.1 and its gate and its drain connected to earth. The transistor MP2      has its gate and its drain connected to the source of MP1 and its source      connected to earth. </PAR><PAR>  The transistors MP1 and MP2, which are normally in the cutoff condition,      limit the level of the input signal to .andplus;-.V.sub.t (the threshold voltage      of the transistors). The level is limited when one of the two transistors      starts to conduct, short-circuiting the input signal to earth. More      particularly, the transistor MP1 limits positive amplitudes and protects      the interface circuit from excessive voltages in the input signal whilst      the transistor MP2 limits the negative amplitude of the signal. </PAR><PAR>  The resistor R'.sub.1 limits the current through the transistors MP1 and      MP2 when the signal reaches levels close to the supply voltage. </PAR><PAR>  If, as in the embodiment shown in the drawings, the sensor S has its      reference terminal connected to earth, the transistors MP1 and MP2 are      p-MOS transistors produced by p-well CMOS technology. If, however, the      reference terminal r of the sensor S is connected to a direct-current      supply, the transistors are n-MOS devices produced by n-well CMOS      technology. In this case, the gate and the drain of MP1 and the source of      MP2 are connected to V.sub.DD instead of to earth. </PAR><PAR>  As stated above, these solutions prevent the problems which may result from      the leakage of stray currents into the substrate. </PAR><PAR>  The use of p-MOS or n-MOS transistors is more advantageous than the use of      ordinary diodes with MOS-technology junctions since they permit a more      dynamic input signal and prevent any current leakage caused by the stray      bipolar transistors. </PAR><PAR>  The filtering and level-changing circuit in the diagram of FIG. 2 has a      transfer function which corresponds to a band-pass filtering effect      between its input and its output. For this purpose, a resistor R&quot;.sub.1      and a capacitor C.sub.1 are interposed in series between the      amplitude-limiting circuit 3 and the inverting input of the operational      amplifier A. Moreover, a resistor R.sub.2 and a capacitor C.sub.2 are      connected in parallel between the inverting input and the output of A. </PAR><PAR>  The transfer function achieved thus assumes the following expression:      ##EQU1##      in which R.sub.1 andequals;R'.sub.1 andplus;R&quot;.sub.1. </PAR><PAR>  In particular, this transfer function has two poles which determine its      low-pass and high-pass behaviour respectively at the frequencies      ##EQU2##      The pole at frequency f.sub.lp is intended to limit the band width of the      signal and may, for example, be at a frequency of approximately 60 kHz.      The formation of R.sub.1 and C.sub.1 by CMOS technology in order to ensure      such a value of f.sub.lp does not pose particular problems. In fact a pole      at 60 kHz can easily be achieved, for example, with a 20 pf capacitor and      a 132 kohm resistor, which values can be integrated on a silicon substrate      of quite large, but nevertheless acceptable area. </PAR><PAR>  Problems may arise, however, in the formation of the pole at the frequency      f.sub.hp, particularly when this frequency has to be quite low. If, for      example, this frequency must assume a value of about 600 Hz and if C.sub.2      has a value of 20 pF, a resistor with a resistance R.sub.2 of about 13      Mohms is required and this is an unacceptable value for production in an      integrated circuit. </PAR><PAR>  In such cases, the solution shown in FIG. 3 may be adopted. In the      arrangement shown in this drawing, a switched-capacitance circuit,      generally indicated 10, is provided in parallel with the capacitor      C.sub.2. This circuit comprises a capacitor C.sub.R whose plates are      connected to those of C.sub.2 through two switching circuits comprising      respective first switches 11 and 21, connected between the plates of      C.sub.R and the homologous plates of C.sub.2, and respective second      switches 12 and 22, connected between the plates of C.sub.R and earth. </PAR><PAR>  In use, the switches 11 and 21 are operatively connected so as to switch on      and off in phase with each other by means of a clock signal .phi. of      frequency f.sub.ck. </PAR><PAR>  The switches 12 and 22, however, are also operatively connected to switch      on and off in phase with each other, but in counterphase with the switches      11 and 21 (.phi.). </PAR><PAR>  The switched capacitor circuit 10 as a whole simulates a resistor with a      resistance equivalent to      ##EQU3##      where f.sub.ck is the clock frequency used. </PAR><PAR>  Thus if f.sub.ck is 150 kHz, C.sub.2 is 20 pF and C.sub.R is 0.5 pF, a pole      is obtained at the frequency      ##EQU4##      It is important to stress that the solution in FIG. 3 is compatible with      the need to limit the band width of the signal in order to prevent      aliasing of the sampled signal. In fact, the operational amplifier A,      which operates by sampling in discrete time domains, &quot;sees&quot;, as its input,      the signal current which in effect is filtered continuously by the      resistance R.sub.1 andequals;R'.sub.1 andplus;R&quot;.sub.1 and by the capacitor C.sub.1. </PAR><PAR>  Finally, the resistor R&quot;.sub.1 can be formed in a distributed manner so as      to increase the equivalent attenuation at high frequencies. </PAR><PAR>  The interface circuit described above can be integrated by CMOS technology      on a single substrate on which circuits for the subsequent processing of      the signal can also be integrated conveniently. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
