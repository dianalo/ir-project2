Yet despite the extensive war games Turkey has organizedalong its mountainous, 200-mile border with Iraq, aless-warlike message is repeated by everyone from companycommanders to the new Turkish chief of general staff, Gen.Dogan Gures: The Turkish military has been deployed to defendTurkey's border, not to attack Iraq.</LP><TEXT>   Foreigners no longer are allowed to travel without permitsin southeast Turkey near the Iraqi border or the Silopivalley, site of the main Turkey-Iraq highway through a gap inthe mountains of Kurdistan. The area is the most probabletheater if fighting breaks out between Turkey, an ally of theWest in the confrontation with Saddam Hussein, and Iraq.   And reporters permitted to travel in the vicinity, whilethey were shown some of the military exercises, weren'tallowed to see the scores of tanks and artillery pieces thathave been sent to the southeast by ship, train and truck.   There were no signs of any offensive massing near Silopiby the estimated 120,000 troops Turkey now has along theIraqi border. Gen. Gures estimated the opposing Iraqistrength as seven divisions, about 70,000 men said bymilitary attaches to be second-line troops.   Long military convoys of as many as 85 trucks, jeeps andambulances still clogged the old Silk Road east toward Iraqlast Friday, taking the place of the 5,000 trucks a day thatonce carried Turkey's lucrative trade with Baghdad and thePersian Gulf region. In the opposite lane leading west, asteady trickle of local people fled the border area withhousehold goods and families loaded into the backs of cars,trucks and tractors. Their businesses have been killed off bythe economic embargo of Iraq, and they fear an Iraqi chemicalattack.   Turks all over the country are getting nervous about war,stocking up food and withdrawing deposits from banks. Stateradio and television carry repeated statements by PresidentTurgut Ozal and the prime minister that there will be noTurkish second front if war breaks out in the Gulf.   The border buildup by Turkey's 800,000-man armed forces,the second biggest in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,is purely to deter an attack by Iraq, Mr. Ozal says. Turkishofficials privately add that it is also a warning to Iran andSyria that Turkey won't stand by, if they try to acquireterritory in case Iraq is defeated.   NATO has sent more than 40 jets from Europe to reinforceTurkey's defenses against Iraq, and Ankara said yesterdaythat the U.S. would double its Air Force contingent in Turkeyto 96 planes for the same purpose. Turkish opposition leadershave accused Mr. Ozal of willingness to let Washington open asecond front against Iraq in the event of war, which theybelieve would invite an Iraqi response and drag Turkey intothe conflict.   But despite the announcement, officials said Turkeywouldn't enter a war against Iraq except in self-defense.&quot;Turkey doesn't have any plans to open a second front,&quot; PrimeMinister Yildirim Akbulut told reporters yesterday.   But some diplomats and the Turkish political opposition,which organized an antiwar rally by 40,000 people nearIstanbul on Sunday, aren't convinced.   Ugur Mumcu, senior commentator at Cumhuriyet, reminded hisreaders that German manipulation of a Turkish leader draggedTurkey into its disastrous involvement in World War I. &quot;Don'tbe fooled. The Pentagon has similar plans today {withIncirlik},&quot; Mr. Mumcu said.   The government brushes aside such criticism as domesticpolitical opportunism, and Mr. Ozal reassured Turks lastweek, &quot;We are trying above all to emerge from this powerfuland without suffering major damage.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
