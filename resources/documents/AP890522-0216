Baker III urgedIsrael on Monday to stop settling Jews on the West Bank and in Gazaand to give up any aspirations of annexing territories capturedfrom Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day war.   Baker, in a speech to an American Jewish group, said, ``Now isthe time to lay aside, once and for all, the unrealistic vision ofa greater Israel.''   He also called on Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government toreopen schools on the West Bank and in Gaza closed by Israeliauthorities attempting to cope with a Palestinian uprising.   ``Reach out to the Palestinians as neighbors who deservepolitical rights,'' Baker said in the speech to the American IsraelPublic Affairs Committee, a private research and lobbying groupholding a convention here.   At the same time, Baker called on Palestinian Arabs to abandon``the illusion of control over all of Palestine'' _ meaning Israelapart from the West Bank and Gaza.   He also urged the Arab world to end its economic boycott of theJewish state and to recognize Israel ``as a neighbor and partner intrade and human contact.''   Baker's speech, which he gave before meeting with IsraeliDefense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, represented a hardened U.S. stancetoward Jerusalem while also appealing for concessions from radicalArabs.   He said the United States would not ``dictate an outcome'' tothe negotiations Baker hopes will spring from a proposal by Shamirto hold elections among Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza.   But, Baker said, ``we do have an idea about the reasonablemiddle ground to which a settlement should be directed.'' He thenproceeded to stake out a position on many controversial issues,including Israel's control of the West Bank and Gaza.   He said Palestinian self-government in the territories wouldprovide ``ample protection'' for Israel's security.   Baker did not explicitly rule out retention by Israel of some ofthe territory, as Rabin and several other leading Israelis say isessential to deter another Arab attack.   But Baker stressed that Israelis ought to get used to the ideaof a negotiated settlement that ``will in all probability involveterritorial withdrawal and the emergence of a new politicalreality.''   In terse terms, he told Israel: ``Forswear annexation. Stopsettlement activity. Allow schools to reopen.''   At the same time, Baker reiterated that the United States didnot support creation of an independent Palestinian state.   Rabin, talking to reporters after a 70-minute meeting withBaker, said schools in Gaza were open with 200,000 students inattendance. But on the West Bank, the Israeli official said, ``welearned that once schools are opened the confrontation between kidsand the military forces of Israel increase the number of casualtiesamong youngsters.''   Rabin said he had not read Baker's speech, which was deliveredabout an hour before their meeting. But he said the key question atthe moment was whether Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza wouldengage Israel in negotiations as proposed by Jerusalem.   ``We learned that once a peace process starts it has its ownmomentum,'' Rabin said.   The Israeli official said he and Baker concentrated on how toget elections going and ``how to remove the threat of terror'' thatkeeps Palestinians from participating in Shamir's proposal.   Rabin said many Palestinians ``realize that what Israel hasoffered is a unique opportunity'' but they were holding back out offear of assassination.   Shamir's two-step plan involves electing Palestinian leaders tonegotiate temporary self-rule and then holding negotiations amongIsrael, Palestinians, Jordan and Egypt on an overall settlement.   Earlier, Rabin reviewed the military situation in the MiddleEast with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney without broaching anyrequests for new weapons deals, defense officials said.   The officials, who asked not to be named, said Rabin and Cheneymet privately and with other officials for more than an hour at thePentagon, with Rabin offering the newly installed Cheney a progressreport on the overall situation in the Middle East.   Rabin and Cheney did not discuss ``in any detail'' Israel'slatest regional initiative, the sources said. Rabin and PresidentBush are expected to delve more deeply into that issue during WhiteHouse talks on Wednesday.   Seymour D. Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents ofMajor American Jewish Organizations, said in a statement that``Baker deserves praise for calling on the Palestinian Arabs toabandon violence and to reach out to Israel to convince the Jewishstate of their peaceful intentions.''   Also, Reich said, ``we are gratified by Secretary Baker's wordsurging the Palestinians to abandon their hopes of destroying Israeland to renounce all talk of taking over Israel in stages.''   The Jewish leader said the major issue, however, was bringing ahalt to the Palestinian uprising and accepting Israel's plan forfree elections.</TEXT></DOC>
