Ortega, who shattered the tranquility of a two-day Hemispheric``celebration of democracy'' with his military plans, latersoftened his stand and said he would decide Tuesday whether toextend the cease-fire.   He accused the Contras of mounting ``waves of attacks'' insideNicaragua.   The two leaders clashed at rival news conferences that upstagedthe ending to the two-day conference, and the most personallanguage by far came from Bush.   The president belittled the leftist Nicaraguan leader as ``thislittle man _ showing up in his military uniform at a democracymeeting,'' and said Ortega ``looks like that unwanted animal at agarden party.''   A spokesman for Costa Rica's President Oscar Arias, host of thegathering, said Ortega had ``dashed cold water on the party, sincehe was invited to a party for democracy and should have behavedproperly.''   ``Nothing like this has ever been seen before,'' said JorgeUrbina.   At the United Nations, General Secretary Javier Perez de Cuellarsaid he was ``extremely concerned'' about the recent clashesbetween the Contras and the Sandinista forces and the apparentbreakdown of the cease-fire.   He expressed his ``strong wish'' that both sides exerciserestraint so that the peace process may continue.   In Nicaragua, government troops were reportedly being moved tostrategic points in what could be preparations for new militaryoperations.   Government-run Radio Catarran in central Chontales province saidmore than 1,000 soldiers from Managua were being transported toguard the strategically important Rama Road after rebel activity inthe area.   The final act of the two-day summit _ dedication of an outdoor``Democracy Plaza'' in the Costa Rican capital _ was played outwithout Ortega, who left for home early.   School children carrying the flags of the nations representedmade up more than half of the crowd, which did not quite fill thesquare. Bush watched the ceremony from behind a thick, transparentbullet-proof shield that had been installed by the Secret Service.   Before departing, Ortega underscored his intention to break the19-month-old cease-fire between forces of his leftist Sandinistagovernment and the Contra guerrillas.   But after arriving back in Managua, he told reporters he wouldannounce on Tuesday whether the truce would be extended for anothermonth, as it has almost monthly since March 1988.   Ortega said Arias and Carlos Andres Perez, president ofVenezuela, had offered to mediate any discussions between theUnited States and the Sandinistas.   ``The waves of attacks by the counterrevolutionaries haveincreased enormously in the last few weeks. The objective is thedestruction of the electoral process in Nicaragua,'' said Ortega,who is running for re-election in Feb. 25 elections.   He said he would continue observing the truce only if non-lethalAmerican aid currently going to the Contras were used, instead, todemobilize the rebels. Bush said he had encouraged the Contras``not to take aggressive military action, and we would certainlycontinue to do that.''   In comments after speaking to the Costa Rican journalistsassociation, Perez pledged to ``work to make sure that Ortega'sdecision is not carried out.'' He said he thought the conflictcould still be mediated and that he, Arias and other Latin Americanleaders would be able to help.   After an early morning tennis game with Argentine PresidentCarlos Saul Menem, Bush met privately with Nicaraguan oppositionpresidential candidate Violeta Chamorro and Panamanian oppositionleader Guillermo Endara as well as a group of Costa Rican politicalfigures.   He emerged afterwards to tell a news conference that several ofthe leaders at the conference have told Ortega it would be ``sheerfolly'' to resume hostilities.   ``He (Ortega) knows that if there's an all-put militaryoffensive, that's going to change the equation 180 degrees,'' Bushsaid.   Asked if that meant he would seek more military aid for theContras, Bush said, ``We'll let you know. We'll let you know.''   He also said, ``I don't think the Contras ought to attack. Whatwe ought to do is fulfill the agreements'' forged by Arias.   He added, ``We have encouraged the Contras not to takeaggressive military action. And we would certainly continue to dothat.''   Under Arias' plan, Ortega had agreed to hold free elections inNicaragua in February and the United States had withheld militaryaid to the Contras.   Faced with resistance from Congress for providing more arms forthe Contras, Bush reversed eight years of President Ronald Reagan'spolicy by endorsing a diplomatic rather than a military solution tothe Nicaraguan conflict.   Bush, en route back to Washington aboard Air Force One, toldreporters, ``It was a great visit.'' Asked about the tone of hiscriticisms of Ortega, Bush said only, ``Speaks for itself.''   An administration official who asked not to be identified saidOrtega's move may be intended to give the Sandinistas ``an excuseto tighten up internally'' and ``to have troops out to intimidatepeople'' before the February elections.   At his news conference, Bush blistered Ortega with unrelentingcriticism, sarcasm and insults.   Professing bewilderment at Ortega's decision, Bush said, ``Ican't figure it out. ... I've asked our own folks, what in heaven'sname would make a person do something so counterproductive _ stickhim out like a sore thumb amongst a bunch of democratically-electedleaders, offend a host (Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.''   Referring to his handshake with Ortega on Friday, Bush said,``He's always kind of sidling up to me looking for some photo op.What he ought to do is talk to the (Nicaraguan) resistance.''   Bush called Ortega's action ``a shameful blow to democracy.''   Warning Ortega not to backtrack from presidential elections onFeb. 25, Bush said, ``The people of this hemisphere know thedifference between real elections and sham elections, and thehemisphere will not settle for anything less than free and fairelections.''   Bush also took aim at Panamanian ruler, Manuel Antonio Noriega,saying he represented an outlaw regime that ``simply must bereplaced.''   The president said Noriega ``may think his lead pipe politicshave won, but he's won nothing more than a fragile status quo. Anddemocracy really will triumph in Panama, I'm confident of that.''</TEXT></DOC>
