The justices, without comment, rejected a request by IllinoisAttorney General Neil F. Hartigan that they restudy the law ``afterthe appointment of a ninth justice.''   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joined the court last Thursday,filling an eight-month vacancy. He did not participate in today'sorder denying reconsideration.   Despite his 12-year tenure as a federal appeals court judge,Kennedy's legal views on abortion are unknown.   The high court's decision in December was not accompanied by awritten opinion, but merely upheld a ruling that the challengedIllinois law impermissibly interfered with abortion rights.   Such even splits among the justices automatically uphold lowercourt decisions in the particular cases but set no nationalprecedent.   In seeking reconsideration, Hartigan emphasized the importanceof ``a decision by a full court'' in the case.   The Illinois law required that girls under 18 and stillfinancially dependent on their parents notify both parents 24 hoursbefore having an abortion.   The law allowed a girl to avoid notifying her parents if shecould prove to a state judge that she was mature enough andwell-informed enough to make the decision on her own and thatnotifying her parents would not be in her best interest.   Doctors who failed to comply with the law's requirement facedcriminal prosecution.   A federal appeals court ruled that the 24-hour waiting period isan impermissible infringement on the right to have an abortion,established by a landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision.   The appeals court also said the Illinois law provision forparental notification or judicial permission could not be enforcedbecause it did not ensure confidentiality and anonymity for girlswho appeal when a judge denies permission for an abortion.</TEXT></DOC>
