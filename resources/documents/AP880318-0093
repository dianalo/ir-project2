The regents voted 7-1 Thursday against divestment, despiteopposition from about 80 students who attended the meeting. Severalof the students staged a one-hour occupation of the room while theregents broke for lunch.   Students rushed to the regents' tables and jumped onto them,breaking one. They rapped regents' nameplates on the table andtossed papers across the room. Some yelled, ``Free our bloodydollars.'' No one was arrested.   CU spokeswoman Pauline Coker said the university's onlyinvestment in a firm doing business with South Africa is slightlymore than $300,000 in Caterpillar Co. bonds that mature in 1992.   Student Michelle Clifford had said chances the regents wouldvote to divest were slim. ``But this is just the beginning,'' shesaid.   About 100 students at CU's Boulder campus staged a ``die-in''Wednesday in an effort to dramatize South African repression.Clifford said students carried toy guns and shot others whopretended to die.   Up to 130 students have been spending nights in makeshiftshanties for the past two weeks to dramatize opposition toapartheid. A shanty also was put up on Wednesday in Denver at thecampus shared by the University of Colorado, Metropolitan StateCollege and Denver Community College.</TEXT></DOC>
