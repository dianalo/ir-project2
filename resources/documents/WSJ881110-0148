Memos from the Food and Drug Administration accompanying the study -- performed more than a year ago -- say that &quot;while there is no direct proof that silicone causes cancer in humans, there is considerable reason to suspect that it can do so.&quot;    Information about the study and the FDA memos was released yesterday by Public Citizen Health Research Group, a Washington-based consumer advocacy group that says it obtained the material from a source at the FDA.    &quot;Despite the worrisome results, the public has not been warned,&quot; says Sidney M. Wolfe, a physician and director of Public Citizen. About 130,000 breast implants using silicone gel are performed annually, and about two million women have received the implants since the process was begun about 25 years ago. Public Citizen called for an immediate halt to such procedures, which are used for cosmetic purposes and for breast reconstruction after a mastectomy.    The study was conducted by Dow Corning Corp., the main producer of silicone gel in the U.S. The company is a joint venture of Dow Chemical Co. in Midland, Mich., and Corning Glass Works in Corning, N.Y.    While acknowledging that silicone implants did produce tumors in rats, a Dow Corning spokesman says, &quot;Patients face no significant risk. All the available data to date show that implants in humans are safe when used appropriately.&quot;    In a prepared statement, the FDA said it had already decided to convene an advisory panel to review the problem before Public Citizen's announcement. But the agency said the only other action it would take now would be to review labeling information on silicone products so that physicians were aware of the potential risks.    Although the FDA said the risk of cancer from silicone implants, if it exists, would be small, the agency added that &quot;the possibility cannot be completely ruled out.&quot;    Dow Corning says it began the study in 1986 in anticipation of an FDA requirement to submit safety data on breast implants. The study was designed to determine if silicone gel would cause cancer in tested rats. About 21% of the animals injected with a gel used before 1976 developed tumors. About 24% of animals in a second group injected with the gel currently in use also developed tumors.    But those findings were &quot;no surprise,&quot; according to Robert Grupp, the spokesman for Dow Corning. &quot;Anytime a solid object is placed in a rodent, you get tumor growth at the site of the implant. That's called the 'solid-state' concept. But it's not applicable to humans.&quot;    But FDA staff members, according to Public Citizen, wrote that: &quot;Solid-state tumor has been reported in rats, mice, chickens, rabbits and dogs. It is biologically unconvincing that man is a uniquely resistant species.&quot;    Moreover, the FDA memos noted that the tumors in the Dow Corning study were different from &quot;classical&quot; solid-state tumors in that they spread throughout the animals and were highly lethal.    Dow Corning says it gave the FDA preliminary findings in 1987 and the complete study in September. The FDA said it hasn't discussed the findings before now because the information was &quot;proprietary.&quot;    In 1982, according to Public Citizen, the FDA published in the Federal Register its determination that silicone gel breast implants &quot;present a potential unreasonable risk of injury.&quot; But the agency acknowledged that it didn't require companies to submit safety data until this year. &quot;We're a small agency,&quot; says a spokesman. &quot;It's a matter of resources.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
