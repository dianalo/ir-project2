The sales are part of a restructuring begun in 1989 withthe divestiture of operations in gold mining, geothermalsteam and nitrogen fertilizer.</LP><TEXT>   The company, based in New Orleans, said the latest plannedsales continue its strategy of parting with existing energyproperties in favor of the higher profit margins yielded fromdiscovering new supplies.   Yesterday's announced sale price &quot;may be slightly betterthan expected,&quot; said Michael Millman, an analyst at ShearsonLehman Hutton. &quot;They're cashing out of energy-assetmanagement, where returns are lower than in exploration. Thestrength of this company is in finding new properties.&quot;   To be sure, Freeport still owns considerable energyassets. Yesterday's agreement involves just 38% of thecompany's total oil and gas reserves. More than half thereserves being sold are in the Gulf of Mexico region. Thereserve totals in yesterday's sale: 17.8 million barrels ofoil and 288.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas.   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,Freeport shares were quoted at $37.875, up $1.75.   In December, Freeport said it wants to sell at least $750million of oil and gas reserves and mineral assets bymid-1991, thus shedding about 50% of its energy reserves. Aspokesman reiterated that goal yesterday. He said futuresales of other oil and gas reserves are likely. &quot;We havepotential buyers coming in to review those assets on acontinuing basis,&quot; he said.   The company insists such sales aren't a prelude to gettingout of the energy business. In the first quarter, metalsaccounted for 60% of the company's pretax income,agricultural minerals 27% and energy 13%. The company isdeveloping a $550 million copper and gold-mine project inIndonesia, where it expects to hit peak production by early1992. The company is also developing an $800 million sulfurand oil project in the Gulf of Mexico; the oil part isexpected to be in production in the fourth quarter this yearand the sulfur in mid-1992.   Certain of the reserves in yesterday's sale weren't fullydeveloped last year, and some others weren't always producingbecause of maintenance -- reducing their contributions toFreeport's 1990 net income of $300.8 million, or $5.22 ashare. Net included $242.7 million from the sale of otherassets. Revenue was $1.6 billion.   Besides helping fund exploration for new energy reserves,the latest asset sale will be used to reduce bank debt, thecompany said. Certain of the latest sales are subject tonegotiation of definitive agreements and government approval,among other things. Freeport said it expects to complete thesales &quot;over the next few months.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
