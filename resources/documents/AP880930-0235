(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Negotiators for Caterpillar Inc. and theUnited Auto Workers union today agreed to extend their contractindefinitely while barganing continued toward a new pact, avoidinga midnight strike deadline, officials said.   The move will keep some 17,500 Caterpillar workers in fivestates on the job while negotiations continue.   A midnight strike deadline still loomed for farm equipment makerDeere andamp; Co., which is negotiating with the UAW on a new labor pactnear the company's Moline, Ill., headquarters.   The Caterpillar extension came less than 12 hours before thecurrent labor agreement was to expire and follows two months ofunsuccessful negotiations between the union and Caterpillar _world's largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment _ and theunion.   The decision to extend the negotiations puts on hold strikeplans by the company's blue-collar workforce in factories in 12cities in Illinois, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Colorado and Tennessee.   Each side must give five days' notice if they wish to terminatethe agreement, said Bill Price, assistant to the bargainingcommittee chairman for UAW Local 974, which represents 10,033Caterpillar workers in Peoria.   ``We just found out,'' Price said. ``It couldn't have been morethan 15 minutes ago.''   Main union objectives included merit pay increases for the firsttime in a decade, 100 percent job security, a reduction in overtimeand call-back of 1,000 laid-off UAW members.   The union reportedly was seeking a 3-year pact and a 3 percentwage increase in each year of the agreement.   Caterpillar officials have taken a position of holding downcosts and in past talks sought more flexibility in job assignmentsand scheduling, as well as a more simplified grievance procedureand new guidelines for overtime.   The company wants to restrict employee mobility, saving money onretraining and getting more productivity out of its workforce.   On Thursday, UAW officials at Deere plants in Iowa reported anunusual amount of overtime and double shifts recently as Deere, theleading manufacturer of farm tractors and agricultural implements,struggled to meet back-orders in the face of a possible strike.   ``Our people have had a lot of overtime,'' said Jerry Niedert,vice president for UAW Local 838 in Waterloo, Iowa. ``There hasbeen overtime in all areas. It's excessive.   ``We've got people working 16 hours a day, double shifts. Someguys are working seven days a week. We're talking lots of people _hundreds.''   Niedert said the 5,300 union workers at five Deere plants inWaterloo are ready to walk out if a new work agreement isn'treached when the contract expires.   Karl Mantyla, UAW spokesman in Detroit, said the union is notinterested in extending Deere's labor contract.   Larry Solomon of Local 751 in Decatur, Ill., said he also favorsno extension.   ``If we let them drag their feet now, they're just going to keepon dragging their feet,'' Solomon said. ``Who knows when we'll getan agreement.''   Brian Alm, a Deere spokesman, rejected Niedert's contention thatthe overtime was designed to build company inventories in the eventof a walkout. He said a settlement is expected before the deadline.   ``We've been selling everything we can get our hands on,'' Almsaid. ``In some areas, we've got a back-order situation.''   The UAW-Deere talks affect about 13,400 active employees, and4,000 laid-off workers, at 11 cities in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota,Colorado and Georgia. Deere employs about 38,000 employeesworldwide.   UAW officials have been meeting with Deere since Aug. 11 at anegotiating site a few miles from the company's world headquartersin Moline.   Deere workers want to restore salary cuts suffered in their 1987contract. They also want 100 percent job security and pensionimprovements.   As the Caterpillar talks continued, workers in Peoria-area shopsread about the talks in a special ``negotiations extra'' newsletter.   In the publication, Tony Green, president of the Peoria-arealocal which represents about 10,000 employees, warned his troops tobe ready to walk out if no settlement is achieved.   Dated Sept. 21, the letter instructs union members of their dutyto strike, how to collect strike pay and other issues.   ``If a strike occurs, believe me, it will not be the fault ofthe UAW, but Caterpillar Inc.'s fault,'' Green said in a signedcolumn.   Another column, by John Hankins of the bargaining committee,portrayed the UAW-Caterpillar talks as terse exchanges.   ``The company sets there and says `I hear you. Not interested,''' Hankins said.   Meanwhile, negotiators continued to study the latest offer fromCaterpillar, which company spokesman Mark Polzin described as ``asignificant modification'' of earlier offers.   UAW spokesman Jack Roberts said the union spent much of the daywriting a counterproposal which was presented to the company in anevening meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
