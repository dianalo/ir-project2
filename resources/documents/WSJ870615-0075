BirnbaumStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Wayne Owens was plotting his return to Congress last year, an old colleague asked him, &quot;What the heck do you want to come back here for?&quot;    &quot;The only thing worse than being here is not being here,&quot; replied the former -- and now current -- congressman.    The Utah Democrat gave up his seat in the House in 1974 to wage what turned out to be an unsuccessful campaign for the Senate. Twelve years later, he sought and recaptured his House seat, representing Salt Lake City.    The Congress he returned to this year is markedly different than the one he left. The liberal lawmaker sees the place as less encrusted by the entrenched power of elderly committee chairmen and more open to the ideas of newcomers like himself. But, he adds, it also is more bombarded by sophisticated lobbying techniques, more confounded by such pressing fiscal problems as the federal budget deficit and more obsessed with political fund-raising -- awash in campaign cash.    Mr. Owens served a single, two-year term at the end of the Nixon administration. But that brief period produced some far-reaching changes in the way Congress operates. Political-action committees were created, and so was the congressional budget process -- two &quot;reforms&quot; that are now facing criticism and renewed attempts at alteration.    The House also began to abandon its strict reliance on seniority to determine committee chairmanships. And it conducted the impeachment investigation of President Nixon, an experience that in some ways is being echoed by the current congressional probe into the Reagan White House's role in the Iran-Contra scandal.    In 1974, Mr. Owens was a vocal member of the House Judiciary Committee that approved three articles of impeachment 10 days before President Nixon resigned. But in 1987, Mr. Owens says he wouldn't have served on the Iran-Contra panel, even if he had been asked. Though he says he was honored to witness the American system work during the Watergate inquiry, his own role in that drama probably cost him the Senate seat in 1974; Richard Nixon won 72% of the popular vote in Utah during the previous election.    Ironically, Rep. Owens was instrumental in opening the impeachment hearings to television, an action that emblazoned his own presence on the panel in the minds of voters back home. Television later was extended to House floor proceedings, and produced what Mr. Owens sees as one of its most profound changes.    He says he is appalled by his colleagues' use of the House TV for flagrant self-promotion. Brief speeches at the start of each session, called &quot;one-minutes,&quot; formerly took up only a few minutes each day. Now they stretch for a half-hour or more as members alert broadcasters to tape their orations for local newscasts.    Another media opportunity, called &quot;special orders,&quot; comes at day's end. During Rep. Owens's first go-round, few lawmakers sought the time -- as much as 60 minutes -- available to them on the House floor, because there wasn't much incentive to speak for so long to an empty chamber. But now, special orders sometimes last for hours under the cameras' constant gaze.    On the other hand, televised debates make it easier today than it was years ago for members to keep track of the issues, Mr. Owens says. He now spends less time on the House floor than he used to, and believes members' comments are better prepared. &quot;Television is here to stay,&quot; he says, &quot;and its impact is basically good.&quot;    The 50-year-old lawmaker isn't so upbeat about the effect of the campaign-finance &quot;reforms&quot; that were passed during his first two years in Congress. The political-action committees established then were intended to give small contributors a bigger voice in Congress. Instead, he asserts, PACs have become the vehicle for the torrent of money that is funneled from powerful interests into the coffers of mainly incumbent congressmen.    The result is what Rep. Owens bemoans as a &quot;defeat-proof&quot; House that is consumed with -- and broadly influenced by -- fund-raising. Mr. Owens himself raised and spent $800,000, a record for a Utah House campaign, to get elected last year. In his House race in 1972, he spent $130,000. He is now working to place limits on campaign spending and to begin public financing for congressional races. His view, he says, makes him &quot;something of a pariah&quot; to some of his colleagues.    Another big change is the increased adroitness of interest groups in lobbying representatives. &quot;In those 12 years I was gone, basically every group you can think of has developed a Washington office or a national association aimed at presenting their case to Congress,&quot; he says. To get the ear of their congressmen, these new organizations routinely utilize home-state delegations. As a result, Mr. Owens says he meets with Utah constituents here in Washington perhaps five times a day; a dozen years ago, it was five times a week.    Some corporations use more subtle lobbying methods. Mr. Owens says he was handily defeated in his recent attempt to kill the C-17 transport plane for the military because McDonnell-Douglas Corp. had plants making its parts in about 100 congressional districts in 27 states. His legislation, he says, &quot;was doomed even before we took it up.&quot;    This tendency for lawmakers to support projects in their own districts is what Rep. Owens says has defeated the good intentions of those who shaped the congressional budget process in 1974. Then, Mr. Owens and others were attempting to keep track of the deficits with a new Congressional Budget Office and to actually reduce them with the oversight of a special Budget Committee.    But process hasn't proved to be an adequate substitute for consensus, he says: &quot;It didn't work because nobody wants to kill programs.&quot; He now backs a constitutional amendment that would make it harder for Congress to spend more than the government collects in revenue in a given year.    The soft-spoken Rep. Owens says he is happy to be back in Congress, the place, he says, &quot;where you can make changes.&quot; During his absence, he headed a Mormon mission in Montreal, practiced law and ran unsuccessfully for governor of Utah. But now he says he is where he wants to be. He told the recent graduating class of his alma mater, Panguitch (Utah) High School: &quot;What I wanted to do when I was sitting in your chair, I am doing right now.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
