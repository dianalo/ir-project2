Rep. William L. Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on theHouse Armed Services Committee, said Bush insisted at the WhiteHouse meeting that it would be ``devastating to arms controlefforts if Congress would not authorize the B-2.''   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed ServicesCommittee, had said Thursday that Congress needs more informationon the costly radar-evading plane before deciding whether to killit or spend more money.   Rep. John G. Rowland, R-Conn., said he was unconvinced by Bush'sargument for full financing, and suggested a compromise that wouldallow 13 planes to be built while testing continued through 1993.He said Bush rejected the offer.   ``I was not convinced by the president's remarks,'' Rowlandsaid, adding ``there are a small number of Republicans andhopefully a large number of Democrats'' who believe testing shouldbe completed before a commitment is made to build the 132 planesthat the administration wants.   ``By 1993 we will have purchased 44 planes'' at a cost of $40billion, Rowland said, adding it is a better idea to build 13,``fly them around ... develop them and then make a determination.''   Bush began his personal involvement in the administration'sdefense push Thursday, calling Aspin and other members of the HouseArmed Services and Appropriations committees to the White House.   He pressed them to back his budget proposals for the B-2, aswell as the Strategic Defense Initiative, the MX missile and theMidgetman missile.   The House and Senate are scheduled to vote next week on thoseprograms and a package of Pentagon cuts the administration proposedto meet a $10 billion reduction target in the defense budget agreedto by congressional and administration negotiators.   Bush told lawmakers the package and the weapons systems areessential to the nation's deterrent capability and to the U.S.strategy at the arms reduction talks in Geneva, said White Housepress secretary Marlin Fitzwater.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, meanwhile, pressed the B-2's caseto House Republicans, who are divided on the issue.   The Pentagon hopes to buy 132 planes at a cost of about $70billion.   In fiscal 1990, the Defense Department has proposed spending$4.7 billion for the B-2, but last month the House Armed Servicespanel cut $800 million from the budget.   Aspin told reporters after the White House meeting he could notpredict which way Congress would go on the Pentagon spending bill.   ``I say, give the opponents of the B-2 an up-or-down vote. Ifthe Congress is willing to step up to this issue this year, I saylet's do it,'' Aspin said.   If other efforts to limit production of the plane fail, Aspinsaid he will propose funding production of only two bombers in 1990and 1991, when the administration wants eight bombers. Hisamendment would meet the full request for research and developmentwork over that period.   He called his amendment ``a cold turkey fence of the procurementmoney until Congress acts again.''   Aspin said his plan ``shuts down the program, but it gives theadministration a chance to come up with another program that'spolitically more acceptable _ financially.''</TEXT></DOC>
