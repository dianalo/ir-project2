('TrojanHorse' computer virus)andM;</TITLE><SUMMARY>The 'AIDS Information Disk' sent to thousands of users in the US,England, and other countries contains the so-called 'PanamaTrojan' virus, a program that prevents hard disk access.andP;  It hasbeen distributed to users on the mailing lists of computermagazines and the World Health Organization, and contains twoexecutable files: INSTALL.EXE and AIDS.EXE.andP;  AIDS.EXE calculatesusers' risk of catching the AIDS virus; INSTALL.EXE changes theAUTOEXEC.BAT file and renames the existing one AUTO.BAT.andP;  Theprogram creates a new, hidden AUTOEXEC file and two hiddendirectories; after a certain number of reboots a copy of theinstallation program writes a very large file to the hard disk andencrypts subdirectory information, preventing the user fromexecuting files on the disk.andP;  A 'cure' for the virus is to rebootfrom a write-protected system disk and use a utility program toremove the AUTOEXEC file.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer VirusesComputer CrimesPublic SoftwareFile ManagementFloppy Disk.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The AIDS Information disk -- update on 'Panama Trojan' The notorious AIDSInformation disk from PC Cyborg appears to have been mailed to severalthousand users in a number of countries.andP;  These have mainly been the UK andUS, but disks have turned up in Europe and the Far East.andM;As revealed in the last issue of PC User, the offending disk contained theso-called 'Panama Trojan,' a dangerous hidden program designed to lock usersout of their hard disks.andM;It's alleged that the mailing list of the weekly computer magazine PCBusiness World (PCBW) was used as the basis for the operation, but wasaugmented with a list from an AIDS conference of the World HealthOrganisation.andP;  This had led to the disk arriving in hospitals anduniversities.andM;Currently, the theory is that the PCBW list was obtained under the pre-textof doing a mailshot promoting new software.andP;  This was apparently checked byPCBW, but instead of harmless leaflets advertising software, the highlydangeorus disk was sent out instead.andM;Attempts to trace the person who contacted PCBW have so far failed, but itnow appears that the PC Cyborg organisation does exist in Panama, while anunconfirmed report states that there are two Palestinians on its board ofdirectors.andM;This had led to the suspicion that a new form of terrorism might be behindthe AIDS disk -- an attempt to disrupt business in the western world andextort money.andP;  Other theories are that extortion is the main purpose of thedisk, or that a victim of the HIV virus is hitting back at the world.andM;The disk sent out has two executable files on it -- AIDS.EXE and INSTALL.EXE.andO;The first of these is the AIDS Information program itself, which asksquestions about your sexual habits, drug use, and so on, and then calculatesyour risk of catching the AIDS virus.andM;The instructions for installing the software tell y ou, from the C prompt, toenter A:INSTALL.andP;  This starts the installation process, copies the AIDS.EXEfile into the root directory of the fixed disk, and then prints out a form soyou can pay for the software licence.andP;  This is to be sent to a PO Box inPanama, together with the payment of either US $189 or $378, depending on thetype of licence required.andM;The installation process changes the machine's AUTOEXEC.BAT file and theexisting one is renamed AUTO.BAT.andP;  This has a REM statement inserted into ittelling you to use the file just as you would a normal AUTOEXEC -- placingthe instructions in it that you want executed when the machine is started.andM;A new, ready-only and hidden, AUTOEXEC file is created, which has what lookslike a REM statement in it, a couple of other statements, and the statementAUTO.BAT, which runs the commands in the original AUTOEXEC.andM;Two hidden directories are also created.andP;  One of these contains a copy of theinstallation program, renamed to REM $%FF}.EXE (the {FF} indicates thecharacter number 255, or FF in hexadecimal -- this is invisible in that ithas no screen representation and therefore will not showup up when doing asimple DIR).andP;  The other has several sub-directories, one of which containsfive files named using different combinations of the underline character.andO;One of these files is used as a counter.andM;The REM statement in the new AUTOEXEC file actually starts REM {FF}.andP;  Thismeans that DOS's batch processor doesn't recognise the REM as normal andinstead goes to the disk for an external command.andP;  This executes the fileREM{FF}.EXE and the counter is updated.andP;  There appears to be a random elementin the starting of the counter and there's also evidence to suggest that therating obtained if the AIDS program itself is run affects the value of thecounter.andM;After the machine has been rebooted a certain number of times (depending onthe counter), the REM%Ff} program interrupts the operation of the PC.andP;  Itwrites a very large file to disk, and encrypts the information in thesub-directories.andP;  It warns the user not to interfere with the process andlocks the user out of the PC.andP;  If you do break out of it and boot again fromthe fixed disk, it will present what appears to be a proper listing of thefiles on the disk.andP;  None of these can be executed.andM;If you boot from a clean system disk in the floppy disk drive and then lookat the fixed disk, the normal directories have gone and several file nameshave clearly been corrupted.andM;However, before the Trojan has been activated, there are steps that can betaken.andM;The machine should be booted from the floppy disk drive using awrite-protected system disk, and a utility such as PC Tools (so far, this hasproved the best utility to use in our own tests) copied onto the fixed disk.andO;This should then be used to remove the AUTOEXEC file, AIDS.EXE and all of thehidden sub-directories plus their contents.andM;The easiest way of removing the directories is to rename them, and then erasethem in the usual way.andP;  It's then necessary to run a tulity such as CHKDSK torecover any lost clusters, and also create a new AUTOEXEC.BAT file from thecontents of the AUTO.BAT.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
