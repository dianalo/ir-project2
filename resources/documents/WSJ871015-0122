While at the time it seemed mere hyperventilation, this portrayal was in fact central to the apparently successful campaign to discredit Judge Bork. It's not that hyperbole directly persuaded Senators, but that the hyperbole was needed to raise the money to persuade Senators. The bogeyman image was absolutely crucial to the needs of the real special interests, the Spitz Channels of the left.    &quot;Dear Friend,&quot; said Joanne Woodward's mass mailing on behalf of the National Abortion Rights Action League, &quot;$500,000 is needed immediately. . . .&quot; Norman Lear's People for the American Way mailed out 3.8 million anti-Bork solicitations; its Arthur Kropp boasts, &quot;We wanted to raise $1 million but now it looks like closer to $2 million.&quot; Direct-mail consultant Roger Craver, who has five different anti-Bork clients, told the New York Times, &quot;This is the equivalent of Jim Watt wanting to flood the Grand Canyon.&quot;    This is bogeyman fund-raising. The livelihood of fund-raisers is raising funds, either through direct contacts or mass mailings. Success lies in getting a batch of first contributions in some heated battle, then returning to a proven list to pay ongoing salaries. Not for nothing did more than 30 special-interest groups submit requests to testify -- meaning, appear on national television. At the lowest and most cynical level of American politics, the level at which it has settled the past two months, one might argue that special-interest groups are prevailing and being well paid for their efforts. Judge Bork's discomfort is just tough luck; he happened to be handy when the fund-raisers needed a nightmarish caricature.    Of course, both conservatives and liberals have for some time exploited bogeyman fund-raising. Conservative direct mailers wept at Tip O'Neill's retirement. With the creation of the Bork bogeyman, however, something seems to have snapped in Washington politics. Tip O'Neill and Jesse Helms are political figures who have the platform and resources to fight back. A judicial nominee, especially a federal appeals court judge, is severely constrained from defending himself at the level of discourse preferred by, say, the creator of Archie Bunker.    It isn't only Judge Bork's supporters who are concerned that the rest of the country now sees Washington as a stinking swamp of intellectual dishonesty and political reprisal. Lloyd Cutler's support for the nomination is based not on the merits alone but on concern that the tenor of the Bork opposition is poisoning the well for his own party. In the current issue of The New Republic, Andrew Sullivan frets that with the fund-raising hysteria, &quot;The only nominee who in the future will be able to survive the demagoguery will be someone who can respond in kind.&quot; Perhaps the president should nominate Don Rickles (&quot;Get off my back, you hockey puck!&quot;).    Mr. Sullivan's article should be read by anyone who still doubts this process profoundly distorted the Bork record. While he says a serious case can be made against the nomination, he catalogs &quot;the disingenuousness of the Bork-hate campaign.&quot; The lies, such as a claim that Judge Bork testified in favor of a law he in fact opposed. The name-calling of Ralph Nader: &quot;a plague on the next generation.&quot; The mailings of one of liberalism's sainted groups, Planned Parenthood, said, &quot;Bork's position on reproductive rights? You don't have any.&quot; Mr. Sullivan concluded: &quot;And Senators wonder why the polls show a drift away from the Bork nomination.&quot;    Editorialists, columnists and several Democratic senators are now engaged in an elaborate rationalization of this descent into political falsification. The public is asked to accept their argument that the assault on the integrity of a single American citizen by Planned Parenthood, People for the American Way and others was beside the point. That wrongful assault, however, will survive as a lesson of the Bork nomination.    The lesson is that up to now, the assault has worked. It intimidated not only Senators who spin like weather vanes, but also Senators made of sterner stuff. This was affirmed in the vote of the Senate Judiciary Committee and in thinly argued justifications for that vote. It is a new kind of politics, and it awaits the official imprimatur of 51 Senators. We hope that someone pauses to see the implications of turning the advice and consent role over to groups whose very livelihood depends on making U.S. politics feverish and false. </TEXT></DOC>
