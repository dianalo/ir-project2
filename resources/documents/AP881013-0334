Pending stockholder approval on Dec. 12, Continental Illinoiswill become Continental Bank Corp. and the Continental IllinoisNational Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Chicago will become simply theContinental Bank, said Chairman Thomas C. Theobold.   In addition, the company plans a dividend increase and anemployee stock-ownership plan to reward its investors and workersfor helping it achieve what it expects will be record high earningsthis year, Theobold said in a statement.   Continental also will seek shareholder approval for a 1-for-4reverse stock split to raise the price of its stock in hopes ofattracting more institutional investors.   The name change, which the company prefers to call asimplification, reflects Continental's new direction as a nationalbusiness bank, Theobold said.   ``Although proud of our Illinois heritage, we want a name thatmore accurately reflects the national scope of our business andreinforces the bank's new strategic direction,'' he said. ``In manyways, this modification is only a confirmation of how customers andinvestors already refer to the bank.''   The name change is not an attempt to escape the stigma of thebank's scrape with failure in 1984, said spokeswoman Holly Anderson.   ``We've always been Continental Bank _ that's our acceptablesecond reference,'' she said.   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. saved the ContinentalIllinois Bank from collapse in June 1984, halting a $20 million runon deposits prompted by concerns about the stability of the bank,which was at that time among the world's largest.   Questions about the bank's stability first surfaced followingthe failure of the Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City in 1982.Continental Illinois had bought more than $1 billion in energyloans from Penn Square and was forced to write off most of themafter the Oklahoma bank collapsed.   The FDIC purchased $5.2 billion worth of Continental Bank loansas part of its plan to save the bank from failure. The federalinsurance agency still owns or has options on 69 percent of theholding company's stock, said Continental spokesman Edgar McDougal.   Last October, three months after Theobold succeeded John E.Swearingen as chairman, Continental Illinois announced its plan tobecome a ``market-driven business bank devoted to servingcorporations, institutional investors and individuals with complexfinancial requirements.''   In the year since then, the company has sold its consumer retailbusiness to the First National Bank of Chicago; sold some of itsoverseas holdings, including its branches in Seoul, South Korea,and Taipei, Taiwan; and launched a $5 million advertising campaignaimed at persuading businesses to bank with Continental.   The firm earned a record $128.7 million in the first half of1988 and expects to post record-high annual earnings as well,Theobold said.   The quarterly dividend increase from 2 cents to 5 cents pershare and the awarding of stock to employees are gestures ofthanks, Theobold said.   ``It's time we rewarded our stockholders and employees for theirconfidence in us through lean times and gave them reason to expectcontinued prosperity in the future,'' he said.   The reverse stock split will reduce the number of outstandingshares from 215 million to 54 million and quadruple the stock'sprice. Theobold said many institutional investors and brokeragefirms aren't interested in stocks that trade below $10 a share, asContinental's does.</TEXT></DOC>
