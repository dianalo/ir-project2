Almost since computers began, U.S. manufacturers likeInternational Business Machines Corp. have dominated themarket in Europe. U.S. companies get three out of every fourdollars spent on mainframe computers there, and U.S. productsaccount for at least half of all computer sales. Last year,as its U.S. operations bled red, IBM leaned on Europe for 71%of its net income.</LP><TEXT>   But now Japanese companies are coming on strong. Among thefirst was Toshiba Corp., grabbing the market lead in laptopcomputer sales. Last week, Fujitsu Ltd. one-upped that byagreeing to buy control of Britain's biggest computer maker,International Computers Ltd., or ICL. With less flash butequal resolve, Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. arealso expanding.   So far, the Japanese hold less than 10% of the $110billion European computer market. But nobody -- least of allthe endangered Americans -- thinks they'll stop there. &quot;Weexpect the Japanese to increase their role,&quot; says David E.McKinney, chief of IBM's European computer business.   For the Japanese, Europe is the latest battleground in a30-year campaign to overtake the U.S. computer giants. AddingEurope, a third of the global computer market, to theirterritory would increase their world-wide economies of scale.For the U.S., a tough competitor would thereby becomedownright frightening; the ICL purchase agreement makesFujitsu the world's second-biggest computer maker, vaultingit ahead of U.S.-based Digital Equipment Corp.   No. 1 IBM is the target. In Europe, &quot;we aren't competingwith European manufacturers; we're competing with IBM,&quot; saysSoji Endo, manager of overseas operations for Hitachi'scomputer business. &quot;We try to scratch a little bit from{IBM's} market.&quot;   But Adam Quinton, of London stockbrokers UBS-Phillips andamp;Drew, notes that the Japanese threat is a long-term one: &quot;Idon't think it's a question of IBM needing to do anythingdramatic&quot; today, he says. And IBM's Mr. McKinney says: &quot;Ourstrategy doesn't change. We're going to work very hard tostay competitive.&quot;   Ultimately, European consumers will decide the winner.Force of habit will be a big factor: Most big Europeancorporations already have huge investments in Americansoftware.   Technology will be another factor. Despite past U.S.strength, Japan is moving up fast. The computer-screentechnology in today's laptops, for instance, comes mostlyfrom Tokyo. In the end, says Bruno d'Avanzo, Digital'sEuropean marketing boss, the computer war in Europe &quot;boilsdown to American technology vs. Japanese technology.&quot;   Such talk annoys native European computer makers, butthey're becoming irrelevant. Often weak in technology andfinance, the major European manufacturers never managed morethan a 25% share of their home market in the 1980s -- and nowthey're losing even that.   All but the strongest European hardware maker, WestGermany's Siemens AG, have recently reported losses orsluggish sales. In the confusion, the Japanese are picking upsome of the pieces. ICL was Fujitsu's prize. Mitsubishigobbled up ailing Apricot Computers Ltd., once the biggestpersonal-computer maker in Britain.   Next, analysts say, may be Italy's struggling Ing. C.Olivetti andamp; Co. or the unprofitable computer business of N.V.Philips of the Netherlands; both have been seeking foreignpartners. The only sure survivors will be Siemens with itsfinancial muscle, and French state-owned Groupe Bull with itspolitical backing.   Under the circumstances, all eyes are on EuropeanCommunity headquarters in Brussels. Though the EC has noideological reason to favor one country's industry over theother's, it's leery of Japan because of past trade frictionand Japan's late entry into an overcrowded market. Anotherpossible boost for the Americans may be an alliance with theEC to link computer-research programs; talks exploring thatoption began last month in Washington and Brussels. The ECmight also try to force Tokyo to ease entry to its market forEuropean companies.   With 1992 and a unified European market approaching, theEC is also unlikely to sit idly by as its native computerindustry withers. &quot;My view is the world needs equilibrium&quot; ofcomputer production among Europe, Japan and the U.S., warnsFilippo Maria Pandolfi, the EC's science and researchcommissioner. &quot;I am strongly in favor of maintaining thecapacity of the European industry.&quot;   But it's already too late for Britain. Computer sciencebegan here, with 19th-century mathematician Charles Babbage;and though the Pentagon made the first primitive electroniccomputer, Cambridge University was the birthplace in 1949 ofthe first machine to store programs.   That's moldy history now. Nearly every computer-hardwareengineer in Britain today works for a U.S. or Japanesecompany. Excluding troubled PC maker Amstrad PLC, &quot;therereally isn't anybody left in the information technologyindustry in the U.K.,&quot; laments Peter Horne, Apricot'smanaging director.   Apricot, put on the block last winter by its founders, wasa shuttlecock between Japanese and U.S. bidders. Japaneseflexibility and tact, not price, were deciding factors inchoosing the winner, says Roger Foster, managing director ofApricot's former parent, now called ACT Group PLC.Mitsubishi, though no major player in the Japanese computermarket, pleased him with its pledges to become a good,long-term partner for both Apricot and ACT. By contrast, theAmericans struck Mr. Foster as prickly. &quot;The Americans werepreoccupied with all the legal problems&quot; and risks, he says.   The sale stirred little political controversy. In theearly 1980s, Apricot's catchy name (a play on better-knownApple) and snazzy technology made it the U.K. market leader.But it was too small to compete easily with multinationals,and it blew its lead with a few marketing blunders. By lastyear, it had sunk to fifth place in the U.K. PC market. Underthe circumstances, the Japanese were welcomed as saviors.   The honeymoon is now in its fourth month. A one-monthsalary bonus for all 400 Apricot employees helped ensure goodwill. A typically British summer party, held under a canopyin a Yorkshire field, smoothed relations with dealers. Next,Mitsubishi plans to expand Apricot's product-developmentstaff and to install new equipment in its Scottish PCfactory.   The Japanese know that success in computers -- as in theautomobile and consumer electronics industries -- is partly amatter of global economies of scale. Hitherto, Japan'scomputer giants were preoccupied with their home market andthe U.S.; Europe was an afterthought. Now Europe, with its1992-related economic growth and the opening of former Eastbloc markets, has appeal.   Fujitsu's managing director and vice-general manager,Michio Naruto, hopes that 70% of the company's revenue willcome from outside Japan by the end of the decade, up from 35%today.   In one European market niche, victory has already gone toTokyo. In 1986, armed with new technology for easy-to-read,portable computer screens, Toshiba rushed into the Europeanmarket with its laptop computers. To sell the machines,Toshiba's marketers in Europe -- themselves Europeans --methodically targeted the continent's top PC dealers, alreadyused by IBM and Compaq Computer Corp. At the time, neitherU.S. company had a comparable product, so Toshiba was aninstant hit. Last year, on the strength of its specializedlaptops alone, it was the sixth biggest PC vendor in Europe.   Once entrenched, the Japanese can be hard to dislodge.According to market researchers Dataquest Inc., Toshiba lastyear had a 39% share of the laptop market in Europe, comparedwith Compaq's 16%. &quot;We're taking share back,&quot; says JosephMcNally, Compaq's British boss. But despite Compaq's statusas the second-biggest vendor of PCs in Europe, surveys showToshiba's name has more clout among British consumers.   Still, Toshiba may be a special case. For the Japanesegenerally, building a continent-wide sales network fromscratch will be difficult. The number of attractive takeovertargets in Europe is small. And the risk of a politicalbacklash is great.   &quot;The Japanese over time have a chance of being strong {inEurope}, but a lot of things have to happen before they getthere,&quot; says Digital's Mr. d'Avanzo. Among other things, hesays, the Japanese must learn to write software and providecomputer services to suit the tastes of European customers.   For the European companies, providing such software andservices may be their last refuge. Already, as their hardwarebusinesses weaken, Bull and Olivetti are rushing into thefaster-growing software and service markets. At this rate,some analysts predict, most in the European industry couldend up as glorified repackagers of hardware mass-produced byJapanese and U.S. giants. The native European hardwareindustry could shrivel, just as the U.S. consumer-electronicsindustry withered in the face of strong Far East competition.   The thought chills some Europeans. &quot;I cannot imagine sucha danger,&quot; says Francis Lorentz, Bull's chairman and chiefexecutive. No matter what happens, he says, the sheerdynamism of a post-1992, post-Cold War Europe will provideenough business for all to prosper -- Japanese, American andEuropean. &quot;We have fantastic market opportunities for thefuture,&quot; he says. &quot;Europe today has become the majorbattlefield in our industry.&quot;   ---   Jacob M.
