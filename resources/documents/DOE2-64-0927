Thus monoclonal antibodies(MAb) reactive to DD should have a very suitable specificity for in vivothrombus detection. Two anti-DD MAbs have been labelled with {sup 131}Iand assessed as scintigraphic agents in a normal rat model system. Eachrat received 3 sc implants of antigen covalently coupled to Sepharosebeads: 1) Human DD 2) Human FB 3) Glycine (GL) (control). Scintigraphicimages taken 7 days after injection of {sup 131}I anti DD MAb showedclear localization of both anti-DD MAbs to the DD implant rather thanto the FB or GL implants with no localization in normal tissues. Thiswas confirmed in biodistribution studies. Injection of anti-DD MAbs DD-3B6/22and DD-IC3/108 resulted in DD: blood ratios of 10.4 +/- 0.6 and 4.9 +/-0.3 respectively. These results suggest that anti-DD MAbs will have potentialfor thrombus radioimmunodetection.</TEXT></DOC>
