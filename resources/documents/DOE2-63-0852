Afterpassage of the Act, the DOE initiated a number of systems studies toreevaluate the role of Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) within thefederal waste management system. This report summarizes the results ofa study to determine the schedules and costs of developing those MRSfacilities needed under a number of scenarios, with differing functionsallocated to the MRS and/or different spent fuel acceptance schedules.Nine cases were defined for the system study, seven of which includedan MRS Facility. The study cases or scenarios evaluated varied relativeto the specific functions to be performed at the MRS. The scenarios rangedin magnitude from storage and shipment of bare, intact spent fuel toconsolidating the spent fuel into repository emplacement containers priorto storage and shipment. Each scenario required specific modificationsto be made to the design developed for the MRS proposal to Congress (theConceptual Design Report). 41 figs., 326 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
