DALY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Massachusetts Supreme Court today upheld theconvictions of four men found guilty in the 1983 gang rape of awoman on a barroom pool table.   In a pair of unanimous rulings, the state's highest courtrejected defense arguments about the fairness of the lengthy 1984trial in Bristol Superior Court that attracted national attention.   The case, which originally involved six young men of Portuguesedescent, drew angry protests by women's groups in support of thevictim and brought agony to the Portuguese-American community inthe fishing city of New Bedford, 60 miles south of Boston.   In ruling against the defendants, the court upheld thepunishments handed out to Daniel Silvia, who was sentenced to nineto 12 years in the state prison at Walpole; Joseph Vieira, who drewsix to eight years; and John Cordeiro and Victor Raposo, who weresentenced to nine to 12 years each. Two other defendants wereacquitted.   Defense attorneys raised a series of arguments attacking thehandling of the trial by Judge William G. Young, but the high courtrejected each one, saying Young did not abuse his discretion.   Bristol County District Attorney Ronald Pina said through aspokeswoman that he was ``very pleased'' with today's rulings.   ``His faith in the judicial system has been substantiated, inspite of all the public turmoil in this case. He's pleased that thecommunity can finally put this issue behind them,'' saidspokeswoman Charlotte Enoksen.   None of the four defense attorneys involved in the case were intheir offices this morning.   The justices noted that the jury could have found credibleevidence that on the evening of March 6, 1983, the victim wasattacked at Big Dan's tavern in New Bedford and was forced to havesex as she was held down on the pool table.   On appeal, Vieira and Silvia raised several arguments. Theyclaimed that the prosecutor failed to make a timely disclosure ofcertain evidence that might have helped the defense, depriving themof constitutional rights to due process.   They also argued that the Bristol County district attorneysuppressed until after trial a witness's recorded account of thevictim's condition and statements shortly after the rape.   And they argued that Young prejudiced their ability to present adefense based on the theory that the victim consented to the sexualencounter. On that claim, Vieira and Silvia complained about theexclusion of an allegedly false prior complaint of rape by thewoman, and other evidence.   Each claim was rejected by the unanimous Supreme Court.   In their separate appeal, Cordeiro and Raposo argued thatYoung's order prohibiting coverage of the victim on camera at thetelevised trial was an abuse that prejudiced their right to a fairtrial.   They also claimed that Young erred in refusing to instruct thejury on the defense of consent to rape. In addition, Raposo raisedclaims about Young's decisions on trying the defendants togetherand on allowing evidence of a prior conviction.   Again, the high court dismissed each claim.</TEXT></DOC>
