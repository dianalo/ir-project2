Joining GE in bidding for business will be Aerospatiale, a French company, and MBB, a German concern, GE said. Communication satellites transmit television and telephone signals and data.    The first two projects the companies are bidding on are a European satellite, Intelsat VII, and an Australian satellite, Aussat-II. GE's Astro-Space division, based in East Windsor, N.J., would provide the communications equipment for the two projects, while the two foreign concerns would provide the platform on which the equipment would rest, a GE spokesman said.    The companies expect to submit their joint bids on the two projects by year's end, GE's spokesman said. Intelsat is an organization formed by many European countries, and Aussat is an Australian government-owned company, GE said. </TEXT></DOC>
