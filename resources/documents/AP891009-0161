Finding such peace has left the 33-year-old woman without wordof her husband in the Afghan army and cost her a career andultimately her identity.   Now she is forced to hide her face behind a veil in public _ inaccordance with the customs of the Islamic fundamentalism thatprevails at the refugee camp.   In Kabul, the shell-shocked Afghan capital 400 miles away,another woman, Sadiqqa, vows never to pay that price.   ``I would rather die,'' the 19-year-old science student at KabulUniversity said. ``Putting on a veil amounts to being imprisoned orkept in a cage. Nothing could be worse.''   President Najib of Afghanistan has been been playing on thosefears, frequently reminding Afghan women of the fundamentalism ofthe Moslem guerrillas trying to overthrow his government.   Much has happened to change the lives of Afghan women sincecivil war broke out 11 years ago, said Esmatee Wardak, chairman ofthe All Women's Council of Afghanistan in Kabul.   ``When the men went to war, the women started working infactories and offices, as painters and carpenters. In short, theygot their first taste of freedom. These are the women who wouldhave a difficult time under the fundamentalists,'' said Mrs.Wardak, one of two women with Cabinet-rank in Najib's government.   The women's rights movement took root in Afghanistan in 1919,the year it declared its independence.   When Sharifa was 3 years old in 1959, King Zahir Shah decreedthat women no longer had to wear the chadri, the tent-like pleatedgarment with a mesh opening over the eyes.   Encouraged by her family and particularly her father, Sharifasaid, she wore Western clothes, graduated from Kabul University andwent to work as an accountant in a government office.   That changed with the war.   When her husband was drafted into the Afghan army nearly fouryears ago, Sharifa took their small son and daughter across themountains to western Pakistan, where they have lived in a two-roommud hut furnished with ragged pillows on the floor and decoratedwith pictures from magazines pasted on the walls. She said shedoesn't know if her husband is dead or alive.   In Pakistan she and a few others like her were suddenlysurrounded and alienated by Afghan women with traditional ideas,women with whom they had little contact back home.   Envied or ostracized by the others, Sharifa and those like hercomplain of the narrowness of their lives and of the hard timesimposed by the mullahs, the religious leaders who roam the campsearching for wrongdoing.   The slightest infringement is reported to the mullahs. And sinceshe is dependent on them for food and other necessities, herchildren will suffer for her misdemeanors.   Sharifa said she is obedient because of her 9-year-old son and10-year-old daughter. Soon the daughter will be forced to wear aveil in public.   ``Right now, she's as free as she'll ever be in her life,''Sharifa said. ``Soon she will lose that freedom and have to jointhe other women.''   But there is no way out until the war ends.   ``Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever return home,'' she said. ``Iwon't go back if the fundamentalists come to power. I will not stayunder this veil and be hounded by the mullahs. I want to be happyagain.''   On the Kabul University campus, with Western rock music blaringfrom a portable stereo, Sadiqqa and her friends discuss the plightof women like Sharifa who are forced to abandon their ambitions andmodern lifestyles for what they call ``Gulbuddin's medievalfortress.'' Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is a Moslem guerrilla leader.   ``If you're married, you're a wife. Otherwise, you are just awoman,'' said Sadiqqa, dressed in tight Western blue jeans, a blueT-shirt with sequin appliques and her long black hair pulled backin a ponytail.   ``Islam isn't against women working, but Islam's interpretationsare always done by men. That's the problem.''   Those fears were heightened last year when the guerrilla leadersdrafted a constitution stating women must be kept in purdah, thepractice of wearing the veiled costume.   Although the constitution was later abandoned, many leaders inthe seven-party guerrilla alliance still say they would not wantwomen to vote in an election of a new Afghan government.   But the war has made Afghan women on both sides of the bordermore assertive and determined.   ``I am a Moslem but I will never, ever again wear a chadri,''said Mrs. Wardak, one of four women elected to the Parliament in1964 when Afghan women were given the right to vote.   ``Islamic law does not require it and now there are many womenlike me who will fight anyone who tried to put us back under theveil. We will defend our rights.''   Mrs. Wardak was wearing a white suit with pink scarf tied aroundher neck the day she was interviewed in her Kabul office.   She said Afghan society has become much more dependent on womenduring the decade-long struggle between the government and themujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors. The war has left one-third ofthe country's 15 million people dead, living in exile or in refugeecamps along the border.   Moslem women in general have a long tradition of fighting fortheir beliefs and their countries, dating back to the ProphetMohammad's wife, Aisha, who went to battle beside her husband on acamel. Afghan women have a long history of being on the frontlines, including fighting the British during three wars in the 19thcentury.   Today is no exception, said Mrs. Wardak, who earned a master'sdegree in education at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.More than 8,000 women have enlisted in the armed forces, trainingas pilots and paratroopers and fighting side-by-side with malesoldiers, she said.   ``Men present themselves as intrepid and heroic, telling howthey have suffered by going to war,'' she said. ``Women havesuffered a lot since the revolution. They have lost husbands andfathers, sons and brothers.''   Women will be essential in rebuilding Afghanistan once theconflict ends, Mrs. Wardak added.   ``We are a backward country. How can a society improve withoutthe participation of women, especially at this stage of developmentin the world? It's impossible.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Oct. 16</NOTE></DOC>
