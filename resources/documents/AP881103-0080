(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis,declaring he is ``sprinting for the finish line'' in thepresidential election, proposed today a federal, state and localalliance to combat drug use in the nation's schools.   At a town meeting at Pennsbury High School in Bucks County,Dukakis said his proposed alliance ``will set for its goal drug-freeschools in the 1990s in every community in the United States.''   Earlier, in an interview on the ``CBS This Morning'' televisionshow, the Massachusetts governor insisted that up to 30 percent ofthe voters remain undecided with only five days remaining untilElection Day.   In an effort to overtake Republican presidential rival GeorgeBush, Dukakis has focused heavily on combating drugs.   He lambasted Bush on Wednesday for saying he would notautomatically cut off foreign aid to nations that fail to cooperatewith U.S. efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs.   Dukakis shifted the focus today to the need for comprehensivemeasures to discourage drug use, especially among young people.   He outlined a program that would include drug education startingin kindergarten and creation of community advisory councils tocoordinate local efforts.   The Democratic nominee said he would advocate making suchcouncils ``permanent, not just something to do this year.'' Theywould include educators, parents, children and leaders of business,sports and the media.   He also called for special grants targeting ``high-risk kids andhigh-risk communities.''   A fact sheet distributed by Dukakis aides said the program wouldhave a federal commitment of $400 million.   In his TV interview earlier today, Dukakis claimed that ``we areeither tied or moving ahead'' in the major states essential to hishopes of scoring an upset victory over Bush.   That assessment is contradicted by many public opinion pollswhich suggest that Dukakis still has a lot of ground to make up.   On his 55th birthday, the Massachusetts governor was hammeringaway at Bush on the issue of drugs which he said marked a cleardifference between him and Bush.   As for the tougher tone of his rhetoric, Dukakis said he had been``a little too restrained, perhaps,'' earlier in the campaign.   Voters are ``taking a very strong second look at me,'' he said.   Dukakis often has compared the presidential campaign to amarathon race. ``This one is going to go down to the wire,'' he saidtoday. ``... We're sprinting for the finish line and we hope andexpect that we're going to win.''   At rallies Wednesday in Chicago and Philadelphia, Dukakis quotedBush as saying he wouldn't strip U.S. foreign aid from countriesthat refused to cooperate in efforts to stem the flow of drugs.   ``I'll be damned if I'll let those countries send their poisoninto the United States of America,'' he said, using unusually stronglanguage.   ``I'll say to foreign leaders, if you're prepared to work withus, we'll work with you,'' he went on to the cheers of partisancrowds. ``But if you're against us don't expect a dime from Americanforeign aid.''   Bush spokesman Mark Goodin, responding to Dukakis' comments, saidthe Democratic nominee has distorted the GOP nominee's position onthe issue.   ``The vice president would never hesitate to use aid as a leveron the war on drugs,'' Goodin said.   Dukakis also returned to two of his favorite themes, the linkbetween Bush and Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega and Bush'splan to put his vice president, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, in chargeof the war on drugs.   The Democratic candidate said he would tell foreign leaders, ``Ifyou think you can do to Mike Dukakis what Noriega did to GeorgeBush, if you think we're going to risk our children's lives byputting somebody like Dan Quayle in charge of the war against drugs,then you're in for a big surprise on January 20, 1989.''   After a rally in Pittsburgh, Dukakis told reporters, that Bushwas offering people ``a lot of talk and very little action.''   ``I don't think Mr. Bush is serious about the war againstdrugs,'' he said.   At nearly every stop for two days, crowds sang ``Happy Birthday''to the candidate who turned 55 today.   His wife, Kitty, had planned to be with him for his birthday, butshe was hospitalized in Minneapolis, recovering from a respiratoryinfection. Aides said she hoped to join him on Friday in Chicago.   With time running out for his campaign, Dukakis was dogged bynational polls released earlier this week showing him trailing Bushby up to 13 points.   Dukakis told crowds to ignore the polls and encouraged them bysaying that ``this is one election where millions of people aregoing to be looking and thinking and listening and they're not goingto be making up their mind until very close to the moment when theygo into that polling booth.''</TEXT></DOC>
