Her neurosurgeon, radiating all the warmth of hisstainless-steel instruments, was cruelly blunt as heprescribed immediate surgery. &quot;You have a 5% chance of dyingor becoming a quadriplegic,&quot; he announced. As the patientbegan to cry, the surgeon briskly walked out of the room. &quot;Iwas totally shocked,&quot; she says.   Today, Dr. Vogler, who came through her operationsuccessfully and teaches medicine at the University ofSouthern California, is observing eight medical studentsundergo a test she hopes will help doctors learn to treatpatients more humanely.</LP><TEXT>   The pilot program by the National Board of MedicalExaminers, here at USC and at the University of Illinois,uses mock patients to test both the competence and compassionof medical students. The board, which now administers thebattery of written competency exams doctors must pass beforepracticing, aims to make the grueling situational examinationa required hurdle for new physicians by as early as 1995.   The board is responding to a persistent patient complaint:The bedside manner of many doctors is abominable. &quot;Patientsfeel doctors are money-grubbing,&quot; says Dr. Vogler, whocommonly hears that doctors are cold, condescending and speakan unintelligible language. Adds Daniel Klass, projectdirector for the board's pilot test: &quot;There is a sense thatpatients are really dissatisfied with doctors.&quot;   Some vital signs that might explain why:   -- During office visits, general practitioners spend lessthan seven minutes talking to the average patient, down from11 minutes in 1975, one study shows.   -- They interrupt patients an average of 18 seconds intotheir account of what ails them, reports another study, and80% don't even hear all of the patient's chief complaints.   -- A 1990 survey by Miles Inc.'s pharmaceutical divisionfound that one in four U.S. patients has switched physiciansat least once because the doctor made them feeluncomfortable, didn't relieve their anxiety or failed toanswer questions.   -- When the University of California, Los Angeles, askedwhy its medical students chose the healing arts, the No. 1reason was to earn a comfortable living. Working with peopleranked third.   What are the results of such attitudes? Dr. Vogler oncewatched a resident physician tell family members their sonwas dead, then walk out of the waiting room. A 26-year-oldmember of Vital Options, a Los Angeles patient-support group,tells how his doctor administered chemotherapy for testicularcancer before informing him that he would be sterilized. &quot;Whydidn't you tell me so I could bank my sperm?&quot; he rememberspleading with the physician six years later. The doctorreplied that he had imparted all the information needed bythe patient at the time of treatment.   While recognizing that a test alone can't make medicalstudents more compassionate, the medical-examiners boardhopes its program prods schools to produce graduates with atleast minimal bedside skills. Grades on the board test arebased 35% on their communication and information-sharing, 35%on taking a patient history and 30% on physical-exam skills.   Graduates have 15 minutes to examine each of 16 subjectswho have been trained to simulate having ailments. The&quot;patients,&quot; many of them actors, use a checklist to grade theaspiring doctors' questions during the exam, then evaluatemore subjectively what might be called the warm-and-fuzzyfactor. A five-point scale measures how the mock patientsfeel the would-be doctor greeted them and whether he or she&quot;talked down&quot; to them. Another measure is simply, &quot;Would youwant this person to be a doctor?&quot;   In USC's health facility, &quot;Jessie Sinclair,&quot; a 55-year-oldpatient played by actress Ella Evans, coughs incessantly andwrings her handkerchief as the fourth-year medical studententers the examination room. Jessie has inoperable lungcancer. &quot;How are you feeling about this?&quot; the student asksgingerly. &quot;I just can't deal with it,&quot; Jessie replies with asigh of despair. &quot;My oldest daughter will get married in oneyear. Will I live that long, doctor?&quot; By the end of theinterview, the doctor has had to face two issues: Jessie'sguilt about being a longtime heavy smoker and her impendingdeath.   Watching the students -- who know they are beingvideo-taped and graded -- shows how pitiful the current stateof affairs can be. One male student examiningmigraine-headache sufferer &quot;Maggie Smith&quot; on anemergency-room exam table, plops his two examinationinstruments down right between her legs. Another malestudent, presented with a shy young female patient who hasnever had a regular menstrual period, looks like he wouldrather flee than talk about menstruation.   Some doctors fault the medical system, along withmedical-school training and litigious patients, forattitudinal shortcomings. Advancing technology leads doctors,who once labored over patients for details about an ailment,to spend more time scrutinizing MRI scans instead. Andincreased specialization encourages doctors to look atpatients organ by organ -- not as whole human beings.   &quot;Doctors see patients as a consultant, not on a regularbasis,&quot; says Dr. Vogler, and transient populations mean thatfewer patients and doctors establish lifelong rapport.Physicians say they must spend a quarter of their time onpaperwork, and drastic cuts in their insurance-reimbursablecosts force them to process more patients to keep up profits.Others note that grueling residency and internship schedules-- keeping doctors awake 48 hours running -- can make acaring person callous.   Another problem: Researchers say most students graduatefrom the nation's 126 medical schools without ever having apatient examination observed. When USC began systematicallyrequiring such exams a few years ago, faculty members wereappalled by what they saw. One student thumped a cardiacpatient's chest with a medical hammer, and others didn'tdetect obvious heart murmurs and enlarged livers. &quot;Medicineis both art and science,&quot; says Stephen Abrahamson, pastchairman of USC's medical-education department. &quot;We haven'tpaid enough attention to the art.&quot;   There are powerful medical and financial reasons for thissituation to change. Studies show that patients who clearlyunderstand the need for certain medications and who feeltheir physician is supportive and caring are more likely toget better. Then again, nearly three-quarters of themalpractice lawsuits that doctors lose reflect poor patientcommunication. In the past two years, malpractice insurers inOregon and Maryland -- with New York soon expected to follow-- have offered discounts of up to 20% for doctors taking ashort communication course offered by Miles's pharmaceuticalsunit.   Some medical schools are changing -- for example, havingstudents meet with patients in the first year, not the third,as has been traditional. Some teach interviewing skills.Southern Illinois University School of Medicine won'tgraduate students who don't pass an 18-patient clinical test.And to help encourage empathy, Long Beach (Calif.) MemorialMedical Center has medical students spend their first day offamily-practice residency as patients; the exercise requiresstudents to wear hospital gowns and to use bedpans.   Still, questions loom about whether most medical schoolswill adopt such programs. Even at schools exploring new ways-- such as Harvard University and UCLA -- the majority ofprofessors view the approaches as frills that can distractfrom the need to absorb the growing body of scientificknowledge. Rather than requiring such new programs, someprofessors and others suggest gauging the compassion ofmedical-school applicants better, perhaps by making it afactor in admissions.   &quot;I don't think this test will change patient-doctorinteractions,&quot; says Glenn Provost, a fourth-year USC medicalstudent who just took his exam. &quot;People can put on a show for16 patients.&quot; He says the test made little difference when hereturned last week to a residency program -- and was limitedto three minutes with each patient.   Some patients also doubt the test will spell relief. &quot;Idon't know if a test will help,&quot; says Linda Behshid, a24-year-old Los Angeles student who was outraged when none ofher four doctors told her that four days of 24-hourchemotherapy would leave her infertile for life. She foundthat out by reading the fine print on medical release forms.Her conclusion: &quot;I think they just have to go through being apatient themselves, to feel victimized, to feel helpless.&quot;   ---              Patients' Diagnosis of Doctors                                                                                                          The Opinions Are In...
