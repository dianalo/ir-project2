The Communications Workers of America said Friday that NewEngland Telephone should pay customers the money it wasn't payingstriking workers.   The company said no, it has to pay overtime to managers fillingin for strikers and probably was losing revenue to competitors.   Telephone operators at Illinois Bell asked customers to delaypaying their telephone bills during the strike. Chicago-basedAmeritech, which serves five Midwestern states, said using customersin the week-long walkout was ``irresponsible.''   Some progress was reported in talks local companies held with CWAon Friday, a day after the union reached agreement with BellAtlantic. Bell of Pennsylvania was to begin talks today with theCWA, whose members have been on strike for two weeks.   On the West Coast, Pacific Telesis of San Francisco also reportedsubstantial progress toward a new contract.   Wages and employee contributions to health-insurance plans havebeen major issues blocking settlement of the contracts with the fourcompanies' nearly 200,000 employees in 20 states and the District ofColumbia.   The striking workers include operators, telephone installers andrepairmen, factory workers and some sales and clerical personnel.All four companies have continued service using managementpersonnel, but there have been delays for installation and operatorservices.   The Bell Atlantic-CWA agreement resolved regional issues, whileleaving local issues to be decided in further talks.Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic also was bargaining separately withthe International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.   Union officials at Bell Atlantic said 41,000 striking workerswon't return to work until all local issues are resolved and the11,000 workers represented by the IBEW settle. But both sides said afinal accord could be reached within days.   Pacific Telesis spokesman Lou Saviano said CWA and companynegotiators made ``very substantial progress,'' but unresolvedissues remained.   No new talks have been scheduled in the Ameritech strike.   Five people were arrested Friday outside Ohio Bell headquartersin Columbus after CWA members blocked building entrances. Thosearrested were issued summonses and released.   A picketer was arrested at a Michigan Bell facility near Saginawafter strikers blocked a driveway. The 37-year-old woman was chargedwith obstructing traffic, a misdemeanor, and freed on $100 bond.   In Vermont, where CWA and IBEW workers are striking New EnglandTelephone, a subsidiary of New York-based NYNEX, union officialssaid the regional company stood to save $3.1 million from 1989through 1992 if it's successful in shifting some costs of healthinsurance to its employees.   ``This money will not be translated into lower phone bills forVermont customers because local rates are frozen,'' said Ken Peres,a CWA economist. ``Instead, the $3.1 million will flow directly asprofits to NYNEX's subsidiary, New England Telephone.''   Richard Fortier, business manager of IBEW Local 2326, said unionofficials also wanted rebates to Vermont phone customers ``toreflect New England Telephone's decreased expenses on wages andbenefits during the bargaining impasse.''   NYNEX spokesman John Bonomo said: ``We're not doing this to savemoney. We're asking employees to pick up part of the health-carecosts because the costs are escalating so much we can't keep paceourselves.''   Bonomo said the company was incurring increased expenses inovertime paid to managers filling in for striking workers andprobably was losing revenues to competitors.   In Chicago, CWA spokesman Greg Kenefick said the union wantedtelephone customers to ``put telephone bills on hold.''   ``Our focus now is going to be biting into their income, askingpeople to put bills on hold,'' Kenefick said, adding that he doesn'tbelieve there's much risk of customers losing service if theywithhold payment.   Pat Montgomery, spokeswoman for Illinois Bell, called it``irresponsible to use customers in a management-union dispute.''</TEXT></DOC>
