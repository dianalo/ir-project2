The office's analysis, released this week, found that thepresident's offer would result in about $1 billion in savings fromreductions in pay and allowances for troops stationed overseas withthe remaining windfall the result of lower day-to-day operatingcosts.   Bush's proposal calls for removing 30,000 U.S. troops and 325,000Soviet soldiers from Europe and reductions in the number of NATOcombat aircraft by 750 and Warsaw Pact planes by 3,000.   The president introduced his arms control initiatives placingceilings on troops, tanks, combat aircraft and attack helicopters,artillery and armored personnel carriers last month at the 40thanniversary of NATO. The proposal refines what the alliance put onthe bargaining table in Vienna in March.   Under Bush's proposal, a conventional arms treaty would benegotiated within six months to a year. The budget office analysissaid that under that schedule, ``savings would not begin until 1991at the earliest, and full savings would probably not be realizeduntil at least 1993.''   The costs are based on 1990 dollars in budget authority, theoffice said.   The analysis also said that the proposal might also allow thePentagon to avoid the need to buy about $6 billion in new weapons.The savings, however, would likely come over many years and only ifthe procurement rate for new weapons is reduced.   If Bush decides that reductions in the Warsaw Pact forces meansless of a threat and choses to maintain a smaller or less-modernmilitary, ``such a decision could result in reductions in thedefense budget much larger than those estimated in this paper,'' theoffice said.   However, the budget office, which conducted its analysis at therequest of the Senate Budget Committee, said the savings could beless if Bush decides cuts in forces in Europe require a greaternumber of forces in the United States or increases in the number ofships or aircraft to carry weapons and cargo to Europe.   Cost of verification also could cut into the net savings, theoffice said.   Bush did not specify which U.S. forces would be removed toachieve the reductions, but the budget office suggested possiblesteps to realize the savings. Among the office's suggestions waswithdrawal of one armored or mechanized division, including all itshelicopters and artillery. An armored or mechanized divisionincludes three brigades with about 17,000 personnel.   Such as step would require removing about 26,000 Army personnelfrom Europe. In addition, the United States could withdraw one andone-third of a tactical wing of F-16 fighter aircraft. About 4,000personnel are attached to a wing.   The United States could see a one-time saving if Bush decidesagainst construction of new base in Crotone, Italy, to house the401st Tactical Fighter Wing of F-16 fighters and the approximately3,600 U.S. troops and 600 civilians.   Estimated cost to build the new base is $830 million for the NATOallies with the United States expected to pay about $26 million. TheU.S. expense does not include $180 million for housing over 10 years.   Last year, Italy agreed to provide a new home for the wing afterSpain demanded that it leave the base at Torrejon de Ardoz, justeast of Madrid.   However, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told NATO allies inBrussels, Belgium, Friday that Bush proposals on reductions incombat aircraft exclude the 72 F-16 of the 401st Tactical Wing.</TEXT></DOC>
