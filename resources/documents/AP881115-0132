(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two teen-agers already charged in incidentsof molesting young boys were charged Tuesday with an additional 302counts of sodomy and sexual abuse, authorities said.   The new charges bring to 20 the number of boys allegedly abusedat a home computer school in Great Neck operated by Arnold Friedman,56.   Friedman's son Jesse, 19, and his friend, Ross Goldstein, 18,pleaded innocent to the new charges Tuesday before Nassau CountyJudge Abbey Boklan.   Boklan ordered Friedman continued free on $100,000 bail despitethe objections of Nassau County Prosecutor Joseph Onorato, who urgedbail of $200,000. He argued the additional charges against Friedman,which bring the total to 250 counts, increase the risk that he willflee.   Goldstein was released on $25,000 bail.   The latest indictment alleges that Friedman and Goldsteinsexually abused seven boys, ages 9 to 12, at the Friedman residencein 1986 and 1987. The boys were students at the computer school.   This latest indictment charges Jesse Friedman with 198 counts ofsodomy, sexual abuse, use of a child in a sexual performance andendangering the welfare of a child.   Goldstein had previously been arrested and charged with varioussex-abuse charges in connection with purported child sex orgies atthe Friedman residence in 1986 and 1987.   Tuesday's indictment accuses Goldstein of 118 counts ofsex-related crimes.   Friedman's father pleaded guilty last March to 42 sex-relatedcharges involving 13 boys who attended his home computer courses. Heis serving 10 to 30 years in prison. The sentence is concurrent witha federal sentence that Friedman received for sending childpornography through the mails.   Goldstein and Jesse Friedman are scheduled for trial Jan. 4.</TEXT></DOC>
