(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A county judge has barred a woman fromobtaining an abortion during a divorce proceeding, calling herestranged husband's bid to block the procedure a type of custodyfight.   The ruling Tuesday blocks Shawn K. Lewis, who is about threemonths pregnant, from aborting the fetus conceived after she filedfor divorce from Carlton J. Lewis.   Lewis had sought the order, claiming that as the father he wasentitled to a say in what happens to the fetus. Mrs. Lewis couldface 45 days in jail and a $100 fine for contempt of court if shedefies the order.   Genesee County Circuit Judge Valdemar Washington, in a 17-pageruling, said he issued the injunction because the couple had filedfor divorce and the case ``falls squarely within the jurisdictionof divorce proceedings.''   ``In this court's view, this is not a case of mother's right toterminate pregnancy versus father's rights to veto pregnancy,''Washington said.   ``Once that (divorce filing) occurred, an additionalresponsibility was placed on the court to look into the interestsof any minor children that the parties may have.''   He said no Michigan court has ruled on when a fetus becomes achild, so he must consider the case a custody fight as if the childalready was born.   Her attorneys said they will seek an emergency hearing beforethe state Court of Appeals.   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Linda Pylypiw, who representedthe woman on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``Idon't believe (Washington) ruled on any of the constitutionalissues.''   Pylypiw said a woman has a right under the 14th Amendment, whichguarantees a right to privacy, to choose abortion during the firsttrimester of her pregnancy.   Steven Moss, attorney for Lewis, hailed the ruling, but said itwould be decided ultimately by higher courts.   Washington had granted a temporary order halting the abortionAug. 8. After considering written arguments, he made the orderpermanent Tuesday.   The hometown of the couple, who are in their 20s, has not beendisclosed.   The couple have a 16-month-old child, who is living with Mrs.Lewis.</TEXT></DOC>
