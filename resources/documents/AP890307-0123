The council of the London borough of Lewisham said it obtainedthe information from a leaked copy of a British Rail document. Thestate-owned rail company declined to comment, saying it wouldpublish its proposals Wednesday.   Lewisham is campaigning with residents of southeast Englandagainst plans to cut a new high-speed rail route through London andthe countryside to the rail tunnel under the English Channel thatwill link England and France. The channel tunnel is to open in 1993.   The London-Folkestone route is a hot political issue for PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher. It is also a serious ecological issuethat comes at a time when Mrs. Thatcher needs to demonstrate concernfor the environment.   Council spokesman Graham Taylor said that according to thedocument, 24.6 miles of the 68-mile route would run underground, andmaximum rail speeds would be 140 mph instead of the previouslysuggested 180 mph.</TEXT></DOC>
