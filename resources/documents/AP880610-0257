Alfonse D'Amato says he's going to try toovercome the opposition of a House committee and win passage thisyear of legislation that would impose the death penalty onconvicted drug dealers who kill.   The Senate passed the election-year bill Friday, voting 65-29for the measure and ignoring critics' pleas that the measure wouldbe immoral, ineffective and do little but pander to the public'sfrustration with illegal drugs.   ``It's society's way of saying we've had enough,'' said D'Amato,R-N.Y., who sponsored the legislation.   The liberal leaders of the House Judiciary Committee, which willconsider the legislation, have a history of quashing death penaltybills.   But bills can be pried out of committees if a majority of Housemembers sign a petition requesting that the measure be brought tothe floor. D'Amato conceded that because of the opposition ofJudiciary Committee leaders, the seldom-used discharge petitionprocedure would probably be necessary.   He said if that did not work, he would attach the provision toother drug legislation to be considered later this year. If thelegislation fails to receive House approval by the time the newCongress begins in January, lawmakers would have to begin theprocess anew.   There was no need for prodding in the Senate, where a majorityof lawmakers from both parties _ 27 Democrats and 38 Republicans _supported the legislation. D'Amato acknowledged to reporters laterthat the fact this is an election year ``may be some kind of aninfluence, and I'm not going to guess how much.''   Opponents tried unsuccessfully to weaken the bill with severalamendments. One would have substituted life imprisonment for themeasure's death penalty. Another would have limited itsapplicability to drug dealers who kill law enforcement officers.   Yet another, sponsored by Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., would havemandated that executions occur in public and be televised.   ``It's a repulsive amendment to a repulsive proposal,''Hatfield, who opposed the legislation, said of his amendmentshortly before it was rejected on a voice vote.   The legislation allows the death penalty to be imposed on peoplewho are convicted in federal courts of running a drug ring and arethen separately found guilty of killing law enforcement officers orprivate citizens. In addition, any person who commits a felonyviolation of federal drug laws who then kills an officer could facecapital punishment.   Morton H. Halperin, director of the American Civil LibertiesUnion's Washington office, called the bill ``an election yearcampaign platform and not a piece of serious legislation.''   D'Amato told reporters he believed the legislation would applyto ``hundreds and hundreds of potential cases.''   The senator's office, citing FBI statistics, said 57 lawenforcement officers were killed between 1977 and 1986 pursuingsuspects involved in drug cases. Twenty-three of those officersdied in 1986 alone.   Three years ago, federal legislation was enacted establishingthe death penalty for military personnel convicted of espionageduring peacetime. Under federal law, the death penalty can also beimposed for airplane hijacking. No one has yet been executed underthe laws.   Thirty-seven states have death penalty laws. Since 1976, whenthe Supreme Court resumed permitting executions after a four-yearlull, 99 people _ all convicted murderers _ have been put to deathin the United States.   The Senate passed legislation in 1984 establishing the deathpenalty for attempts to kill the president and for murderscommitted on federal property, but the House never approved thebill.</TEXT></DOC>
