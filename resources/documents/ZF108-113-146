 The project begins asan implementation of a larger corporate strategy, but as itprogresses and complications develop, the strategic focus maybecome blurred.andP;  This loss of strategic focus can result in theoriginal intent of the investment becoming lost.andP;  Many companiesare now assigning customer project managers with theresponsibility of overseeing the completion of a project.andP;  Thiscan help to maintain a cost benefit analysis perspective as wellas to facilitate the completion of the project.andP;  Three valuabletactics for retaining strategic focus include visibleparticipation of a senior customer executive, the directing of aregular flow of corporate information to the project team andongoing cost-analysis revision.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Strategic PlanningProject ManagementCost Benefit AnalysisCustomer Relations.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Keeping a strategic focusandM;A Project is the tactical implementation of a broader corporate strategy.andO;Accordingly, it is initiated with goals that are stated in corporate terms,for example, increasing revenues, improving service levels, or achieving costefficiencies.andM;In many cases, as the project progresses and problems start to occur, thisstrategic view of the project loses focus and &quot;Finishing the Project&quot; becomesthe new goal.andM;For example, the project is entering the peak activity period.andP;  Problems andissues dominate the agenda and crisis management is in full effect.andM;Focus shiftedandM;The project started out as a business initiative to introduce a new productor to implement an operating efficiency.andP;  Suddenly, it has developed its ownlifeforce and completing the project has become the primary objective.andM;The focus has shifted and the goals now being communicated are &quot;cap theinvestment,&quot; &quot;discharge our responsibilities,&quot; &quot;get the customers (users)back to the operational department.&quot;andM;Somewhere along the way, this project has lost its strategic focus.andM;What was once viewed as the tactical implementation of a strategic program isnow seen as an obstacle to the financial and operational well-being of thecorporation.andM;The responsibilityandM;Who is responsible for maintaining the strategic focus?andM;Certainly, the executive sponsor/owner of the project has a large role toplay, however, the responsibility must belong to the project manager.andM;To address this issue, many organizations are now appointing customer projectmanagers.andP;  A customer project manager, whose operational bottom line was thebasis for the Project Cost Benefit Analysis, is perceived as being morelikely to manage the project from a strategic or &quot;bottom line&quot; perspective.andM;As project managers, systems professionals should also embrace thisphilosophy.andP;  Those who do will soon discover that the strategic approachprovides some significant benefits to the project manager.andM;Here are three tactics designed primarily to maintain the strategic focus,however, from each one it is clearly the project manager who benefits themost.andM;To be successful, it is essential for any strategic business project to havethe visible participation and commitment of a senior customer executive.andP;  Anideal opportunity for the executive to provide this leadership is chairingthe Project Steering Committee.andM;The project manager benefits because executive involvement provides an avenuefor escalating unresolved issues, ensures the participation of customerresources, and demonstrates the corporate commitment for the project to theentire project team.andM;The project manager must direct a regular flow of corporate information tothe project team so that all members of the project share the strategicfocus.andP;  Let us always remember the story of the bricklayers who were askedwhat they were doing.andP;  While the first replied, &quot;I am laying bricks&quot;, anotherreplied.andP;  &quot;I am building a cathedral&quot;.andM;A critical tactic is the ongoing revision to the Project Cost BenefitAnalysis.andM;The project was (hopefully) justified and funded on the basis of a CostBenefit Analysis showing an expected return to the corporation for aninvestment in the project.andM;Once a project is initiated, the Cost Benefit Analysis is usually put aside.andO;By allowing this to happen, the project manager is neglecting a very powerfulally against the biggest threat to the security of the project.andP;  That threatis change.andM;All change requests that alter the project scope or schedule should bediscussed in terms of their impact on the Cost Benefit Analysis.andP;  Even anaccumulation of smaller changes can adversely affect the expected return oninvestment or the payback period.andM;Through the effective maintenance of the Cost Benefit Analysis, project scopecontainment becomes a more manageable task for the project manager.andM;By employing these and other tactics, the project manager ensures that theproject team never loses sight of why the project is being financed by thecorporation.andP;  After all, when you understand the expectations of the personpaying the bill, you are on the track to success.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
