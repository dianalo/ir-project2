But pro-Iranian kidnappers in Beirut said they have postponedthe release because the United States failed to meet their demandto send a senior State Department official to Syria.   The handwritten statement was accompanied by an instant pictureof Robert Polhill, one of three U.S. educators held by the groupsince Jan. 24, 1987.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the releasestatements came from both the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation ofPalestine, which is holding several American hostages, and fromSyria.   ``We're hopeful this could be real,'' Fitzwater said as thepresident flew to Florida for a meeting with French PresidentFrancois Mitterrand.   Fitzwater said the State Department had dispatched a receptionteam to Wiesbaden, ``where they have the medical facilities toreceive any hostage that might be released.''   ``We have statements of imminent release from Islamic Jihad andfrom Syria,'' Fitzwater told reporters. But, he cautioned,``there's no way for us to know conclusively that it's going tohappen.''   He said the hostage reception team has been sent there before onrumors of a hostage release that never happened.   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine said onWednesday it would release one hostage this week. It did notidentify the hostage, but the statement was accompanied by aninstant photograph of Jesse Turner of Boise, Idaho. The group alsoholds Alann Steen and Robert Polhill.   Fitzwater said the Syrian government sent word throughdiplomatic channels Wednesday that it appears a hostage would bereleased. ``It is a little more significant that we have astatement from the Syrian government, but it by no means makes it acertainty,'' he said.   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler saidthe message from Syria was the first official word to the U.S.government that a hostage may be released.   She also ruled out any ``deals'' and said the United States hadhad no contact with Iran, directly or indirectly, about the captiveAmericans.   Ms. Tutwiler said Edward Djerejian, the U.S. ambassadorDamascus, had returned to his post in Syria after attending ameeting of U.S. diplomats in Bonn, West Germany. She said AssistantSecretary of State John Kelly, who also attended, did not plan togoto Syria, as demanded by the Islamic Jihad.   Eight Americans are among the Western hostages held in Lebanonby pro-Iranian groups. The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press, kidnapped March16, 1985.   Turner, Steen and Polhill were taken from the campus of BeirutUniversity College in Beirut on Jan. 24, 1987.   Asked if the administration was concerned that sending Kelly toDamascus might be viewed as negotiating with terrorists, Fitzwatersaid, ``we certainly don't want any question about negotiations tobe raised by his going.''   ``Our position is that we want the unconditional release of allhostages. We will not deal or negotiate for hostage release butwe're hopeful this could be real,'' Fitzwater said.</TEXT></DOC>
