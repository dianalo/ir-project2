Against cows.    Last week, in a half-hour of machine-gun fire and grenade explosions, more than 100 Marxist rebels staged an execution-style slaying of 204 pure-bred Brown Swiss milk cows on a big dairy farm near here. The farm belongs to a wealthy Salvadoran family, meaning the cows were enemy cows. In a war that has left some 60,000 human beings dead, the incident has caused furious debate.    Radio Venceremos, a clandestine rebel station, announced that the attack heralded the beginning of a new economic destruction campaign under the slogan &quot;Everyone eats, or no one eats,&quot; which is directed at winning higher wages for rural workers. The rebels promised to soon attack cattle belonging to other wealthy farmers and ranchers.    But the campaign, which adds a new wrinkle to the rebels' longtime strategy of crippling the country's economy by attacking bridges, roads, electricity stations and coffee plantations, appears likely to backfire. In this largely agrarian society, there are few citizens who don't appreciate a good piece of cow flesh, no matter who owns it. Thus, accounts of the slaughter stirred strong emotions.    &quot;Our people don't link the cows with the social status of the owner,&quot; said Archbishop Arturo Rivera y Damas in a strongly worded homily on Sunday. &quot;They can't conceive of how useful animals that don't harm anyone can be immolated by Salvadorans who say they fight for the welfare of the poorest.&quot;    Groans one leftist political analyst who frequently defends the guerrillas' methods, &quot;This is absolutely crazy. Surreal. Bizarre. Even though these were definitely oligarchic cows.&quot;    Many supporters of the rebels worry that the attack on these helpless animals will simply provide fodder for the government's propaganda machine. And the rebels' opponents have been exploiting the issue.    President Jose Napoleon Duarte drew appreciative titters from a crowd of peasants during a speech earlier this week when he mentioned the killing, saying, &quot;Now they have declared war on cows.&quot;    Lt. Col. Julio Cesar Grijalva, the deputy commander of the military garrison in charge of this region, says the attack shows how weak the rebels are militarily. &quot;This is revolution by hunger,&quot; he says.    Local cattle growers' associations issued communiques in solidarity with the Garcia Prieto family, one of El Salvador's richest, which owns the farm. And a series of unsigned political advertisements in local newspapers features photos of the dead animals next to shots of smiling rebel leaders. Superimposed on the photos is a tiny girl holding a glass of milk. The text says that the dead cattle could have provided 12 million glasses of milk a year to the children of El Salvador.    Leftist thinkers counter that most Salvadorans can't afford to give their children milk anyway. The private sector, the leftists claim, has raised a bigger stink about dead cattle than it ever did about the documented massacres of peasants by the army.    &quot;The last time I've seen such an outcry in the press was when the U.S. Marines were killed,&quot; says one former university professor, referring to a 1985 rebel attack at a sidewalk cafe that left four Marine guards from the U.S. Embassy dead, along with several civilians.    Jose Luis Argueta, the rector of the National University and a leftist sympathizer, says the attack was as legitimate as are assaults on other economic targets. &quot;A cattle herd has the same place in the scheme of capital as a cement plant,&quot; he says. &quot;Besides, think of all the thousands of animals of campesinos killed by army bombardments.&quot;    Rebel radio announcers, meanwhile, have been having a field day with the new strategy. Unfazed by promises from the army that it would be implacable in its pursuit of the assailants, Radio Venceremos taunted the military leadership: &quot;Poor generals, now you'll be a professional army trained and armed by Buffalo Bill Reagan but guarding cows.&quot;    (The army later triumphantly announced it had killed the guerrilla leader of the slaughter, although its description of the man didn't match that given by witnesses to the attack.)    The slaughter has stirred deep resentment among workers at Monte Grande, the sprawling, 700-acre farm that the guerrillas attacked. &quot;It's a tragedy for us, a disgrace for the campesinos,&quot; says an 18-year-old man who gives his name as Pedro and who gets paid about $10 a week to care for the farm's prize bulls. &quot;We're really the ones who suffer in this case; the owners can leave the country any time they want.&quot;    Still, even in the midst of tragedy, at least one hero emerged. Workers talk with pride of Sparky, the milk cow that sent one young guerrilla sprawling just as he was leveling his M-16 at her. Before he was back on his feet, she had jumped two fences and escaped.    As for the surviving 400 cows, farm administrator Eliseo Salmeron jokes, &quot;Now we're going to have to give them guns to defend themselves.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
