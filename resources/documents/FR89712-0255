This proposal is prompted by fatiguetesting by the manufacturer, which revealed cracks on the run-outs of stringers22 to 28 at the forward and rear internal side of the left-hand and right-handframe 47. This condition, if not corrected, could lead to reduced structuralcapability of the fuselage and subsequent decompression of the airplane.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received no later than August 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Send comments on the proposal in duplicate to the FederalAviation Administration, Northwest Mountain Region, Transport AirplaneDirectorate, ANM-103, Attention: Airworthiness Rules Docket No. 89-NM-78-AD,17900 Pacific Highway South, C-68966, Seattle, Washington 98168.

All comments submittedwill be available, both before and after the closing date for comments,in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizingeach FAA/public contact, concerned with the substance of this proposal,will be filed in the Rules Docket.Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submittedin response to this Notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped post cardon which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 89-NM-78-AD.''The post card will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>The Direction Genrale de L'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthinessauthority of France, in accordance with the provisions of an existing bilateralairworthiness agreement, has notified the FAA of an unsafe condition thatexists on Airbus Industrie Model A300 series airplanes. The manufacturerreported that, during full-scale fatigue tests, cracks developed in therun-outs of stringers 22 to 28 at the forward and rear internal side ofleft-hand and right-hand fuselage frame 47. This condition, if not corrected,could lead to reduced structural capability of the fuselage and subsequentdecompression of the airplane.Airbus Industrie has issued Service Bulletin A300-53-237, dated January18, 1989, which describes procedures for inspection for cracks of stringers22 to 28 run-outs at fuselage frame 47, and repair, if necessary. The DGAChas classified this service bulletin as mandatory.This airplane model is manufactured in France and type certificated inthe United States under the provisions of andSection; 21.29 of the FederalAviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on airplanes of thismodel registered in the United States, an AD is proposed that would requireinspection for cracks of stringers 22 to 28 run-outs at the fuselage frame47, and repair, if necessary, in accordance with the service bulletin previouslydescribed.It is estimated that 66 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected bythis AD, that it would take approximately 8 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost would be $40 permanhour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD to U.S.operators is estimated to be $21,120.The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draftevaluation prepared for this action is contained in the regulatory docket.A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
