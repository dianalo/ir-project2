Based upon the above, aninformation provision system of the electricity distribution servicesthrough the active system has been developed. This system is composedof two subsystems, namely the routine information provision subsystemand the non-routine information provision subsystem. The routine informationprovision subsystem is a system to produce the frequently used informationcollectively in the forms which are standardized throughout the KansaiElectric Power Co. and prepare them in the intermediate files beforehand.The non-routine information provision subsystem is a system that itsuser may retrieve any output content directly from the service filesin a desired form at well. As a result, any occurrence of problem becameimmediately noticed and the work and time needed for collection of therelevant information was greatly reduced. (10 figs, 4 photos, 1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
