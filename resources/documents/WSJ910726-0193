IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., complained that its offer wasmore than $500 million lower than the bid from ATandamp;T and itspartner, Pyramid Technology Corp.</LP><TEXT>   In asking the General Services Administration to overturnone of the biggest computer awards ever from the federalgovernment, IBM appeared to acknowledge that the ATandamp;T bidoffered more-advanced equipment. But IBM said in a statementthat &quot;in the request for proposals, the government said itdid not want to overspend to achieve slightly superiortechnical features.&quot; The statement said the contract was for&quot;fundamentally off-the-shelf commodity items&quot; and that &quot;giventhe current federal budget deficit there can be nojustification for spending an additional half a billiondollars.&quot;   In New York, an ATandamp;T spokesman said, &quot;We think ourcustomer, the Treasury Department, reviewed all competingbids thoroughly, and the decision will be upheld.&quot; A Treasuryspokesman had said at the time of the award that &quot;ourobjective was never just the lowest bid.&quot;   It has become routine for the losing bidder on a biggovernment computer contract to challenge the decision, butthe awards are seldom reversed.   Separately, IBM cut the list price on its laptop computerby 12%, to $5,245, and reduced prices on additional mainmemory by 45%. Market researchers say the machine hascontinued to sell well since its introduction in March. But,with a price war raging in the whole personal-computermarket, IBM's competitors have cut their prices on comparablelaptops, so IBM had to follow suit.</TEXT></DOC>
