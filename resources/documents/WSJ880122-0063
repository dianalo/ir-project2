Under the leveraged buy-out, Shoe-Town, Totowa, N.J., said 9.6 million common shares were tendered; the off-price shoe retailer has about 10.6 million shares outstanding.    As previously reported, the management group, STI Acquisition Corp., launched the buy-out last month. A shareholder request in a class-action lawsuit for an injunction to block the tender offer was denied Tuesday in Delaware Chancery Court.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Shoe-Town shares closed at $9.75, up 12.5 cents.    Holders who didn't tender under the offer will receive $9.75 for each of their shares once the transaction is completed, Shoe-Town said.    Leveraged buy-outs are acquisitions financed largely with debt. The borrowings then are repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or by asset sales. </TEXT></DOC>
