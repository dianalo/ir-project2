The primary focus is on the Reagan administration'sshaping of nuclear strategy, programs, and arms control, with particularattention to comparing the Administration's apparent objectives withits actions. The Administration entered office reasoning that the unsatisfactoryoutcome of the SALT accords, the shift in the nuclear balance in favorof the Soviet Union, and the widening gap between official strategicpolicy objectives and capabilities should serve as lessons in the reevaluationand reformulation of American arms policy. Greater attention would bepaid to supporting strategic policy requirements with the necessary programs,while deemphasizing and redefining the role of arms control in US nationalsecurity. The dissertation concludes that the Administration did notsupport its strategic policy standards and requirements with appropriatenuclear force programs and capabilities. The strategic modernizationprogram that was adopted neither closed the window of military vulnerabilitynor corrected the strategy-force mismatch.</TEXT></DOC>
