A group of new freshmen, aspiring members of the Pirustreet gang, were attacking Centennial's biggestupperclassmen. Taking blow after blow, one 310-pound footballplayer didn't fight back. He didn't dare. Piru revenge inCompton can be fatal.   &quot;It was sickening to watch,&quot; says Anderson Brown, aCentennial counselor.   Some principals would have called the police. But Mr.Miller got results by calling Big Dave, Duckee, and Shelton.   Born as David, James and Alex Cox, the three brothers arefounders of the Fruit Town Pirus, a street gang whose membershave been active in local crack-cocaine traffic, murders anddrive-by shootings, according to Compton police records. Mr.Miller appealed to the Coxes' sense of community pride.   &quot;They want these kids to get an education like everyoneelse,&quot; says the principal. The Coxes, who say they havereformed and don't run the Fruit Town group anymore,appreciated the principal's approach.   &quot;You can't be tough all the time,&quot; says David Cox, whograduated from Centennial seven years ago. &quot;You can alwayssit down and talk to someone; Miller does that.&quot; After themeeting, Mr. Cox says, he and his brothers talked to theyoung wouldbe gang members and told them to stop theharassment and go to class. &quot;The problem went away,&quot;Principal Miller says.   Close to a learning meltdown not long ago, Compton hasmade educational progress lately. It has done so by learninghow to deal with gangs.   With their students poor, urban and 99% minority, Comptonschools serve a city of 86,000 in the gang heartland ofsouth-central Los Angeles County. Not one block or school inCompton's 10 square miles is territory unclaimed by thecity's 40 black and Hispanic street gangs. In Washington,D.C., the nation's big-city murder leader, 72 people per100,000 residents die by homicide each year. In Compton, acity of fewer than 100,000, there were 78 homicides lastyear. Thirty-one were gang related, police say.   During much of the 1980s, if fights didn't empty desks,beepers often called students away from class for drug deals.In 1987-88, Compton hit the bottom 1% of all Californiaschools in state test scores, and 20% of its high-schoolstudents dropped out.   Since then, 12th-grade Compton scores on statewide testshave moved up to 160 from 135 in mathematics and to 158 from146 in reading. Scores are also up in four of five subjectsin the eighth grade. About 12.6% of Compton high-schoolgraduates now move on to state four-year colleges, up from9.1%. The dropout rate fell by about half to 10.6% in1988-89, the last year for which complete figures areavailable.   The most telling gain, however, may be the one inattendance, with the average up to 91% from 81% in 1986-87,as fear's grip on the schools has loosened.   As the kind of gang violence common between Bloods andCrips on the West Coast spreads nationally, Compton offerslessons on how schools can cope. Three million violentincidents a year plague the schools, U.S. crime reports show.Although that number has held stable in recent years, theNational School Safety Council, in Encino, Calif., says gangsare contributing to an escalation in serious incidents. TheCenter to Prevent Handgun Violence found newspaper reports of71 handgun killings in schools in the last four years in asurvey done last December.   Efforts to battle the gangs intensified in 1983, aftergang gunfire wounded five students at Compton's DominguezHills High School. Gangs killed a school janitor at a gradeschool last May and a school security officer in 1987.Centennial lost at least two students in drive-by killingslast year and two more to gang-related incidents this year,Mr. Miller says.   Compton has battled back by giving its school securityguards nearly all the powers of police, including arrest andbooking authority; by adopting dress codes banning baggypants, bandannas, beepers, and other gang regalia; and bylaunching Operation New Start, which includes lessons ongangs for parents, teachers and students.   Compton's school personnel have also developed gang-copingtechniques that can't be found in policy handbooks or programguides. The schools know they will never wipe the gangs out.So they manage the problem instead.   Part of Operation New Start is a 15-week &quot;behaviormodification&quot; class for fourth and fifth graders, designed tocorrect sometimes ambiguous attitudes toward gangs. Surveyedthis fall before taking the class, for example, 61% agreedwith the statement: &quot;There is nothing really wrong withgangs.&quot;   Midway through a session at Martin Luther King ElementarySchool, George Dawkins, a soft-spoken minister hired by thedistrict to teach the behavior class, is deep into a lessonon refusal skills.   &quot;Now children, I want you to tell me what could be theconsequences of ditching school.&quot;   &quot;You might get caught by security and sent back,&quot; says onechild. &quot;Your parents could see you,&quot; adds another. Thenlittle Albert LaShaun speaks: &quot;You could get shot.&quot;   &quot;What could happen then?&quot; Mr. Dawkins asks.   &quot;Could get wounded,&quot; says Charles Hall, another student   &quot;Anything else?&quot;   &quot;Death,&quot; says Charles.   Mr. Dawkins says Albert and Charles are right. Being onthe street at the wrong time, he warns, or &quot;just talking togang {members} is enough to get you shot.&quot; So is play-actinglike gangs or using gang hand signals. Because drug transportis the chief reason gangs recruit children, Mr. Dawkins showsa video in which several substance abusers die. The children,giggling at first, fall silent as the machine clicks off.   &quot;That was kind of hairy, wasn't it, class?&quot; says Mr.Dawkins. &quot;Makes you feel sad.&quot; Then Mr. Dawkins asks whatthey would do if friends ask them to smoke a joint. LarryHoward, a stocky youngster in a purple-striped shirt, answersthe question with a question:   &quot;What if your mother or father ask you to do it?&quot;   Mr. Dawkins says that's a &quot;very seldom&quot; occurrence. But&quot;what if they're on PCP?&quot; another child wants to know. Mr.Dawkins urges them to resist.   &quot;Let's not fool ourselves, boys and girls,&quot; he says. &quot;It'sgoing to be tough.&quot; As he returns the class to its regularteacher, even students distracted during the film are buzzingwith expectation. A scratchy Christmas album is placed on anold phonograph, and the students loudly take up a chorus:&quot;Oh, let there be peace on Earth.&quot;   One afternoon at nearby Davis Middle School, instructorWillard McCrumby is introducing parents to the language andequipment of local gangs. While a Pot Luck buffet of turkeywings and cornbread sits on tables behind him, a table nextto him holds a short sword made from a six-inch knife and asteel chair leg, a leather belt studded with nails, a2.5-pound lead weight on a chain, a colorful pile of sportshats and other gang regalia.   Mr. McCrumby hands out a &quot;street-talk test&quot; that deciphersterms such as &quot;home boy&quot; (fellow gang member), &quot;strawberry&quot;(a girl who trades sex for drugs), and &quot;take him out the box&quot;(killing a rival). &quot;These are some of the things you shouldnot buy for your youngsters,&quot; Mr. McCrumby advises, holdingup &quot;locs,&quot; or rapper-style sunglasses favored by gangmembers, &quot;cake cutter&quot; combs with long metal tines thatslash, and toy guns real-looking enough to draw fire frompeople with real ones.   Most of all, Mr. McCrumby cautions, beware when yourchildren ask for athletic jackets or caps, often a sign ofgang leanings. Compton's Spooktown Crips wear the hats of theSan Diego Padres; the West Side Pirus lean to Texas Tech.Look under the brim of your child's cap, Mr. McCrumby says,and you may discover his street name or a crossed-out streetname. Mr. McCrumby says the crossed-out street name couldmean the student has killed someone.   Warm applause follows the presentation. Several parentsvow not to buy hats. &quot;Anything against the gangs is good,&quot;says Charles Allen, who has a sixth-grade son at Davis. Amemory guides Mr. Allen's vigilance with his son. In March of1988, he says a gang member killed his father-inlaw with ashot through the forehead as he sat on the front porch. Why?&quot;You tell me,&quot; says Mr. Allen, shrugging. &quot;They said it was agang initiation.&quot;   Crimes on school grounds fell to 417 in the year endedlast June 30 from 671 the year before, and arrests rose to278 from 129. The 113 arrests and 316 crimes in the sixmonths ended last Dec. 31, were keeping pace with the yearbefore.   One typical week this school year in Compton included sixarrests, five burglaries, four violent assaults, one knifefight, an extortion, the confiscation of a .25-caliberautomatic pistol, one strongarm robbery and one assault witha deadly scholastic weapon: a Centennial student answeredgang threats by smashing a trophy against a Piru's head inthe assistant principal's office.   School police officers sit in daily on the briefings ofCompton's regular police to learn about gang-relatedincidents outside the schools. Sometimes, using theinformation, Compton school officials have even called gangmembers at home and &quot;suggested&quot; they stay away from schoolfor a day or more.   Osvaldo Villarreal, a school police officer at Compton'sDominguez Hills High School, says he thinks Dominguez is asafer school than it was when he arrived two years ago. &quot;Thestudents respect me,&quot; he says, wheeling an unmarked cararound the sprawling Dominguez campus.   Getting this respect often involves some creativelaw-enforcement techniques. A Dominguez student whoidentifies himself only as Richard says he refused when Mr.Villarreal ordered him to erase the graffiti of his gang,Compton Varrio 124, from a table he had scrawled it on. WhenRichard accused Mr. Villarreal of hiding behind his badge andgun, the officer, who is average in height, muscular and inhis mid-30s, offered to settle the matter man to man. &quot;I gotmy ass beat,&quot; says Richard. The graffiti disappeared.   Pulling up to a crowd of students that is supposed to bein class, Mr. Villarreal, rolls down the window and beckons astudent wearing a gold earring. The student, Lafayette Hicks,accepts Mr. Villarreal's invitation to get in, and the cardrives off.   A member of one of the Crip gangs that dominate Dominguez,Lafayette says things are quieting down at the school. Thefew Pirus attending Dominguez are all &quot;undercover&quot; -- notwearing their gang's colors -- &quot;so we're slackin' up on 'em,&quot;says Lafayette, attired in distinctive blueblack Cripaccoutrements: L.A. Raiders hat, baggy trousers, and aloose-hanging L.A. Dodgers shirt with &quot;007,&quot; his street name,stitched on.   Lafayette notes that there is a probation officer oncampus for the first time this year, so students with pastoffenses are watching themselves. And then there is Mr.Villarreal.   &quot;They got an officer here who is doing his job,&quot; saysLafayette. &quot;He respects us and we respect him.&quot;   Up to a point. Students spit at the ground when Mr.Villarreal approaches, a gang expression of disrespect. ButMr. Villarreal tolerates this. He also rarely bothersstudents for sporting gang apparel banned by the dress code.After dropping Lafayette off, Mr. Villarreal chases down fourstudents hiding behind the bushes, whom he suspects ofgambling. On one of the students, who is wearing Crip colors,Mr. Villarreal finds a knife, which he returns to the gangmember. &quot;If I catch one with a knife, and don't book him,I'll get some information from him,&quot; Mr. Villarreal explains.   The next morning, Mr. Villarreal claims some vindicationfor his policies. A campus visitor has had a radio stolenfrom his car. Based on information from students, Mr.Villarreal tracks down the culprit, who identifies himself asJavier, and cuts a deal: no criminal charges if the radio isgiven up and the student agrees to a suspension. Javier hasonly one regret. Although he insists he isn't a gang member,he says he transferred to Dominguez from Compton High Schoolto get away from the attacks of Crips who believed hebelonged to a local Hispanic gang. Back at Compton, where hewill now be forced to return after the suspension, the Cripsare waiting.   Javier had been the beneficiary of a mercifully liberal,if unofficial, school transfer policy. The practice allowsgang members to avoid attending a school dominated by a rivalgang, and is also used to protect innocent students who arebeing harassed.   Centennial's Mr. Miller says up to 200 of his 1,400students have transferred into his school from other Comptonneighborhoods, and from neighboring towns. A similar numberof students who would be at Centennial have transferred out.   &quot;I always review the kid's record before he comes in, andI won't have any hard-core gang {members},&quot; says Mr. Miller.&quot;But when a parent sits in front of you with tears in hiseyes and says I'm afraid my son will get killed, what can youdo?&quot;   Former bus drivers for Centennial, regarded as a Blood andPiru school, also say routes were changed five years ago toavoid some Crip areas. Such peace-keeping measures, togetherwith Mr. Miller's hard line toward beepers and showingcolors, have helped hope gain a notch on fear at CentennialHigh.   &quot;When I first came here, I saw more than fights, I sawwars,&quot; says Kamika Colvin, a 17-year-old senior atCentennial. &quot;I've seen people going wild, a teacher gettinghis arm broken, boys hitting teachers, students gettingknocked out. Now they're kicking the gangsters out. It'scalmed down a lot.&quot;   About 300 students now take algebra instead of simplermath courses, up from 210 in 1987. An advanced-placementcalculus class has been added. The state math-score gainsindicate more is being learned.   Still, attendance is slack and motivation seems dimmed inteacher Samuel Ibe's morning algebra classes one Friday. Astudent repeats Mr. Ibe's instructions, mimicking hisNigerian accent to general amusement. But Mr. Ibe ignores thebarbs and ends up with a breakthrough of sorts.   &quot;What do we do when we are dividing two fractions?&quot; Mr.Ibe asks. Without waiting to be called, a boy in a schooljacket with Centennial's Apache insignia blurts out: &quot;Invertthe second fraction.&quot; What next? &quot;Cross cancel.&quot; Then what?&quot;Multiply.&quot; On a roll, Mr. Ibe asks a question that hadstumped students in a class earlier that day: &quot;What is theproduct of a negative and a positive?&quot;   &quot;Negative,&quot; replies the young man correctly. &quot;Alwaysnegative.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
