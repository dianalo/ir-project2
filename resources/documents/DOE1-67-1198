<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-67-1198 </DOCNO><TEXT>Kyushu Electric Power Co., Inc. is constructing the Hatchobaru No. 2 unit,whose commercial operation is scheduled to start in 1990. The magma reservoirthat has caused the volcanism around Mt. Goutou and Mt. Kuroiwa actsas the heat source for the geothermal acitivies in the Otake and Hatchobaruareas. The existence of a NE-SW geologic fault that has been expectedfrom a magnetotelluric survey is confirmed by examination through exploratoryboreholes. The examination also permits the determination of the sizeof the geothermal reservoir which can provide a steam source for theHatchobaru No. 2 unit. The power generator is of the same model and capacityas the No. 1 unit and its output is also the same 55,000 kW. Its majorfeature is the adoption of the double flash cycle, two-phase flow transportation,integrated steam well operation, continuous remote monitoring and control,gas extraction equipment and electrical devices protection against corrosion.Investigations are made of various environmental issues including thesize of the geothermal reservoir, its effect on hot springs, metal corrosiondue to hydrogen sulfide, effects on ground subsidence and earthquakes,measures to be taken for natural landscape and nature conservation. Predictionand evaluation of these environmental effects are also made. (21 figs,8 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
