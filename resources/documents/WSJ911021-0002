This is decaffeinated, so I don't need to saythat caffeine is addictive and can cause temporary butsignificant increases in your blood pressure and heartbeat.However, FDA regulations do require me to notify you that thedecaffeination process may leave minute traces ofcarcinogenic solvents in the coffee beans.&quot; He poured.   I had nearly finished the front page when he returned withmy breakfast.   &quot;Your eggs,&quot; he said as he put my plate in front of me,&quot;are fried in a polyunsaturated oil high in fat and calories.Eggs that are only lightly cooked may contain salmonella, anorganism causing food poisoning, and the National Society forthe Alleviation of Allergies warns that many Americansexhibit a mild allergic response to the ova of domestic fowl.Egg yolks contain large quantities of cholesterol, and theAmerican Association of Cardiological Surgeons recommendsthat people over 40, particularly those who smoke or are morethan 10 pounds overweight, limit their consumption to foureggs per week.&quot;   I sucked in my stomach.   &quot;Potatoes,&quot; he continued, &quot;are a member of the nightshadefamily, and any greenish patches on their skin may containtraces of an alkaloid poison called solanine. The Physician'sReference Manual says solanine can cause vomiting, diarrhea,and acute nausea. However, your potatoes have been carefullypeeled, and our supplier has agreed to assume any liabilitythat may arise from their consumption.   &quot;The blueberry muffin contains enriched flour, cane sugar,eggs, butter, blueberries and low-sodium baking powder. TheInstitute of Alimentary Studies warns that a diet high inprocessed flour may add to your risk of stomach andintestinal cancer. The Center for Dietary Purity warns thatprocessed wheat flour may be contaminated with up to twotenths of a part per billion of fungicides and rodenticides.It has been bleached and brominated and in cool wet yearsmight also contain minute traces of ergot. Ingested insufficient quantities, ergot can cause hallucinations andconvulsions, arterial spasms, and induce abortions inpregnant women.   &quot;Citizens Against Empty Calories, an independent researchorganization funded in part by the American Beet SugarProducers Association, warns that cane sugar is high incalories, low in nutritional value, and one of the principaldietary factors associated with dental caries.   &quot;Butter, like eggs, is high in cholesterol, a materialthat studies have identified as playing a potentiallysignificant role in the development of arteriosclerosis andheart disease, particularly in genetically susceptibleindividuals. If any of your close relatives ever had a heartattack, the Department of Health and Human Services warnsthat your personal physician might advise you to limit yourintake of butter, cream and other dairy products.   &quot;Our blueberries are from Maine. They have not beenfertilized or treated with pesticides. However, the U.S.Geological Survey has reported that many Maine blueberrybarrens are located on granite, and granitic rock frequentlycontains measurable amounts of radioactive uranium, radiumand radon gas.   &quot;Finally, the baking powder used in these muffins containssodium aluminum sulfate. Aluminum, some researchers suggest,may be a contributing factor in the development ofAlzheimer's disease. The National Institute of Mental Healthhas not stated a position on this, but it has asked us toinform our customers that it will be funding a seven-year,$47 million study examining the association between aluminumconsumption and senility syndromes.&quot;   He picked up a pitcher. &quot;I have to inform you that our`fresh-squeezed' orange juice was actually prepared before 6this morning. It is now 8:30. The FDA and the JusticeDepartment recently sued a restaurant in Georgia (U.S. v.Mom's Homebaked Cafe) for describing three-hour-old juice as`fresh-squeezed.' Until that case is decided, our legaladvisers have required us to get a waiver from any customerordering a similar product.&quot;   I signed the form he handed me, and he stapled a copy tomy bill. But as I reached for the glass, he stopped me.   &quot;Excuse me, please. Our salt and pepper shakers areclearly labeled, but corporate policy requires that I repeatthe warnings to you verbally. On the salt it says, `Ifconsumed in large quantitites, sodium chloride can be highlytoxic, and habitual ingestion of this compound has been shownto cause life-threatening hypertension.' The other shakersays: `Pepper. Use with extreme caution] The Center forCommunicable Disease warns that sneezing associated withcareless use of this powder may contribute to thetransmission of rhinoviral and influenza-type diseases.'Finally, the Department of Consumer Safety has determinedthat the tines of your fork are sharp, and new regulationsrequire me to caution customers to use that utensil withextreme care.&quot;   He turned, and with a cheery &quot;Enjoy your breakfast, sir,&quot;headed off to the next table. I picked at my meal butcouldn't finish it. The food had gotten cold, and somehow Ihad lost my appetite.   ---   Mr. Alden, a Michigan writer, normally eats his breakfastat home.</TEXT></DOC>
