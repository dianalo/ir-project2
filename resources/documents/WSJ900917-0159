The sheer number of airline flights is increasing fasterthan the rate of airliner accidents is decreasing. If thattrend continues, says the world's top builder of passengerjets, the net effect would be an average of 20 major crashesa year for all makes of airliners by the middle of the nextdecade, up from 15 now.</LP><TEXT>   That's &quot;hitting critical mass&quot; in terms of negativepublicity, Boeing says, so it has set out to do everything itcan to reduce the number of crashes before travelers arescared out of their wits. &quot;We're heavily dependent on publicconfidence,&quot; says Earl Weener, the engineer in charge ofsafety at the Seattle giant. &quot;And clearly, the public wouldlike us to have no accidents.&quot;   Perfection is impossible. But Mr. Weener maintains that bystudying the roughly 850 large-scale plane wrecks that haveoccurred since the jet age began in the late 1950s, Boeinghas come up with a plan to reduce significantly the number ofairliner accidents and fatalities.   Boeing already has started going public with its findings,sharing them with the rest of the industry, the media andlawmakers. In all of these forums, Boeing has insisted thatthe means to make flying safer are already available. &quot;Wedon't need a lot of new, sexy technology,&quot; Mr. Weener says.Instead, carriers and airports around the globe need to makeinvestments in safety-enhancing equipment, and airlines needto train their pilots better, Boeing suggests.   At the same time, Boeing isn't discounting the importanceof correcting its own design deficiencies or assembly-linemiscues, when they arise. &quot;We're not saying it's all thefault&quot; of airports and pilots, Mr. Weener insists. But henotes that when there's an identifiable manufacturing problemthat leads to a crash, the Federal Aviation Administration ismandated to step in and it tends to be fixed relativelyquickly. The problems that Boeing is pointing out, bycontrast, have seemed to sit and fester. &quot;Some of what iscausing accidents is absolutely too predictable,&quot; Mr. Weenersays.   Although some in the aviation industry are skeptical thatBoeing's plan will make much of a difference, the reaction toBoeing's open airing of its concerns has been surprisinglypositive. Even the Air Line Pilots Association has beensupportive. While the union is uneasy with Boeing'scalculations that mistakes by flight crews have caused morethan 72% of the accidents during the past 10 years, the unionpraises the company for digging behind the raw statistics, acompilation of U.S. and foreign government investigativereports.   &quot;Even though it grates on us to hear `pilot error,' we doknow that what Boeing is doing is right and proper,&quot; saysJohn O'Brien, the union's director of engineering and airsafety.   One tactic in Boeing's plan is to encourage airportsaround the world to put in electronic instrument-landingsystems, beams that help guide a plane on its glide pathdownward. Looking at its own 737 narrow-body twin-jet, Boeingsays that of 83 major accidents that have occurred since theplane was introduced in the late 1960s, 40 were duringapproach and landing. Many of these could have been averted,Mr. Weener says, if airport facilities had been using thegear Boeing is calling for. The system, which has alreadybeen installed at most major U.S. airports, costs about $1million a runway.   Another tactic that Boeing recommends is the use offlight-data recorders to review regularly the performance ofaircraft and their flight crews. Although many foreigncarriers use such a setup, U.S. airlines have been inclinedto check such a wide range of information only after a crash,when the &quot;black box&quot; is recovered.   But now, largely because of Boeing's efforts, domesticairlines are considering adding to their planes newsophisticated recorders that can spot troubling patternsbefore any damage is done. For instance, a recorder couldalert regulators to the fact that planes landing at a certainairport are repeatedly descending too rapidly.   &quot;It's our hope that we're going to see in the comingmonths one or more of the large carriers decide to go into itin a big way,&quot; says Anthony Broderick, the FAA's chief ofregulation and certification. Mr. Weener says the key is forairlines to use the recorders strictly to foster safety, notas tools against pilots who may have gone astray.   The biggest lifesaver, though, could turn out to be adevice that already exists on domestic airliners, but thathas often malfunctioned or been misused. Since 1975, pilotsaround the world have unwittingly run aircraft into theground 66 times without mechanical failures, bad weather orair-traffic controller foul-ups. In 44 of those cases, Boeingsays, the planes either didn't have a ground-proximitywarning system or had a faulty one. The system is supposed tosound an alarm -- &quot;Pull up] Pull up]&quot; it shrieks -- when anairliner not configured for landing has strayed too close tothe terrain.   Although the device costs only about $30,000 an aircraftto install -- a minimal expense considering that a wide-bodyjet can go for more than $125 million these days -- it'sestimated that two-thirds of all non-U.S. carriers, or about460 airlines, don't use such systems in their fleets. Even inthe U.S., where Congress has mandated the use ofground-proximity indicators, Boeing has found that pilotsoften ignore the signal; that's exactly what happened in fiveof six crashes of this type last year, it says.   Part of the reason is that early-generation warningsystems had a tendency to go off inadvertently, which hasconditioned some cockpit crews to assume a high number offalse alarms. &quot;A lot of pilots just turn them off,&quot; says Mr.Weener.   The solution, he says, is for carriers to make sure theyare using the latest systems, which are much less likely tobe triggered arbitrarily and give a pilot an extra long timeto respond. In addition, Boeing believes that airlines mustteach pilots to take the plane higher immediately, if theycan, and to ask questions later, even if a flight is delayedas a result.   Not everyone in the industry is convinced that Boeing'sproposals will really do that much good. &quot;Anytime you havesomebody with Boeing's credibility pounding the drum, it'scertain to help,&quot; says Rick Davis, director of an aviationsafety program at the University of Southern California. But,he adds, &quot;getting things done is not always so easy,&quot; becausecertain airlines will by nature be slow to make changes, andthose in weaker financial condition may not be able to affordeven the slightest safety improvements.   Ken Plunkett, director of research at the Aviation SafetyInstitute, a Worthington, Ohio, watchdog organization, alsopoints out that some mistakes by pilots are inevitable.&quot;Maybe we're trying to push human beings beyond&quot; what they'reable to do, he suggests.   Nonetheless, Boeing feels that by stirring discussion, itcan -- and will -- make things better. &quot;Traditionally, wehaven't wanted to point the finger,&quot; explains RandyHarrision, the Boeing public relations man on the campaign.&quot;But it's gotten to the point that if we can't influenceevents, it's going to become untenable for everybody.&quot;   Boeing may be pointing the finger, but it isn't namingnames, even at meetings attended exclusively by aviationindustry officials. Instead of singling out the carriers withlousy records, it's calling attention to exemplary airlines,such as British Airways and Pan American World Airways, whenit comes to the proper use of ground-proximity warningsystems.   &quot;I have not heard anything that would cause us to haveconcern&quot; with Boeing's approach, says William W. Hoover,executive vice president for operations and safety at the AirTransport Association of America, the carriers' trade group.   In the end, what could have become a nasty display ofbickering and backbiting is quietly emerging into an unusualshow of cooperation and mutual support. &quot;I think more andmore, the industry is realizing what the full cost of anaccident is,&quot; says John Enders, president of the FlightSafety Foundation, a nonprofit Washington group that isworking with all the players to help smooth over the roughspots.   ---             Primary Causes of Major Accidents                                                                                                             In world-wide commercial jet fleet, since 1980-89                                                                                                              CAUSE                       NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS                                                                                                        Flight crew mistake ............         88 Airplane malfunction ...........         13 Airport/traffic control error ..          6 Weather ........................          6 Maintenance problem ............          3 Miscellaneous ..................          5                                                                                                          NOTE: Table includes only accidents in which the aircraftis damaged beyond repair and a primary cause has beenidentified by government investigators.
