The paper maker posted net income of $90 million, or 80 cents a share, compared with $76 million, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier. Per-share figures were adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split effective in May.    Sales rose 55% to $1.91 billion from $1.23 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, International Paper shares closed at $47.75, down 87.5 cents.    The company also named three senior vice presidents to the new posts of executive vice president: David I.J. Wang, 55 years old, will head the company's timber and diversified businesses divisions; he is a newly appointed director, filling a vacancy. W. Craig McClelland, 53, and a director, will be in charge of pulp and coated papers; he remains president and chief executive officer of the company's Hammermill Paper Co. subsidiary. John T. Dillon, 49, will run the company's packaging businesses.    The new executive vice presidents will report to John A. Georges, 56, chairman and chief executive officer. International Paper hasn't yet named a president to succeed Paul H. O'Neill, who resigned in April to become chairman of Aluminum Co. of America.    Mr. Georges said he expects continued growth for the second half, adding that the improved first-half earnings came despite a higher 1987 tax rate and start-up costs associated with the opening of two new paper facilities.    &quot;Market conditions for most of our major product lines are positive,&quot; he said.    For the first half, net rose 78% to $180 million, or $1.62 a share, from $101 million, or 94 cents a share, a year earlier. The results include the Hammermill unit, which was acquired by International Paper in the fourth quarter of 1986.    Sales increased 58% to $3.74 billion from $2.37 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
