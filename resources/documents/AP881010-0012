Tim Wirth,D-Colo., summing up what is becoming a bipartisan litany amongenvironmentalists.   ``Whichever administration comes in will probably be much moresupportive of environmental legislation than this one,'' says Sen.Robert Stafford, R-Vt., who frequently found himself at odds withthe Reagan White House.   ``It looks like it's going to take a new president,'' addsRichard Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition, aconsortium of environmental, public health and labor groups.   Sounding a note of pessimism is Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine,who spent much of 1988 trying to unite disparate factions on whatwould have been the first major rewriting of the Clean Air Act in11 years.   ``I believe that many who say they support clean air havenaively placed too much confidence in Vice President Bush's(environmental) statements than they warrant,'' Mitchell said lastweek as he ended efforts to find an air-quality compromise thisyear.   ``I don't think it will make much difference with him,'' saidMitchell, adding that Bush's call for a reduction of ``millions''of tons of the acid-rain chemical sulfur dioxide is vague comparedto Dukakis' call for a 12 million ton cut in sulfur dioxideemissions from coal-burning plants.   ``He could push for a 3 million ton cut and not still violate acampaign pledge,'' says Mitchell, calling for a minimum reductionof 10 million tons.   Both presidential candidates have been talking up a cleanerenvironment on the campaign trail, which contrasts sharply with theReagan administration's early frontal attacks on environmental lawsand running battles with Congress.   The administration's record hasn't been entirely negative.Spurred by the warnings of scientists, it supported theinternational agreement to reduce emissions of chemicals that aredestroying the Earth's ozone layer.   But on a number of other environmental issues _ including acidrain, toxic wastes and strip mining _ it has been widely accused offoot-dragging or worse.   The next president and the 101st Congress are likely to find anincreasingly global focus to the issue of air quality, whichheretofore has been framed in terms of smoggy cities and lakes andtrees harmed by acid rain.   For the last two years, scientists have been appearing before anever widening circle of House and Senate committees to deliverfrightening warnings about global warming called the greenhouseeffect.   They say a variety of factors, from burning fossil fuels such ascoal and petroleum to destruction of tropical rain forests, areoverloading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases that trap heatthat normally would escape into space.   No one is directly linking this summer's drought and recordtemperatures to global warming, but witnesses say more suchconditions, along with coastal flooding, can be expected sometimein the next century.   Scientists are divided over when average temperatures will climbto dangerous levels, but some warn that even if greenhouse gaseswere controlled tomorrow, the Earth may already be committed to itshottest period in 100,000 years.   Greenhouse control bills have been introduced on both sides ofCongress calling for a variety of remedies including better energyefficiency, development of alternatives to fossil fuel andinternational cooperation.   Wirth, who has chaired some of the greenhouse hearings, saysglobal warming may be the catalyst that can break the air-qualityimpasse that stems from competing economic and regional interestsin this country.   ``I think that's where the possibility may be,'' said Wirth, whoalong with Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., is trying to interest thepresidential candidates in a joint plan relying heavily on economicincentives to curb greenhouse emissions.   Witnesses have told Wirth's hearings there would be day-to-dayside benefits from attacking the greenhouse problem: saving energycould reduce emissions of acid rain chemicals; vehicles with betterfuel mileage not only would cut carbon emissions contributing tothe greenhouse effect but also would emit less smog-producingchemicals.   The global warming threat also offers the next administration anew frontier for relations with the Soviet Union. The two nationsare estimated to be responsible for 45 percent of the world'sgreenhouse gases.   Wirth says failure of the latest effort to strengthen the CleanAir Act demonstrates the need for a partnership between the WhiteHouse and Congress in dealing with the far more complicated andominous problem of global warming.   ``It shows how difficult it is to push something uphill withoutadministration support,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
