Disaster specialists reviewed the scenarios on Thursday withadministrative personnel from police, fire and medical teamsplanning for the Atlanta convention.   The Jackson scenario assumes that disgruntled Jackson delegates,holding a ``Draft Jesse for President'' rally, might block theentrance to a hotel in protest.   Other scenarios included:   _A water main breaks, leaving the Omni, site of the convention,without water.   _Five Missouri delegates report their credentials are stolen.   About 35,000 people are expected for the July event, not a largecrowd by Atlanta convention standards. A computer conferenceearlier this month drew twice that many.   ``But we'll have the eyes of the world on us,'' said EllisStanley, director of the Atlanta-Fulton County Emergency ManagementAgency. ``We've got to know where all the duties andresponsibilities will fall.''</TEXT></DOC>
