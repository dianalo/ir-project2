RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal bya former Chicago councilman convicted of fraud for conspiringillegally to buy and sell tax-delinquent properties.   The court, over one dissenting vote, refused to use the case ofThomas E. Keane to set guidelines on when some people may challengetheir fraud convictions after completing prison terms for thoseconvictions.   Only Justice Harry A. Blackmun voted to hear arguments inKeane's case.   Keane, 83, was paroled in 1978 after nearly two years in prison.   Lower courts said, in effect, Keane now has too little at staketo mount such a challenge.   The Bush administration, although agreeing with the lowercourts, nevertheless urged the justices to hear Keane's appeal.Justice Department lawyers said the case should be used to resolvea recurring conflict among federal courts.   For example, former Maryland Gov. Marvin Mandel's convictionunder the same federal anti-fraud law was overturned by a federaljudge in 1987 after Mandel was released from prison. The 4th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling.   The Bush administration has an appeal pending before the highcourt that seeks to reinstate Mandel's conviction, which stemmedfrom a scheme to help friends who owned a racetrack in return formore than $380,000 in gifts.   In the case acted on today, Keane was convicted in 1974 of mailfraud. Prosecutors said that while a city councilman he formed asecret partnership to acquire tax-delinquent property at CookCounty scavenger sales.   The prosecutors said Keane used his influence as chairman of thecity council's finance committee to reduce tax liens on the parcelsand then convinced friends at public agencies to buy the parcels atmore than their market price.   There was conflicting evidence at the trial as to whether Keanemade a profit from his efforts. A separate state court trialconcluded that Keane did not make any money.   The jury in the federal trial was told it could convict Keane offraud without finding that he made any profit or that the taxpayerssuffered a tangible loss.   A guilty verdict could be based on a finding Keane defrauded thecitizens of Chicago of their intangible right to his faithful andloyal services, the jury was told.   After his federal conviction, Keane was sentenced to prison andfined $27,000.   Years after he was freed and completed his parole, the SupremeCourt ruled in 1987 that a federal mail fraud conviction may not bebased on a defendant's defrauding the public of its intangibleright to honest and impartial government.   The justices said there must be some tangible loss suffered bytaxpayers.   That ruling prompted Keane to go back to the federal courts tohave his conviction overturned. He also sought return of the$27,000 fine.   A federal judge threw out Keane's challenge, and the decisionwas upheld last July by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   The appeals court said too little was at stake for the courts toexpend valuable resources to consider the challenge years afterKeane had served his time in prison.   The $27,000 fine ``is a sunk cost rather than a continuingdisability producing additional injury as time passes,'' theappeals court said.   It also said the harm to Keane's reputation does not ``justifythe investment of judicial time necessary to decide whether he isentitled to vindication.''   Keane might have been convicted of mail fraud even if the jurywere told to base its verdict on a tangible loss of property, the7th Circuit court added.   ``No one can accept without unease the thought the legal systemtolerates erroneous convictions,'' the appeals court said. But itsaid, ``At some point the judicial system must close old files andturn to the future, regretfully accepting the risk of error lestthe quest for perfect justice becomes the enemy of adequatejustice.''   Justice Department lawyers said even though they agreed with the7th Circuit court ruling the Supreme Court should review the matter.   Other appeals courts erroneously have made it easier forconvicted criminals who have completed their sentences to challengetheir convictions, the government said.   The case is Keane vs. U.S., 88-1178.</TEXT></DOC>
