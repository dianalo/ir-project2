The questionis: where?   Last year at this time, when money-fund yields werepushing 10% after rising steadily for about a year, more than$1 billion a week was flowing into the funds. But in the pastsix weeks, more than $8 billion has flowed out of moneyfunds, and for good reasons.</LP><TEXT>   While average money-fund yields have stayed just under 8%for more than three months, interest rates in general havegone up and headed back down. The temporary rise made yieldson some other investments more attractive than money funds.Now, with rates headed lower, moving into other investmentsoffers a chance to lock in today's yields for months or evenyears to come.   Although no one's suggesting that investors pull all, oreven most, of their cash out of money funds, many financialadvisers do say this is a good time to at least considerother things as well.   &quot;You have to segment&quot; your assets, says Kurt Brouwer ofSan Francisco investment advisers Brouwer andamp; Janachowski. &quot;Askyourself, `How much do I need to keep liquid, and how muchcan I afford to lock in for a little longer?'&quot;   Financial professionals generally recommend keeping theequivalent of three months of living expenses in some kind ofliquid account to cover unexpected illness or otheremergencies. There's also an argument for keeping a certainamount of cash on hand to take advantage of unexpectedinvestment opportunities. For those purposes, money fundslook pretty good. Their average yield of 7.96% is more than afull percentage point better than the 6.63% average onmoney-market deposit accounts at major banks.   Some of the cash coming out of money funds is undoubtedlygoing into the stock market. After all, the long-term averagereturn on stocks has been about 10% a year. But theshort-term risk in stocks can be great, and money-fundinvestors tend to be risk-averse. Typically, they prefer thestability of fixed-income investments, the comparativeliquidity of bond mutual funds and the safety of securitiesbacked by the U.S. government.   Here's a look at some of the alternatives:                                                                                                          CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT: These are a popular alternativeto money funds because federal deposit insurance makes themparticularly safe. There are usually steep penalties forearly withdrawal, however, so most money-fund investors wouldprobably opt for the shortest terms. To get a yield betterthan 8% from a bank generally requires at least a one-yearcommitment.   In some parts of the country, however, depositors can dothat well or better on terms as short as three months. InNarragansett, R.I., for instance, Pier Bank offers 8.75% forthree months. A six-month CD at Connecticut Bank andamp; Trust Co.in Hartford yields 9%.   &quot;If you're going to be moving out of money funds into CDs,this is a good time,&quot; says Edward D. McCarthy, a financialplanner in Providence, R.I. &quot;The market in this part of thecountry is as hot as I've seen it in years.&quot;   One option for investors considering CDs is buying themfrom a major brokerage firm. According to Banxquote MoneyMarkets, a New York information service, the average yield ona six-month broker-sold CD is 8.37%. The CDs are actuallyissued by banks and thrifts and are insured; the brokeragefirms negotiate rates with the banks and thrifts whose CDsthey sell.   Because many big brokerage firms maintain a secondary, orresale, market in the CDs they sell, investors concernedabout liquidity can buy a two-year CD, with an average yieldof 8.95% at the firms surveyed by Banxquote, and sell itlater if they need the money.                                                                                                          TREASURY BILLS: T-bills, which are backed by the U.S.government, come in maturities of three, six and 12 months.The six-month bill, which yielded 8.10% at yesterday's weeklyTreasury auction, offers a slightly better yield than theaverage money fund; the one-year bill is even better,currently yielding just under 8.2%. And T-bills are exemptfrom state and local taxes.   T-bills, however, require a minimum investment of $10,000.A few money funds have no minimum-investment requirement, andmany let investors get started with as little as $500.   Buying Treasurys through a bank or broker, which usuallycharge a $50 to $100 fee, reduces the yield. But Treasurysecurities can be purchased directly at no fee through theFederal Reserve Bank by mail or in person.   Investors willing to lock up their money for a while canget better yields. A 10-year Treasury note, for instance, iscurrently yielding close to 8.6% and requires a minimuminvestment of just $1,000. &quot;I'd want to be high quality atthis point,&quot; says Lewis J. Altfest, a New York investmentmanager. &quot;Close to 9% a year compares pretty favorably toequities.&quot;                                                                                                          SHORT-TERM BOND FUNDS: Bond funds offer investors a way toparticipate in the somewhat higher yields available in thebond market without sacrificing the diversification andliquidity of a mutual fund. But bond-fund prices dofluctuate, so investors should think in terms of &quot;totalreturn,&quot; which includes price changes as well as interestpayments.   Money-fund investors may prefer short-term bond funds,which invest in securities with maturities of one to fiveyears. Their prices are less volatile than longer-term bonds.The 9.04% average yield on investment-grade short-term bondfunds at the end of March was more than a full percentagepoint higher than on money funds. The total return over thepreceding 12 months was 9.32%.   Intermediate-term funds, with maturities of five to 10years, looked even better over the past year. According toLipper Analytical Services, the total return for the 12months through March 31 was 9.65%. The average yield at theend of March was 8.62%.   &quot;Most of the time, I'd rather take my risk where I'mgetting paid for it, either in equities or long-term bonds,&quot;says Michael A. Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. &quot;Forthe last year or so, you've been better off in short orintermediate term.&quot;   For investors in high tax brackets who want to stay inmoney funds, tax-exempt funds may be the way to go right now.The average yield on tax-exempt money funds is currently5.74%, which translates into a taxable-equivalent yield of8.57% for an investor paying taxes at a 33% rate.   There are state tax-exempt funds, too, that areparticularly attractive to investors in high-tax states likeCalifornia, Massachusetts and New York. For New Yorkinvestors paying 36% of their income in taxes, for instance,a 5.5% yield on a tax-free fund would be equal to a taxableyield of 8.59%.   Yields on tax-free funds aren't always higher than taxablefunds, however. They tend to fluctuate more because they areinfluenced by the supply of tax-exempt securities.   There is the view among some financial professionals that,tax-free or taxable, money funds aren't a bad place to bewhen the interest rate outlook is uncertain. &quot;Money funds area decision not to bet,&quot; says Lynn Hopewell, a financialplanner in Falls Church, Va. &quot;If you're talking megabucks,that's one thing. If you've got a few hundred thousand, Idon't think a sliver of a point makes that much difference.&quot;   ---                     What Money Earns                                                                                                                           Some current yields                                                                                                                  Money-market mutual funds     7.96%           One-year bank CDs             8.08%           One-year Treasury bills       8.19%           30-year Treasury bonds        8.58%                                                                                                          *As of March 31, 1990                                                                                                          Source: Donoghue Organization, Lipper Analytical Services,Banxquote Money Markets.</TEXT></DOC>
