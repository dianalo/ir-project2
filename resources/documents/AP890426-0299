The terminal near this east Scottish oil port city handles gasfrom 16 production platforms in the British sector of the North Seaoil and gas field.   It was shut down after routine inspection revealed defects inequipment that ``could be of a serious nature,'' Shell said.   Shell initially reported that the shutdown involved the whole ofthe terminal, which a spokesman for the Scottish sector of BritishGas PLC said handled about a third of Britain's North Sea gassupplies. British Gas is the monopoly company responsible for gassupplies to homes and industry throughout Britain.   But a Shell spokesman subsequently said that only part of theterminal had been shut and that this part accounted for about 7percent of Britain's North Sea gas supplies.   The shutdown is the second North Sea setback in eight days. TheNorth Sea's Brent oil field has been shut since April 18 when a gasleak and explosion on Shell's Cormorant Alpha platform haltedproduction of 472,000 barrels of oil a day, or nearly a quarter ofthe British sector's oil production.</TEXT></DOC>
