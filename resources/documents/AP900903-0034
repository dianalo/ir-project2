Reagan barely mentioned the Middle East crisis in a weekendspeech, but did say Arab nations' banding together against SaddamHussein is ``reason for very great optimism.''   He called the Iraqi leader the ``reincarnation of Hitler.''   President Bush ``is doing very well in what is needed,'' he saidin a speech at a copy service company's convention.   Despite the Mideast crisis, Reagan, 79, said he is ``moreoptimistic than I've ever been'' about the prospect for freedom andpeace in the world.   Reagan spoke Sunday to more than 2,000 people at the Kwik-KopyInternational Conference.   He also talked about the importance of the free flow ofinformation in a free society, even though he had requested thatthe press in general be prohibited from attending his speech, saidJan Norris, a spokesman for Kwik-Kopy.   Reagan, whose speaking fee was not disclosed, said SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev understands that his government ``mustallow the flow of information'' to prosper.</TEXT></DOC>
