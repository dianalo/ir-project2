The unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group completed its side of the case in the California state court suit -- the first Superfund-related suit to go to trial pitting a polluter against its insurers.    With more than 100 multimillion-dollar pollution suits pending against insurance carriers nationwide, Shell's case is being closely watched. The U.S. Office of Technology Assessment estimates that during the next 50 years the cost of cleaning the nation's hazardous-waste sites could reach $500 billion.    The federal government has predicted that one of the Shell sites, near Denver, will require the most expensive hazardous-waste cleanup in the country, an effort that won't be completed before the year 2000.    &quot;What's at stake is the question of who finances the nation's cleanup enterprise,&quot; says Robert Sayler, a lawyer at the Washington, D.C., firm of Covington andamp; Burling, who represents corporate policy holders in similar suits. &quot;Corporations bought insurance against the fear of the unknown. This is the ultimate feared unknown.&quot;    The Houston-based oil giant contends that the comprehensive general-liability insurance it purchased covers pollution-related damage at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, near Denver, and the McColl site in Fullerton, Calif. Shell manufactured pesticides at Rocky Mountain, the site where the U.S. Army made chemical weapons. Shell buried wastes at the McColl site from a gasoline refinery it operated nearby.    Insurance carriers contend that the company's policies don't cover the cleanup because Shell knew it was polluting the sites and failed to stop. The current trial involves only the Rocky Mountain site. The McColl case will be tried later.    The federal government suit that prompted Shell to seek coverage from its insurance carriers was filed in 1983 under the Superfund law, which requires those who generated, stored, or transported hazardous waste to pay to clean it.    The U.S. suit, which covered the Denver site, was settled in January. Under the terms of the settlement, Shell and the Army -- which owned the land -- agreed to split the cleanup costs according to a formula. As part of the settlement, the Environmental Protection Agency, working with Shell and the Army, will determine how and when to clean the site.    Shell's latest trial, which began last summer, is expected to take many more months to complete.    Lawyers for the insurance companies have tried to show that as early as 1952 -- the first year for which Shell seeks insurance coverage -- the company was aware its waste had seeped into the groundwater. In order to show Shell knew it was polluting the environment, defense lawyers introduced Shell records indicating that the company doubled its production of two pesticides at the plant after the EPA informed it that the pesticides were carcinogenic and would later be banned.    Shell said it had no knowledge that the waste-disposal facility was leaking. Shell officials also testified that under the terms of the lease with the Army, they were required to use the Army's waste-disposal facilities and bore no responsibility for upkeep or maintenance.    If corporations are able to prove that such cleanup costs must be paid by insurance carriers, insurance rates might climb, says James Killelea, general counsel of Home Insurance Co., one of the defendants in the Shell suit. In turn, shareholders in corporations found liable for cleanup costs could also face a heavy burden, particularly if the company is small or has gone into bankruptcy. </TEXT></DOC>
