Witnesses said casualties were heavy.   ``Many students are being mowed down. Can't anything be done?''a reporter telephoning from the scene said before breaking down intears.   The troops were deployed after a military coup staged Sunday byhardline armed forces commander Gen. Saw Maung. Not long after thecoup's announcement, angry demonstrators began moving into the cityfrom outlying areas.   Battles between the two sides were reported Monday around themain government administrative building, the U.S. Embassy, SulePagoda, at a junction leading into the city and other areas.   Residents of buildings near the U.S. Embassy said demonstratorswere being cut down by military fire while others saw two monksfalling to the ground after being hit by bullets around the SulePagoda.   Total casualties could not be estimated. The shooting wasreported continuing with local residents dragging the woundedinside their houses.   A Western diplomat contacted by telephone from Tokyo saidsoldiers were firing from rooftops at demonstrators in front of theU.S. Embassy, but the embassy building itself had not been hit. Onedead person and three wounded could be seen in front of thebuilding, located on a major commercial street.   ``There's a lot of shooting. There's been deaths and injured.It's a bad situation here,'' the diplomat said, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   Although most demonstrators faced troops without weapons, somecarried swords, spears, crossbows and other primitive weapons.There were reports that firebombs were being hurled by protestersin some areas, and demonstrators were seen taking weapons fromfallen soldiers.   In once instance, troops guarding a road junction opened fire ona crowd of demonstrators trying to march into the city from theworking class suburb of North Okkalapa.   According to incomplete reports, the fighting erupted Sundaynight not long after Saw Maung seized power, and more than 40demonstrators and 17 soldiers were reported killed Sunday night inone area of the city.   Sporadic shooting and several large blasts were heard in thecapital after the new authorities imposed an 8 p.m. curfew andbanned public gatherings.   Thousands of people immediately surged into the streets afterthe state-run radio announced the coup. They called for weapons andbegan erecting barricades from trees and waterpipes againstmilitary vehicles.   Saw Maung, 59, said over state-run Radio Rangoon on Sunday thathe overthrew civilian president Maung Maung to halt economic andsocial chaos and to hold democratic elections after 26 years ofauthoritarian rule by the Burma Socialist Program Party, the solelegal party. He immediately abolished key government institutions.   The fate of Maung Maung was not known.   The sudden announcement came amid speculation the government andkey opposition leaders were paving the way to an interim governmentand a return to full democracy.   ``I believe the people will rise up again and this time they aregoing to be angrier. It's going to be tragic,'' Burma expert JosefSilverstein of Rutgers University said by telephone.   Troops moved in Sunday night and sealed the offices of all sixgovernment newspapers, making it unlikely they would be permittedto reopen Monday. Although nominally under government control, thenewspapers have in recent weeks been publishing news about the massanti-government movement in the country.   Protests since July have forced the resignation of two Burmeseleaders and more recent strikes, demonstrations, looting andlawlessness have pushed the nation to the verge of anarchy.   Saw Maung, who identified himself as chairman of the PeaceRestoration Committee, has been defense minister since July. He iswidely regarded as a hard-line officer and a right-hand man of thetoppled President Sein Lwin.   Sein Lwin, whom demonstrators called the ``most hated man inBurma,'' resigned Aug. 12 after a week of bloody clashes betweentroops and unarmed protesters left 112 dead by the government'scount.   A later broadcast named the other 18 military officers in thecommittee, including the army, navy and air force commanders, eightof Burma's nine regional army commanders, and the unpopularmilitary intelligence chief, Col. Khin Nyunt.   The broadcast said all government and state bodies weredissolved, including local administrations. Striking governmentworkers were told to return to work by Sept. 26 or face dismissal.   The initial broadcast, preceded by martial music, said themilitary took over state authority ``to curb further deteriorationof the general situation in the country.''   It said the military would ``restore law and order, peace andtranquillity in the country ... and ease the daily livelihood ofthe people.''   ``After accomplishing the above objectives, (the authoritieswill) hold general elections under a multiparty system. ...Political parties which accept and practice true democracy canprepare for the general elections from now on.''   It said the election supervision commission formed by MaungMaung's government would be retained.   Maung Maung, a Western-educated lawyer, on Aug. 19 became thenation's first civilian leader since the 1962 military coup thatinstalled the Burma Socialist Program Party.   Maung Maung bowed to protests and offered general electionsunder a multiparty system, but demonstrators say they do not trustthe party and demanded formation of an interim government toconduct the polling. The government gave no indication it wouldagree.   Burma's last multiparty elections, in February 1960, sweptformer Prime Minister Nu to power over an army-backed party. NeWin, the armed forces commander then, led the 1962 coup thattoppled Nu's government.   After years of little resistance to authoritarian rule, studentsrioted in September 1987 to protest the government's decision tovoid much of the currency in circulation without compensation.   Security forces killed scores of demonstrators in quellingbroader student-led protests in March and June. Ne Win resignedJuly 23, taking indirect responsibility for the rioting.   Protesters blame the ruling party's rigid socialism for turningresource-rich Burma into one of the poorest countries in Asia.</TEXT></DOC>
