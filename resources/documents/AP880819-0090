ROWE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   An investigation into the deaths of five elderly Bostonresidents during the heat wave found no problems with theirbuilding's ventilation system, while in Illinois the summer'storrid stranglehold claimed its 40th victim.   Twenty-three cities in nine states set or tied temperaturerecords for the date Thursday, the National Weather Servicereported. But forecasters promised that a cooling trend was on theway in several areas as residents cast about, sometimesdesperately, for ways to beat the heat.   H.M. Hines, who owns Home Ice and Coal Co. in Raleigh, N.C.,said the 105-degree weather there was bad enough that some peoplehad asked him to dump blocks of ice into their swimming pools.   ``But it's not a good idea,'' Hines said. ``Somebody jumps inand hits that 300-pound block of ice, it's dangerous.''   The deaths in Massachusetts occurred between Aug. 4 and Monday,a period when temperatures soared into the 90s. State MedicalExaminer Bryan Blackbourne said the clustering of the deaths in thesame place and during a short time led him to conclude heat was acontributing factor. Four of the victims lived on the top floor ofthe eight-story building.   ``It was 90 degrees to 95 degrees outside and I would say easily100 degrees inside,'' said Frank Frenna, 72, who also lived on thetop floor of the building but kept cool with a window airconditioner.   On Thursday, a Boston Housing Authority investigation found the12 exhaust fans on the flat-topped roof were operating properly andlittle variation in hallway temperatures from floor to floor, saidhousing authority spokesman Bill Wright.   Illinois authorities said an 85-year-old Danville man died ofheat stroke and reported his body temperature was 105 degrees whenhe was found in his home. They said he had no air conditioner andhis doors and windows closed.   In Chicago, Cook County officials said the county's death tollfrom the summer heat stood at 40. Most of the victims were elderly.   In Peoria, meanwhile, a day-care center was closed after statepublic health officials found 95-degree temperatures indoors.   The prolonged heat and humidity also threatened wildlife,especially birds on Illinois' endangered species list.   William E. Southern, a professor of biological sciences atNorthern Illinois University, said dozens of marshes and wetlandsin the state have dried up, leaving waterfowl nowhere to nest,breed or feed.   Elsewhere, the record-breaking temperatures kept airconditioners at full cry and activity at a minimum.   The 105-degree reading at Raleigh-Durham International Airporttied the previous all-time record high set on July 23, 1952.   At normally cool Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina, themercury hit 81 degrees, breaking the old record of 76 set 20 yearsago.   Catherine Morton, news director for the mountain, said the heatwas affecting more than just people.   ``A neighbor was out hiking and decided to take a dip in one ofthe local streams,'' she said. ``When she looked up, there was awild bear in the pond up above her. Everybody's looking to cooloff.''   About half of Kentucky's 178 school districts had planned toopen by week's end, but one school district's superintendent, LarryRyle, said if temperatures remain as high, ``I'll declare a heatemergency and close them down.''   In New York City, the collapse earlier this week of a carriagehorse working in 90-degree-plus weather created a public furor andprompted Mayor Edward I. Koch to announce some changes.   Koch said Thursday the city will provide more watering holes inCentral Park, move a horse ambulance there and provide shade in hotweather. He also called for review of a regulation that requireshorses to return to the stable when the temperature hits 90 degrees.   The changes, he said, ``make good old-fashioned horse sense.''   Meanwhile, a cold front moved across central and eastern partsof the nation today, lowering temperatures and scattering rain andthunderstorms.   Highs were expected to be in the 70s from the Great Lakes intoNew England and along the Pacific Coast and in the 80s or 90sacross much of the rest of the nation.</TEXT></DOC>
