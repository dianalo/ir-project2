The Securities and Exchange Commission also accused James H.O'Hagan of engaging in insider trading to repay $1 million heallegedly diverted from clients' accounts.   O'Hagan's attorney in Minneapolis, Jan Stuurmans, was in ameeting and not immediately available for comment.   The SEC complaint, filed at federal court in Minneapolis,accused O'Hagan, 53, formerly a partner in the firm of Dorsey andamp;Whitney, of trading Pillsbury securities with misapropriatedconfidential information in 1988 about Grand Met's pending hostiletender offer.   In July 1988, Dorsey andamp; Whitney was engaged as local counsel forGrand Met, a British food and beverage producer, in the Pillsburymatter. Grand Met eventually acquired Pillsbury in January 1989.   O'Hagan left Dorsey andamp; Whitney in late February 1989, said RobertStruyk, chairman of the Minneapolis-based law firm.   He said O'Hagan, who specialized in securities, commodities andmedical malpractice litigation, ``had been with the firm since 1963or 1964.''   Struyck declined to comment further, noting that the matter wasnow in litigation.   But he emphasized that Dorsey andamp; Whitney ``is not involved inthis case in any way and we have been cooperating fully.''   The complaint alleged that O'Hagan learned of the pending GrandMet offer in July 1988 after speaking with another Dorsey andamp; Whitneypartner.   According to the complaint, between late July and Sept. 21,1988, O'Hagan bought Pillsbury stock and call options. On Oct. 4,1988, Grand Met announced its cash tender offer for Pillsbury at$60 per share, driving up the stock's price by $20.   Between Oct. 5 and Oct. 17, O'Hagan sold his Pillsbury stock andoptions, allegedly netting $4.35 million in profits.   The SEC complaint alleged that O'Hagan, needed the tradingprofits to repay ``approximately $1 million he had secretlydiverted from a Dandamp;W client, Northrup King Co.''
