But with broadmarket measures managing to stay within striking distance oftheir highs, some analysts think the individual investors'eagerness now has positive implications.   Strategists and money managers usually feel more confidentwhen big investors -- pension funds and other institutions --are doing the buying; these investors have deep pockets andcan weather occasional setbacks. They fear that smallinvestors too easily get cold feet about holding securitieswith no guaranteed returns; if they suddenly sell in a panicthey can send the whole market tumbling.</LP><TEXT>   But after this year's bull run, many institutionalinvestors have spent all they can, or want to. Smallinvestors are the ones with enough cash still out of thestock market to fuel a further jump in prices.   And while the data about individual investors are thin,they suggest they are buying: Federal Reserve figures showthat households, personal trusts and nonprofit organizationsraised the stock portion of their financial assets to about18% through June from about 16% six months earlier.   Meanwhile, sales of shares in stock mutual funds --through which most small investors are getting into the stockmarket these days -- have been strong this year. Even whenthe Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 120 points on Nov.15, equity mutual funds reported a surge in buying activity.Ma and Pa Investor were going after suddenly cheaper stocks.   The question is, if the market stumbles in the next fewmonths, will individuals stay the course or bolt for safety?   Edward Kerschner, chief strategist for PaineWebber, arguesthat the shift of households' funds to stocks will besustained and strong. Most important, he says, the baby boomgeneration needs securities with higher returns thancertificates of deposit and money-market accounts to pay fortheir retirement and their children's education.   As interest rates continue falling and stay low, stockscould become as attractive to individual investors as theywere during the 1950s and the 1960s. Then, stocks accountedfor close to 30% of U.S. households' financial assets.   Michael Tierney, manager of trust investments at FirstWachovia Corp. in Winston-Salem, N.C., agrees. Moreover, headds, shares of companies that will benefit from globaleconomic growth are more suitable for conservative smallinvestors than they were in the past. He foresees reducedinternational political tensions, declining interest ratesaround the world, and closer alignment of major worldcurrencies, which means less foreign-exchange risk. Theopportunities for small investors to buy growth stocks undersuch favorable conditions will be as irresistible as duringthe post-World War II economic boom in the U.S., he says.   Mr. Kerschner thinks individuals' move into stocks shouldbe broad-based enough to lift prices in many industry groups.Investors are already stepping into shares of utilitycompanies for two reasons: Their earnings are considered tobe relatively safe even under currently weak economicconditions, and their profits will benefit from lowerinterest rates because capitalhungry utilities borrow a lot.   But as individuals get acclimated to the stock market, Mr.Kerschner expects them to move into more speculative growthstocks -- issues offering lots of growth potential but low orno dividends.   In fact, rather than bracing for an unpredictable stockmarket at the hands of small investors, Wall Street &quot;mightexpect a dampening of volatility as individuals buy stocks,&quot;Mr. Kerschner says. &quot;The individual doesn't sit by hisstock-quote machine all day, isn't marked for his performanceat the end of every quarter and has a higher cost of exiting&quot;the stock market than do institutional investors, who canbail out at rock-bottom commissions on trades of big blocks.   Still, other strategists and money managers warn thatdroves of small investors can make the market more volatile.Though they may be accumulating stocks, individuals are &quot;morefearful of risk,&quot; as long as the economy is uncertain, saysTim Love, senior portfolio manager at Marinvest, a unit ofthe Honk Kong andamp; Shanghai Bank. &quot;The big problem is thatpeople are still afraid of unemployment and a reduction oftheir disposable income.&quot;   Besides, says Carmine Grigoli, chief strategist at FirstBoston, it is &quot;irresponsible&quot; to put undue emphasis on &quot;moneymigration&quot; as an argument for bullishness. He thinks manyindividual investors will become disappointed, perhapsdisillusioned, with their foray into stocks over the nextseveral months.   For one thing, Mr. Grigoli says, corporations are sellingmore stock to raise capital, rather than issuing bonds orborrowing from banks. As much as $22 billion in stock hasbeen added to the U.S. market since March, according to theFed, the first net addition of stock in seven years, and anocean of stock issues is slated to hit the market in comingmonths. Mr. Grigoli doubts there's enough buying power in thehands of conservative small investors to soak up all thoseshares.   Also, &quot;I see nothing in sight to suggest that profits willrise in the first half of the year,&quot; Mr. Grigoli says. Stockprices already are expensive, given the depressed state ofcorporate profits, he says.   Ultimately, though, an increased demand for stocks bysmall investors can be a positive force if it outpaces stocksupply, says Charles DuBois, managing director of ChancellorCapital Management in New York. But the timing is souncertain that he won't bet money on it.   &quot;There's something like six to 12 months after supplyslows down before the market gets over its indigestion,&quot; hesays. &quot;Historically it's not a consistent indicator.&quot;   And while &quot;there could be a long-term migration intostocks&quot; by small investors says Barton Biggs, chiefstrategist for Morgan Stanley, &quot;that doesn't mean the stockmarket will go up every day.&quot; The market and the people in itare more likely to be moved by factors that wax and wane overshorter periods, he says.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          The stock market extended its rally, pushing the Dow JonesIndustrial Average back above 2900.
