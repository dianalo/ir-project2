(OS/2 version of Lotus 1-2-3spreadsheet) (editorial)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Marion, Larry.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Why You Should Care About 1-2-3/GandM;Unlike most personal-computer publications, LOTUS magazine takes a pragmaticview of the torrent of new hardware and software released almost hourly.andO;Instead of gushing superlatives about new technology for technology's sake,we view the new releases from a real-world perspective.andM;This month's cover story reflects the approach readers have come to expectfrom LOTUS.andP;  In &quot;Inside 1-2-3/G,&quot; Contributing Editor Daniel Gasteigerdescribes his experience in making the transition from 1-2-3's familiarMS-DOS, character-based interface to 1-2-3/G's Macintosh-like, mouse-and-iconwork style.andM;As a pioneer in the use of 1-2-3, and one of the founding editors of LOTUS,he is superbly equipped to be your guide to the new environment.andP;  Gasteigerhas been programming computers since 1973 and has been using 1-2-3 sinceearly 1984.andP;  He joined Lotus Development Corp. soon after graduating fromCornell University and later joined Lotus Publishing.andP;  During his four yearsat the magazine, he created the magazine's Macros columns and thetechnical-editing department, which ensures the accuracy of the technicalmaterial published in these pages.andM;Daniel has a much more down-to-earth view of 1-2-3/G than the reviewers youmay have read elsewhere.andP;  The conventional wisdom after the introduction of1-2-3/G was that it would drive millions of users to buy OS/2, much as 1-2-3fueled the demand for the IBM PC.andP;  &quot;If 1-2-3/G doesn't make OS/2 abest-seller, nothing will&quot; was one common refrain.andP;  Here is Daniel'sperception: &quot;The only reason to go to OS/2 and 1-2-3/G is for multitaskingand superior networking capabilities.&quot;andM;However, Daniel's essay is relevant to spreadsheet users whether or not theyplan to upgrade to OS/2 and 1-2-3/G.andP;  His chronicle of the changes inthinking, action, and output resulting from the new technology gives apreview ofthe failure.andP;  While he is not a mouse fan, Daniel finds that thegraphical user interface offers important advantages even to keyboardaddicts.andP;  &quot;I started using the mouse reluctantly--having my fingers leave thekeyboard is disorienting to me,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;But if you dare to use the mouseonce or twice, you'll get around faster.andP;  It proves to be so much moreefficient, not so much because of the mouse itself but because of the userinterface.&quot;andP;  Daniel and Associate Editor Phyllis Sharon, who edited thearticle, add that the combination of pull-down menus, dialog boxes, and othercomponents of the graphical interface represent a tremendous boon or peoplewho use 1-2-3.andM;So turn to page 28 for a glimpse of the type of interface that will mostlikely be in your future.andP;  If you doubt it, maybe the article will changeyour mind.andM;Larry Marion Editor-in-Chief</TEXT></DOC>
