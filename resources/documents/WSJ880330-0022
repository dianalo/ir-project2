The dollar purchases by the two central banks, combined with buying by commercial bank dealers covering short, or oversold, dollar positions, boosted the U.S. currency. The dollar was quoted at 125.25 Japanese yen in late New York trading, up 1.2% from 123.75 late Monday. The dollar also climbed 0.8% to 1.6690 West German marks from 1.6553.    In trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar opened at 125.75 yen.    Dealers speculated that the intervention and short-covering might be enough to stabilize the dollar as trading slackens ahead of the Easter weekend. But the downward pressure on the dollar is far from dissipated, they said.    &quot;We still have the (U.S.) trade deficit, and we're not getting out of the hole that easily,&quot; Jose Gonzalez, foreign exchange manager at National Bank of Detroit, said. Mr. Gonzalez said the dollar's recovery yesterday was &quot;a bit of a consolidation&quot; because &quot;the market doesn't want to go too far too fast.&quot;    Yesterday's trading still left the U.S. currency below the levels it has generally traded at since the first week of January.    The dollar fell as low as 123.60 yen in Sydney trading yesterday. But it recovered later in Tokyo dealings as the Bank of Japan purchased dollars against the yen and commercial interests also bought the U.S. currency.    Traders were spurred to cover oversold dollar positions by remarks from Japan's finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, who raised the possibility of larger-scale intervention. Mr. Miyazawa told a news conference in Tokyo that the recent bout of new exchange-rate volatility called for coordinated action under agreements by the Group of Seven nations. Intervention by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy -- prodded the rally that lifted the dollar from its 40-year lows in early January.    In New York, the Fed picked up where the Bank of Japan left off, buying dollars and selling yen.    &quot;It was very effective,&quot; Shigeru Tokunaga, vice president and foreign exchange manager for Fuji Bank Ltd. in New York, said of the Fed's dollar-buying. &quot;Market sentiment had been nervous and sensitive about intervention,&quot; he said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 40 cents an ounce to $455.40 in brisk trading. Estimated volume was 5.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $455.00 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Tuesday, March 29, 1988    Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
