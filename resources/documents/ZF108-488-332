 The list of words are all related in some way with oneanother.andP;  Given the word &quot;Match,&quot; what comes to your mind?andP;  Perhaps youconjure up some idea related to comparing objects, such as the words in thisgame.andP;  How about if we add the next words &quot;Fire&quot; and &quot;Candle&quot;?andP;  Does thiscreate a dramatic shift in your ideas, such that &quot;Match&quot; now activates anidea related to &quot;a small stick that ignites easily by friction&quot;?andP;  Thisarticle will examine a research topic which seeks to develop knowledge-basedsystems that support the building and query of such idea networks.andM;To change the focus of this discussion to a topic more relevant than matchesand fire, consider how the general manager of one division within a largecorporation develops and executes a strategic plan.andP;  He may build a list ofideas concerning the competitors in this market, new products that are beingplanned for introduction, pricing and distribution channels for theseproducts, a new computer-integrated manufacturing process which he hopes willreduce product costs such that the new products will be profitable, and soon.andP;  This manager's decision-making process may be compared with our wordassociation game, where his strategic planning process is an idea associationgame.andP;  When confronted by a quality problem associated with the newmanufacturing process, the manager might activate ideas about higher costsand competitive pressure in the marketplace.andP;  In a broader scope, if amanager begins work on a new product which potentially shares a new designtechnology with other product divisions in his company, he will contact thosemanagers that come to mind (i.e., idea association) who might benefit fromcollaboration on this design.andM;As new information arrives on this manager's desk, he may extend or revisehis mental model of the business strategy.andP;  A piece of unfavorable data maytrigger an alternative strategy which he now communicates to a subordinatefor subsequent implementation.andP;  Thus, the manager's mental model is bothdynamic and unique to his view of the world.andP;  His model reflects hismanagerial history in the way he formed an abstract hierarchy of generalconcepts, and it reflects the order in which both the new information ispresented to him and resulting business commitments are made when reacting tothis new information.andM;Consider once again our word association game.andP;  If you had been reading aboutproper storage for flammable liquids within your business when the word&quot;Match&quot; is presented to you, your reaction is likely to be very differentfrom that at the beginning of this article.andP;  Your memory recall is affectedby the context of your current thoughts.andP;  Similarly, a manager may fail torecall a critical part of his business plan when confronted with a new pieceof information, simply because the current context of his work provokes anidea which represents an alternative meaning for the ambiguous term.andM;Our research seeks to design a system which would assist a manager byrepresenting the important elements in his or her mental model for astrategic plan.andP;  First, this system must be flexible since each managerconstructs a mental model which is unique to his own experiences and biases.andO;Second, long-term plans are usually defined by a broad set of concepts whichare only loosely related.andP;  The manager may apply a set of heuristics to theseconcepts which help him to identify problems and opportunities within hisbusiness.andP;  Finally, the manager does not work alone.andP;  He forms a network ofpeers, subordinates, superiors, customers, competitors, and others with whichhe exchanges strategies and opinions.andP;  Each of these individuals maintainshis/her own mental model reflecting his/her personal responsibilities andknowledge, yet all of these people must be able to communicate successfullyabout a specific problem and to modify their individual mental modelsappropriately.andM;In this article, we review some of the research which studies mental models,approaches to planning and control by general managers, and communicationwithin a network of individuals.andP;  Several alternative information systemstructures which might be used to represent mental models are discussed,followed by a presentation of our system for Strategic Plan and ResourceINTegration (SPRINT).andP;  Finally, several future research topics are outlinedwhich will extend our work.andM;FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTSandM;To facilitate this examination of supporting mental models with aninformation system, we utilize a case study from a strategic planningtextbook [30].andP;  In this case study, Jane Sherrill has just been appointed aspresident of a newly acquired subsidiary, Sci-Tech Associates.andP;  Jane has beenemployed as a marketing manager with the parent firm, Cyril Electronics, forseveral years.andP;  Now, as a new president, Jane must develop an understandingof Sci-Tech's organization, its products, its market, and its strengths andweaknesses as a business in order to draft a comprehensive strategic planwithin the next nine months.andM;Three aspects of this case are relevant to our purpose.andP;  First, we willsurvey some of the research in defining the role of mental models in decisionmaking.andP;  Secondly, we review approaches to planning and control that amanager may utilize to create and execute his strategic plan.andP;  Third, theimportance of communication is emphasized within this integrated planningeffort.andM;Mental ModelsandM;General managers appear to derive the most strategically important benefitsfrom &quot;soft&quot; information.andP;  This type of information would include inside tipsabout a competitor's product plans, political and economic news whichtriggers a response tactic in the manager's strategic plan, and so on.andO;Studies have been conducted [27] which indicate that this is due to thetimeliness of the information.andP;  However, we would also add that this softinformation, particularly that associated with triggers for action, iscausally related by symbolic information and semantic links.andP;  Thus,traditional data processing systems have difficulty in representing this formof managerial knowledge.andM;A manager has two primary uses for aggregated, &quot;hard&quot; information: buildingmental models of the things around him and identifying problems andopportunities [27].andP;  These mental models would include competitive forces inhis firm's market, functional responsibilities within his organization, anddata triggers which invoke preplanned strategic responses.andP;  How decisionexecution triggers are used to put structure onto a stream of unstructureddecisions in high velocity environments in the microcomputer industry isdiscussed in [4].andP;  How a manager might use information to identify theproblems to be solved is described in [32].andP;  Also contained in [32] is adefinition of the word &quot;problem&quot; as an association relating the differencebetween some existing situation and some desired situation.andP;  An &quot;operator,&quot;on the other hand, is defined as a managerial activity which transforms a setof input variables into a set of output variables according to somepredetermined plan.andP;  Thus, since operator selection is triggered by thedifference to be reduced, the process of problem finding is the process ofdefining differences.andP;  Problem solving is the complementary process ofselecting operators which will reduce differences.andP;  The manager definesdifferences by comparing his perceived reality with the output of a modelwhich predicts the same variables.andP;  Therefore, the problem of understandingproblem finding is eventually reduced to understanding the models whichmanagers use to define differences.andM;Executive Information Systems (EIS) are directed at supporting theinformation requirements of senior-level managers [35].andP;  These systemssupport the communication requirements of executives through electronic mailand assist executives in problem-finding activities by scanning environmentalinformation, summarized appropriately for the executive's high-level mentalmodel of the business.andP;  Although EIS provide a manager with some of theinformation required to build his mental model, they do not provide him withthe capability to construct a computer-based representation of his mentalmodel.andP;  The primary purpose of this article is to describe an appropriaterepresentation for this knowledge.andM;Our proposal for a mental model representation must consider the types ofmanagerial tasks for which this knowledge-based system is appropriate.andP;  Inparticular, we must not make excessive claims for our ability to representthe intuitive nature of human thought.andP;  This point is summarized veryeffectively in [11, p. 62]: &quot;In creating a representation we are carving outfrom the reality that we experience a collection of formalized structures.andO;We thereby create a blindness to everything that is not expressible withinthose structures....andP;  What we are able to do with expert systems, with thekind of technology we have, depends on creating a very narrow focus andstructure.&quot;andP;  Even an incompetent manager could easily outperform the mostsophisticated knowledge-based system by making use of common-sense knowledgefor unusual situations.andP;  However, with realistic expectations and a carefullydefined problem domain, we believe that a useful representation can bedeveloped for mental models.andM;A similar, although more theoretical, perspective is described in [21].andO;Thinking is defined as, &quot;the manipulation of internal representations of theworld.&quot;andP;  If a person carries a small-scale model within his head of externalreality and of his own possible actions, he is able to try out variousalternatives, conclude which is the best of them, react to future situationsbefore they arise, utilize the knowledge of past events in dealing with thepresent and future, and in every way react in a much fuller, safer, and morecompetent manner to the emergencies which face him.andP;  These small-scale modelsneed not be either wholly accurate or correspond completely with what theymodel in order to be useful.andP;  For example, someone may hold a mental model ofa computer which simply understands a black box with a terminal for input anda printer for output.andP;  For a task such as word processing, thisrepresentation may be completely adequate.andP;  However, for a system programmerdeveloping a new C compiler, a much richer model would be required.andM;There are no complete mental models for any empirical phenomena, such ashuman behavior.andP;  It is emphasized in [21] that completeness does notnecessarily enhance the usefulness of a particular model -- a manager doesnot need to understand the minute details of human cognition in order tobenefit from a mental model describing his competitor's response tointroduction of a new product in the marketplace.andM;Planning and ControlandM;Executives' activities are focused on two key processes: agenda setting andnetwork building.andP;  Whereas formal plans tend to be explicit, rigorous, andlogical, especially with respect to integration of financial goals, a generalmanager's agendas often contain loosely connected goals and strategies thataddress long-, medium-, and short-term responsibilities [24].andP;  We address theagenda-setting process in this section and the executives' communicationnetwork in the following section.andM;The agendas evolve from an incomplete set of objectives (an implicit modelguiding the manager) to a specific set of strategies and measurements whichcan be documented and audited (an explicit model).andP;  The explicit models canbe supported by management information systems and executive support systems,but the implicit models do not lend themselves to such structuredrepresentations using conventional data structures.andP;  As will be describedlater in this article, alternative knowledge representations have beendeveloped in artificial intelligence research which will partially supportthese implicit mental models.andM;Many discussions of strategic planning do not extend beyond identifyingissues, stakeholders, and objectives [28, 31].andP;  These discussions usuallyfocus on the perspectives of the Chief Executive Officer and senior staff.andO;Our emphasis, however, is directed at the plans of first- and second-levelline managers.andP;  Writing a plan and identifying the stakeholders, i.e.,andO;interested parties, is not enough -- measurements and controls must be putinto place to assure achievement of the plan [30, chap.andP;  21-23].andP;  We believethat a strategic plan should also include planning for control [17, 34, 36].andO;These control elements of a plan would also evolve from a loosely knit set ofobjectives and measurements to a plan which specifies metrics and reviewdates for each strategy.andP;  During this evolution of the plan, changes mayoccur frequently and may dramatically alter the relationships betweenobjectives, control metrics, and stakeholders.andP;  Thus, a representation mustprovide a flexible structure in a system modeling the elements of this plan.andM;A common control cycle described in Total Quality Control (TQC) literature isthe &quot;Deming Circle&quot; or &quot;Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) method&quot; [12, 29].andP;  The lasttwo steps are absent from many discussions of strategic planning methodology.andO;The Check step represents the comparison of the results of the process to theexpected goals.andP;  Any deviation is then analyzed in the Act step, where causesare assigned and corrective actions are identified.andP;  Moving from here to theplanning phase completes the cycle of planning for action, implementingplans, checking results, and analyzing and identifying actions needed.andM;A similar idea is captured in an oft-quoted phrase in [1, p. ix]: &quot;A gooddeal of the corporate planning I have observed is like a ritual rain dance;it has no effect on the weather that follows, but those who engage in itthink it does.&quot;andP;  The metrics of a plan must be monitored and therelationships between coordinated activities compared to assure that the planis progressing as desired.andM;An additional requirement for strategic planning is to integrate the plans ofseveral individual managers and organizations.andP;  An approach called ManagementBy Objectives (MBOs) is used within many American corporations [7, 14].andP;  Thismethod is implemented with many variants, but it frequently fails to fullyintegrate objectives both vertically and horizontally within a decentralizedorganization.andP;  Vertical integration would tie a division general manager'sobjectives to those of his functional managers and in turn to the objectivesof all line managers.andP;  Plans are integrated horizontally when the objectivesof all levels in one division are coherent and mutually supportive with theobjectives of relevant counterparts in the same division and in otherdivisions of the corporation.andP;  Knowing which other plans are relevantpresents a challenging problem.andP;  Horizontal integration is usually practicedin an ad hoc fashion and is therefore generally inadequate.andM;Little attention has been paid to developing knowledge-based informationsystems which can assist managers to define and integrate their plans.andP;  Ourresearch takes a step in this direction and outlines long-term researchobjectives for distributed knowledge-based systems for strategic planning andcontrol.andM;CommunicationandM;A manager builds a network of cooperative relationships with thoseindividuals who play a role in supplying information for developing andimplementing his emerging agenda [24].andP;  We do not focus attention in thisarticle on the channels used for this communication -- face-to-face,telephone, written, etc.andP;  -- but, we consider the types of information thatare exchanged and how this information is used within the mental models ofeach participant.andM;Stated more abstractly, when one person successfully explains something toanother, what is conveyed is a &quot;blueprint&quot; for the construction of a mentalmodel [21].andP;  The content of this message must take into account the assumedpreexisting mental models of the recipient, so that his prior models may beextended to include this new knowledge.andP;  Thus, depending on who is receivingthe message, additional knowledge may need to be exchanged in order to setthe appropriate context for communication or to share unique backgroundinformation.andM;A crucial task for future systems development is to design an informationsystem which specifically supports the communicative requirements ofstrategic planning and control.andP;  A description of the need for a class ofsystems called Conceptualization/Communication/Creativity Support Systems(CSS) is contained in [8].andP;  According to [8], CSS are characterized by, &quot;Useof the computer as a managerial mind-to-mind telephone rather than as asophisticated calculater.&quot;andP;  The author also notes that the planning processmust integrate the strategic plans with capital investment plans, i.e., theresources needed to execute the strategy.andP;  This description supports ourconcept of the communication requirements for consensus among managerialmental models.andP;  Although [8] aptly describes the failure of existing planningprocesses and the role that CSS should play in future, only a vaguedescription is provided for the architecture of such a system.andP;  Our SPRINTsystem, described later in this article, provides a more detailed design.andM;REPRESENTATIONS FOR MENTAL MODELSandM;Expert SystemsandM;An expert system developed for solving management problems might capture theexpertise of several senior managers who are particularly knowledgeable aboutconstructing a complete strategic plan.andP;  The knowledge would include generalstrategies for managing product lines in declining markets, strategies forfragmented commodity markets, products which fit or contradict thecorporation's long-term strategies, and decision models for accepting aproposed new product (ROI, etc.).andM;A manager who consults this expert system would reply to a series ofquestions which would elicit the critical elements for a coherent plan.andP;  Anexpert system typically represents the heuristic expertise of a few expertsin a narrow domain.andP;  These heuristically based decisions are most commonlycaptured as production rules which are applied via forward-chaining(data-driven) or backward-chaining (goal-seeking) inference engines.andM;A description of a study in which an expert system is implemented fordeveloping strategic company objectives is contained in [28].andP;  In particular,the system described is intended to develop plans for new ventures, eitherfor individual entrepreneurs or within established companies.andP;  The authorclaims this is a reasonable application for expert systems because:andM;* Expert decision skills are needed to do the strategic planning job.andM;* There are recognized experts in the field.andM;* The job requires informed judgment.andM;* A number of specific company strategy development tasks, especially wheresmall companies or strategic business units are involved, involve manageabletasks that can be defined with sufficient precision to enable knowledge-basedsystems development.andM;When a manager is still in the early stages of formulating his planningagenda, i.e., loosely connected goals and strategies, an expert system wouldbe useful to provoke ideas about market factors, competitivestrengths/weaknesses, etc.andP;  However, plans at this stage are evolutionary;they are extended in detail and pruned of obsolete ideas over several weeksor months.andP;  Expert systems are helpful, but not sufficient when supporting amanager to build an evolving representation of his personal mental modelwhich helps him to clarify his implicit model and to make it explicit forcommunication to other individuals in his network.andM;HypermediaandM;A concise definition for hypermedia is provided in [18]:andM;Hypermedia is a style of building systems for information representation andmanagement around a network of multi-media nodes connected together by typedlinks.andP;  Such systems have recently become quite popular due to theirpotential for aiding in the organization and manipulation of irregularlystructured information in applications ranging from legal research tosoftware engineering.andM;We briefly review the hypertext systems which were considered while designingthe SPRINT system.andP;  These systems are discussed in the order that theyinfluenced our thinking -- the list is not intended to be exhaustive.andM;NoteCards -- NoteCards was developed by a team at Xerox PARC [18, 19].andP;  Thisresearch effort significantly affected our own prototype design.andM;NoteCards is designed around two primitive constructs, notecards and links.andO;A notecard is an electronic form of a 3 x 5 paper notecard which isgeneralized to contain any digital media: text, bitmap image, etc.andP;  Links areused to interconnect individual notecards into a network of related concepts.andO;A link is a typed, directional connection between a source and a destinationcard, where the type is a user-chosen label signifying the meaning of therelationship.andP;  Fileboxes are specialized notecards that can be used toorganize or categorize large collections of notecards.andP;  A filebox may containany type of notecard, including other fileboxes.andP;  Fileboxes were designed tohelp users manage large networks of interlinked notecards by building ahierarchical categorization of notecard clusters.andM;Seven issues to be considered in designing the next generation of hypermediasystems are reviewed in [18].andP;  One of these issues is particularly relevantto incorporating intelligence into a mental model representation.andP;  Unlikeexpert systems, hypermedia systems do not include inference engines thatactively derive new information and enter it into the network.andP;  In caseswhere computational ability is added to hypermedia, there is a clearseparation between the network and the computational engine.andP;  Cards and linksmay be added to the network, or the network may be searched for information,but the procedural knowledge is not integrated with the passive networkstructure.andP;  It is stated in [18]: &quot;A merging of concepts from frame-basedsystems into the design of hypermedia systems would be a sensible way toapproach the integration of hypermedia with rule-based, truth-maintenance,and other computational engines.&quot;andP;  This approach is taken in our integratedrepresentation for SPRINT.andM;gIBIS -- The gIBIS project represents research being conducted at MCC [10].andO;gIBIS is an application-specific hypertext system designed to facilitate thecapture of early design deliberations.andP;  For the purposes of our research, weare primarily interested in the typed links used in the gIBIS network.andP;  gIBISemploys three kinds of concept nodes: Issues, Positions, and Arguments, whichare interconnected by nine kinds of links.andP;  For example, a Position (concept)Responds-to (link) an Issue (concept), and this is the only place that aResponds-to link may be used.andP;  Arguments must be linked to their Positionswith either Supports or Objects-to links.andP;  A similar set of specifications isdescribed for each of the nine links.andP;  We outline a similar set of nodes andlinks for the strategic planning domain represented in our SPRINT system.andM;KnowledgePro -- KnowledgePro is a very recent entrant into the commercialmarket for expert system shells on the IBM PC [23].andP;  KnowledgePro integratesseveral features from both rule-based inference and hypertext.andP;  The hypertextallows the user to pick and choose his way through a knowledge base, choosingmore detailed solutions as required.andP;  The expert system can steer the userdown a path that is determined by his responses to a set of questions thatare fixed by the knowledge engineer.andP;  Thus, a two-way communication isestablished between the user and the expert system.andP;  One of the mostpromising applications for this marriage is in producing intelligentdocumentation.andM;A major drawback of KnowledgePro is that the knowledge base is only a passivestorage for predetermined knowledge.andP;  Support for mental models will requirea hypermedia network which can guide its own evolution and update throughintegrated procedural expertise.andM;Observations about Hypermedia -- Hypermedia provides a natural representationfor the loosely connected goals and strategies which characterize the mentalmodel for a manager's agenda.andP;  The flexible definition of nodes and linksallows each manager to build a personalized representation of his/her mentalmodel.andP;  However, hypermedia, as it is implemented in the current generation,is inflexible in its integration of computational engines for inferentialreasoning [18.]andM;Hypermedia systems expand the user's accessibility to a wide range ofinformation which may have very little semantic structure.andP;  Thus, an alreadysevere problem of selecting the most appropriate information from availableknowledge or databases may become worse.andP;  However, if the conceptualstructure of the hypermedia system is a reflection of the user's personalmental model, then selection and navigation become more intuitive for theuser.andP;  Links from the node currently being viewed may serve as memory promptsfor related concepts.andP;  Thus, the explicit model represented in the systemreflects the user's implicit mental model.andM;Semantic NetworksandM;The use of semantic networks as a knowledge representation formalism has along, albeit somewhat ill-defined, history in AI literature.andP;  The idea of&quot;semantic networks&quot; is generally credited with originating in [33].andP;  In thiscase, the author intended to develop a theory of the structure of humanlong-term memory and to create a computer model which utilized the theory toperform complex, memory-dependent tasks.andP;  The tasks which the authoraddressed were primarily concerned with storing the meanings of commonplacewords.andM;Although the author's intent in [33] was to model the semantics of Englishwords using network structures, similar representations were soon being usedto model many nonsemantic subjects, e.g., physical object structures.andO;Virtually every network-like formalism that has appeared since thepublication of [33] has been labeled by someone as a &quot;semantic net&quot; [5].andP;  Ageneralized network-like formalism which is called a &quot;Structured InheritanceNetwork,&quot; or SI-Net is described in [5].andP;  A SI-Net has a fixed set of nodeand link types which provide a basis for a fixed and well-defined interpreterand an explicit semantic theory for the formalism.andM;For our purposes, we describe several features of semantic network-likerepresentations which are useful for describing the mental models ofmanagers.andP;  Basically, a semantic network consists of nodes, interconnected byvarious kinds of associative links; thus, it is similar to an ordinarydictionary.andP;  Links from one concept node (word) point to other concepts(words) which collectively form a definition of the original concept.andM;Concepts are defined in [5] as, &quot;formal objects used to represent objects,attributes, and relationships of the domain being modeled.andP;  A Concept isthought of as representing an intensional object, and no Concepts are used torepresent directly extensional (world) objects.&quot;andP;  Generic Concepts representclasses of individuals by describing prototypical members of the class andIndividual Concepts are represented by relationships with more generalConcepts.andP;  Objects in the world have complex relational structure, and thus,they cannot be usefully taken as atomic entities or mere lists of properties[5].andP;  A Concept must therefore account for this internal structure as well asfor the object as a holistic entity.andP;  This observation is of crucialimportance as we define a representation for managerial mental models.andP;  Therelationships inherent in a mental model cannot be captured by a conventionaldatabase system.andM;The semantic memory model described in [33] was intended to serve as ageneral inferential representation for knowledge.andP;  An intersection search isconducted as a spreading activation, breadth-first search of the nodessurrounding two concepts.andP;  The search fans out by following links from theoriginal two concept nodes, until a point of intersection is found betweenthese &quot;spheres of activation.&quot;andP;  The resulting path would indicate a potentialrelationship between these two concepts.andP;  Thus, implicit relationships may beinferred from the explicitly defined network.andM;A system was implemented [9, 22] which utilizes a constrained spreadingactivation search for making inferences about the goals of a user.andP;  GRANT isan expert system for matching research proposals with potential fundingagencies by simulating a funding adviser.andP;  The meaning of a concept isencoded by its association with other concepts.andP;  For example, an agencywilling to fund AI research may also be willing to fund an expert systemproject, even though the agency profile does not explicitly list expertsystems.andP;  The two concepts are semantically related.andP;  A constraint is imposedon the spreading activation search by restricting the paths (sequence oflinks) that may validly connect a research proposal with an agency, i.e., thepath by which two &quot;spheres of activation&quot; intersect.andP;  Thus, a semanticnetwork model in the GRANT system attempts to form an explicit representationfor a funding adviser's implicit semantic memory.andM;Frame-based RepresentationandM;We introduce fram-based representation as an integrating framework for theabove three potential representations for mental models -- expert systems,hypermedia, and semantic networks.andP;  In addition, frame classification andinheritance provides useful object-oriented features to our system design.andO;Each node in a semantic network may be represented as a single frame.andP;  Linksare defined as slots within each frame.andP;  Frame-based systems supportinheritance, defaulting of slot values, and integration of truth maintenance,inference engines, and rule-based reasoning.andP;  The semantic network suppliesthe fundamental node-link representation of hypermedia, with the addition ofsemantic information carried by the link names.andP;  These features offrame-based representation enable an active hypermedia network to interactwith the user while he or she modifies or browses the mental modelrepresentation.andP;  A detailed review of frame-based representation capabilitiesis beyond the scope of this article.andP;  For an excellent summary, see [13].andM;Briefly, a frame contains slots defining attributes of that frame.andP;  Each slotis characterized by a set of facets.andP;  The value facet, if defined, containsthe current value for that slot.andP;  Additional facets may exist for ifNeeded,ifAdded, ifAccessed, and ifRemoved.andP;  These facets contain procedural demonswhich determine the frame's behavior if the corresponding slot's value isrequested but the value is not available (ifNeeded), a new value is added(ifAdded), an existing value is simply read (ifAccessed), or a value isremoved (ifRemoved).andP;  Facets may also be defined to restrict the type, numberof values, and other characteristics for a slot.andP;  Thus, the facets supplymeta-information about the slot's values.andP;  The ability to define frames,slots, facets, and demons dynamically allows the user to create apersonalized mental model with minimal restrictions imposed by the systemdesigner.andM;Note that the ifNeeded facet creates behavior similar to a backward-chaininginference process: if a value is not available, a rule (ifNeeded procedure)determines how to infer or compute the missing value.andP;  If the ifNeeded demonattempts to access a value in another frame which is undefined, its ifNeededdemon will also fire.andP;  The ifAdded facet creates behavior which is analogousto a forward-chaining inference process: whenever a value is set, a rule(ifAdded procedure) determines which other rules (frames/values) should alsobe tested or modified.andP;  Like the ifNeeded demons, the ifAdded demons maycause a chain reaction through the network.andP;  The frame/slot/value tuples aresimilar to the object/attribute/value tuples used in expert system knowledgebases.andM;Another interesting benefit of the frame-based representation is inheritanceamong frames.andP;  If a slot value is not available, a value from a parent framein a defined hierarchy may be used instead.andP;  Similarly, when an ifNeededdemon is required but is not defined for the current frame, a generalprocedure may be inherited via the parent chain.andP;  Using this inheritance,inference capabilities may be integrated into the hypermedia network todefine a shared set of behaviors for clusters of nodes.andP;  The SPRINT systemutilizes a filebox hierarchy similar to that described for the NoteCardssystem.andP;  Each filecard may inherit values and demons from its respectivefilebox(es).andP;  Thus, a single ifNeeded demon may be added to a particular slotin the filebox, and each filecard linked to that box will inherit that demon.andM;THE SPRINT SYSTEMandM;The SPRINT system (an acronym for Strategic Plan and Resource INTegration),can be used by a manager to make implicit planning model more explicit.andP;  Thatis, the user can create concept nodes and links which describe his or herunderstanding of the business environment impacting the strategic plan.andP;  Inaddition, the user can specify the resources that are required to achieve theplan and the relationship that those resources hold with the strategies.andO;These planning elements could be described with any of the hypertext systemsavailable on the market, however, our system design also incorporates twosignificant extensions: integrated heuristic rules and goal-orientedcommunication between the models of individual managers.andM;A feature which is conspicuously absent from the current generation ofhypermedia systems is integrated support for inference upon the knowledge inthe network.andP;  In many systems, such as NoteCards, computational engines maybe implemented external to the hypermedia network which treat the network asa passive store of facts represented as nodes and links.andP;  However,integrating an inference engine into the network allows each node to describeits own role within the network.andP;  The prototype system described in thissection utilizes an object-oriented language for implementing the hypermedianetwork.andP;  Smalltalk/V running on an IBM AT clone was used for our system.andO;This object-oriented design allows a network to be created where the nodesare not only passive records of notes, but each node encapsulates an activebehavior within the network.andP;  Thus, creation or modification of one node orlink may cause a chain-reaction of new changes through the network in orderto maintain a coherent mental model.andP;  This is accomplished by sendingmessages between the objects in the system.andM;A Mental Model for Strategic PlanningandM;Earlier in this article, we proposed that an integrated representation couldbe developed for mental models in strategic planning domains.andP;  Thisrepresentation used frame-based structures as the integrating framework forheuristic inference in a semantic network.andP;  A hypermedia browser, similar tothat used by NoteCards, would allow this network to be created andmaintained.andP;  Further, interactive use of the hypermedia interface by amanager would trigger demons within the nodes (frames) which activateinference processes in the system.andM;Figure 1 shows the primary concepts and relationships required in a strategicplanning network.andP;  The boxes represent classes of nodes, each with itsassociated links to other nodes.andP;  The isolated nodes in the lower-left cornerof the figure may be connected to any of the remaining nodes.andP;  Together,Stakeholders and Impersonal Forces represent the external or environmentalinfluences on a plan.andP;  Stakeholders are other individuals, such asstockholders of the corporation, customers, or vendors who affect or areaffected by the plan.andP;  An Impersonal Force is similar to a Stakeholder,except that it is non-human.andP;  For example, the weather in the midwesternUnited States might be an impersonal force affecting the profit margin foragricultural products.andM;Tracing a specific set of instances in Figure 1 would yield relations asfollows.andP;  An Issue may generalize one or more other Issues; thus,abstractions are formed.andP;  An Issue is causedBy a Cause, which in turn maydefine a hierarchy of additional related Causes.andP;  Either an Issue or a Causeis addressedBy one or more Objectives, each of which is linked to Strategiesfor reaching the Objective's goal.andP;  A Strategy is assignedTo a particularorganization which has the responsibility to implement the necessary actions.andO;Finally, each Strategy is measuredBy one or more Controls which represent the'Check' step of the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle.andP;  A set of semanticallyrelated links are provided for the inverse relationships.andM;The environmental factors would be represented by a Stakeholder whohasInterest in an Issue or an Objective.andP;  The Stakeholder holds Positionsabout his/her interests.andP;  These positions may be stated as truth-beliefsabout specific concepts or as heuristic rules used for inference.andP;  Forexample, a particular stakeholder might believe that &quot;the Unix operatingsystem will dominate the computer industry by 1993,&quot; or that &quot;IF the 80486microprocessor wholesale price drops below $500, THEN all further developmenton 80386-based products should be halted.&quot;andP;  Similarly, an Impersonal Force,such as the Dow-Jones industrial average, affects a Strategy related toissuing new shares of stock.andM;We will use the Sci-Tech case study (in [30]) that was introduced earlier inthis article as a forum for describing our prototype implementation and itsapplication to mental modeling.andP;  Begin by considering Figure 2 which displaysan example of a browser window.andP;  The graphical browser has the capability ofshowing one link type at a time from any node (filecard or filebox).andP;  In thiscase, the boxes link is displayed for the &quot;Strategic Plan&quot; filebox.andP;  Thetitle of the window always indicates the current node followed by the linktype displayed in the graph pane.andP;  All other nodes shown in the graph pane ofFigure 2 are fileboxes which are contained within the boxes hierarchy of thisnode.andP;  There are two large panes at the left-hand side of this window.andP;  Thetop pane displays all fileboxes which are stored at the root level of thehierarchy; five in this example.andP;  Note that the &quot;Strategic Plan&quot; filebox isone of these root nodes.andP;  By using the mouse to select one of the other fourtitles, the graph pane would be updated to show this new hierarchy.andP;  Thelower pane displays all links which are defined for the currently selectednode (Strategic Plan in this example).andP;  In the upper left corner, two smallpanes are defined with labels &quot;Read&quot; and &quot;Execute.&quot;andP;  If the Read button ishighlighted and the mouse is used to select one of the nodes in the largegraph pane, then a new window is opened which displays the detailed contentsof that filecard (see Figure 4).andP;  If the Execute button is highlighted, thena node selected in the graph pane will have its attached method immediatelyexecuted.andP;  The attached method may contain any valid Smalltalk code.andP;  Forexample, it may access an external database and display the results of thequery.andP;  A filecard in the 'E-Mail' filebox has an attached method which opensa terminal emulator window accessing the manager's electronic mail.andP;  Thus,this prototype system supports the data query functions required by anExecutive Support System [35].andM;Figure 3 shows the same window in which a different node has been selected.andO;The title of the window shows that a filecard from the &quot;Issues&quot; filebox isthe selected node and that filecards from the &quot;Causes&quot; filebox are linked viathe causedBy relation.andP;  The node &quot;Proprietary growth is slow&quot; is a filecardrather than a filebox; thus, the links shown in the lower-left pane aredifferent than those in Figure 2.andP;  Refer again to Figure 1 for theinterpretation of the concepts Issue and Cause, and for the relationscausedBy and specializes.andP;  Selecting the filedIn link would update the graphpane to show the generalization network of fileboxes above the current node.andM;An example of the second window type is shown in Figure 4.andP;  This windowdisplays the detailed contents of a single node (filecard or filebox), andallows the network to be traversed in a manner similar to that used inApple's HyperCard product.andP;  The window label shows that the card titled&quot;Reduce Costs&quot; is contained in the filebox &quot;Strategies.&quot;andP;  The lower-left paneshows that four links are defined for this card.andP;  After selecting themeasuredBy link, a list is popped up which shows the titles of cards linkedvia this link type.andP;  In this case, only one card is linked via measuredBy.andO;Clicking on a member of this list will cause this entire window to be updatedto show a new card, &quot;Cost of Goods Sold&quot; in this example.andM;Recall that each card is actually represented as a frame within the semanticnetwork.andP;  Thus, an ifAccessed demon could be added to the notes slot whichwill be fired whenever that card is read.andP;  This capability facilitates thecreation of an intelligent document which modifies its behavior based uponthe cards that are selected by the user.andM;Our prototype system consists of fileboxes and filecards to represent themajor concerns of Jane Sherrill in the Sci-Tech case.andP;  To reflect the controlaspect of Jane's mental model for Sci-Tech's strategic plan, we have enteredan ifAdded demon to the &quot;Cost of Goods Sold&quot; card.andP;  Whenever the data slot ofthis card is changed, the demon checks the goals of all Strategies linked viaits measures link and displays a warning message when the variance isunfavorable.andP;  A &quot;complete&quot; mental model for Jane Sherrill would model theinteraction of plan elements to mimic her understanding of the businessdynamics within Sci-Tech Associates and the interaction with its environment.andM;A Distributed Model for IntegrationandM;The representation described above is adequate to represent the mental modelof a single manager, but it is necessary to integrate the plans of a networkof managers in order to produce a coherent global plan which satisfies thecorporate objectives [26, 37].andP;  The communicative acts between these managersare goal-oriented, i.e., the initiator has minimal knowledge of the structureand contents of the receiver's mental model, but the initiator holds a goalconcerning the intended effect on the receiver's model.andP;  The communicativeintent is stated as a goal which is based on the class-level structure shownin Figure 1.andP;  The terms of the goal may be semantically related to thecontents of the receiver's mental model.andP;  For example, if Manager 1 wantsassistance in &quot;Increasing customer satisfaction for software products,&quot; andManager 2 has the following knowledge in her mental modelrepresentation/knowledge base:andM;Concept: We design and code C compilers.andM;Concept: We have defects in our C compilers.andM;Link: C compilers are a subset of software products.andM;Rule: If a software product has defects, then customer-satisfaction isreduced.andM;Objective: Reduce software defects in C compilers.andM;Then, a relationship may be inferred between these two managers, and theirplans should be coordinated.andP;  Exact keyword matching is unlikely to besuccessful as a method for making this inference.andP;  These requirements forgoal-oriented queries make existing distributed hypertext systems inadequatefor this environment [2, 10].andM;The object-oriented design used for the representation of an individualmental model provides an excellent foundation for a distributed architecture.andO;The communication within the distributed system may be viewed as messagespassed between the individual models.andP;  The notion of active objects is auseful conceptualization for this distributed architecture.andP;  An active objectis, &quot;an object in which a high degree of autonomous responsibility andcontrol is vested.andP;  The active object is considered, within its usage, as anindependent agent, and frequently a source of knowledge and activity&quot; [16].andO;Active objects can initiate actions asynchronously without receiving amessage, whereas passive objects must receive a message before performing anyaction.andM;Actor formalism, as described in [20], specifies the behavior of an actor bythe types of messages the actor will receive and the operations performed onreceipt.andP;  Sender and receiver actors proceed asynchronously and in parallelduring and after message transfer.andP;  However, the actor formalism implies avery high degree of fine granularity parallelism, whereas other active objectsystems [3, 25] implement heavyweight active objects.andP;  These larger-grainedobjects incorporate operations which may be invoked by other objects viamessage passing, and processes which execute in parallel with operationinvocations.andP;  Active objects can form a rather natural representation ofitems in our universe, as is noted in [16].andP;  To mirror reality, the objectsin our SPRINT system must be active to reflect the autonomous activity thatexists in the real world.andM;We propose an architecture for a distributed knowledge base management system(DKBMS) which manages goal-oriented queries between multiple knowledge-basedsystems (KBSs).andP;  In this architecture, a single KBS encapsulates the mentalmodel of an individual manager, and the DKBMS represents the communicationmedium connecting this network of managers.andP;  The DKBMS incorporates a globalknowledge base (GKB) for organizing the meta-knowledge which describes theapplication domain.andP;  For the strategic planning domain outlined in thisarticle, the meta-knowledge would consist of structural information regardingthe elements of a plan, e.g., issues, stakeholders, objectives, strategies,etc.andP;  The GKB also contains a Knowledge Cluster Dictionary which is modeledas a semantic network of strategic planning terms.andP;  Figure 5 shows a diagramof the DKBMS architecture.andM;The second element of this DKBMS architecture consists of the communicationlink between the DKBMS and each KBS.andP;  Our control mechanism utilizes anactive object design in that we implement the DKBMS and each KBS as separateobjects in Smalltalk and send messages between these objects.andP;  These objectsare located on separate nodes within a wide area network.andP;  The KBSscommunicate with the DKBMS via a standard message protocol, and each KBS usesthe DKBMS as a liaison to either instruct or query other KBSs.andP;  The GKB mayuse the knowledge clusters to select zero, one, or many KBSs as messagetargets.andP;  In cases where heterogeneous knowledge representations areimplemented among the various KBSs, it may be necessary to map the messagesfrom one representation to another when communicating between a KBS and theDKBMS.andM;For a more detailed description of an object-oriented design for distributedknowledge-based systems, see [6].andM;CONCLUDING REMARKSandM;The system design described in this article is based on relevant literature,both theoretical and applied, on a strategic planning case study from amanagement textbook, [30] and on substantial industrial experience by theauthors.andP;  We are now beginning a case study within a major U.S.andP;  corporationwhich has a decentralized management structure.andP;  This particular corporationis of interest to us because it has developed a manual planning and controlprocess which specifically addresses the integration of plans within andbetween divisions.andM;We expect this case study to fulfill several objectives.andP;  First, we willassess the ability of our SPRINT system to represent the critical conceptsand semantic relationships needed to capture the richness of a manager'smental model.andP;  Our proposed representation was illustrated in Figure 1.andO;Second, we need to elicit the meta-level knowledge which will allow the DKBMSto support communication and consensus among the individual mental models(KBSs).andP;  The &quot;relevant&quot; KBSs must be selected for communication byconsidering the context of the plan represented in the initiating KBS and itsrelationship with the plans of others.andP;  Third, we must demonstrate thefeasibility of using a system such as SPRINT within the complex environmentof an existing corporate planning and control process.andP;  We will accomplishthis by representing within SPRINT the planning data and process knowledgegathered during our case study, and then reviewing this model with themanagers who own the plans that were used.andM;Although a thorough discussion of knowledge acquisition techniques is beyondthe scope of this article, a few remarks may be useful.andP;  Knowledgeacquisition for the SPRINT system consists of two stages: eliciting thesocial knowledge, or planning language, which supports the communicationamong a particular group of managers; and eliciting the mental model of anindividual manager.andP;  The semantic relationships shown in Figure 1 are part ofthe social knowledge which should represent the formal or informal planningprocesses used within the target organization.andP;  The SPRINT architecture, andour prototype system, easily accommodates this form of knowledge through thefilebox hierarchy.andP;  An individual manager's mental model is representedpartially within this common planning language and partially through thecreation of additional fileboxes, link types, and attached procedures.andO;Ideally, the SPRINT system would incorporate an automated knowledgeacquisition tool which would assist a manager in extending the semantics tomatch his/her own mental model; presently, this is accomplished through theuse of pull-down menus.andP;  An interesting presentation of similar knowledgeacquisition issues can be found in [15].andM;A related topic which must be addressed in greater detail is to determine theconditions under which a manager would choose to use this system, i.e., thebenefits derived from SPRINT must outweigh the costs incurred as managerialtime expended in creating and maintaining the model.andP;  If an explicitrepresentation of a manager's mental model is to be useful in communicatingwith other managers (via the DKBMS), then it is essential that the model bekept current.andP;  Many short-term plans are too dynamic to justify the timerequired to maintain them as accurate representations of the manager'simplicit mental model.andP;  Thus, a possible conclusion is that only those planshaving a horizon between six months and three years would benefit from theSPRINT system.andP;  This question requires empirical investigation in our futureresearch.andM;REFERENCESandM;[1.] Ackoff, R.
