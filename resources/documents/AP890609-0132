Chief U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson took three countsagainst Secord involving accusations of illegal gifts to OliverNorth and consolidated the with nine new charges accusing Secord oflying to Congress.   The alleged lies involve covering up Secord's own profits in theIran-Contra affair and denying that North received any benefits fromthe maze of corporations known as the Enterprise set up by Secordand business partner Albert Hakim.   North, who enlisted Secord to run arms to the Nicaraguan rebelsduring a congressional ban on military aid to the Contras, wasconvicted last month of accepting a $13,800 home security systemfrom Secord. North faces sentencing June 23 for that and two othercrimes in the Iran-Contra scandal.   The government says Secord's profits from running arms to theNicaraguan Contras and assisting the Reagan administration's secretIran arms initiative totaled more than $1 million.   Consolidating the 1988 gratuities charges against Secord with thenine-count indictment brought in April will serve ``the interests ofjudicial economy and sound administration,'' Judge Robinson said ina two-page order.   Secord's lawyer, Thomas Green, argued Thursday in favor of tryingSecord on the gratuities charges alone.   Green said the new indictment is laden with potential problemsover the use of classified information which ``will delay any trial.... In short, consolidation will not result in any judicialeconomy.'' Green also said the indictments are not logically related.   But Robinson said proof for the gratuities charges would beadmissible to prove the cover-up allegations and that there islittle doubt that consolidation is appropriate.   The office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh has said itplans to offer no classified documents in prosecuting the 12 charges.   Secord's claim to classified documents in his defense will havevery little likelihood of success, the prosecution said in a courtfiling.   Associate independent counsel Reid Weingarten said the governmentwould seek dismissal of broad conspiracy, theft and wire fraudcharges against Secord. They focus on the diversion of Iran armssale money to the Contras and prosecuting them would involve the useof extensive amounts of sensitive material. U.S. intelligenceagencies are unwilling to turn over such material to Secord withouta painstaking, page-by-page review, the government said in a recentcourt filing.   Identical conspiracy and theft charges were dismissed againstNorth when intelligence agencies refused to declassify nationalsecrets contained in material that was relevant to the prosecution'scase and North's defense.</TEXT></DOC>
