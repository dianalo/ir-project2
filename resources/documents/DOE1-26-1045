These systems are designedto prevent catastrophic failures and incorrect operations and work wellfor general data acquisition and remote supervisory control. However,feedback control, system diagnostic, advanced protection, and contingencycontrol are difficult to implement on the ever changing power systemwith these conventional approaches. Knowledge based systems have thepotential for following the changes in the power system and adjustingdecision criteria accordingly. Decisions can be made on a more completedata base which is constantly adjusted to changes in system parametersand operation. This paper describes the various functions where knowledgebased systems could ideally be used. The use of a knowledge based, adaptivesystem approach for diagnosing distribution system disturbances and equipmentfailures is presented. Two field experiments are described.</TEXT></DOC>
