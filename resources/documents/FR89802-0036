This order is effective under the AgriculturalMarketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafterreferred to as the ``Act.'' This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major'' rule undercriteria contained therein. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has consideredthe economic impact of this proposed rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.There are approximately 16 handlers of prunes produced in California subjectto regulation under the California prune marketing order, and approximately1,200 producers in the production area. Small agricultural producers havebeen defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.2) as thosehaving average gross annual revenues for the last three years of less than$500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whosegross annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of prune handlersand producers may be classified as small entities. The marketing order for California prunes requires that the assessmentrate for a particular fiscal year shall apply to all assessable pruneshandled from the beginning of such year. An annual budget of expenses isprepared by the Prune Marketing Committee (Committee) and submitted tothe U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval. The members of the Committeeare handlers and producers of regulated prunes. They are familiar withthe Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnelin their local areas and are, therefore, in a position to formulate anappropriate budget. The budget is formulated and discussed in public meetings.Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participateand provide input. The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividinganticipated expenses by expected shipments of assessable prunes. Becausethat rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a ratewhich will produce sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses.The recommended budget and assessment rates are usually acted upon by theCommittee shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred ona continuous basis. Therefore, budget and assessment rate approvals mustbe expedited so that the Committee will have funds to pay its expenses.The Committee met on June 27, 1989, and unanimously recommended 1989-90marketing order expenditures of $250,895 and an assessment rate of $1.39per salable ton of prunes. In comparison, 1988-89 marketing year budgetedexpenditures were $248,320 and the assessment rate was $1.60 per ton. Assessmentincome for 1989-90 is estimated at $250,895 based on a crop of 180,500salable tons of prunes. While this proposed action would impose some additional costs on handlers,the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Someof the additional costs may be passed on to producers. Further, these costswould be significantly offset by the benefits derived from the operationof the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determinedthat this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Based on the foregoing, it is found and determined that a comment periodof less than 30 days is appropriate because the budget and assessment rateapproval for this program needs to be expedited. The Committee must havesufficient funds to pay its expenses, which are incurred on a continuousbasis. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 993 </ITAG>California, Dried prunes, and Marketing agreements and orders.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, it is proposed that a new andSection;993.340 be added to 7 CFR Chapter IX as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 993_DRIED PRUNES PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA </ITAG>1.
