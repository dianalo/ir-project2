Idon't believe I've seen a production that had the same actor as . . .;    Holdit.;    Theseus and Titania?;    Hippolyta and Oberon?!;    Wait a minute,wait a minute. I go back and read it again. There must be some mistake.;   But no. That's what it says.;    I read a little further: Ah. That explainsit. The director is Danny Scheie.;    The man, or munchkin, responsible forthe world's funniest &quot;Comedy of Errors&quot; in 1988, in which 16 speaking rolesand &quot;several gaolers, officers and attendants&quot; were portrayed by nine actorsand two musicians; in which a packing crate doubled as a stage, a bicyclebuilt for two held four and two of the actors played their own twin brothers,both onstage at the same time, which you must admit is unusual, not to sayimpossible. I mean, Hayley Mills had a trick camera.;    AND that -- to getserious here -- is what puts Shakespeare/Santa Cruz in a class by itself.Without being all academic and heavy, it's the Shakespeare festival thatbelieves in doing things a little different.;    &quot;Henry V&quot; with a company of11 actors playing 44 roles. (Because director Michael Edwards decided to take&quot;We few, we happy few&quot; literally.) &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Rosencrantz and GuildensternAre Dead,&quot; back to back in rotating repertory. A U.S. Navy &quot;Othello.&quot; An &quot;AsYou Like It&quot; that picked up everything, including the audience, when the storymoved to the Forest of Arden.;    Some years, the company goes straight forthe gold: no high concept, just simple beauty. &quot;Richard II.&quot; &quot;The Winter'sTale.&quot; &quot;Twelfth Night.&quot; &quot;Love's Labour's Lost.&quot; &quot;Much Ado About Nothing.&quot;&quot;Much Ado&quot; may have been the prettiest: An entire Franciscan mission, down toits clay pots of impatiens and a tiny graveyard, was built in the glen next tothe Performing Arts complex at the University of California, Santa Cruz.;   For me, it all began in 1984 when I, new to San Jose, wandered down to SantaCruz, got lost trying to find the festival, found it, got lost trying to findthe glen, found it -- and found there the Globe Theater, battered andbullet-scarred, crowned with the wreckage of a snub fighter plane.;    Thiswas Michael Edwards' production of &quot;Henry IV, Part 1,&quot; which knocked thestuffing out of the stultified Britishness that Americans endure, nay, expectas a condition of Shakespeare. The poetry was there, not in the measuredcadences of the Queen's English but in an exciting mix of American accents.Prince Hal looked like Boy George, the king like a contemporary politician,his generals like generals, his enemies like partisans.;    &quot;I want the actorsto speak in their own voices,&quot; says Edwards, the 40-year-old Australian whocame here to direct &quot;Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; in 1983, who planned to stay twoyears and instead became artistic director in 1987.;    &quot;In their own voices&quot;sounds so simple, but it leads to larger iconoclasms: the willingness to takerisks, challenge the text, be just a little anarchic. These are thingsShakespeare/Santa Cruz takes for granted as its birthright.;    In thebeginning, founding director Audrey Stanley wanted to pay homage to her latecolleague, the respected Shakespearean scholar C.L. Barber, and to givesomething tangible to UC-Santa Cruz students. So every summer, there have beenRoyal Shakespeare Company guests, who teach and coach as well as act. Since1985, the festival also has had an increasing complement of Equity(professional) actors.;    The 1991 season is the festival's 10th. It opensSaturday with (what else in a commemorative year?) &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot;in the glen; continues indoors with &quot;Our Town,&quot; the quintessential Americanplay, opening next Friday, and &quot;Measure for Measure,&quot; one of the mostdifficult of the problem comedies, with its opposed forces of license andrepression; and ends outdoors with the work that most defines 20th-centuryart, &quot;Waiting for Godot,&quot; in which the fragrant and shady glen will adopt thepersona of &quot;A country road. A tree. Evening.&quot;;    All will run in repertorythrough Sept. 1, with a brief adjournment Aug. 24-25 for &quot;Midsummer&quot; to playat Villa Montalvo in Saratoga.;    Barber, who died in 1980, is known for abook-length essay on the vis comica of the Bard, the lighter face of thetwo-faced mask of Thespis. It's called &quot;Shakespeare's Festival Comedies.&quot;;   Shakespeare/Santa Cruz is the place where the festive comedies (as well as thetragedies, the histories, the romances and a lot of other plays not byShakespeare) come off the page, played here as delicately as wind chimes andthere as broadly as vaudeville. In Santa Cruz, Shakespeare is shamelesslyalive.;     Shakespeare/Santa Cruz; Repertory: 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'(opens 2 p.m. Saturday); 'Our Town' (opens 8 p.m. next Friday); 'Measure forMeasure' (opens Aug. 2); 'Waiting for Godot' (opens Aug. 9); Through: Sept. 1;Where: Performing Arts complex, UC-Santa Cruz; Tickets: $30-$70 (season);$16-$20 (single).
