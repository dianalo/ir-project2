Tears of homesicknessgive her away.   Dalal is one of 60 Kuwaiti children who last week entered Frenchpublic schools in this spa town 11 miles north of Geneva. Theirwealthy families, who for years have spent summers here, werestranded when Iraqi forces occupied Kuwait on Aug. 2.   The children face the prospect of their first cold winter - andtheir first taste of financial hardship.   During a recess, Dalal turned on her Walkman casette player tolisten to patriotic Kuwaiti songs. She began sobbing, and two ofher Kuwaiti friends, clad in tight blue jeans and baggysweatshirts, cried with her.   ``Living in France is not a problem - the people are verykind,'' said 16-year-old Shaika. ``The trouble is that we areoutside our country and we can't go home. We feel alone, but whenwe talk to each other it helps.''   Divonne-Les-Bains, a town of 6,000 people nestled in thefoothills of the Jura Mountains, boasts luxury hotels, a man-madelake with sand beaches, a casino, golf course and race track.   Several dozen Kuwaiti families live in lakeside and hillsidevillas surrounded by high iron fences. Many of the homes havetennis courts, swimming pools, and satellite dishes.   The families are worried about security, and school officialsasked that the children be identified only by their first names.But the students spoke freely about the new uncertainties in theirlives.   They said their families had become budget-conscious for thefirst time because some bank accounts were inaccessible. Kuwaitiassets were frozen by many governments in order to shield them fromplunder by the Iraqis.   ``My parents used to take us out to dinner all the time,'' Dalalsaid. ``Now its out to the supermarket and back.''   ``We used to go shopping and choose anything we like. We hadeverything,'' added Hawazen, 16. ``Now my mother tells me to picksomething cheap, something I'll wear a lot.''   Many of the fathers, who include diplomats and businessmen, usedto spend the evenings at the casino. Now they offer assistance tothe Kuwaiti Embassy in Geneva and drink tea together while watchingnightly television news reports.   The youths said a return to Kuwait now would be dangerous,possibly even fatal, but they all said they would not have fled ifthey had been home when the invasion occurred. Most have relativesleft behind.   For Haifaa, a 21-year-old Kuwaiti university student, picking upher brother and cousins at school is the main daily activity. Shefinds the waiting intolerable.   ``I would rather go back to Kuwait to be with my other brothersand sisters and die than be separated like this,'' she said.   School officials have gone out of their way to accommodate theKuwaitis, whose children speak Arabic and English, not French. Notuition is charged, and alternative meals are offered on days whenthe French students are fed pork, which is taboo for Moslems.   One Western custom has not been modified: co-ed classes. Dalalsaid she didn't mind her first exposure to male classmates. But one14-year-old Kuwaiti boy, Sabih, complained about girls in hisclass.   The director of the secondary school, Chantal Daux, said sheinitially suggested that multilingual private schools in Genevawould be more suitable.   But the parents insisted on the Divonne-les-Bains schools,apparently mindful of $10,000 annual tuition at the privateschools.   ``The parents expect us to teach the children French, disciplineand the European way of life,'' Ms. Daux said. ``Our goal is tohelp them adapt smoothly ... without pampering them in a gildedghetto.''   A additional English-speaking teacher has been hired to assistthe children in special language courses aimed at preparing them todo all their studies in French as soon as possible.   Ms. Daux said she never questioned the importance of welcomingthe Kuwaitis into her school.   ``It's a terrible human tragedy for anyone who loses hisroots,'' she said. ``I thought about the children and theirdespair. I put myself in the place of their mothers and did what Iwould want done for my children.''</TEXT></DOC>
