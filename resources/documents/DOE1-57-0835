<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-57-0835 </DOCNO><TEXT>It was shown for the first time that in the presence of Ni and Pt, p-benzoquinoneis hydrogenated with the formation not only of hydroquinone but alsoof 1,4-cyclohexanediol. The rate of formation of 1,4-cyclohexanediolis {similar_to} 1/20 of the rate of formation of hydroquinone. Smalladditions of alkali (0.001 M) to the reaction system lead to a changein the selectivity of the process on Pt: the only hydrogenation productis hydroquinone; in the case of Ni, the direction of the reaction isunchanged.</TEXT></DOC>
