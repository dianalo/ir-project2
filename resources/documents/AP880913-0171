By opposing the MX and Midgetman missiles and ridiculing theStrategic Defense Initiative as ``a fantasy,'' Dukakis has laidhimself open to Republican barbs that he would undermine Americanstrength in arms talks with the Soviets.   Dukakis, in turn, has demanded that Bush explain how he proposesto pay for all the weapons in the Pentagon arsenal.   The Massachusetts governor has launched a counteroffensive inrecent days, visiting an Ohio plant that makes engines for theStealth bomber Monday to dramatize his support for thatradar-evading plane.   On Tuesday, Dukakis donned a helmet and rode in a M-1 Abramstank at a General Dynamics facility in Sterling Heights, Mich.,where he charged the Reagan administration sought to cut tankproduction by a quarter.   ``We'll continue research on strategic defenses, but we're notgoing to waste hundreds of billions of dollars on a system our bestscientists say won't work, at a time when we're shortchanging ourtroops in the field and mortgaging our future,'' said Dukakis, whoalso planned a major address on defense in Washington Wednesday.   To date, Dukakis has been on the defensive in arguing that whatthe American military really needs is a ``conventional defenseinitiative'' to beef up its front-line forces in Europe.   Far from promising actual cuts in Pentagon spending, Dukakis hassuggested any savings on strategic weapons may be offset by theneed to buy more tanks, artillery and conventional weaponry.   Bush, meanwhile, has had a field day making the rounds ofmilitary plants and bases, pillorying a rival who ``gives me theimpression he's opposed to every new weapons system since theslingshot'' and quipping that Dukakis ``thinks a naval exercise issomething you find in the Jane Fonda Workout Book.''   But Bush, who has not suggested scrapping a single Pentagonweapons program, so far has not spelled out how he proposes to keepthe $289 billion Pentagon budget within the constraints of hisso-called ``flexible freeze'' on all federal spending save SocialSecurity.   Regardless of who wins, the next president will inevitably befaced with hard decisions on Pentagon spending.   ``It's been a dirty little secret of the Reagan administrationthat for the whole second term the defense budget has undergonereal declines,'' said Kenneth Adelman, Reagan's former director ofthe Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.   After doubling in his first four years, the Pentagon budget hasfallen 10 percent in real dollars since 1985. It is still 53percent higher than before the Carter-Reagan buildup.   But it would take a major new spurt in spending to get all ofthe major new weapons off the Pentagon's drawing boards and intothe field _ or space.   Lawrence Korb, a former Reagan assistant secretary of defense,said: ``Right now in defense you have a $400 billion program and a$300 billion budget. Whoever gets in there is going to have to getthat program down. ... Something will have to go.''   The Democrats' platform calls for ``more stable defensebudgets,'' not cuts. Dukakis says his top priority ``will be toimprove our conventional forces ... while negotiating sensible armscontrol agreements.''   But building up that conventional strength will not be cheap.   Korb, director of the Center for Public Policy Education at theBrookings Institution, estimates it would cost $5 billion for eachextra day the U.S. wants to be able to fight a conventional war inEurope against the Soviets.   Adelman, now vice president of the Institute for ContemporaryStudies, said: ``Dukakis cannot save any money like he talks aboutby cutting down the strategic forces and pouring those funds intoconventional forces. There's not going to be that much to pour in.Strategic forces account for at the most 12 percent of the U.S.defense budget. Eighty-eight percent is conventional.''   Military analyst Joshua M. Epstein said it is Bush's figuresthat don't add up.   ``Bush is talking about trying to drive eight lanes of trafficthrough a three-lane tunnel as far as the Pentagon budget isconcerned. He has just not realistically faced up to the budgetconstraints that will be imposed by Congress,'' said Epstein, aBrookings senior fellow.   ``The extra five lanes are continuing funding at high levels forSDI; following through on plans for a 600-ship Navy; continuedmodernization of the strategic triad with not one bomber but two,the B-1 and the Stealth; the MX and Midgetman missile; a fullTrident submarine program,'' said Epstein.   ``If you're not prepared to cut some of these glamor programsthen things like readiness and training and personnel andmaintenance and conventional forces are going to take a beating,''he said.   Dukakis has said he would continue basic Star Wars research at areduced level of $1 billion, less than a third of what is nowspent. He opposes a rail-based MX missile system and the Midgetman.He favors scrapping plans to build two new supercarrier task forcesthat cost $18 billion each.   The Massachusetts governor supports the radar-evading Stealthbomber, which he boasted Monday was ``started by a Democraticpresident, it was supported by a Democratic Congress and it's goingto be completed by my administration.'' He also favors the D-5submarine launched ballistic missile.   He charges that despite spending nearly $2 trillion on defenseand increasing the U.S. nuclear arsenal from 7,000 warheads to12,000, the Reagan-Bush administration has left U.S. armed forcesshort of spare parts and ammunition.   Bush has committed himself to research, testing and deploymentof SDI as rapidly as possible _ but he cautioned last month that``a full deployment ... would be very expensive.''   Bush pledges to support ``rail mobility for the MX missile.'' Hesays the single-warhead Midgetman would be ``hard to locate andcould enhance stability. However, it is very expensive.''</TEXT></DOC>
