For example, Kenneth Olsen, Digital Equipment president,says he decided not to read his e-mail when he printed it outone day and had 30 feet of messages.   Now electronic filters for e-mail are appearing that usetechniques pioneered at Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology. Beyond, Cambridge, Mass., will reach the marketfirst this summer with BeyondMail, a $250 software programthat looks at e-mail as it comes in and decides what to dowith it. Users decide how to program their own computers toset priorities. Messages from the boss, customers or othermembers of a project team go in the urgent file. Others canbe sorted for later viewing.   A computer user can set up rules for automaticallyforwarding e-mail depending on the situation: traveling onbusiness; working at home; vacation-reachable;vacation-unreachable. The computer forwards messages aboutsales to another salesperson and ones about projects toanother group member. Normally, messages are organized basedon headings, but BeyondMail can react to key words in amessage.   &quot;This {type of product} is going to be the killerapplication for networks,&quot; says Esther Dyson, editor of theRelease 1.0 newsletter, who thinks it will be a big hit.   Wijit, another e-mail filter with an MIT pedigree, islikely to be acquired by Dun andamp; Bradstreet's software unit,which hired John Landry, who had headed Wijit's developer,Agility. He says it will hit the market this year.                                                                                                          Physicians Can Stop   Lugging Drug Tomes   DOCTORS will soon start prescribing drugs with the aid ofa hand-held electronic device.   Medical Economics, Oradell, N.J., plans to start shippingin April a $249 electronic version of the Physicians' DeskReference, the standard physicians' guide to prescriptiondrugs. David Sifton, project manager, says that &quot;doctors canmake on the spot dosage and {drug} administration decisions&quot;while making rounds.   The device weighs 10 ounces and fits in a pocket. Theoriginal tome weighs seven pounds and costs $49.95, thoughmost doctors get it free from drug makers. The electronicversion holds about 25% of the data in the tome, includingall data on warnings and contra-indications, but it lacksdetails on side effects and interactions among differentdrugs.   By typing in the first few letters of the drug name,doctors can see data almost instantly on an eight-line screenwithout having to search an index and then leaf through thepages. It tells doctors how to calculate doses for peoplewith different weights and special problems. &quot;We arediscussing bringing out an add-on cartridge with interactioninformation,&quot; Mr. Sifton adds.   Medical Economics, a unit of Toronto's Thomson Corp.,placed an initial order for 10,000 devices with themanufacturer, Selectronics Inc., Pittsford, N.Y.                                                                                                          Neural Network Software   Is Getting Brainier                                                                                                          GROWING numbers of companies are using PC-based neuralnetwork software to solve problems that used to be attackedby expert systems or statistical analysis.   NeuralWare, Pittsburgh, is one maker of the software,which analyzes data to determine patterns and &quot;learn&quot; thebest answers. Casimir C. Klimasauskas, NeuralWare's founder,says one user of his $1,895 software is a direct mailcompany. The firm, which declines to be named, analyzes testmailings to see what selection of mail-order goods mostappeals to a demographic group. Previously, it used astatistical technique called two-pass logistic regression,but using the neural net, it gets the same sales volume with15% fewer mailings.   Other firms sell cheaper packages, including Brainmaker, a$195 package from California Scientific Software, GrassValley, Calif.; and MacBrain, a $1,495 package for theMacintosh computer from Neurix, Boston.   Promised Land Technologies, New Haven, Conn., hasintroduced a $249 neural network, Braincel, that works withMicrosoft's Excel 3.0 spreadsheet software, greatlysimplifying the process of collecting data in an organizedformat. Braincel users include an accounting firm trying todevelop a program to help spot common audit errors, andCiticorp's Quotron Systems, which is devising a system topredict stock-index movements five minutes ahead of time.   Murray Ruggiero, Promised Land's vice president, researchand development, is working on a program he calls Dr. Trot.He says it picks winners in harness races 38% of the time.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          TUFTS University mechanical engineers are testing baseballbats made out of a wood composite that are almost as durableas aluminum. Robert Collier, professor of mechanicalengineering, says tests show the bats have the same acousticsignature as solid wood bats rather than the metallic ping ofaluminum. . . . Bull HN Information Systems has developed theChild Protection System to help social workers quicklydetermine if a child has been abused before or if pastviolence at an address makes police aid advisable. The$80,000 system accommodates laptops linked to a centraldatabase by cellular phones, so caseworkers can check at anytime. In a Michigan case, a mother sentenced to jailsuggested the grandmothers as caretakers. The caseworkerelectronically checked files and found one grandmother had ahistory of child abuse while the other lived with a violentboyfriend. The child went to foster care.</TEXT></DOC>
