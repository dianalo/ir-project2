We report an associatedmembrane perturbation whose recovery determines substantial modificationsin the behavior of log phase Escherichia coli K-12 exposed to sublethaldoses of near-UV radiation (366 nm). When incubated at 37/sup 0/C inplain nutrient broth, cells suffered a growth delay of about 100 minwith parallel inhibition of several membrane functions. Conversely, whengrown in conditions known to influence membrane activities, these wereslightly inhibited and the growth delay lasted about 50 min. All theabove conditions triggered the stringent response, characterized by anequivalent post-irradiation burst of intracellular guanosine 5'3' tetraand pentaphosphate and by a similar decay rate of the nucleotides accumulatedat time 0 of the growth lag. According to our data the polyphosphates'half decay time in irradiated cells remains practically constant andclose to 15 min. But, while cells from unsupplemented broth at 37/sup0/C resumed normal growth in around 100 min those with recovered membraneswere rescued from growth inhibition in about one half of that time.</TEXT></DOC>
