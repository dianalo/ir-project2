But all nine face charges including ``crimes against the state,crimes against the administration of justice and crimes against thenational economy,'' Attorney General Carlos Villalaz said.   The most serious of the accusations carries a 15 to 20 yearprison sentence, according to the penal code.   Arias, a vice presidential candidate in May elections, wasarrested Sunday in Veraguas province, 180 miles west of thecapital. He and the the others had been promoting theanti-government campaign they call ``not one penny more''.   Authorities called it ``economic insurrection,'' and questionedhim for four hours before he was freed on Monday, he said.   The opposition is urging Panamanians to delay paying taxes andutility bills and to boycott the state-controlled lottery andgambling casinos.   The campaign aims to withold essential funds from the governmentrun by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Panama has already been badlyhurt by U.S. economic sanctions.   Former presidential candidate Guillermo Endara is in the 14thday of a hunger strike aimed at encouraging Panamanians to join thecampaign.   ``When the regime reacts in such an exaggerated way to anon-violent campaign, it is revealing the impact of the campaign,the weakness of the regime and its bad conscience,'' Arias said inDivisa, 150 miles west of Panama City.   He said the group was arrested Sunday by about 20 peoplecarrying AK-47 assault rifles and revolvers.   ``Physically, there was no mistreatment, but there waspsychological mistreatment,'' he said.   A statement by Endara said the opposition ``reiterates itspromise to keep fighting for the establishment of a democraticsystem of government and full respect for human rights by thepeaceful means we have been following, despite the escalation ofviolations and attacks from the dictatorial regime.''   Villalaz said four other opposition activists were detainedSunday in Chiriqui province, 240 miles west of Panama City and theDefense Forces said they remained jailed.   Arias was one of two opposition vice presidential candidates inMay 7 national elections the government annulled after returnsshowed the opposition winning by a landslide.   The United States imposed sanctions on Panama after Noriega wasindicted on U.S. drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges in1988. Noriega denies the charges.   The sanctions included witholding taxes owed to Panama for useof the canal and banning U.S. companies from doing business with alist of Panamanian individuals and enterprises.   Washington considers Endara and his running mates Panama'slegitimate leaders.   Noriega named his longtime friend, Francisco Rodriguez,provisional president on Sept. 1, the day the former president'sterm ended.</TEXT></DOC>
