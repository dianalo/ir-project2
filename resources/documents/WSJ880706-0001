Hughes </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><TEXT>   Women may be more likely to initiate a corporate kiss, but the corporate hug usually starts with a man.    Men rarely receive a surprise hug from another man in a business situation, unless the two are old friends. But some men are far less reserved when it comes to hugging female colleagues or subordinates. And the hugs can be abusive.    Honi M. Almond, vice president of business affairs at New World Television in Los Angeles, recalls attending one industry gathering and being suddenly hugged by a &quot;powerful&quot; business associate. &quot;It made me feel very uncomfortable,&quot; Ms. Almond says. &quot;There's a way of hugging, and there's a way of hugging. And that one was over the line. I had to push him back and laugh it off. . . . The next time I saw him, I stayed away.&quot;    Secretaries are also easy targets for a hug, especially in Hollywood. &quot;I've seen a writer walk into an office and pull a secretary up against him. She doesn't know what to do,&quot; says Charles Fries, chairman of Fries Entertainment Inc.    Like corporate kissing, corporate hugging is frowned on by etiquette experts. Elizabeth Post, granddaughter of Emily Post and an editor of her grandmother's books on etiquette, says hugging &quot;indicates affection, and I don't believe business is an appropriate place for that.&quot;    Nevertheless, the corporate man-to-man hug has long been considered acceptable between old friends. &quot;There's a thump-on-the-back hug greeting. It indicates a long history of give and take,&quot; says Alan Landsburg, chairman of Landsburg Co. in Los Angeles. But even those hugs don't always go smoothly. &quot;I will go to shake hands and wind up in a bear hug,&quot; Mr. Landsburg says. &quot;Occasionally, it's awkward.&quot;    Some high-powered female executives hug on a regular basis. Sherry Lansing, a self-described &quot;big hugger&quot; who co-owns Jaffe/Lansing Productions, says hugging &quot;makes me feel good. If I like the person, it's a way of breaking down the formality. A handshake seems too formal.&quot;    In some offices, hugging is as routine as a trip to the coffee machine. Kathleen Hughes, a public relations representative for BellSouth Corp. in Washington, says the executives in her office frequently exchange hugs. &quot;They come in and say, 'Hey,' and there's a big bear hug. All of a sudden you're grabbed.&quot; But being hugged doesn't bother her, she says. &quot;It's a friendly, happy outfit.&quot;    Special occasions can trigger collective corporate hugging. When Boston Beer Co. won an award for its beer, the entire staff hugged. &quot;We had obviously lost all control,&quot; says Jim Koch, founder and owner. &quot;It was a moment of happy delirium, and all normal conventions fell away.&quot;    But it made him feel odd. &quot;You have a businesslike relationship all year long. Then you win an award and it's OK to hug, but only for 60 seconds. Then it's back to business.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Kissing in the Workplace Poses Dilemma --- Kissers' Motives Often Doubted by Recipients&quot; -- WSJ July 6, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
