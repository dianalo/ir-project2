Speaking before the House telecommunications and financesubcommittee, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said the recentexperience of the Bank of New England, which was seized byfederal regulators earlier this year, raises questions aboutwhether risky trades in derivative securities -- such asswaps and foreign currencies -- pose a risk to the federaldeposit insurance system.</LP><TEXT>   During the months before its collapse, BNE was forced tounwind $30 billion in currency and interest-rate contracts.The problems encountered by the bank in getting out of thosecontracts have some regulators worried that the failure of alarge bank with heavy exposure to the derivative securitiesmarket could create a gridlock in the global banking system.   Mr. Breeden told the subcommittee that he sharesregulators' concerns, and questioned whether banks'participation in risky derivatives markets should be backedby federal deposit insurance. The experience of thesecurities industry shows that &quot;you can do {tradederivatives} without being an insured institution because allof the major securities firms do it,&quot; he said.   &quot;The difference is not that securities executives aresmarter than bankers, but at least people who make a mistakein the securities industry do it with their own money,&quot; Mr.Breeden said.   Mr. Breeden also commented that the BNE case illustratesthe difficulty in gauging banks' exposure to the derivativemarkets, since many of their trades never show up on theirbalance sheets. Because the transactions don't fit thetraditional definition of assets and liabilities, hybridtrades are often referred to as off-balance sheet activities.   Mr. Breeden said regulators encountered a similar problemwith off-balance sheet liabilities when securities firmDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc. went under. But he added that themarket-reform bill signed into law late last year gives theSEC the authority to &quot;get a better picture&quot; of brokeragefirms' exposure to derivative markets.   An official at a leading U.S. commercial bank counteredthat &quot;the ability to trade these instruments is essential tonormal banking activity.&quot; He added that derivativeinstruments are part of &quot;a basic banking function.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
