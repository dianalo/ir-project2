Alejandro Bendana, a Nicaraguan foreign ministry official andalso a guest on the show, said: ``They don't need guns at thispoint.''   The presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Ricaand Guatemala signed an agreement Aug. 7 calling for thedemobilization and disbanding of the Contra rebels by earlyDecember. The Contras, backed by the United States since 1981, havebeen fighting to oust the leftist Sandinista government inNicaragua.   The plan does not mention the mechanics for disarming therebels. It calls for an International Commission of Support andVerification to aid the Contras in resettling in their homeland ora third country. The Honduran government, which hosts the majorityof more than 10,000 combatants, has said the rebels must leavetheir base camps near the Nicaraguan border.   Calero cited his distrust for the Sandinista government and aMarch 1988 bilateral agreement for saying the rebels who return toNicaragua should carry their weapons, largely supplied by theUnited States. The 1988 accord, which never was put into placebecause of disagreements, would have allowed the Contra combatantsto hold on to their arms in special zones set up inside Nicaragua.   ``We have to realize the Sandinistas have lied, deceived, brokenpromises all along,'' Calero said.   Bendana said: ``The Contras can come back in. There is anamnesty in place. ... The point is they don't need guns at thispoint.''   Asked about Bendana's assurances, Calero smiled, saying: ``It'sa lie,'' and he called for the demobilization of the Sandinistaarmy, which stands at about 80,000-strong and is the largest inCentral America.   ``Contra commanders who are living in Miami condominiums reallydon't command that much respect from Contra foot soldiers,''Bendana said.   ``Why should any standing, legal government want to demobilizeits force to protect itself?'' he said when pushed on thedemobilization question. ``Once the war is over we want to go backto normalcy.''   Calero said the agreement by the Central American presidents wasa disappointment.   ``We feel that we've been let down by the United States and bythe Central American presidents who should know better,'' he said,adding the United States ``could have lobbied harder, they couldhave shown more support so that our forces would remain in placeuntil after the elections as the only guarantee for free electionsin Nicaragua.''   The Nicaraguan government has scheduled general elections forFebruary.   Bendana said his government would ``use every political, legal,and moral means at our disposal to try to persuade these people tocome in within the civic, within the legal arena.''   ``Let's slug it out on the radio stations and the newspapers,openly, in political rallies, by way of political platforms putbefore the Nicaraguan people so the Nicaraguan people and not theUnited States and not at the point of a gun, can decide what kindof government they want on February 25th, under internationalobservation,'' the Nicaraguan official added.   Some 50,000 Nicaraguans, many of them civilians, have beenkilled in the fighting in the rural northern mountains and centralplains.</TEXT></DOC>
