Austrac, which is owned 14.8% by the Australian manufacturer BTR Nylex Ltd. and 85.2% by a company associated with businessman Richard Pratt, last week lifted its bid to 4.10 Australian dollars ($2.95) a share, or a total of 1.63 billion dollars ($1.17 billion), from four dollars a share, or 1.60 billion dollars. BTR Nylex is owned 60% by BTR PLC of Britain.    Two big ACI holders, AMP Society and Westfield Capital Corp., accepted the new bid, lifting Austrac's stake to 50.6%.    ACI's chairman, Brian Scott, said yesterday that the revised bid still isn't adequate. He said that the board will continue to seek a higher price, that ACI is looking for another bidder and that it is considering legal action against the Austrac bid.    ACI yesterday continued to trade below the offering price, closing at four dollars in Sydney. </TEXT></DOC>
