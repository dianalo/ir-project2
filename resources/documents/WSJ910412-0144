JesseHelms addressed the U.S. Senate. According to Sen. Helms, theNicaraguan government &quot;continues to repress its own people.&quot;Specifically, he claimed that former freedom fighterscontinue to be massacred and that political opponentscontinue to be intimidated, threatened, tortured and/orjailed without due process. He also suggested that our armycontinues to subvert its neighbors by shipping weapons toMarxist guerrillas elsewhere. Sen. Helms concluded thatPresident Violeta Chamorro &quot;lacks the ability, perhaps eventhe will, to wrest power away from her predecessors.&quot;   It makes me feel better to read that Sen. Helms hasapparently never met Mrs. Chamorro or even visited Nicaragua.This may explain many of his misperceptions about ourcountry, our reality, our economic and political goals, andour president, who will be arriving in the U.S. next week.</LP><TEXT>   In order to clear up these misperceptions, I feel it'snecessary to give to the American people a clear view of thecurrent conditions in Nicaragua, the policies we areundertaking to stimulate production, and the kind of societywe are building for the future.   When Mrs. Chamorro took office, we had suffered through 10years of civil war, during which the economy was ruined, tensof thousands of lives were lost, hundreds of thousands ofrefugees had fled the country, inflation had reachedworld-record proportions for more than two years, and ourforeign debt had become the largest per capita in the world.   All polls taken during the electoral campaign indicatedthat the people wanted to get rid of two overwhelmingproblems: the never-ending war, and the economic crisis.   Less than a year later, the war is over. More than 20,000Resistance fighters have been persuaded to disarm and becamefarmers. Their first harvest, red beans, is already in themarket. The army has been reduced from 80,000 to 28,000members, and continues to be reduced. Thousands of weaponshave been destroyed and buried in future peace parks. And1990 became known as the year of pacification for Nicaragua.   Nevertheless, the other looming problem remains: theeconomic crisis. We now are confronting the economic problemshead-on. Last month's 400% devaluation of our currency setthe stage for our decision to anchor our currency, thecordoba, to the dollar at realistic levels. In addition tostabilizing the currency, we are simultaneously addressingstructural reform. We are well advanced in the deregulationof what had been a &quot;command&quot; economy.   Private banks now can be established in Nicaragua; foreigntrade is free of government control; a comprehensiveprivatization law will be submitted to the national assemblyover the next few days; we have sharply reduced protectionisttariffs and steep marginal tax rates; and we have madesubstantial progress in solving the land concerns of thedifferent claimants in the rural areas, all of which willlead to the necessary existence of secure property rights inNicaragua.   In spite of such shocks, there has not been a singleviolent rally in the streets, a single bus destroyed, asingle supermarket robbed or a single protester jailed. Inspite of the strongly polarized society we had less than ayear ago, the reconciliation policy and the spirit that Mrs.Chamorro introduced in our society are already leading to thekind of benefits many other Latin American countries can onlydream of. 1991 is thus becoming the year of economicstabilization and structural reform for Nicaragua.   The response to our efforts from entrepreneurs -- bothlarge and small, domestic and foreign --  has beenoverwhelmingly positive. In spite of the initial recessionaryimpact of our stabilization measures, entrepreneurialactivity is picking up in Nicaragua. Substantial investmentsare being planned and realized in different areas of oureconomy. And our human capital, much of which had left thecountry during the 1980s, is beginning to come back.   Dozens of agricultural growers who had left the countryare returning and investing their own capital in the richland that once again will turn Nicaragua into thebread-basket of Central America. International names -- suchas Kodak and CocaCola -- that either had given up or beenforced out of Nicaragua are also returning. Private exportersonce again are operating, as export facilities are privatizedand more goods become available for exports. And there are 10applications to open private banks in Nicaragua.   We are confident that our constructive, growth-orientedreforms will succeed. But despite the initial positivereactions we have had, the economy will take time to rebuildfrom the devastation of the past decade. That is why we willneed substantial foreign resources over the next three years.At the present time, our greatest financial concern is toobtain the necessary support from the international communityto meet the $360 million in arrears we have with theInterAmerican Development Bank and the World Bank. Payment ofthose arrears is a necessary condition to obtain financialsupport from those institutions as well as from theInternational Monetary Fund for our stabilization andstructural reform programs.   In her own words, President Chamorro is committed to the&quot;establishment of . . . full democracy, directed towardsecuring the reconciliation of Nicaraguans -- based on theunity of the nation, oriented toward the common well-beingand service to the country -- above any political interest.&quot;And that is what she is doing.   I would like to have Sen. Helms come to Nicaragua. Hecould see with his own eyes former Resistance rebels who arenow active members of the former pro-Sandinista union;crippled ex-army boys playing basketball in their wheelchairswith crippled former Contras; or the marriages of formerContras to former militia members.   This miraculous transition to peaceful, productivedemocracy is why Mrs. Chamorro wants to address a jointmeeting of Congress during her visit to the U.S. -- so thatshe can express our gratitude for Congress's interest indemocracy in Nicaragua. And so Nicaraguans can say, throughMrs. Chamorro, how close we want to work with the U.S. andother countries in the construction of a new, better world.   ---   Mr. Lacayo is minister of the presidency of Nicaragua.</TEXT></DOC>
