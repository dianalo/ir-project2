Adoption of the measure Tuesday, increasing the current $101,250limit to $124,875, was a reversal by the lawmakers. Minutes earlier,they narrowly rejected a similar provision that would have raisedthe ceiling to just $118,000.   Democrats, with a sprinkling of Republican support, had sought toeliminate the price ceiling on mortgages, arguing that the movewould benefit borrowers living in the nation's priciest housingmarkets.   But sensing a campaign issue, Republicans said the Democraticproposal would mostly benefit well-to-do people and divert FHAresources away from poorer home buyers.   ``This is a classic case where my colleagues on the other sidetalk about the poor and the underclass and low-income and mediumincome, and are reaching out again to help the rich,'' said SenateMinority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.   The provision is part of a $67.2 billion measure financingfederal housing, veterans, space and environmental programs forfiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1.   By a 55-43 vote, the Senate rejected a Democratic attempt toscuttle the proposed $124,875 ceiling. The cap, which will last forone year, was then adopted on a voice vote.   ``I think people were knowledgeable that I was going to keepworking at it,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., who sponsored boththe $118,000 and $125,000 cap proposals and had threatened to keepintroducing amendments until one was adopted.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who fought for removing the capentirely, said afterward that his side was ``caught by surprise'' byNickles' repeated efforts.   That vote came after the chamber rejected, 50-49, to reject theproposal to raise the limit to $118,000.   Thirty-nine Republicans and 16 Democrats voted against blockingthe $124,875 ceiling proposal. Only 36 Republicans and 13 Democratshad supported the lower cap on the earlier vote.   Aides to Nickles estimated the $125,000 ceiling might stimulateabout $5 billion worth of additional home purchases. They saidmetropolitan areas where borrowers would be able to take advantageof the higher cap include Boston; New York City; Stamford, Conn.;Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles; San Francisco; and San Diego.   The Bush administration had opposed removing the FHA mortgagecap, arguing it would be unwise to do so without reforming thefiscally troubled agency.   Opponents of eliminating the cap entirely said that would exposethe government to huge losses from additional loan defaults. TheFHA's main insurance fund lost $452 million last year, according toa congressional report, as default payments outweighed collectedfees.   Congress was told last month by Comptroller General CharlesBowsher that FHA has ``very serious'' financial managementdifficulties.   Opponents also argued that removing the ceiling would in effectshift more of the FHA's resources from low-income to high-incomepeople and would be most beneficial to buyers in wealthy areas suchas New York and California.   ``If they ever want a fat-cat provision, this is it,'' said Sen.Jesse Helms, R-N.C.   Supporters of scrapping the $101,250 ceiling argued that it wouldmake more FHA loans available in many of the country's mostexpensive areas. In 18 states plus Washington, D.C., the median homeprice already exceeds that limit, according to the NationalAssociation of Home Builders.   More than 17 million families have used FHA insurance since theagency was founded in 1934.   Under the program, borrowers obtain their loans from banks, andthe loans in turn are guaranteed by the government. Because the bankis making a risk-free investment, it is able to offer better termsto borrowers.   The House version of the bill, passed July 20, did not containthe FHA provision.</TEXT></DOC>
