(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge ruled that 80 children held by amasked gunman last month at a private school will not have totestify at a preliminary hearing next week.   An attorney for James Harvey Jr., charged with 84 counts ofkidnapping in the daylong ordeal, had sought to subpoena the WestEnd Christian School pupils for Tuesday's preliminary hearing.   At a brief hearing Thursday, District Attorney Charles Freemanaccused defense attorney Michael Cornwell of trying to ``create acircus atmosphere.''   Cornwell said the prosecutor ``is trying to create a lynch-mobatmosphere.''   ``I think some people have concluded that Mr. Harvey is guiltyand all this is a waste of time,'' Cornwell said. ``Thelevision and readthe papers. Everybody knows he's guilty.''   Harvey is expected to be bound over to a Tuscaloosa County grandjury at next week's hearing.y saw him onte   Harvey and another man, both wearing ski masks, allegedlyentered the Tuscaloosa school Feb. 2 and took the 80 pupils andfour teachers hostage.   The other man, John Rhodes, gave up a few hours later andcharges eventually were dropped against him when authoritiesdetermined he had been tricked into the abduction.   Twelve hours after the ordeal began, Harvey laid down hisweapons and was arrested after watching a videotape of Gov. GuyHunt signing a phony pcouch-potato economy'' that will be marked by lowunemployment, more savings and rising productivity, economists andpopulation experts say.   The dawning of a couch-potato economy is the best thing thatcould happen to the United States after years of yuppie splurging,says Edward Yardeni, the economist who coined the term.   ``Yuppies are slowing down. We're all getting older, a littleless frivolous,'' Yardeni, 38, director of economics andfixed-income research for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., saidthis past week.   Exhibit No. 1 in Yardeni's case is the shift noted last year inconsumer-spending priorities after the go-go years of 1985 and 1986.   In 1985, the two fastest-growing segments were brokerage andinvestment fees and audio and video equipment.   In 1986, the leaders were boats and recreational vehicles.   In 1987, America seemed to turn suddenly sedentary. Books andmaps finished first, followed closely by funeral and burialexpenses.   The numbers from the Commerce Department may be misleadingbecause the biggest percentage risers are small segments thatfluctuate widely, but Yardeni is convinced that they tell a story.   ``I'm not promising you that the transformation definitelyhappened in '87,'' but something is afoot, Yardeni said.   He said the shift could point to an increased savings rate.``And that should leave room for a boom in exports and a boom incapital spending. Which is not a bad mix at all.''   One reason for Japan's extraordinary success is its high savingsrate, which creates a pool of money for investment.   Trailing behind the American baby boomers is the ``baby-bust''generation _ the smaller complement of workers that is entering thework force now.   There are too few qualified baby busters to fill all theentry-level jobs. But Yardeni optimistically sees a positive sideto that: It will force business to find ways to automate more, hesays, increasing the nation's productivity.   Yardeni's ideas are supported by others, including CherylRussell, editor-in-chief of American Demographics magazine inIthaca, N.Y.   As baby boomers settle down, they are beginning to put asidemoney for their children's education and their own retirement, Ms.Russell said.   But baby boomers will still be spending, too, something that isgood news for producers of consumer goods.   ``Baby boomers are entering their peak earnings years, so theywill be able to spend more and save more at the same time,'' Ms.Russell said.   In spite of the free-spending reputation of the young, Ms.Russell said, households headed by people aged 35 and over leadtheir juniors in every broad category of spending except two:alcohol and rented dwellings.   The mix of spending is what is changing. Couch potatoes spendless money on movie tickets, more on things like VCRs. And, ofcourse, couches.   The changing habits of the nation are more than a myth. TheRoper Organization last year reported a poll finding that more thanhalf of people over 30 prefer doing things at home, while more thanhalf of people under 30 prefer doing things outside the home.   The median age in the United States is rising, Ms. Russellnotes, and it has just passed 30.   ``Everyone's tired,'' said Thomas Miller, 30, editor of thePublic Pulse, a Roper newsletter. ``Some peole call it thecocooning phenomenon. Some people call it the couch-potato economy.We think it's mainly exhaustion.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
