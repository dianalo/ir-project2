Theparticipating republics would allow their constituents vast freedom inchoosing their own forms of government and in controlling their own wealth.;   Gorbachev said that in their negotiations Friday, including those on the nameof the new federation and the distribution of power, the participants had&quot;agreed on many issues,&quot; and that to resolve outstanding disputes, thecommittee &quot;is now going to work non-stop.&quot;;    Gorbachev and Yeltsin both saidthe new union treaty could be completed as early as June.;    April 23 accord; The Kremlin first began to make significant progress in uniting the fractiouscountry April 23, when Gorbachev reached an agreement with the leaders of nineof the 15 Soviet republics in which he promised them significantly greatersovereignty and control of their industrial and natural wealth.

They were carried out largely by &quot;black beret&quot; troops based inRiga, Latvia, and in Vilnius, Lithuania, who take orders from the SovietMinistry of Internal Affairs but increasingly resemble a vigilante force.;   At least 14 border posts have been hit, their premises ransacked or burned andtheir employees beaten and humiliated.
