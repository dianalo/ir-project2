Sikes once refused to subscribe to the Home Box Office and MTV cable-television channels because he didn't want to expose his two younger daughters to R-rated movies and suggestive music videos.    &quot;I don't think we can be valueless in our approach to broadcasting,&quot; explains Mr. Sikes, a soft-spoken man who chooses words carefully.    As the new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, he is moving quickly to exert influence on the issue of indecency in programming. Last week, he gave his staff the go-ahead to crack down on three radio stations that aired allegedly indecent material during daytime hours. The same day, his agency asked a federal appeals court to remand a case brought against the FCC by Action for Children's Television, a Cambridge, Mass., advocacy group -- to give the agency more time to beef up its arguments in support of a 24-hour-a-day ban on indecent broadcasts.    The one-two punch signals the new chairman's readiness to tangle with broadcasters on the indecency issue, even if it means stirring up the controversy over free speech. His actions also show a savvy approach to dealing with Capitol Hill: In his confirmation hearings earlier this summer, lawmakers focused much of their questioning on the topic of sex and violence on the airwaves.    Off Capitol Hill, the actions raised some red flags. &quot;He appears to be less of an ideologue than his predecessors,&quot; says Peggy Charren of Action for Children's Television. &quot;On the other hand, I wish he hadn't moved so quickly and so enthusiastically on indecency. It makes me nervous.&quot; For Gigi Sohn of Media Access Project, the swift move on indecency &quot;shows that the Sikes commission doesn't have its priorities in order.&quot;    Because limits on indecency are hard to pin down, Mr. Sikes suggests that broadcasters and cable operators voluntarily adopt standards. &quot;I think it would be good for people with great distribution power to sit down and think about what standards they want to apply,&quot; he says. &quot;I think it is very dangerous to expect government to act as the broadcaster or as the parent.&quot;    Before moving to Washington in 1986, the 49-year-old former head of the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration ran a broadcast-management and consulting company in his native Missouri. He also has been active in Republican politics and held several state posts in Missouri, including director of consumer affairs, regulation and licensing.    Mr. Sikes's policy views aren't exactly a secret. He spelled out many of them last year in the NTIA's 672-page report called Telecom 2000, largely a blueprint for deregulation with a goal of maintaining U.S. leadership in communications.    At NTIA, Mr. Sikes recommended freeing the seven regional Bell telephone companies from the grip of U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, who oversees enforcement of the consent decree that broke up the Bell System five years ago. He also advocates incentive regulation for the Baby Bells, linking profits with efficiency.    For the near term, Mr. Sikes says his top priority at the FCC is personnel. He already tapped NTIA aides Charles Schott and Ken Robinson for his personal staff, along with Cheryl Tritt from GTE Corp.'s Washington office. And he promoted FCC veteran Roy Stewart to head the agency's mass-media bureau, which regulates television, radio, cable and satellite broadcast systems. Robert Pettit, a partner at the Washington law firm of Wiley, Rein andamp; Fielding, was chosen to be general counsel. The selections indicate that Mr. Sikes isn't veering from the deregulatory path he took at NTIA.    The new chairman is also reviewing FCC staffing levels to determine whether more hiring or streamlined procedures would trim delays in processing various applications. But he says he needs a complete picture first.    Mr. Sikes takes a big-picture approach on the issues, too. For instance, he lumps several contentious proceedings together under the heading of video distribution.    &quot;Telephone companies want to do it. Broadcasters aren't altogether happy with cable, but they don't know whether they want the telephone companies to do it,&quot; he says. To that video-communications list he adds the infant direct-broadcast satellite business and the growing, aggressive wireless-cable business. He says he would like the commission to take a comprehensive approach, rather than examining the segments one by one.    Just how such a giant undertaking would move through the agency is unclear, but Mr. Sikes is already looking for a vehicle. The parameters of a study for Congress on the effects of cable deregulation haven't yet been set, and he suggests the study could be quite expansive.    Deregulation has landed his predecessors in plenty of hot water with Congress, and Mr. Sikes hopes to avoid that fate. Lawmakers have battled the agency over decisions to scrap the Fairness Doctrine --w hich requires broadcasters who air controversial programs to provide time for opposing viewpoints -- as well as over the agency's hands-off stance on many broadcast, cable and telephone matters.    For the past two years, the fighting has been so nasty that the Senate refused to approve nominees to fill vacancies at the five-member commission. The standoff ended last month with the simultaneous confirmations of Mr. Sikes, Washington lawyer Sherrie Marshall and Illinois regulator Andrew Barrett as commissioners.    Now Mr. Sikes expects those hard feelings to soften. He says his expectation comes mostly through &quot;insights from friendships&quot; with a number of influential lawmakers. He is particularly close to Missouri Sens. John Danforth, ranking Republican on the Commerce Committee, and Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Bond. He has campaigned for both men and was an assistant attorney general to then-Missouri Attorney General Danforth.    There is one proposal in NTIA's Telecom 2000 blueprint that Mr. Sikes might not want to follow, now that he has a new job. The report recommended that the executive branch, perhaps the NTIA itself, should determine the nation's communications policy, while the FCC should merely implement it. </TEXT></DOC>
