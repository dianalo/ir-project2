A company spokesman attributed the jump to an improved product line and the growing auto market in Europe.    GM-Europe's market share, however, declined for the first time in several years, to 11% from about 11.3% in 1985. The spokesman attributed the slip to GM's October introduction of the new Opel Omega/Vauxhall Carlton, which cut sales of the older models.    Europe has posed a continuing problem for GM, and the company has said it will trim employment in its passenger-car division there by 5% a year for the next two or three years. The unit, which had a loss of $372.1 million last year, has declined to give an earnings projection for 1986, but has said it will be profitable in 1987.    Ford Motor Co. said last week that it also expected record European car sales for 1986 -- up 6.1% to 1,336,000. </TEXT></DOC>
