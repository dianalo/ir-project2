In the quest to find uses for municipal solid waste,researchers recently have concentrated on using enzymes toconvert the biodegradable portion -- about 60% of the drymatter -- into clean-burning ethanol fuel. A group of TexasAandamp;M University researchers say they have found a way toincrease the fuel-conversion rate for this portion of wasteto 65% from 50%.   Their so-called ammoniafiber-explosion method involvessoaking the biodegradable mass in high-pressure liquidammonia for 30 minutes, then instantly releasing thepressure. Mark T. Holtzapple, one of the researchers, saysthis opens up the fibers, allowing enzymes to penetrate moredeeply and digest virtually all cellulose, the main componentof biodegradable matter. The cellulose is converted intoglucose, which is then turned into ethanol by yeast.   Mr. Holtzapple says the technique can be used on manybiodegradable waste items, including newspapers, papertowels, cereal boxes, paper bags and wax paper. He says thetreatment can yield 45 gallons of ethanol per ton of rawgarbage. Based on a national total of 180 million tons ofmunicipal solid waste a year, that could mean up to 8.1billion gallons of ethanol-equivalent to 6% of U.S. gasolineconsumption.                                                                                                          How to Influence   Some Tough Plastics                                                                                                          RESEARCHERS develop a technique to exploit hard-to-handleplastic molecules.   A class of highly heat-resistant polymers could be asuseful in their fashion as nylon, polyester and otherhigh-strength materials created in laboratories.   But like many other man-made polymers that never made itto the market, the high-temperature polymers, known asaromatic polyazomethines, have been difficult to manufacture.Their very heat-resistant properties require them either tobe heated to very high temperatures for processing orsoftened or dissolved by highly corrosive acid, bothprocesses that usually destroy the bonds that hold themolecules together.   A group of researchers at the University of Rochester saythey have solved the processing problem by adding galliumchloride or ferric chloride to the polymer. These chemicalsact as a wedge driven between the polymer chains, temporarilybreaking the forces that bind the molecules together andmaking the polymer dissolve in common solvents.   After the polymer is processed into desired shapes, it isimmersed in water or methanol, which washes out the galliumor ferric chloride, restoring the material's strength,stiffness and resistance to heat and chemicals.   Samson Jenekhe, an associate professor of chemicalengineering and one of the researchers, says aromaticpolyazomethines have been viewed for two decades as promisingpolymers that couldn't be processed. He says the wedgetechnique could make it possible to use the polymers infire-resistant clothing, airplane parts and, because of thepolymers' optical properties, electronics.                                                                                                          Wasp Venom Gives Clues   To Some Brain Traumas                                                                                                          WASP VENOM may hold the key to drugs to prevent braindamage from strokes, seizures, and Alzheimer's andParkinson's diseases.   The Egyptian digger wasp paralyzes honey bees and dragsthem to underground nests where the bees, still alive, serveas fresh food for wasp larvae. The bees are paralyzed becausethe venom binds to and clogs receptor molecules on cells inthe bee nervous system, blocking the transmission of neuralimpulses.   Researchers became interested in the venom because thereceptors to which it binds normally serve as docking sitesfor glutamic acid, a neurotransmitter in mammals and insects.Glutamic acid has its downside: In strokes, heart attacks andother traumas that deprive brain cells of oxygen, an excessof the acid destroys brain cells. Abnormalities of glutamicacid also are involved in neurological disorders such asAlzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.   Using the chemical structure of the digger wasp's venom asa model, Koji Nakanishi, a chemist at Columbia University,and his colleagues have synthesized a series of chemicalsthat bind to glutamic-acid receptors. The syntheticcompounds, tagged with radioactive tracers, are helping todefine the shape of nerve cells' glutamic-acid receptors,about which little has been known.   The resulting knowledge, says Dr. Nakanishi, &quot;offers thepossibility of developing drugs that could block the actionof the glutamic acid,&quot; thus preventing the brain damage ofstrokes and other oxygen-depriving traumas and revealingsecrets of other brain disorders.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          CHEMISTS at the University of California at Berkeley haveblended polymers and glass at near-molecular level. Theresult, they say, is a composite half the weight of glass,but far stronger and nearly indistinguishable in clarity andresistance to scratches and corrosion. . . . University ofIllinois researchers inserted an organic molecule into aninorganic chain, creating a stiff and strong yet flexiblematerial. Inorganic materials such as brick and cement arestrong, but crumble when compressed less than 1%; relativelyflexible organic materials such as wood and plastic burn ormelt at high temperatures. The researchers say they combinedthe best of each type by inserting a carbon atom at thecenter of a polymer. The polymer is as strong as &quot;the bestPortland cement,&quot; and the carbon lends it flexibility.</TEXT></DOC>
