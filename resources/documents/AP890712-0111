(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Television evangelist Rex Humbardtestified today that he once hitched a ride on a private jet withPTL executives, but did not know the trip was charged to DavidTaggart's personal credit card.   Humbard, a former PTL board member who has been a TV evangelistfor 36 years, said he did not know why Taggart charged the $3,899flight, which included a $200 tip, on his personal card and thensought reimbursement from PTL. The August 1985 flight was fromCharlotte to Florida.   David Taggart and his brother, James, are charged with failing topay $487,000 in income taxes from 1984 to 1987. Federal prosecutorssay the brothers, both former PTL officials, diverted $1.1 millionof ministry funds to their personal use by taking cash advances onPTL credit cards and using blank ministry checks to pay the creditcard bills.   Humbard, who said his ministry staff includes 15 family members,testified that he does not allow any expenditures over $10,000 thathave not been approved by the board of directors.   ``It's quite regimented, isn't it sir?'' federal prosecutor DavidBrown asked Humbard, whose ministry started in Akron, Ohio, and hasbeen headquartered in the resort town of Boca Raton, Fla., for thtsidethe budget withoutauthorization from the board of directors.''   On Tuesday, a former PTL financial officer testified that he didnot think he would get help from ministry founder Jim Bakker ingetting documentation explaining $200,000 in cash advances to DavidTaggart.   ``I had the distinct feeling I wouldn't get a lot of help,'' saidPeter Bailey, the ministry's former vice president for finance.   Bailey said David Taggart refused to submit documentation for thecash advances despite repeated requests.   ``He assured me he had the documents or he was working on thedocumentation,'' Bailey testified. ``David told me the receipts werebeing maintained on the third floor (the ministry's executiveoffices) for reasons of confidentiality.''   Bailey said PTL eventually had to write off the $215,578 inoutstanding cash advances David Taggart had accumulated by November1985.   ``As vice president of finance at PTL, why did you not demandthat David Taggart turn over his receipts?'' Brown asked.   ``We did the best we could. We tried to get the receipts on manyoccasions. We just couldn't do it,'' Bailey responded.   The brothers were indicted in December, the day that PTL founderBakker and his former top assistant Richard Dortch were indicted onmail and wire fraud charges. Bakker and Dortch face trial Aug. 28.   ``It was not uncommon for him to request a $10,000 cashadvance,'' Bailey said.   ``How, without the documentation, would you substantiate that themoney was spent on PTL business?'' Brown asked.   ``I had to take Mr. Taggart's word for it,'' Bailey responded.``He was my boss and I had no choice. But I had no reason not tobelieve him.''   Bailey testified that the only control he had over Taggart's useof ministry credit cards was the $100,000 credit limit imposed byMasterCard and Visa.   He also testified he once pledged a $75,000 certificate ofdeposit owned by PTL as collateral for a loan Taggart needed to buya $640,000 apartment in New York's Trump Tower.   But he said he did not recall signing a three-page statement fora mortgage on the apartment that incorrectly said Taggart waspresident of PTL and inflated his salary to $150,000 a year.   Taggart at the time was a vice president for administration andearned about $90,000, prosecutors said.   Bailey also testified that three blank checks were issued toDavid Taggart shortly before Bakker's resignation in March 1987. Hesaid the checks were used by the Taggarts to pay off their personalAmerican Express bills.   One check totaled $50,000, followed by one for $45,000 and athird for $30,000, Bailey testified.   A fourth check _ for $15,000 _ was written to American Expressabout three weeks before Bakker's resignation, he said.   The trial, which began last week, has outlined the expensiveshopping habits of the two brothers. Witnesses have testified thatbesides the New York apartment the brothers owned a $330,000 home inCharlotte and regularly purchased hundreds of thousands of dollarsworth of jewelry and designer clothes.   If convicted on the tax evasion charges, each could be sentencedto 25 years in prison and fined about $1 million.</TEXT></DOC>
