The foreign doctors are being brought in because Soviet doctorshave been unable to determine effective treatment for the patientsinjured in an April 9 clash.   At least 19 people were killed when troops stormed thedemonstration with gas, shovels and armored personnel carriers. A20th victim died when he was shot for violating a curfew imposed tocurb the unrest.   Izvestia, the government daily, said the Red Cross delegationwas expected to arrive in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, on Fridayto work with Georgian doctors at a hospital where the injureddemonstrators are being treated.   But activist Sergei Dandurov said in a telephone interview fromTbilisi that the delegation had not yet arrived.   Soviet authorities have said a gas known in the West as CS wasused in the demonstration. It is an incapacitating agent whoseeffects are similar to a nerve toxin.   Dozens of people suffering problems with their nervous system,vision, respiration and internal organs are still hospitalized, andsome have begun a hunger strike to press authorities to reveal moreabout the effects of the gas and appropriate treatment.   Human rights campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov traveled to Tbilision Thursday and told reporters he supports Red Cross help,according to Dandurov.   Sakharov is part of a team of newly elected members of the newSoviet parliament who are investigating the April 9 violence. He,historian Dmitry Likhachev and space scientist Roald Sagdeyevbelong to an independent investigating commission.   Izvestia said Sakharov and other commission members met Thursdaywith Georgia's health minister, and Dandurov said they visited theinjured in a hospital on Friday.   It is the second fact-finding trip Sakharov has made to anationalist hot spot in the Soviet Union. Last year, he visitedYerevan, Armenia, to help mediate a dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh,a part of neighboring Azerbaijan that Armenians claim is theirs.   In another development, about 1,000 Georgian women gatheredFriday night outside Government House, the site of the bloody April9 demonstration, to demand that authorities take stronger action totreat gas poisoning victims, Dandurov said. They also demanded thatauthorities free four Georgian activists arrested on charges oforganizing the protest.   Georgian party chief Givi Gumbaridze told the protesters thecourts would decide the fate of the arrested activists, accordingto Dandurov.   The women demonstrators then marched to a hospital where thevictims are being treated and raised nationalist flags on thebuilding's balconies, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
