FOKKER said it received an order for eight of its new F-50 turboprop aircraft from Malaysian Airline System.    The order is the cash-strapped Dutch aerospace group's first since the financial difficulties plaguing it this year came to a head about a month ago and resulted in a major financial overhaul. Under the overhaul, the Dutch government is taking a minority stake in the company in return for additional funding and a swap of state loans outstanding for equity.    Fokker didn't disclose the value of the order. But the basic 50-seat F-50 sells for about $10 million, giving the transaction an indicated value of more than $80 million.    The new F-50s will replace the Malaysian state airline's aging fleet of Fokker F27s, which the Dutch company stopped making last year.    The new plane order is a boost for Fokker, whose shares have fallen sharply this year following a cash squeeze caused by the changeover to new aircraft models, the F-50 and the 100-seat F-100 twinjet, from the F-27 and F-28 models.    Separately, the company confirmed that the government has decided to take a majority holding in its priority shares outstanding in addition to the large minority stake in the common stock. </TEXT></DOC>
