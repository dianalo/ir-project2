The prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of handicapcontained in the proposed regulation applied only to those Farm CreditAdministration programs and activities which are available to members ofthe general public. The proposed regulations also stated that the FarmCredit Administration did not have to take any action to accommodate individualswith handicaps if such action would result in a fundamental alterationin the nature of the program or activity or in undue financial and administrativecosts. The deadline for receiving comments on the proposed regulation wasFebruary 17, 1986. Five comments were received in response to the notice,three from organizations representing handicapped persons and two fromother Federal entities, the Department of Justice and the Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission (EEOC). In general, one commenter expressed disappointmentthat the agency proposed an adaptation of the prototype regulation preparedby the Department of Justice. The Board has determined that FCA's programsand activities do not require unique regulatory language and that theseregulations are, therefore, appropriate for FCA. The commenters objectedto the limitation of the application of the proposed regulations to onlythose programs and activities in which the general public participatesand to the use of the fundamental alteration and undue burdens defensesin areas which they argued are inappropriate. A complete analysis of thecomments and of the changes made to the proposed regulation is providedbelow.The Board has determined that these regulations are not a major rule withinthe meaning of Executive Order 12291, and therefore a regulatory impactanalysis has not been prepared. One commenter expressed the belief thatsmall entities should comply with the rule because of their substantialnumber and the fact that they do affect a considerable number of individuals.The Board notes that the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612)requires that an agency must undertake certain analyses of proposed ruleswhich may have an impact on small business entities and disclose the resultsof such analyses in its notice of proposed rulemaking. Because these regulationsregarding nondiscrimination on the basis of handicap are applicable solelyto the programs and activities of the Farm Credit Administration, the Boardhas again determined these regulations do not impact on small businessentities and are, therefore, not subject to the Regulatory FlexibilityAct.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis and Response to Comments</ITAG>Section 606.601 Purpose.This section describes the general purpose of the regulation which is toeffectuate section 119 of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, andDevelopmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978, which amended section 504of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, to prohibit discrimination on the basisof handicap in programs or activities conducted by Executive agencies orthe United States Postal Service. No comments were made to the regulationand it is unchanged.Section 606.602 Application.In the proposed regulation this section stated that Part 606 applies toall programs or activities conducted by the Farm Credit Administrationwhich are available to members of the general public but listed the ``programsand activities'' which constitute the ``programs and activities'' of theFCA for purposes of the regulation.One commenter to the regulation stated that the FCA erroneously excluded``the regulation, supervision, and examination of Farm Credit System institutions''from this regulation. The commenter believed that these FCA functions notonly constitute an FCA program or activity but also will likely involvecontact with the public, and that the regulation should be amended accordingly.In addition, it objected to the assertion in the regulation that the programsand activities listed therein constitute the sole ``programs and activitiesof the FCA,'' as being far too narrow. It recommended that the regulationbe amended to describe the list of ``programs and activities'' as illustrativeonly and not exhaustive. The proposed section also provides that the institutionsof the Farm Credit System (System), which are supervised, regulated, andexamined by the FCA, are not governed by this regulation. The commenteragreed with this provision in the regulation.The section has been modified in response to the comments received andnow states that this rule applies to all activities and programs conductedby the FCA. Since this rule will most likely apply to the programs andactivities which are open to the members of the general public, the finalregulation retains the list of such programs and activities that was containedin the proposed rule to provide notice to interested persons. However,the regulation has been amended to provide that the list contains examplesof such programs and activities of the FCA, and that an omission does notnecessarily mean that the activity is not covered. The FCA has added languageto paragraph (b) which specifically states that FCA personnel will complywith this part in their interaction with employees of System institutionsand employees of other Federal agencies during the discharge of their officialFCA duties. The exclusion from coverage of System institutions that areregulated or examined by the FCA remains unchanged except that the word``supervised'' has been deleted consistent with the Farm Credit AmendmentsAct of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-205).Section 606.603 Definitions.The regulation defines the significant terms used in Part 606. ``Auxiliaryaids'' is defined to mean services or devices that enable persons withimpaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills to have an equal opportunityto participate in and benefit from the agency's activities, and providesexamples of commonly used auxiliary aids. One commenter suggested thatattendant services should be added to the ``laundry list'' of auxiliaryaids appearing in the regulation. It was suggested that this would removeany confusion for those individuals required to comply with this regulation,since attendant services might be necessary to achieve program accessibility,even where all the requirements to accessibility have been met. Anothercommenter suggested that auxiliary aid should be expanded to include attendantservices needed to aid severely disabled persons traveling during the courseof their work. The FCA Board has declined to incorporate attendant servicesin the definition of ``auxiliary aids'' since such services are generallypersonal in nature and thus they are properly outside the scope of ``auxiliaryaids.'' Nevertheless, to the extent that attendant services are not personalin nature and are directly related to a program or activity of the FCA,such service may be provided when necessary. A wheelchair is considereda personal aid and has been excluded from this definition. However, FCAmay choose to provide wheelchairs on occasion as a special benefit. Thissame commenter also stated that the term ``auxiliary'' implies somethingthat is extra or discretionary and recommended that FCA change the sectionto ``Aids for Reasonable Accommodation.'' This suggestion has not beenadopted. The FCA Board believes the term ``reasonable accommodation'' isa term of art applicable to discrimination in employment under the RehabilitationAct. The use of the term in Part 606 would be inappropriate and confusing,since Part 606 covers more than employment programs and activities.One commenter suggested that the regulation should be amended to clarifythat auxiliary aids are required in all aspects of the FCA programs andto remove any ambiguity that the FCA has an obligation to make programsaccessible and overcome barriers that may not be related to communication.This suggestion has not been adopted as the FCA Board believes that theterm ``auxiliary aids'' adequately indicates what is intended and whatis required.``Complete Complaint'' is defined to include all the information necessaryto enable the agency to investigate the complaint. The definition is necessaryto enable the agency to determine the beginning of its obligations to investigatea complaint.``Facility'' is defined similar to that in the section 504 CoordinationRegulation for Federally Assisted Programs (28 CFR 41.3(f)), except thatcertain inapplicable phrases have been deleted and the phrase ``rollingstock or other conveyances'' has been added. The definition does, however,apply to all programs and activities conducted by the agency regardlessof whether the facility in which they are conducted is owned, leased, orused on some other basis by the agency. One commenter objected to the omissionof the phrase ``or interest in such property'' from the definition of ``facility.''As used in this regulation, the term ``facility'' refers to structures,and does not include intangible property rights. The phrase has been omittedbecause the requirement that a facility be accessible would have no meaningif applied to such things as a lease, life estate, mortgage, etc. Thisdefinition has not changed.``Individual with handicaps'' is defined identical to the definition of``handicapped person'' appearing in the section 504 Coordination Regulationfor Federally Assisted Programs (28 CFR 41.31). Although section 103(d)of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 changed the statutory term``handicapped individual'' to ``individual with handicaps,'' the legislativehistory of this amendment indicates that no substantive change was intended.Thus, although the term has been changed in this regulation to be consistentwith the statue as amended, the definition is unchanged. In particular,although the term as revised refers to ``handicaps'' in the plural, itdoes not exclude persons who have only one handicap.The definition of ``qualified individual with handicaps'' is the same asthe definition of ``qualified handicapped person'' with respect to servicesappearing in the section 504 Coordination Regulation for Federally AssistedPrograms (28 CFR 41.32(b)). The definition provides that a qualified individualwith handicaps is an individual with handicaps who meets the essentialeligibility requirements of participation in the program or activity. Onecommenter noted that the FCA had used the Department of Justice ``FederallyAssisted'' guidelines as a model for its definition for ``qualified handicappedindividual.'' But the commenter stated that the FCA had not addressed theextent to which the agency must provide aids or accommodations to ensurethat such person has equal opportunity to participate in and benefit fromthe program. The commenter questioned why the agency had omitted ``reasonableaccommodation'' from the language in the definition. The commenter referredFCA to the regulations of the Federal Election Commission and to the SupremeCourt decision in <T3>Alexander v. Choate</T3>, 469 U.S. 287 (1985) as support for its positionthat applicants for employment were to be provided reasonable accommodation.The FCA Board has determined that andSection; 606.640 adequately addressesthis commenter's concerns. However, the Board has amended the regulationto include a sentence that indicates that a qualified individual with handicapswith respect to employment is a qualified handicapped person as definedin 29 CFR 1613.702(f), which is made applicable to this part by andSection;606.640. The addition of this language does not change existing regulationsapplicable to employment.``Section 504'' means section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, asamended. This definition has not been changed except that a reference tothe 1986 Amendment has been added.One commenter on a technical matter stated that the numbering used by theagency is not consistent with proper <T4>Federal Register</T4> format. This has been corrected in the finalregulation. Section 606.610 Self-evaluation. The regulation provides that the agency shall conduct self-evaluation ofits compliance with section 504 within one year of the effective date ofthe regulation. The regulation has been changed to eliminate referencesto consultation but provides that the self-evaluation process shall includean opportunity for interested persons, including individuals with handicapsor organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participatein the self-evaluation process and the development of transition plansby submitting comments (both oral and written). One commenter welcomed the requirement that the agency maintain ``a listof the interested persons consulted'' in the performance of the self-evaluation.Experience has shown that self-evaluation is a valuable means of establishinga working relationship with individuals with handicaps that promotes botheffective and efficient implementation of section 504. This final rulehas been amended to utilize language that provides an opportunity for interestedpersons to participate in the process consistent with the Federal AdvisoryCommittee Act (5 U.S.C. app.). Section 606.611 Notice. The regulation requires the agency to disseminate sufficient informationto employees, applicants, participants, beneficiaries, and other interestedpersons to apprise them of rights and protections afforded by section 504.The regulation leaves to the agency the discretion to use whatever mannerthe agency finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections againstdiscrimination assured them by section 504 and this regulation. One commenter suggested that notification of the FCA policy regarding nondiscriminationshould also be included in the regulation and distributed in recruitmentmaterials as well as in general information. The commenter also suggestedthat the FCA should make available to the persons enumerated in the regulationinformation regarding the provisions of this part and its applicabilityto the programs and activities of the FCA. Another commenter suggestedthe FCA amend the regulation to provide that the information ``effectively''apprise persons of their rights and protections against discrimination.In this manner, the commenter believed the agency would be in a positionto test the methods it selected to accomplish the purposes of notification.The Board has not adopted these suggestions. In allowing the agency tohave the flexibility to determine the best method by which informationmay be conveyed to various interested parties, the agency is in the bestposition to specifically target its audience to fully inform such personsof their protections against discrimination. With respect to the suggestion of the inclusion of the term ``effectively''in the regulation, the Board believes this is already addressed in theregulation. The regulation provides that information shall be made availableto persons in the manner the agency finds necessary to apprise them oftheir rights. A method of communication that does not make this informationavailable in an accessible form to individuals with handicaps would notcomply with the regulation. The regulation has not been changed. Section 606.630 General prohibitions against discrimination. The regulation is an adaptation of the corresponding section of the section504 Coordination Regulation for Federally Assisted Programs (28 CFR 41.51).Paragraph (a) restates the nondiscrimination mandate of section 504. Theremaining paragraphs in the regulation establish the general principlesfor analyzing whether any particular action of the agency violates themandate. These principles serve as the analytical foundation for the remainingsections of the regulation. If the agency violates a provision in any ofthe subsequent sections, it will also violate one of the general prohibitionsfound here. Where there is no applicable subsequent provision, the generalprohibitions stated in this section apply. Paragraph (b) prohibits overt denials of equal treatment of individualswith handicaps. The agency may not refuse to provide an individual withhandicaps with an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from aprogram simply because the person is handicapped. The preamble to the proposedregulation states that such blatantly exclusionary practices often resultfrom the use of irrebuttable presumptions that absolutely exclude certainclasses of disabled persons from participation in programs or activitieswithout regard to an individual's actual ability to participate. Use ofan irrebuttable presumption is permissible only when in all cases a physicalcondition by its very nature would prevent an individual from meeting theessential eligibility requirements for participation in the activity inquestion. It would be permissible, therefore, to exclude without an individualevaluation all persons who are blind in both eyes from eligiblity for employmentas an operator of an agency vehicle; but it may not be permissible to disqualifyautomatically all those who are blind in just one eye. Two commenters objectedto the use of the irrebuttable presumption in applying the FCA regulations.One commenter believed such presumption is never justified, while the othercommenter noted that the mere possession of a handicap is not permissiblegrounds for assuming an inability to function in a particular context.While the Board agrees that such a presumption would be valid only in extremelynarrow circumstances, it does not agree that it may never be used. TheBoard believes that the agency may utilize the presumption in appropriatecircumstances. Paragraph (b) also prohibits the agency from directly, orthrough other arrangements, undertaking actions the purpose or effect ofwhich would be to discriminate against individuals with handicaps on thebasis of their handicap or defeat or substantially impair a program oractivity especially targeted at individuals with handicaps. Paragraph (c) provides that the exclusion of nonhandicapped persons fromthe programs specially targeted at individuals with handicaps or the exclusionof a specific class of individuals with handicaps from a program targetedat another class of individuals with handicaps is not prohibited by thispart. Paragraph (d) states that the agency shall conduct its programs and activitiesin the most integrated setting, appropriate to the needs of qualified individualswith handicaps.Two commenters objected to the FCA's omission of the section of the section504 Coordination Regulation for Federally Assisted Programs, which wouldhave prohibited the FCA from aiding or assisting an agency, organization,or person that discriminates on the basis of handicap in providing an aid,benefit, or service to the beneficiaries of the recipient's program. FCAdoes not provide such assistance and the Board has determined that includingsuch language in this regulation would be inappropriate.One commenter believed that the United States Supreme Court's decisionin <T3>Community Television of South California v. Gottfried, </T3>459 U.S.498 (1983), permits Federal agencies, through their rulemaking procedures,to impose upon prospective licensees or certified entities a duty not todiscriminate against individuals with handicaps. Section 504 does not,of itself, extend an agency's regulatory authority to the activities ofentities subject to its regulation. Contrary to the assertion of the commenter,<T3>Community Television </T3>does not support the exercise of such authority,as the focus of the decision is on the underlying regulatory statute. TheCourt does not indicate that section 504 itself could serve as a sourceof such regulatory authority. Neither the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended,nor any other statute provides the FCA with a clear grant of statutoryauthority to enforce section 504 against the Farm Credit System institutions.One commenter noted that construction of additional buildings at an existingsite should not be excluded from the coverage of this section. The Boardhas determined that such an inclusion would be redundant as andSection; 606.650addresses this issue.A Federal agency commenter suggested inclusion of provisions regardingparticipation of a qualified individual with handicaps as a member of aplanning or advisory board, and for not otherwise limiting a qualifiedindividual with handicaps in the enjoyment of some right or privilege givento others receiving aid, benefit, or service from the agency. These twosections were inadvertently omitted from the proposed regulation and havebeen incorporated in the final version.Section 606.640 Employment.Section 640 prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap in employmentby the agency. Courts have held that section 504, as amended in 1978, coversthe employment practices of Executive agencies. <T3>Gardner v. Morris, </T3>752 F.2d 1271, 1277 (8th Cir. 1985); <T3>Smith v. United States Postal Service, </T3>742 F.2d 257, 259-260 (6thCir. 1984); <T3>Prewitt v. United States Postal Service, </T3>662 F.2d 292, 302-04(5th Cir. 1981); <T3>Contra McGuiness v. United States Postal Service, </T3>744 F.2d 1318,1320-21 (7th Cir. 1984); <T3>Boyd v. United States Postal Service, </T3>752 F.2d 410, 413-14 (9thCir. 1985).Courts uniformly have held that in order to give effect to section 501of the Rehabilitation Act, which covers Federal employment, the administrativeprocedures of section 501 must be followed in processing complaints ofemployment discrimination under section 504. <T3>Smith, </T3>742 F.2d at 262; <T3>Prewitt, </T3>662 F.2d at 304.Accordingly, andSection; 606.640 of this rule adopts the definitions, requirements,and procedures of section 501 as established in regulations of the EEOCat 29 CFR Part 1613. In addition to this section, andSection; 606.670(b)specifies that the agency will use the existing EEOC procedures to resolveallegations of employment discrimination. Responsibility for coordinatingenforcement of Federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment isassigned to the EEOC by Executive Order 12067, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp. p. 206.Under this authority, the EEOC established Governmentwide standards onnondiscrimination in employment on the basis of handicap.Although one commenter argued that this section is too brief and weak andone commenter requested a list of examples of reasonable accommodations,the Board has adopted the EEOC's recommendation that to avoid duplicative,competing, or conflicting standards with respect to Federal employment,reference to the Governmentwide EEOC rules is sufficient. The final rulehas not been changed except that a reference to the EEOC has been added.Section 606.649 Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.This regulation states the general nondiscrimination principle underlyingthe program accessibility requirements of andSection;andSection; 606.650 and606.651. No comments were received to the regulation and the regulationis unchanged.Section 606.650 Program accessibility: Existing facilities.The proposed regulation adopts the program accessibility concept foundin the section 504 coordination regulation for programs or activities receivingFederal financial assistance (28 CFR 41.57), with certain modifications.Thus, andSection; 606.650 requires that each agency program or activity,when viewed in its entirety, be readily accessible to and usable by individualswith handicaps. The regulation also makes clear that the agency is notrequired to make each of its existing facilities accessible (andSection;606.650(a)(1)). However, andSection; 606.650, unlike 28 CFR 41.57, placesexplicit limits on the agency's obligation to ensure program accessibility(andSection; 606.650(a)(2)). The ``undue financial and administrative burdens''language found at andSection; 606.650(a)(2) is based on the Supreme Court'sstatement in <T3>Southeastern Community College v. Davis, </T3>442 U.S. 397 (1979),that section 504 does not require modifications that would result in ``unduefinancial and administrative burdens.'' 442 U.S. at 412.This interpretation is supported by the Supreme Court's decision in <T3>Alexander v. Choate, </T3>469 U.S. 287 (1985). <T3>Alexander </T3>involved a challenge to the State of Tennessee's reductionof inpatient hospital care coverage under Medicaid from 20 to 14 days peryear. Plaintiffs argued that this reduction violated section 504 becauseit had an adverse impact on handicapped persons. The Court assumed withoutdeciding that section 504 reaches at least some conduct that has an unjustifiabledisparate impact on handicapped people, but held that the reduction wasnot ``the sort of disparate impact'' discrimination that might be prohibitedby section 504 or its implementing regulation. <T3>Id. </T3>at 299. <T3>Alexander </T3>supports the position, based on <T3>Davis </T3>and earlier lower court decisions, that in some situations,certain accommodations may so alter an agency's program or activity, orentail such extensive costs and administrative burdens that the refusalto undertake the accommodations is not discriminatory. Two commenters objectedto the use of the fundamental alteration and undue financial and administrativeburdens language in the regulation. One commenter stated that the agencyis interpreting the <T3>Davis </T3>case too broadly. It suggested that the alteration and burdenslanguage be deleted, and that ``undue hardship'' be utilized as more specific,less discriminatory, and a more positive term than ``burden.'' The othercommenters stated that by adopting this language the FCA has failed toparallel rules for federally assisted programs, contrary to the intentof Congress. It believed the agency's interpretation of the <T3>Davis </T3>case is inaccurate. It criticized the case law cited bythe agency and stated that a number of more recent cases support the commenter'sposition.In the alternative, two commenters suggested that, should the regulationcontain the fundamental alteration and burdens language, the budget ofthe agency as a whole should be the standard for determining whether anaccommodation is burdensome. They believed that, without this approach,every accommodation is likely to be unduly burdensome, and that as allof the resources of the agency are taxpayers' monies, none may be usedto support discrimination. One commenter noted as support for its positionthat the Department of Labor adopted a similar regulation and suggestedthat the FCA pattern the regulation after the Department of Labor.The Supreme Court in <T3>Davis </T3>was not explicit in specifying what constitutes an ``undueburden.'' The Board notes that subsequent court decisions have not givenequal weight to each factor and have focused on the total impact the requestedmodification would have on the program or activity in question. See, e.g.,<T3>Alexander v. Choate, </T3>supra; <T3>Dopico v. Goldschmidt, </T3>518 F. Supp. 1161 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) rev'don other grounds, 687 F.2d (2d Cir. 1982), <T3>American Public Transit Assn. v. Lewis, </T3>655 F.2d 1272 (D.C. Cir.1981). However, the Board believes its interpretation of <T3>Davis </T3>is both proper and consistent with the lower courts' interpretationof <T3>Davis. </T3>The commenters cited no case law overturning <T3>Davis</T3> or other regulations which include the fundamental alterationor undue burdens language. The case law cited by the FCA remains valid.Accordingly, the Board rejects the suggestions of the commenters.For the record, the Board wishes to emphasize that the agency is not fundedby taxpayers' monies but rather the agency is funded by assessments onthe institutions of the Farm Credit System. An accommodation that resultsin an excessive financial burden on the agency, causing an increase inassessments to System institutions, could be challenged by those institutions.Accordingly, the Board believes that the fundamental alteration an undueburdens language is reasonable and necessary.The Board does not agree with the commenter's suggestion that the relevantinquiry is whether there would be an undue hardship based on the resourcesof the agency as a whole. Were the agency to consider the entire budget,diverting funds from one program to another could result in the agency'sbeing unable to carry out its statutorily mandated functions. The agencyhas a strong and vigorous commitment to section 504 and these regulations.The Board expects the agency to consider all reasonable approaches forproviding accommodations to individuals with handicaps and expects thatthe agency will assert the undue burdens defense only where it is clearthat no reasonable alternatives exist. The Board disagrees with the commenter'sassertion that every accommodation is likely to be defined as unduly burdensome.Section 606.650(b) sets forth the means by which program accessibilitymay be achieved and specifies that in choosing methods, the agency shallgive priority to those methods that provide the most integrated settingappropriate. In the interest of effective and cost efficient accommodations,the Board has adopted the suggestion of one commenter that the agency providean opportunity for the person to be accommodated to provide input regardingaccommodations to be made. Sections 606.650(a)(2) and 606.660(d) of theregulation have been amended accordingly. Another commenter suggested thatthe agency have wheelchairs on hand to accommodate disabled, elderly, orweary persons. It is the agency's policy to maintain the necessary auxiliaryaids to assist individuals with handicaps with whatever their disabilitymay require. However, wheelchairs are considered a personal aid and notan auxiliary aid as defined in this regulation. Therefore, FCA has no obligationto provide this benefit but may choose to do so as a special service.Paragraphs (c) and (d) establish time periods for complying with the accessibilityrequirements and state that aside from structural changes, all other necessarysteps to achieve compliance shall be taken within 60 days. Where structuralmodifications are required, they shall be made as soon as practicable,but in no event later than 3 years after the effective date of the regulation.Paragraph (d) of the regulation has been amended to provide an opportunityfor interested persons to participate consistent with the Federal AdvisoryCommittee Act (5 U.S.C. app.).Section 606.651 Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.Section 606.651 provides that those buildings that are constructed or alteredby, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed,or altered to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicapsin accordance with 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607. The proposed regulation adopts the existing Architectural Barriers Act(42 U.S.C. 4151-4157) standard for section 504 compliance, as applicableto agency buildings. As the buildings subject to this regulation wouldalso be subject to the Architectural Barriers Act, adopting this standardwill avoid duplicative and possibly inconsistent standards. However, existingbuildings leased by the agency after the effective date of the regulationare not required to meet the new construction standard. It should be noted,however, that the requirement of andSection; 606.650 do apply to such structures.Two commenters objected to excluding buildings leased by the FCA afterthe effective date of the regulation. One commenter stated that such buildingsleased after August 7, 1984, the effective date of the Uniform FederalAccessibility Standards, should be required to meet the new constructionstandards. The other commenter stated that the decision in <T3>Rose v. United States Postal Service, </T3>774 F.2d 1355 (9th Cir.1985) held that leased buildings are required to meet the new constructionstandard. In addition, the commenter suggested that the final regulationshould clarify the fact that leased buildings are require to comply withthe Architectural Barriers Act. It notes that such clarification has alreadybeen made by 18 other agencies and that FCA action on this matter willboth reflect and accepted practice and prevent confusion about the reachof the Architectural Barriers Act.In <T3>Rose v. United States Postal Service, </T3>the Ninth circuit held thatthe Architectural Barriers Act requires accessibility at the time of lease.The <T3>Rose </T3>court did not address the issue of whether section 504 likewiserequires accessibility as a condition of lease, and the case was remandedto the District Court for, among other things, consideration of that issue.The agency may provide more specific guidance on section 504 requirementsfor leased buildings after litigation is completed.Section 606.660 Communications.The regulation contains the standards by which the FCA will ensure effectivecommunication with participants in its programs and activities. One commentersuggested that the FCA add a provision to the regulation that would requirethe agency to provide captioning on its flims and vedeotapes. The Boardbelieves it is unnecessary to specify a particular manner of compliancewith the regulation and has rejected this suggestion. One commenter reiteratedits comments made to andSection; 606.650 regarding the use of the fundamentalalteration/undue burdens defenses by the FCA. For the reasons set forthin regard to andSection; 606.650, the Board believes the retention of thelanguage is appropriate and the regulation has not been changed.Section 606.670 Compliance proceduresThe regulation establishes a detailed complaint processing and review procedurefor resolving allegations of discrimination in FCA's programs and activitiesin violation of section 504. One commenter recommended expanding this sectionto include (1) a provision for obtaining the expertise of the ArchitecturalBarriers Compliance Board to help resolve deficiencies in constructionor location of facilities; (2) a provision for judical review; (3) a provisionto ensure that all other regulations, forms, and directives issued by theFCA are susperseded by the nondiscrimination requirements of this regulation;(4) a provision for the award of attorney's fees in administrative procedures;and (5) a provision for the availability of compensation to the prevailingparty. The Board has not adopted these suggestion as they go beyond therequirements of section 504. The Board believes the existing provisionsin the regulation fully protect the rights of individuals with handicapsand carry out both the letter and spirit of section 504.One commenter noted the FCA proposed rules failed to inform complainantsof the address to which complaints should be sent and recommended thisbe included in the final regulation. The regulation has been amended toinclude the address and to correct the title of the designated official.Another suggestion related to the language in paragraph (e) of the regulationwhich states that the agency shall make reasonable efforts in referringa complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction. The commenter statedthat FCA's obligation to refer these complaints is absolute and recommendedthe agency adopt language similar to that contained in the Federal ElectionCommission's final regulation. The Board has not adopted this suggestionbecause the agency may not always be able to refer a complaint, e.g., whenno Federal agency would have jurisdiction or insufficient information wasprovided.One commenter requested that the FCA amend the regulation to provide noticeto the complainant if a decision is made to dismiss the complaint withoutprejudice. The commenter also suggested that the FCA amend its regulationsto provide that a complainant is able to pursue a private right of actionin the courts without invoking the FCA's internal procedures, or afterpreliminary but not final findings have been issued by the FCA. The commenterwas concerned that the existence of an administrative hearing process mayresult in the waiver of an individual complainant's right to have his orher action heard in court.This commenter expressed concern that the regulation provide that any personbe allowed to file on behalf of an individual or class of persons whenthe complainant has been subjected to discrimination. It was pointed outthat this procedure may be necessary in the case of individuals with handicapsbecause, due to their disability, such persons may be unable to fully effectuatetheir rights. Having someone else file on their behalf would ensure thattheir rights are protected. The commenter also questioned the absence ofany statement regarding the availability of compensatory damages to a complainant.The commenter believed it is very difficult for an agency employee or anapplicant for benefits or services to successfully sue a Federal agency.It was argued that such compensatory relief would encourage agency compliancewith the regulations and would result in the agency responding in a moreexpeditious manner to those complaints than the agency might otherwise.It believed there is no reason why the ``make whole'' philosophy in allcompensatory relief situations should not apply to enforcement under theseregulations.With respect to the commenter's concern regarding the availability of acomplainant's right to obtain direct judicial relief, the Board notes thatthe Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 554-557, provides a Federalcourt jurisdiction to review an agency's final decision. It is beyond theBoard's jurisdiction to specify that a de novo review is available to complainantsseeking judical review of final agency decisions. This issue is for thecourts to decide. That is also true for the issue of availability of aprivate right of action, either without invoking FCA's compliance proceduresor after issuance of letters of findings.In response to the question of the commenter regarding who may file a complaint,the Board notes the definition of ``complete complaint'' and that the regulationprovides that the agency is required to accept and investigate all completecomplaints. The Board believes it is not necessary to amend the regulationin this regard. One commenter made the suggestion that the agency notifya complainant when a complaint is incomplete and provide an opportunityto remedy the defect. The Board believes that it is unnecessary to providefor this in the regulation as a rejection of the complaint as incompleteserves this purpose.In a technical suggestion, a Federal agency commenter suggested that wordingbe inserted in paragraph (b) to clarify that the regulations governingthe filing of employment-related complaints are those established by theEEOC.
