One settles part of the dispute over cruise missiles carried onairplanes, the other sets the stage for keeping track of elusivemobile missiles.   The two weapons would be part of a Strategic Arms ReductionTreaty (START) to reduce overall U.S. and Soviet strategic arsenalsby 30 to 50 percent. How to verify that no weapons were hidden andretained is one of the hard-to-resolve issues still on the table.   The ``substantial additional common ground'' cited in a windupsummit communique included counting all existing long-rangeair-launched cruise missiles as nuclear weapons and distinguishingbetween bombers that carry them and those that do not.   On mobile missiles, the two sides agreed to restrict them todesignated territories so they could be counted more easily. Butthe dimensions of the areas were not set.   Edward L. Rowny, the senior U.S. arms control adviser, saidthere was a ``lot of room'' before the issues are completelysettled.   And he said ``we didn`t get anywhere'' on two other problems _monitoring cruise missiles aboard warships and persuading theSoviets that the U.S. anti-missile research program can be squaredwith the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.   ``I would hope that before the year is out that we couldeliminate the differences that still exist,'' Reagan said, althoughthere seemed little prospect for any imminent breakthrough.   Gorbachev told reporters ``it is still possible to sign anagreement in this administration.'' Reagan said, ``Conversationsare still going on and they are still being discussed and I sayprogress is still being made or we wouldn't be talking as we are.''   He has less than eight months remaining in office. And he toldGorbachev at the outset of their talks that the U.S. StrategicDefense Initiative was not on the bargaining table.   Besides modest progress on START, the two leaders inched aheadon other arms control issues.   They exchanged ratification protocols for the IntermediateNuclear Force pact to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles,which was signed at the Washington summit last December.   During the summit, Gorbachev and Reagan also signed two lesserarms control agreements, one requiring at least 24 hours' advancenotification before ballistic missile tests and another to tightenverification procedures for a 1974 treaty limiting nuclear tests to150 kilotons.   On the START treaties, U.S. officials said they had restatedopposition to deployment of Soviet SS-24 and SS-25 missiles.   ``It is the position of the United States that such missilesshould be banned unless the United States and the Soviet Union canreach agreement on provisions which provide for effectiveverification and strict numerical limits on the number of nuclearweapons carried by such missiles,'' U.S. officials said in abriefing paper for reporters.</TEXT></DOC>
