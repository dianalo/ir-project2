The proposal wouldhave (1) required disclosures to be given at the time an application formis provided to the consumer (or before the consumer pays a nonrefundablefee, if that occurs earlier); (2) required that the disclosures be segregatedfrom other information; and (3) increased the number of required disclosures.Subsequently, the Home Equity Loan Consumer Protection Act was enactedon November 23, 1988 (Pub. L. No. 100-709). The law superseded the Board'sproposal. While both the Board's 1987 proposal and the statute addressmany of the same disclosure and advertising issues, the statute also placessubstantive limitations on how home equity plans operate.The statute, which requires the Board to issue regulations, provides thatthe statutory provisions and rules adopted by the Board shall apply toopen-end credit plans entered into five months after the promulgation offinal regulations. The Board is proposing amendments for comment, and expectsto adopt final regulations in May 1989. Compliance with the law would bemandatory around October 1989.Under Truth in Lending and Regulation Z, creditors offering open-end creditare currently required to provide consumers with a limited amount of informationprior to the first transaction under the plan. The disclosures must reflectthe features of the specific plan. Creditors must disclose the informationclearly and conspicuously, but are permitted to integrate the disclosuresinto the contractual agreement.The statute and proposed amendments to the regulation leave in place theexisting disclosure requirements. They would add, however, two requirementsto this framework. First, as is the case for closed-end adjustable-ratemortgages that are secured by the consumer's principal dwelling and havea term over one year (see andSection; 226.19(b) of Regulation Z), creditorsgenerally would be required to provide detailed disclosures about theirhome equity plans when an application is provided to the consumer. Second,creditors would be required to provide the information again, along withthe current disclosures, prior to the first transaction under the plan.The Board is publishing proposed sample disclosure forms to assist creditorsin preparing their plan disclosures. The Board expects to publish alongwith the final regulation tables of values for commonly used indices forhome equity plans.<ITAG tagnum="84">(2) Proposed Amendments to Regulation Z</ITAG>The Home Equity Loan Consumer Protection Act is quite detailed and, forthe most part, the proposed amendments mirror the statutory requirements.The proposed amendments to Regulation Z would incorporate the disclosureprovisions into a new andSection; 226.5b of the regulation and into existingandSection; 226.6. (A new andSection; 226.5a has been proposed recently bythe Board to implement the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act.See 53 FR 51785, December 23, 1988.) Modifications would be made to theadvertising rules contained in andSection; 226.16, and technical amendmentswould be made to andSection;andSection; 226.1 and 226.5.(i) CoverageThe proposed amendments to Regulation Z would apply to all open-end creditplans secured by the consumer's dwelling, as set forth in andSection; 226.5b.Thus, the rules apply not only to plans secured by the consumer's principaldwelling, but also to those secured by second or vacation homes.(ii) Format of DisclosuresUnlike existing Truth in Lending requirements for closed-end and othertypes of open-end credit, the proposed amendments would not require thatthe disclosures provided at the time of application be in a form the consumercan keep. (See footnote 8 accompanying andSection; 226.5(a).) Thus, underthe proposal, although the disclosures would have to be in writing, creditorswould be permitted to place the first set of disclosures on the applicationform the consumer returns to the creditor to apply for the plan.Section 226.5b(a) of the proposal would require most of the disclosuresto be grouped together and ``segregated'' from unrelated information providedto the consumer in connection with the application. The brochure and thevariable rate information could be provided either separately from or withthe other disclosures. Under the proposal, greater flexibility would bepermitted in complying with the segregation standard than currently existsfor closed-end credit. Disclosures for home equity plans tend to be lessconcise and more narrative in form than those for closed-end credit. Therefore,the Board proposes to apply a more liberal standard that would permit informationthat explains or expands on the required disclosures to be included. Informationon other aspects of the plan that is not related to the required disclosures,such as underwriting criteria, however, would not be permitted to be interspersedwith the disclosures. Such information, of course, could be provided aslong as it is separated from the required disclosures.The segregation standard would not apply to the second set of disclosuresprovided by the creditor prior to the first transaction under the plan.The additional disclosures would be given with the information currentlyrequired under Regulation Z, which is not required to be segregated fromother information. These disclosures could be combined and could be integratedinto the contract. Like the disclosures currently required, the additionaldisclosures would have to be in a form the consumer can keep.In the first set of disclosures, andSection; 226.5 (a)(2) of the proposalprovides that certain items would be further highlighted by requiring themto precede the other disclosures. Consumers would be notified that (1)they should keep a copy of the disclosures; (2) they have a right to obtaina refund of fees if any terms change and they decide not to enter intothe contract as a result; (3) they risk the loss of the dwelling in theevent of default; and (4) a creditor may terminate a plan or suspend futureadvances under certain circumstances.Creditors would state all aspects of their plans in the first set of disclosures.For example, if a creditor offers several payment options, all optionswould have to be set forth. Furthermore, if any aspects of a plan are linkedtogether_for example, if the consumer can obtain only certain payment optionsin conjunction with plans of certain lengths_the creditor must clearlydisclose the relation among those plan features. As an alternative to thecombined disclosure method, the Board proposes to permit creditors to createseparate disclosure documents where features may vary. Creditors pursuingthis latter alternative would have to include a statement in the earlydisclosures that the consumer should ``ask about'' the creditor's otherhome equity programs. Creditors would have to provide disclosures in responseto any such request.(iii) Timing of DisclosuresSection 226.5b(b) would require the disclosures and a brochure to be givento consumers at the time an application is provided. In the case of applicationscontained in magazines or taken by telephone or through third parties,footnote 10a would allow the creditor to mail or deliver the disclosuresand brochure to the consumer within three business days of receipt of theapplication.In addition to providing these disclosures early in the application process,the statute and andSection; 226.6(e) would require creditors to provide allof the disclosures again along with the disclosures currently requiredfor open-end credit, to the extent they are not duplicative. Creditorsalso would disclose a list of the conditions that permit the creditor toterminate the plan, freeze or reduce the credit limit, and implement modificationsto the original terms. (This requirement could be met by providing a separatelist or by identifying the provisions in the contract which contain suchconditions.) The disclosures would be provided prior to the first transactionunder the plan, in accordance with the existing rule in andSection; 226.5(b).(See the discussion below concerning the specific requirements for thissecond set of disclosures.)(iv) Duties of Third PartiesIn addition to requiring creditors to provide disclosures to consumersat an earlier time, andSection; 226.5b(c) of the proposed amendments alsowould impose a duty on third parties who provide applications to consumers.The statute requires that a third party, such as a loan broker, that providesa consumer with an application also must give a brochure and disclosures.The statute recognizes, however, that in some circumstances third partiesmay not be able to provide disclosures since specific information aboutthe plan terms may be unavailable.The Board believes that requiring both a third party and a creditor toprovide the consumer with identical information about the same plan mayresult in unnecessary duplication. Under andSection; 226.5b(c) of the proposal,therefore, a third party would be required to provide disclosures onlyif that party has the disclosures for a creditor's particular home equityplan in its possession. Third parties would not have an affirmative dutyto obtain such disclosures about a creditor's programs, or to create aset of disclosures based on what the third party knows about a creditor'sprogram. If, however, a creditor supplies disclosures to a third partyalong with its application form, the third party would have to give theconsumer the disclosures. In all cases, consumers will be provided disclosuresby the creditor within three days after the creditor receives the application.While consumer shopping might be enhanced if third parties provided thedisclosures at the earlier time, consumers will still be able to shop forcredit since neither a creditor nor any other party is permitted to collecta nonrefundable fee until three days after disclosures have been receivedby the consumer.Although the duty of third parties to provide the disclosures may ariseinfrequently, the proposal would require third parties to give the homeequity brochure at the time an application is given to the consumer. Becauseproviding the brochure is not linked to the availability of informationfrom a creditor about its specific plan, the Board believes third partieswould have access to the brochure, and, thus, be able to provide it withthe application. (See the discussion below concerning the responsibilityof the creditor if the third party has already given the consumer a brochure.)(v) Content of DisclosuresSection 226.5b(d) of the proposal lists the information that would be givento consumers when they apply for home equity plans. As is the case withexisting Truth in Lending disclosure rules, the information would be providedonly to the extent applicable; thus, for example, if negative amortizationcannot occur in a program, no mention of it need be made. Because the disclosuresneed not be in a form the consumer can keep, the consumer would be advisedto retain a copy of the disclosures. Creditors would include a statementof any time by which an application must be submitted to obtain specificterms disclosed. If creditors choose not to ``guarantee'' all or some ofthe terms, they would provide a statement of the terms that may changeprior to opening the plan. Creditors also would have to notify the consumerof the right to refund of all fees paid in connection with the applicationif any disclosed terms (other than a variable rate) change prior to openingthe plan, and as a result the consumer chooses not to enter into the plan.Creditors would have to disclose the fact that a security interest is beingtaken in the consumer's dwelling and that the consumer may lose the homein the event of default. <ITAG tagnum="81">(A) Possible Actions by Creditor</ITAG>Under andSection; 226.5b(d)(4) of the proposal, a statement must be providedthat, under certain circumstances, a creditor may terminate the plan andaccelerate any outstanding balance, prohibit additional advances or reducethe credit limit or, as set forth in the initial agreement, implement modificationsto the original terms. In light of andSection; 226.5b(f)(3)(i) of the proposal,which would permit such modifications if they are explicitly provided forin the contract, the Board is proposing to add this last condition to thedisclosure. A creditor would be required to state if fees may be imposedif the account is terminated. Consumers would be notified that they canreceive, upon request, a list of the conditions that permit the creditorto terminate the plan, prohibit additional advances or reduce the creditlimit, and implement modifications during the term of the plan. Upon receivinga request from a consumer, creditors would be required to provide thisinformation in writing in a form the consumer can keep. (See andSection;226.5b(g) of the proposal.)Although the statute calls only for a disclosure of the right to receiveupon request the list of conditions, the Board proposes in andSection; 226.5b(d)(4)(iii)to permit creditors to provide the actual list with the early disclosuresin lieu of that statement. The Board believes this flexibility may helpconsumers compare home equity lines, and may assist creditors by reducingthe circumstances in which consumers will request that this informationbe provided. Creditors would be permitted to provide this list with thesegregated disclosures or apart from those disclosures. Section 226.6(e)would provide that the list of these conditions also would have to be givenwith the disclosures currently required for open-end credit. (This requirementcould be met by identifying the provisions in the contract which containsuch conditions.)<ITAG tagnum="81">(B) Payment Terms </ITAG>Under andSection; 226.5b(d)(5) of the proposal, creditors would be requiredto describe the payment terms of the plan, including the length of thedraw period and any repayment period. (The combined length of the drawperiod and any repayment period would not have to be stated.) If the termsare indefinite, creditors would state that fact. All payment options underthe plan would be stated, including any different payment terms that mayexist during the draw period or during any repayment period, as well asany differences that may apply within either period. If the plan permitsthe consumer to convert any of the loan balance to a fixed term loan, thisinformation would be provided in the disclosures. How the minimum periodicpayment is determined, the frequency of payments, and whether making onlythe minimum payments would not repay any or all of the principal balanceduring the draw and repayment periods would be set forth. The proposedregulation also calls for a disclosure if a balloon payment is requiredunder the plan_to give consumers an accurate picture of their payment obligations.An explanation of the balance computation method would not have to be provided.Creditors would disclose an example, based on an assumed $10,000 outstandingbalance and a recent annual percentage rate (APR), showing the minimumperiodic payment and any balloon payment, and the time it would take topay off the balance if the consumer made only those payments. Footnote10c of the proposal would provide that, for fixed rate plans, a recentAPR is one that has been in effect under the plan within the twelve monthsprior to the date the disclosures are provided to the consumer. For variablerate plans, a recent APR would be the most recent rate provided in thehistorical table, or a more recent rate. <ITAG tagnum="81">(C) Annual Percentage Rate</ITAG>Section 226.5b(d)(6) of the proposal provides that, for fixed-rate plans,a recent APR would have to be provided. Consumers would be told that theAPR does not include costs other than interest. <ITAG tagnum="81">(D) Fees Imposed By the Creditor and By Third Parties </ITAG>Under andSection; 226.5b(d)(7) of the proposal, creditors would have to providea description and the amount of charges required to open and use the accountand a statement of when the consumer must pay the charges. These chargescould be stated as an estimated dollar amount for each fee, or as a percentageof a hypothetical amount of credit. These fees include application fees,points, annual fees, and transaction fees. Under andSection; 226.5b(d)(8)of the proposal, an estimate of fees imposed by third parties stated asa single dollar amount or a range (and a statement that the consumer mayrequest more specific information about such fees from the creditor) alsowould be provided. <ITAG tagnum="81">(E) Other Provisions </ITAG>Under andSection; 226.5b(d)(9), a statement if the plan has a negative amortization_whichwill reduce the consumer's equity in the dwelling_most be provided. Section226.5b(d)(10) would require creditors to state any limitations on the numberof extensions or amount of credit that can be obtained during any timeperiod and any minimum draw or minimum outstanding balance requirementstated as dollar amount or as a percentage. Section 226.5(d)(11) wouldrequire that consumers be told to consult a tax advisor regarding the deductibilityof interest and charges under the plan. (vi) Variable-Rate DisclosuresSection 226.5b(d)(12) of the proposal would require creditors to provideinformation about the variable-rate feature contained in a plan. Many ofthese disclosures closely parallel the disclosures currently required forclosed-end variable-rate transactions secured by a consumer's principaldwelling. The Board is proposing to add a few additional variable-ratedisclosures to those required by the statute. These minor additions wouldhelp make the home equity rules and the rules for closed-end ARMs moreuniform, and thus make compliance easier for creditors. Furthermore, theseadditional disclosures would provide consumers with more complete informationabout the variable-rate feature of home equity lines. <ITAG tagnum="81">(A) Index and APR</ITAG>Creditors would be required to state that the APR may change and that thepayment or term may change due to the fact that the APR is variable. Thefrequency of changes in the APR would be provided. Creditors would haveto identify the index used to determine rate adjustments and a source ofinformation about the index. Creditors would have to describe how the correspondingAPR will be determined (for example, by stating that a margin is addedto the index value). If the initial rate is discounted, a disclosure ofthat fact as well as the disclosure forms could be preprinted and rateinformation may not be accurate, consumers would be told to ``ask about''the current index value, margin, and APR. Rules relating to changes inthe index value and resulting changes in the APR would be set forth. Thisprovision would require an explanation, for example, of a preferred-rateprovision, where the rate will increase upon the occurrence of some event,such as an employee leaving the creditor's employ. Similarly, an explanationwould have to be given if the plan permits the consumer to convert froma variable rate plan to a fixed rate.<ITAG tagnum="81">(B) Rate and Payment Limitations</ITAG>Any annual rate caps must be stated and, if there are no such limits, thatfact must be stated. The maximum rate that may be imposed under each paymentoption under the plan also would be provided. This rate could be statedas a specific rate (for example, 18%), or as a percentage above an initialrate (for example, 5% above the initial rate). In either circumstance creditorscould use a range in expressing the maximum rate in the early disclosures.In addition, creditors would have to show, if the maximum rate were ineffect, the minimum periodic payment based on a $10,000 outstanding balance.(If a range is used, the highest rate in the range should be used for thisdisclosure.) Finally, any payment limitations would be provided.<ITAG tagnum="81">(C) Historical Table</ITAG>A 15-year historical table, based on an assumed $10,000 extension of creditand showing how the APRs and payments would have been affected by the indexvalue changes under the plan, would be provided. If the values for an indexhave not been available for 15 years, creditors would need only go backas far as the values have been available in giving the history and maystart the example at the year for which values are first available. Thehistory would reflect the method of choosing values for each plan. Forinstance, if an average of index values is used, averages would be usedin the history, but if a single index value is used, a single index valuewould be shown. The creditor would assume one date within a year (or oneperiod, if an average is used) on which to base the history of index valuesfor each loan plan. The creditor could choose to use index values as ofany date or period as long as the index value as of this date or periodis used for each year in the index history. Only one index value per yearneed be shown, even if the plan provides for adjustments to the APR orpayment more than once a year. In such cases, the creditor would assumethat the index rate remained constant for the full year for the purposeof calculating the annual percentage rate and payment. Updating will benecessary only once each year to reflect the most recent year's index value.To assist creditors in constructing histories of certain common indices,the Board expects to include tables of index values when the final ruleis published. In its final regulation, the Board expects to publish rateinformation for the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal, theaverage prime rate published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, and UnitedStates Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturities of 90 days and6 months. The Board requests that commenters provide the names of any otherindices for which it would be useful to have rate histories.The payment figures in the example must reflect all significant loan programterms. For example, features such as rate and payment caps, a discountedAPR, negative amortization, and interest carryover would be taken intoaccount by creditors in calculating the payment figures. One payment peryear would be shown in the table, even though payments may vary duringa year. (The calculations, however, should be based on the actual paymentcomputation formula.) Balloon payments need not be reflected in the table.Because disclosures will be given early, creditors would need to assumea value for the margin in order to do the calculations for the example.Creditors would select a margin that they used during the preceding sixmonths and disclose on the form that the margin is one that they have usedrecently. The margin selected may be used until a creditor updates thedisclosure form to reflect the most recent 15 years of index values. Similarly,if the home equity plan has a discounted initial rate, creditors also willbe permitted to assume an amount by which the initial rate will be discounted_whichis representative of the amount of a discount used by the creditor duringthe preceding six months_and disclose on the form that the initial ratehas been discounted.In setting forth payment information, both the draw and any repayment periodwould be illustrated in the table. In providing this information, creditorswould assume that the $10,000 balance is reduced according to the termsof the plan. To minimize compliance costs, the Board proposes to permitthe use of a representative term within a range of a five-year period insetting forth the draw and repayment information in the table. For example,if a creditor offers plans with a five-year draw period, and repaymentperiods ranging from six to fifteen years, the creditor would use the actuallength of the draw period. In figuring the repayment period for the table,the creditor could use any term from six to ten years (for example, eightyears), and any term from eleven to fifteen years (for example, thirteenyears). If different payment options are available during either period,payments under each option would have to be shown.<ITAG tagnum="81">(D) Other Information</ITAG>Consumers would be informed that rate information will be provided withthe periodic statement.Sample home equity disclosure forms that show how the proposed requirementsmight be met are provided in proposed Appendix G.(vii) Later DisclosuresAs discussed earlier, andSection; 226.6(e) would require creditors to providethe disclosures set forth in andSection; 226.5b(d) a second time along withthe disclosures would be provided prior to the first transaction underthe plan, in accordance with the existing rule in andSection; 226.5(b), andcould be integrated into the contract.<ITAG tagnum="81">(A) Duplicative Information</ITAG>Information that duplicates the current disclosures need not be provided.For example, because andSection; 226.6(a)(4) and (b) require the disclosureof any finance and ``other'' charges, respectively, creditors would nothave to disclose fees imposed by the creditor (see proposed andSection; 226.(d)(7))or fees imposed by third parties (see proposed andSection; 226.5b(d)(8)).<ITAG tagnum="81">(B) Inapplicable Information</ITAG>Creditors need not provide information that is inapplicable. For example,because andSection; 226.5(a)(1) requires that the disclosures be in a formthe consumer may keep, creditors would not make the statement in proposedandSection; 226.5b(d)(1) that consumers should make a copy of the disclosures.Similarly, because proposed andSection; 226.6(e)(2) would require creditorsto disclose the conditions under which the creditor may, for example, terminatethe plan and require payment of the outstanding balance in full in a singlepayment upon termination, creditors need not disclose that the consumermay receive, upon request, this information, as required by proposed andSection;226.5b(d)(4).<ITAG tagnum="81">(C) Current Information</ITAG>Creditors would be required to provide current information about aspectsof the plan that may vary among consumers. For example, if the creditoroffers a variety of payment options and the consumer chooses one option(and the others are unavailable), the specific payment terms selected wouldhave to be disclosed. Similarly, if the first set of disclosures statedthe maximum APR that could be imposed (for variable-rate plans) as a range,the later disclosures would have to reflect the specific rate cap.<ITAG tagnum="81">(D) Historical Information</ITAG>Creditors could provide the same historical information about the programthat was given in the first set of disclosures. For example, the historicaltable provided in the earlier disclosures would not have to be modifiedfor the later disclosures to reflect more recent margins or discounts,since the table is intended to show historical rate fluctuations and theireffects on payments (and need only be updated once a year).(viii) Consumer BrochureSection 226.5b(e) would require creditors and third parties providing applicationsto furnish consumers with a brochure prepared by the Board describing homeequity plans, or a brochure that provides substantially similar information.As required by the statute, the brochure will describe home equity plans,including the potential advantages and disadvantages. The brochure alsowill provide guidance on how to compare home equity plans with closed-endcredit. The Board envisions that any substitutes must be, at a minimum,comparable in substance and comprehensiveness, recognizing that some lenders'brochures may contain more detailed descriptions of their particular homeequity programs than contained in the Board's brochure. The Board is currentlypreparing a brochure and will have it available when the regulation isissued in final form.The proposal would mirror the statute in requiring third parties to provideconsumers with the brochure if an application is given to the consumer.The Board believes, however, that requiring a second brochure to be givenby the creditor in such circumstances is unnecessary. Therefore, the Boardbelieves that the creditor's duty to provide the brochure would be metif the third party provides the brochure to the consumer. This will avoidduplication. The creditor would have a duty, however, to ensure that thethird party has provided the brochure if the creditor chooses not to givethe consumer the brochure.(ix) Right of Rescission_Material DisclosuresThe Board is soliciting comment on whether it should amend footnote 36,accompanying andSection; 226.15(a)(3) of the regulation, to provide thatthe payment information required under proposed andSection; 226.5b(d)(5)(i) and (ii) that is given at the time an account is opened be treatedas ``material disclosures'' for purposes of the right of rescission (andSection;226.15). Section 226.15(a)(3) states that the consumer may exercise theright of rescission until midnight of the third business day followingthe opening of the plan, delivery of the notice of the right to rescind,or delivery of all ``material disclosures,'' whichever occurs last. Footnote36 of the regulation currently defines material disclosures to includethe method of determining the finance charge and the balance upon whicha finance charge will be imposed, the annual percentage rate, and the amountor method of determining the amount of any membership or participationfee that may be imposed as part of the plan. Including such payment informationin the definition of ``material disclosures'' would be consistent withthe material disclosure definition in the closed-end credit rescissionprovisions.(x) Advertising RequirementsUnder the open-end advertising rules in andSection; 226.16, any referenceto an item required to be disclosed under andSection; 226.6 requires thedisclosure of cost information such as the APR, any membership or participationfee, and any minimum, fixed, transaction, or activity charge. Under currentrules, a creditor may refer to a payment term in an advertisement for open-endcredit without having to make additional disclosures about other materialterms. Furthermore, only items stated affirmatively require further information.Under andSection; 226.16(d)(1) of the proposed regulation, any referenceto a payment term in a home equity advertisement would ``trigger'' furtherdisclosures, including loan fees, estimates of other fees that may be imposed,and, for variable-rate plans, the maximum rate that may be imposed underthe plan. Proposed andSection; 226.16(d)(3) provides that, if such an advertisementstates a payment amount, it would have to state, if applicable, that theplan contains a balloon payment. Furthermore, if any of the ``triggers''is stated affirmatively <T3>or </T3>negatively, further disclosures must be given. For example,if a creditor states ``no annual fee'' in an advertisement, additionalinformation must be provided.In addition, andSection; 226.16(d)(2) of the proposal provides that if anadvertisement states a ``discounted'' APR it must state in equal prominencethe APR derived by use of the fully-indexed value. Creditors would be prohibitedby andSection; 226.16(d)(5) from referring to home equity plans as ``freemoney'' or using similarly misleading terms. Finally, if an advertisementstates that any interest under the plan may be tax deductible, the advertisementmust not be misleading about such deductibility. (See andSection; 226.16(d)(4).)For example, an advertisement referring to deductibility might includea statement that the consumer should consult a tax advisor regarding thedeductibility of interest.(xi) Substantive LimitationsThe act imposes three substantive limitations on the way home equity planscan be structured. In some provisions the statute speaks in terms of creditoractions. In other provisions the statute speaks in terms of what may becontained in the credit contract. Under andSection; 226.5b(f) of the Board'sproposal, the substantive limitations would apply to both actions creditorsmay take and the provisions that may be contained in contracts. These limitationsalso would apply to assignees and holders.<ITAG tagnum="81">(A) Index For Variable-Rate Plans</ITAG>Under andSection; 226.5b(f)(1) of the proposal, a creditor may change theAPR after the plan is opened only if the change is based on an index outsidethe creditor's control and the index value is available to the public.This provision would prohibit a creditor from using its own prime rateor simply retaining the right to change rates at its discretion. A creditorwould be permitted to use the Wall Street Journal prime rate, for example,or any other index not within the creditor's control.<ITAG tagnum="81">(B) Termination</ITAG>Under the statute and proposed andSection; 226.5b(f)(2), creditors are prohibitedfrom terminating an account and accelerating payment of the outstandingbalance prior to the scheduled expiration of the plan. The act, however,provides three exceptions to the rule. First, a creditor may terminatethe plan if there has been fraud or material misrepresentation by the consumerin connection with the plan. Second, a creditor may terminate the planif the consumer has failed to meet the repayment terms of the agreement.This provision would permit termination only if the consumer fails to actuallymake payments. A creditor could not terminate a plan if, for example, theconsumer, in error, sends a payment to the wrong location, such as a branchrather than the main office of the creditor. Finally, a creditor is permittedto terminate the plan if the consumer acts or fails to act in a way thatadversely affects the creditor's security interest. This provision wouldpermit termination, for example, if the consumer transferred title to theproperty without the permission of the creditor or if the consumer failedto maintain required insurance on the dwelling.If any of these three events occurs, a creditor may also be able to takeaction short of terminating an account and accelarating payment of theoutstanding balance. These three events would likely constitute circumstancesthat would permit a creditor to prohibit additional extensions of creditoror reduce the credit limit. (See the later discussion of the ability ofa creditor to change the terms due to default and other events.)Creditors would not be permitted to specify in their contracts other eventsthat would permit terminating an account and accelerating payment of theoutstanding balance. Thus, for example, a contract could not provide thatthe account will be terminated and the balance accelerated if a judgmentis filed against the consumer.<ITAG tagnum="81">(C) Change of Terms</ITAG>Section 226.5b(f)(3), which implements the third substantive limitation,provides that a creditor may not unilaterally change the terms under theplan after the account has been opened. There are, however, several exceptionsto this rule.<T3>(1) Events provided for in the contract. </T3>The legislative historymakes clear that a creditor was not meant to be prohibited from implementingspecific changes set forth in the contract that are contemplated on theoccurrence of a specific event; this exception has been incorporated inproposed andSection; 226.5b(f)(3)(i). Both the triggering event and the resultingmodification must be stated with specificity. For example, in an employeeloan program, the contract could provide that a specified higher rate willapply if the borrower's employment ends. Similarly, a creditor would bepermitted to suspend additional extensions of credit if the maximum APRis reached, as long as this is expressly provided for in the agreement.A creditor using this provision could only suspend advances for the periodthe APR would exceed the rate cap, and would have to permit further advancesif the applicable rate drops to or below the cap, if that occurs duringthe draw period set forth in the initial agreement. The Board solicitscomment on whether other examples should be provided such as permittingcontracts to provide for a replacement index in the event the originalindex in a variable-rate plan becomes unavailable.While the Board proposes to permit creditors to specify in the initialagreement specific changes that are contemplated on the occurrence of specificevents, there are two limitations on the provisions that could be set forthin the contract. First, under the regulation, creditors would not be permittedto include a general provision in the agreement permitting them to changeany or all of the terms of the plan. For example, creditors could not include``boilerplate'' language in the agreement stating that they reserve theright to change the payment obligations under the plan. Second, creditorswould not be permitted to include in the initial agreement any events whichthe regulation expressly addresses. For example, the statute and andSection;226.5b(f)(3)(iii) of the regulation provide that a creditor may prohibitadditional extensions of credit or reduce the credit limit during any periodin which the value of the dwelling that secures the plan declines significantlybelow the property's appraised value. Because the statute expressly providesfor this situation, and specifically sets forth what action the creditormay take if it arises, the contract may not authorize the creditor to takemore sweeping action. For example, a creditor could not permanently refuseto make further advances if the value of the property declines significantlybelow the property's appraised value, since the statute provides that furtheradvances can be prohibited only during the period in which the value ofthe property remains significantly below the appraised value. Similarly,a contract may not authorize the creditor to take any additional actionbeyond prohibiting further advances or reducing the credit limit when thecreditor reasonably believes that the consumer will be unable to fulfillthe repayment obligations due to a material change in the consumer's financialcircumstances_since this condition also is set forth in the statute. TheBoard believes permitting creditors to expand on the exceptions set forthin the statute would be inconsistent with the intent of the legislation.<T3>(2) Changes made by mutual written agreement. </T3>The statute andthe proposed amendments to the regulation prohibit <T3>unilateral </T3>changes. The Board proposes to permit creditors tochange the terms after a plan is opened provided the consumer expresslyagrees in writing to the change. Thus, for example, under footnote 10dto andSection; 226.5b(f)(3), a consumer and a creditor could agree to extendthe period during which advances can be obtained, or could agree to changethe repayment terms from, for example, interest-only payments to paymentsthat reduce the principal balance. Under the proposal, creditors wouldnot be permitted to assume consent because the consumer uses an account(even if that implies acceptance under state law). The Board believes thiswill carry out the Congressional intent to limit changes after a plan isopened, yet accommodate the need for adjustments agreed to by both partiesto the contract.<T3>(3) Insignificant changes. </T3>The statute and andSection; 226.5b(f)(3)of the proposal provide another exception to the general prohibition againstchanging terms, for changes to ``insignificant terms.'' This is intendedto address operational problems, such as changing the address of the creditorfor purposes of sending payments. This exception would not permit a creditorto unilaterally change a term such as a fee charged for late payments.<T3>(4) Substitution of index. </T3>Section 226.5b(f)(3)(ii) of the proposalalso provides that the creditor may change the index and margin used underthe plan if the original index becomes unavailable, as long as historicalfluctuations in the two indices were substantially similar, and as longas the new index and margin would have resulted in a rate similar to therate that was in effect at the time the original index became unavailable.<T3>(5) Beneficial changes. </T3>Creditors also would be permitted underproposed andSection; 226.5b(f)(3)(iv) to make any changes that ``unequivocallybenefit'' the consumer as long as the change is beneficial for the entireterm of the agreement. A creditor would not be able to change the paymentobligations of the plan in reliance on this exception. For example, reducingthe amount of the minimum payment may not be unequivocally beneficial sinceit may result in less principal being repaid over the term of the planand may result in a higher total amount of finance charges. While thisexception is narrow, as noted above, a consumer and creditor would be permittedto change the terms of the plan by mutual written agreement.<T3>(6) Changes due to default and other events. </T3>Section 226.5b(f)(3)(iii)of the proposal incorporates the statutory provisions that provide thata creditor may prohibit additional extensions of credit or reduce the creditlimit in four circumstances. First, a creditor may take such action ifthe value of the dwelling that secures the plan declines significantlybelow the property's appraised value for purposes of the plan. Second,a creditor may prohibit additional extensions of credit or reduce the creditline if the creditor reasonably believes the consumer will be unable tofulfill the repayment obligations under the plan due to a material changein the consumer's financial circumstances. Two conditions must be met fora creditor to use this exception. First, there must be a ``material change''in the consumer's financial circumstances. For example, a significant decreasein the consumer's income would meet this part of the requirement. Second,as a result of this change, the creditor must have a reasonable belief,based on some evidence (such as failure to pay other debts), that the consumerwill be unable to fulfill the payment obligations of the plan.The third exception permits a creditor to prohibit additional extensionsof credit or reduce the credit line if the consumer is in default of anymaterial obligations under the agreement. (Sections 226.5b(d)(4) and 226.6(e)(2)require that the creditor provide or make available a list of the conditionsthat would permit prohibiting additional extensions of credit or reducingthe credit line.) The final exception permits a creditor to prohibit additionaladvances or reduce the credit line because action by a governmental bodyeither (a) precludes the creditor from imposing the agreed-upon APR (forexample, enactment of a lower state rate ceiling after the plan has beenentered into), or (b) adversely affects the priority of the creditor'ssecurity interest to the extent that the value of the security is lessthan 120 percent of the amount of the credit line (for example, throughimposition of a tax lien).Under the proposed regulation, creditors are permitted to prohibit additionalextensions of credit or reduce the credit limit only as long as any ofthese four circumstances exist. Thus, for example, if the creditor limitsthe ability of the consumer to obtain further advances due to a significantdecline in the value of the dwelling, and during the length of the drawperiod the value of the property subsequently increases, the creditor wouldhave to reinstate credit drawing privileges. Similarly, a creditor mayreduce the credit limit only during the period any of the circumstancesexists.<ITAG tagnum="81">(D) Refund of Fees</ITAG>Section 226.5b(g) of the proposal imposes a duty on a creditor to refundall fees paid by the consumer in connection with an application if anyterm disclosed (other than a variable rate) changes between the time disclosuresare provided to the consumer and the plan is opened, and if, as a resultof the change, the consumer decides to not enter into the plan. This ruleapplies to any fees paid in connection with the plan, such as credit reportfees and appraisal fees, whether paid directly to the creditor or to thirdparties. This right is distinct from the existing right of rescission underandSection; 226.15, which begins only when a plan secured by the consumer'sprincipal dwelling is actually opened.<ITAG tagnum="81">(E) Imposition of Fees</ITAG>Finally, under andSection; 226.5b(h) of the proposal, neither the creditornor any other party may impose a nonrefundable fee in conjunction withan application until three business days after the disclosures and brochurehave been provided to the consumer. If disclosures are mailed to the consumer,footnote 10e of the regulation provides that a fee cannot be collecteduntil six business days after the mailing. If a refundable fee is collectedprior to the consumer receiving the disclosures, the fee would have tobe refunded to the consumer if the consumer decides not to enter into theagreement. (xii) Effective DateThe statute provides that the act and regulations shall apply to: (1) Anyagreement to open a plan which is entered into five months after the regulationsbecome final; and (2) any application to open a plan which is distributedby or received by a creditor five months after regulations become final.Under this requirement, creditors would have to provide the first set ofdisclosures to consumers if an application is received after the effectivedate of the regulations, even if the application was provided to the consumerprior to the effective date of the rule. The Board plans to provide a rulein the supplemental information to the final amendments allowing creditorsto provide the first set of disclosures to consumers within three daysof receipt of the application in such cases.(xiii) Disclosure Samples and Model ClausesIn connection with the other revisions, the Board is proposing to reviseAppendix G of the regulation to incorporate disclosure samples (G-17A andG-17B), and model clauses (G-18) to assist creditors in preparing disclosures.<ITAG tagnum="81">(A) Disclosure Samples</ITAG>Form G-17A illustrates a variable-rate plan with 10-year draw period followedby a 5-year repayment period. The payments are based on a percentage ofthe outstanding balance so that, independent of rate changes, paymentswill vary each month during the plan. Consequently, payments are statedas a range in the minimum payment example. In the historical table, whichillustrates both the draw and the repayment periods, only one payment peryear is reflected and the fact that payments would have varied during eachyear is stated. All calculations, however, are conducted using the actualpayment computation formula. The Board specifically solicits comment onwhether this treatment is appropriate for such payment arrangements.Form G-17B illustrates a variable-rate plan with interest-only paymentsduring the draw period followed by a repayment period, the length of whichdepends on the size of the outstanding balance. The consumer is permittedto select between two payment arrangements_monthly or quarterly payments_duringthe draw period. Accordingly, the payment disclosures and examples illustratesuch payment option. In addition, by including two payment columns, theform illustrates how one historical table can be used to disclose multiplepayment options.<ITAG tagnum="81">(B) Model Clauses</ITAG>Appendix G-18 contains a number of model clauses that may be used in preparingdisclosures. Information that must be inserted is indicated by italicizedlanguage within parentheses. Alternative language is set forth in bracketsand separated by a slash. Disclosures that may not be applicable to a givenplan are set forth in brackets.<ITAG tagnum="84">(3) Economic Impact Statement</ITAG>The Board's Division of Research and Statistics has prepared an economicimpact statement on the proposed revisions to Regulation Z.
