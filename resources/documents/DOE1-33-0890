Thermal decarbonylationof Ru{sub 3}(CO){sub 9}({mu}{sub 3}-CO)({mu}{sub 3}-S) (1) at 100{sup0}C has yielded 3, 47%, 5, 10%, and Ru{sub 7}(CO){sub 20}({mu}{sub 4}-S){sub2} (6), 26%. The large clusters are decomposed to 2 and 3 by reactionwith CO at 1 atm. Compounds 4-6 have been characterized by single-crystalX-ray diffraction analyses. For 4: space group P2{sub 1}/n, a = 8.787(2) A, b = 14.550 (3) A, c = 19.741 (3) A, {beta} = 98.09 (1){sup 0},Z = 4, rho/sub calcd/ = 2.56 g/cm{sup 3}. The cluster consists of anapproximately square arrangement of four ruthenium atoms with quadruplybridging sulfido ligands on each face. An Ru(CO){sub 4} unit bridgesone Ru-Ru edge of the cluster. But the EAN rule the molecule is unsaturated,and one of the Ru-Ru bonds was found to be unusually short, 2.704 (1)A. For 5: space group P2{sub 1}2{sub 1}2{sub 1}, a = 11.211 (2) A, b= 14.666 (4) A, c = 17.611 (4) A, Z = 4, rho/sub calcd/ = 2.63 g/cm{sup3}. Compound 5 is isomorphous and isostructural with the know osmiumhomologue. The molecule consists of a pentagonal-bypyramidal clusterof five ruthenium atoms with two sulfido ligands. A Ru(CO){sub 4} groupbridges one apical-equatorial edge of the cluster. For 6: space groupP2{sub 1}2{sub 1}2{sub 1}, a = 11.226 (3) A, b = 14.320 (4) A, c = 21,217(5) A, Z = 4, rho/sub calcd/ = 2.59 g/cm{sup 3}. Compound 6 is isomorphousand isostructural with the known osmium homologue. The molecule consistsof a pentagonal-bipyramidal cluster of five ruthenium atoms and two sulfidoligands. Two Ru(CO){sub 4} groups bridge symmetrically adjacent apical-equatorialedges of the cluster.</TEXT></DOC>
