 400 on Reader Service CardandM;Typically, a video or hard-copy terminal connected directly to a system'sconsole port serves two major functions.andP;  First, these devices are used todisplay system console messages, such as tape mount requests and warnings ondisk space status.andP;  Second, they allow system managers to perform suchfunctions as shutting down and rebooting systems.andP;  However, as systemmanagers well know, some very obvious drawbacks are inherent inconfigurations like these.andM;Because hard-copy terminals consume much paper, &quot;weeding&quot; through thosemountains of paper to review console output can be quite burdensome.andO;Although paper waste can be avoided by using a CRT terminal, information islost forever once it scrolls off the screen.andP;  Whichever display method ischosen, the bottom line is that system managers still must use these consoleterminals to halt and reboot their systems.andM;Physical space might also be a consideration for system managers.andP;  Becauseevery system requires a console terminal, computer-room space can be consumedquickly.andP;  DEC provides a software product, VAXcluster Console System, thateliminates the need for separate console output devices for each system, andsupports VAXclusters and stand-alone systems.andP;  However, at a base price of$4,809 for a four-node license, it is a rather expensive solution.andP;  Anotherway around the space problem is for system managers to use terminals withmultiple serial ports so that they can toggle between different consolesessions, but this solution makes it likely that important console outputwill be lost.andM;Integrated Solutions, however, provides a another way to deal with consoleoutput.andP;  Using Integrated Solutions' software package, Console, a systemmanager can log all console output to a disk-based file.andP;  In addition, themanager can access a system console port from any other terminal to examineconsole log files and issue commands, just as if he were working on adirectly connected console terminal.andP;  Console can be used with computersystems, as well as peripherals such as HSCs, network routers, and otherdevices that require or use a console device.andM;Console needs to be installed on only one VMS system, where it can monitorthe console output of other systems.andP;  Monitored systems, such as other VAXesand HSCs, must be connected either to a hard-wired serial port on the systemrunning Console or to a Local Area Transport terminal server port.andP;  Under theLAT configuration, Console employs a reverse-LAT connection, whereby the hostinitiates the connection rather than the terminal, to capture the consoledata (Fig.andP;  1).andM;Console is made up of two programs: the server program and the Consoleprogram proper.andP;  When started up, the server program creates a detachedprocess, called Console Server, that performs two tasks.andP;  First, it capturesall console data as it is written to monitored ports.andP;  Second, it facilitatesthe connection from the system manager's remote terminal to a monitoredconsole port.andP;  If the detached server process is stopped--as will happenduring a system crash--all monitoring of console ports will be terminated andconsole messages will not be recorded.andM;The Console program serves as a front end to the server program, enabling theuser to request connections to monitored console ports.andP;  Once a user'sconnection is established, the user can examine historical or current consoleoutput and issue commands to the system through the connected console port.andM;To assess the performance of Console, DR Labs configured a test environmentconsisting of a MicroVAX 3600, MicroVAX 3100 and MicroVAX II.andP;  Console wasinstalled on the MicroVAX 3600andgt; the console ports of the MicroVAX 3100 andMicroVAX II were connected to LAT terminal server ports.andP;  The LAT terminalserver ports to which the monitored console ports are connected must be setto remote accessandgt; this is accomplished either by logging directly into theterminal server or by using DEC's Terminal Server Manager software.andM;System managers must edit the file CNSL$NODES.LIST, which specifies thedevice names of the monitored console ports, before starting the Consoleserver process.andP;  Once this file is set up correctly, the Console serverprocess is initiated by executing the command file CNSL$STARTUP.andP;  Uponstart-up, an ASCII log file is created for each monitored console port, withthe name [is less than]nodename[is greater than]_ [is less than]date[isgreater than.CONSOLE_LOG.andP;  For example, the log file created for our MicroVAX3100, GALE, was named GALE_31-OCT-1990.-CONSOLE_LOG.andP;  These log files whichshould not be confused with VMS operator log files, are used to captureoutput messages from their corresponding console ports.andM;The CONSOLE command is used to establish a connection to a monitored consoleport from a remote terminal.andP;  Because the DCL table is not updated byConsole's installation procedure, system managers must add the CONSOLEcommand to their process command tables manually using the VMS SET command.andO;For instance, to establish a connection to the console port of our MicroVAX3100, we simply typed the following command: CONSOLE GALE.andM;Although the Console user interface is neither elegant nor sophisticated, itwas adequate for our purposes.andP;  Console displays two independently scrollalewindows along with a command-line prompt at the bottom of the screen (Fig.andO;2).andP;  The top window shows the console log file, and the bottom one showscurrent console output--that is, output generated by the system while theremote terminal is connected to the console port.andM;All Console operations, such as window scrolling and searching, are invokedvia the application keypad.andP;  By pressing [is less than]PF2[is greater than],a system manager can view the keypad mapping, which closely resembles that ofEDT, the VMS text editor.andP;  Like EDT, Console assigns dual functions to somekeys on the keypad.andP;  The second key function is invoked by pressing the PFIkey, then the function key.andM;The keypad allows users to toggle between windows and scroll through theircontents.andP;  It also offers Find and Find Next options, a useful way for systemmanagers to pinpoint information quickly in large log files.andP;  System managerscan also toggle among various console port connections or select differentconsole log files for viewing.andM;All commands are typed at the command-line prompt.andP;  The obvious limitation ofsuch an approach is that it prevents users from performing certainfull-screen operations, such as file editing.andP;  Still, the command-lineinterface does provide a useful mechanism for interacting with a systemthrough its console port.andP;  A comman-line recall feature would certainlyenhance the user iterface.andM;Because all commands are routed through the server process to the connectedconsole port, there is a noticeable lag between the time a command is enteredand the time it is received by the remote system.andP;  For fleet-fingeredtypists, this delay can be a little disconcerting.andM;Any quick typist will also discover that, when logging into a system via theConsole server, his password might be displayed at the command-line prompt.andO;Console, by design, does not echo the password to the screen, but if the usertypes his password before Console processes the NOECHO command, the passwordbecomes visible.andP;  This problem can be avoided by remembering to wait for thePASSWORD: prompt before typing the password.andM;Although Console performed well during our testing, we did encounter oneserious limitation: We were unable to issue a Break character to theconnected console port, thus preventing us from halting any of our monitoredsystems.andP;  Console does provide a way to issue a Break--by pressing thesequence [is less than]PFI[is greater than] [is less than]KP3[is greaterthan]--but it proved ineffective for LAT-connected console ports.andP;  It did,however, work for console ports linked to TT ports.andP;  Once we informedIntegrated Solutions of the problem, the company sent a fix for terminalslinked to a LAT terminal server port.andM;On a minor note, when a remote terminal is used as a console terminal, theterminal type is classified as unknown.andP;  The result is that certainsystem-generated output is not interpreted, as it would be by a definedterminal type.andP;  For example, the escape sequence that clears a VT terminal'sscreen is ignored when connected through Console.andM;Console is priced according to the number of console port connections.andP;  Thebase price (one connection) is $400.andP;  The price of additional connectionsdepends on the total number of links required, with the price per connectiondecreasing as the total increases.andP;  (See &quot;Prices for licensing anddocumentation,&quot; below.)andM;We were for the most part pleased wit Console.andP;  Though it does not offer asleek interface and has a few noticeable limitations, it does provide aneffective way to save console output at a reasonable cost.andP;  For systemmanagers, the console log files that this software puts to disk can be ofinvaluable help in efforts to trobleshoot system problems.andM;Console software serves two functions.andP;  First, it allows system managers tocapture to the system disk all console information from local and remotesystems that is more commonly directed to a console terminal or printer.andO;Second, the software allows system managers to access a system's console portfrom remote terminals, and review log files or issue commands directly to theconsole.andM;To observe how effectively Console fulfills these functions, DR Labsconfigured a test environment that consisted of a MicroVAX 3600, a MicroVAX3100 and a MicroVAX II, all running VMS version 5.3.andP;  We installed Consoleversion 1.3 on the MicroVAX 3600 and connected the console ports of theMicroVAX 3100 and MicroVAX II to Local Area Transport terminal server portson DR Net, DR Labs' test Ethernet network.andM;We tested the product by assessing how well it recorded console informationto disk, and by remotely connecting to console ports and issuing commands tothese &quot;consoles.&quot;andP;  As part of our tests, we used our remote consoleconnections to halt and reboot the DR Labs systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
