The Commission des Operations de Bourse, which has no powers to prosecute offenders itself, said yesterday that it transmitted the findings of its investigation to judicial authorities.    The probe, which comes just as France is about to increase the commission's powers to deal with increasingly frequent allegations of insider trading here, covered all transactions in Societe Generale shares between June and December 1988 -- a period including the runup in the share price and the launch of an aborted raid on the bank by financier Georges Pebereau.    That raid caused considerable controversy here both because of persistent allegations of insider trading and because the move had the blessing of France's Socialist government. The government intervention was part of the Socialists' plan to remodel the shareholding structure of French concerns sold to the public by the former conservative government.    Although Mr. Pebereau acquired a 10.36% stake in the bank, becoming its dominant shareholder, he was denied any management role and ultimately sold off his stake after a four-month stand-off. </TEXT></DOC>
