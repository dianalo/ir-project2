Hernandez made the unprompted remarks as he entered an eveningmeeting of oil officials from six Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries and representatives of seven non-OPEC oilexporters, including Mexico, China and Egypt.   The two groups were exploring means of cooperation, includingpossible joint cuts or restraints on oil production. Their aim isto push prices up to OPEC's target of $18 a barrel.   U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington, speaking during a recenttour of independent oil-producing nations, criticized OPEC forseeking to collaborate with other countries. He said the Viennatalks were ``doomed to failure.''   ``I can't really understand why Secretary Herrington made suchaggressive attacks against OPEC,'' Hernandez said.   The minister said OPEC's sole intention was to ``reach arational level in the price of oil.''   ``I don't believe this is against the national interests of theUnited States,'' he said. ``The United States is the country withthe highest cost of (oil) production.''   He noted that proven oil reserves and production levels in theUnited States have fallen sharply since world oil prices collapsedtwo years ago.   The United States was not invited to the Vienna meeting. KentHance, A member of the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulatesthat state's oil industry, was here, however, to meet individuallywith OPEC and non-OPEC oil officials.</TEXT></DOC>
