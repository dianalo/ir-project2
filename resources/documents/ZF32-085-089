Probably because all manner of the alternativepointing devices slated for use with the specified IBM equipment is currentlyavailable only for the Mac.andM;Bad drives, bad.andP;  The recent revelation that Apple had decided to institute awarranty-extension policy on those failing Sony hard disks struck aresponsive cord in the Mac the Knife community.andP;  The many calls have beentabulated.andP;  Most inquiring owners of Macintoshes equipped with the suspectSony drives want to know when the policy will be announced.andP;  Every indicationnow points to an Aug. 15 announcement.andP;  And remember, your claim will be onlyas good as your drive's serial number.andM;October surprise.andP;  Radius plans to replace its existing graphics acceleratorand color interface cards with a single, all-purpose board sometime inOctober.andP;  Sources say it will have 16 SIMM slots, so with the proper amountof RAM, it should be able to drive most any monitor up to 21 inches at 16bits or 24 bits.andP;  Why pay more?andM;There is no Strategic MacWEEK Mug Reduction Treaty.andP;  Consort with the Knifeat (415) 243-3500, fax (415) 243-3650, MCI (MactheKnife), AppleLink (MacWEEK)and CompuServe/Zmac.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
