(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Rifle Association and othergun advocates spent nearly $6.6 million in an unsuccessful bid todefeat Maryland's handgun control law, while the law's supportersspent about $750,000, according to election reports.   The NRA contributed $5.1 million to the campaign and loaned theMaryland Committee Against the Gun Ban an additional $971,000, whilea little more than $100,000 came in the form of hundreds of smallcontributions from donors in Maryland and other states, according toreports released Tuesday.   The Maryland committee, which has an empty treasury, hasoutstanding debts of $375,000, not counting the NRA loan, the reportshowed.   Those who sought to repeal the law, which aims to outlaw cheap,easily concealable handguns often called Saturday Night specials,outspent supporters nearly 9-to-1, with their outlay representingabout $10 for every vote cast to defeat the law. The NRA said it wasthe first time it has lost a state referendum on handgun control.   The campaign was by far the most expensive in Maryland history.   Citizens for Eliminating Saturday Night Specials, the committeethat backed the law, spent $752,107. It had support from most of thestate's elected officials, including Gov. William Donald Schaefer,who helped raise money and made television and radio advertisementssupporting the law.   Gun law advocates, who finished the campaign with a $17,000surplus, spent more than $554,000 on advertising. The group raised$372,000 in the final 2{ weeks of the campaign.   The Washington-based group Handgun Control Inc. campaigned forthe law and provided the single largest contribution to itsdefenders, $95,000. The group's vice chairman is Sarah Brady, wifeof presidential press secretary James Brady, who was shot along withPresident Reagan in 1981.   Final unofficial returns from election night showed the law wonby 57 percent to 43 percent.   The law makes it illegal after Jan. 1, 1990, to sell handguns inMaryland not approved by a nine-member board of gubernatorialappointees. Guns made prior to 1985 are excluded from the ban.   The law does not spell out which guns should be banned, butdirects the board to consider characteristics such as the quality ofmaterials and workmanship, concealability and the safety of the gun.</TEXT></DOC>
