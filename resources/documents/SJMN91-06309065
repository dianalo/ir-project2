And four times, they were unsuccessful.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  COFER'S MISSES PUT 49ERS IN TOUGH SPOT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Falcons 17, 49ers 14; Notebook; Mercury News Staff Writers Nancy Gay and MikeAntonucci contributed to this report.  </MEMO><TEXT>     In the first quarter, Mike Cofer attempted a 33-yard field goal, but it wasblocked by Tory Epps, who blocked two 49ers field goal attempts in one gamelast season.;   In the second quarter, Cofer attempted a 32-yard field goalthat hit the right upright and bounced out. It appeared that the snap was lowon that attempt.;   Five minutes later, Cofer attempted a 32-yard field goalthat was wide left. And with ten seconds remaining in the half, Cofer's47-yard attempt was also wide left.;   Cofer did not make himself available toreporters after the game. His holder, punter Joe Prokop, said there was noproblem with the snaps or the holds.;   Last week, the 49ers waived punterBarry Helton, Cofer's longtime holder. This season, Ralf Mojsiejenko startedthe season as the holder and now Prokop has the job.;   Cofer is 9-of-18 onfield goal attempts. Last season, Cofer made 24 out of 36 field goal attemptsand missed on just two of distances between 30 and 39 yards.; WHO BELTED WHO?As expected, a number of brawls broke out. But surprisingly, only one resultedin an unsportsmanlike conduct call.;   In the biggest fistfight of the day,49ers and Falcons swarmed each other after Andre Rison's three-yard touchdowncatch early in the final quarter. Trouble started after 49ers cornerback DonGriffin shoved Rison in the face mask. Wide receiver Jason Phillips threw aright at Griffin and the battle was on. In the end, though, Falcons guardHouston Hoover was nailed for the 15-yard infraction.; MEMORIES: The way thegame ended Sunday reminded some players of the famous college game betweenBoston College and Miami, when Doug Flutie's Hail Mary pass won the game forB.C.;   Linebacker Bill Romanowski was on the Boston College team.;   &quot;I wason the other end of it that time,&quot; Romanowski said. &quot;But it was the same typeof game.&quot;;   Defensive end Kevin Fagan, who played at Miami, was on the losingside that time as well.;   &quot;It was identical,&quot; Fagan said. &quot;At the time, Iprobably thought Flutie's pass was (more disappointing). But now I think thisone is.&quot;; MONTANA ON TV: CBS made a big deal out of a taped interview with JoeMontana on its 'NFL Today&quot; show, but nothing newsworthy was said.;   TerryBradshaw asked some routine questions and Montana gave some routine answers,venturing into his relationship with Steve Young only as far as saying thatcompetitiveness is a natural part of being a professional.;   'If I feelcomfortable with him playing, what good am I?&quot; Montana told Bradshaw.; BIGMATCHUP: There were no long pass plays in the battle between Atlanta defensiveback Tim McKyer and 49ers receiver Jerry Rice. The game took a physical tollon both, Rice leaving for a while with leg and groin injuries and McKyergetting laid out twice.;   But both were talking afterward and McKyer wasquoted by the Falcons publicity staff as saying, &quot;The thing with Rice is thatI just felt at the last game that he did not show the sportsmanship that heshould have. It wasn't very classy of him, but that is behind us now.&quot;;RECORD-BREAKER: Steve Young's 97-yard pass to John Taylor in the secondquarter set a team record for the longest touchdown pass, surpassing JoeMontana's 96-yard completion to Jerry Rice against San Diego on Nov. 27,1988.; ETC.: The 49ers continue to have breakdowns on special teams. In thefourth quarter, Sanjay Beach fumbled a punt return, which was recovered byAtlanta. . . . . . . Brent Jones, who had missed six games with a knee injury,was back in action Sunday. He caught one pass for 12 yards.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ANN KILLION, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Atlanta  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911104  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  687  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, November 4, 199100309065,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
