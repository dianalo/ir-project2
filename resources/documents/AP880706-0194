(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The former commander of the USS Stark saidWednesday that the downing of an Iranian commercial jet by a Navywarship was not necessarily similar to the Iraqi jet attack on hisship that killed 37 sailors and forced him out of the service.   ``The CO (commanding officer) had a hard time,'' said Glenn R.Brindel of the decision by Capt. Will C. Rogers III of the USSVincennes to shoot down the oncoming Iranian Air Airbus A-300. ``Hecalled the shots the way he had to.   ``Some people are trying to draw parallels between the twoincidents. I don't necessarily concur with that.''   Brindel said he did not wish to comment further.   Brindel's ship was hit in the Persian Gulf by two Exocetmissiles fired from an Iraqi jet 12 miles away. The frigate hadlittle warning before the missiles struck. The ship's Phalanxanti-aircraft system was not engaged at the time of the attack.   The Vincennes, a sophisticated Aegis-class cruiser, wasreceiving confusing radio signals from the Airbus, makingidentification of the craft difficult. At the same time, theVincennes and another Navy warship were engaging several Iraniangunboats that had fired on one of the Vincennes' helicopters.   When the aircraft did not respond to several warnings from theVincennes, Navy officials said Rogers ordered two missiles launchedat the plane. Based on the information available, the captain saidhe believed the plane to be an F-14.   Iranian authorities said 290 people were aboard; there were nosurvivors.   In the 1987 attack on the Stark, a Navy investigation found thatthe ship was never ready or capable of repelling an attack andrecommended that Brindel, then a captain, be court-martialed.   Instead, the Navy allowed Brindel to retire at the rank ofcommander after he was given a letter of reprimand.   Adm. Frank B. Kelso, commander-in-chief of the Atlantic Fleet,said the decision not to follow the recommendation of investigatorswas based in part on the surprise nature of the attack and theheroic response of Brindel and his crew in saving the ship.   Brindel now sells real estate in Virginia Beach, Va.</TEXT></DOC>
