While NO/sub x/ reductionmeasures have to be taken for gas engines, in order to keep within thelimits of Clean Air Technical Guide (TA-Luft), this is not generallythe case for gas turbines. The measurements obtained on gas engine plantsshow that the techniques obtainable on the market now comply with orconsiderably fall below the prescribed emission values for NO/sub x/and CO. By injecting water or steam, the NO/sub x/ emission from gasturbines can be further reduced.</TEXT></DOC>
