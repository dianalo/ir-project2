After havingcharacterized the application scenarios, in which industrial diagnosisplays a major role, we discuss the tasks for which are suitable and theirmost usual architectures. A brief survey on the major projects in thefield allows a state-of-the-art assessment. Finally, we consider themost significant researches which are expected to substantially contribute,in the next years, to the development of expert systems for industrialdiagnosis applications.</TEXT></DOC>
