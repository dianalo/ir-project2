WinterStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GMECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)ECONOMIC AND MONETARY INDICATORS (EMI) </IN><TEXT>   Selling factory machinery is tough these days because durable goods producers generally continue to be cautious about ordering, and auto maker General Motors Corp., a major buyer, has slashed spending.    U.S. machine tool producers received $165.2 million in net orders last month, down 23% from $214.6 million a year earlier, the National Machine Tool Builders' Association reported. However, the March order total was 8.1% higher than February's $152.9 million, the NMTBA said, making it the highest monthly total since the $180.2 million of last October.    Despite the rise from February, producers of these machines, which shape most metal parts, say they continue to answer a lot of questions from potential buyers in relation to orders finally signed. And first-quarter orders were down 25% from a year earlier.    The March order total was reduced by about $20 million of cancellations of previously placed orders for big transfer presses by GM, say press builders.    General Motors previously has canceled some press orders, and the latest move is part of its plan to close some plants and shrink production capacity, press builders said. A GM spokesman said the company has a policy against commenting on any individual purchases.    The big auto producer previously said, however, that spending on its auto and truck plants will decline to $7.9 billion this year, from an unusually high $10.6 billion in 1986, and that such spending will drop to about $5.8 billion by 1989.    &quot;Our orders are on a sort of plain -- we're booking about like we have been since late last year,&quot; says Harry B. Heeb, vice president of sales for Giddings andamp; Lewis Inc.'s machine tool division. The Fond du Lac, Wis.-based unit of AMCA International continues to receive orders from a wide range of customers, including aerospace and defense companies, he says.    However, aerospace orders aren't as strong as they were a year ago, producers say. For one thing, the B-1B bomber and C-5 transport plane contracts are winding down, reducing machine tool orders from West Coast contract shops that provide parts for those planes.    The lower dollar hasn't yet resulted in a surge of export orders, Mr. Heeb says. However, he reports &quot;a firming in pricing&quot; as a result of higher production costs by some foreign competitors.    &quot;Our activity is very good,&quot; says James D. Axelson, director of sales for Devlieg Machine Co., Royal Oak, Mich. &quot;There's a lot of interest in manufacturing cells and systems. But as you get more dollars involved, it takes longer for the customer to get all of the required approvals.&quot; The systems frequently cost more than $8 million.    March orders for lathes, machining centers, grinders, boring mills, milling machines and other machines that shape metal by cutting were $124.5 million, the NMTBA said, down 22% from $159.9 million a year earlier. However, March orders were up 20% from $103.7 million in February.    Orders last month for metal-forming presses and other machines to shape metal with pressure fell to $40.8 million because of the cancellations, down 26% from $54.7 million a year earlier and 17% below the $49.2 million of February.    Because of shrinking backlogs of unfilled orders, machine tool producers are throttling back production. Industry shipments in the first quarter totaled $475.9 million, the NMTBA said, down 20% from $597.3 million a year earlier.    ---   Comparative new orders for metal-cutting machines:                         Mar. 1987    Feb. 1987     Mar. 1986 Domestic .......... $108,550,000  $98,350,000  $146,050,000 Foreign ............. 15,900,000    5,350,000    13,850,000 Total .............. 124,450,000  103,700,000   159,900,000   Three-month total for 1987: $327,100,000; 1986:$463,500,000.
