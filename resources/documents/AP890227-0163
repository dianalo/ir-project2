The Federal Communications Commission said those requirements for``Link Up America'' aid were denying service to 15 percent of allapplicants.   The year-old federal assistance plan is designed to encouragelow-income households to obtain telephone service by helping pay forinstallation.   Qualifying households may receive up to $30 to help defray suchcosts.   Gerald Brock, chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau, saidthere were 385,000 people in 37 states, the District of Columbia andPuerto Rico in the program.   Brock said the commission decided to loosen the requirements whenit was shown it would not cost the government very much.   ``We are finding that it has been an effective program but it hasnot been so well used that the financial requirements wereoverwhelming,'' Brock told reporters. ``That's one of the reasonswhy we put more restrictions on at the beginning.''   In another action Monday, the FCC ruled that radio equipment usedto provide phone service to remote areas will be considered asbelonging to the telephone companies, and consumers will not have tobuy it.   The commission made its ruling on a petition filed by theColorado consulting firm of Tallon, Cheeseman andamp; Associates regardingthe Basic Exchange Telecommunications Radio Service.   The commission said the antenna and radio equipment located on ornear the premises of users of the service should be treated asregulated network equipment and is eligible for federal and stateprograms designed to assist telephone companies that provide servicein high-cost areas.   The company estimated the cost of this equipment to range from$2,200 to $2,400, the commission said.   The ruling means the FCC will increase the federal assistanceavailable to rural phone companies and their customers to installsuch equipment, and the users will pay the same basic servicecharges as regular phone users in the area.</TEXT></DOC>
