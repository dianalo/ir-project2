Norway's state-controlled petroleum group blamed lowercrude oil prices, a weakening of the petrochemical market andworse results from refinery operations.</LP><TEXT>   Sales rose 8.1% to 78.3 billion kronor from 72.4 billionkronor.   In its forecast for 1992, the group said market trends inthe first part of the year &quot;give no promise of an earlyrecovery in Statoil's principal markets.&quot;   It said stronger economic growth in the U.S. and WesternEurope will be needed &quot;to establish a market basis for anoutput by OPEC {the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries} in excess of 23 million to 24 million barrels ofoil per day in 1992.&quot; Under such market conditions, Statoilsaid, it will give continued emphasis to improvedcost-effectiveness.   Operating profit at Statoil's refining and marketing unittumbled to 647 million kroner in the year from 1.2 billionkroner in 1990. Statoil blamed the plunge on storage losscaused by lower crude and product prices, a longer and morecomprehensive turnaround than planned at the Mongstadrefinery, and investments related to the brand change toStatoil Norge from Norol.   The petrochemicals and plastics unit's results slipped toa 17 million krona operating loss in 1991 from a 718 millionkrona profit in 1990, it said.   At the end of 1991, Statoil had 13,950 employees, up from13,000 a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
