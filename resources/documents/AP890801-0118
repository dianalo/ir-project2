The junior high schools would be reopened for the first timesince January, said West Bank commander Maj. Gen. Amiram Mitzna.   Primary schools and classes for high school seniors reopenedJuly 22, and 200,000 students returned to classes.   The West Bank's nearly 1,200 primary and secondary schools wereclosed throughout most of the 19-month Palestinian uprising againstIsraeli rule in the occupied territories.   The Israeli government said the schools were hotbeds of violenceand rejected repeated appeals from the United States andinternational human rights organizations against the closures.   Palestinian leaders have called on students not to jeopardizethe resumption of classes by initiating anti-Israeli disturbances.   Mitzna, speaking to Israeli legislators touring the West Banktown of Ramallah, said the army was considering reopening classesfor high school sophomores and juniors in the near future, Israelradio said.   Mitzna added that Israel recently released 97 high schoolstudents who were arrested for anti-Israeli protests to allow themto resume their education.   Elsewhere in the occupied lands, two Palestinians were shot andwounded overnight in clashes between Israeli soldiers and about 200protesters in the Tulkarem refugee camp. The army also fired teargas to disperse the crowd, which gathered to protest the death of aPalestinian camp resident earlier in the week, Arab reports said.   The army said three Palestinians were wounded in the Tulkaramclashes.   In other developments, Israel radio reported that leafletssigned by Palestinian Liberation Organization chairman YasserArafat's Fatah wing warned activists from the hard-line MarxistPopular Front for the Liberation of Palestine that ``they bearresponsibility'' for their threats against Palestinian lawyer JamilTarifi.   Tarifi, a PLO supporter, disclosed last week he had met withIsraeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir for discussions onimplementing Shamir's peace plan. Tarifi is the only Palestinian toadmit to such a meeting.   Graffiti signed by the front later appeared on walls threateningTarifi with punishment for the meeting.   Faisal Husseini, a prominent east Jerusalem Palestinian leaderand a PLO supporter, harshly criticized the threats and told theIsraeli news agency Itim that ``these warnings do not serve thePalestinian cause.''   The front, headed by George Habash, has opposed Arafat's offerto compromise in negotiations with Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
