Both seem tothink short-term, even at the expense of the future.   This, of course, is a generality with many exceptions. Lots ofcompanies foresake instant profits in order to fund research thatwon't pay off for years. Many families forego today's pleasures fortomorrow's security.   Still, a study by a financial planning group reveals a strongtendency among Americans to dismiss potential problems from theirminds, often because they are forced to by more immediate, pressingchallenges.   According to a report of the findings:   _Despite listing saving for retirement as their most importantlong-term financial goal, most people do little about it. ``Whileconcern is high, short-term worries about the mortgage and payingfor college have taken precedence.''   _The number two financial goal for most Americans is puttingchildren through college, ``but most have no idea what it willcost, and harbor unrealistic expectations about how they will payfor it.''   _More than one-third of Americans say someone in the family willneed long-term medical care, ``but virtually none have any plans topay for it, nor do they seem disposed to plan.''   Fairly or unfairly, a rap against surveys is that they tend togenerate more suspicion than conviction, especially when resultsuncannily coincide with goals of those who conduct or contract forthem. This one may be no exception.   Conducted by the Gallup Organization for the InternationalAssociation for Financial Planning in Atlanta, it suggests stronglythat Americans need professional financial advice.   One of the findings, as reported by the IAFP, adds to thatfeeling, informing recipients that ``financial planners are alsorated far ahead of other professionals in job performance andqualifications.''   Still, it has a convincing ring to it, one that conceivablymight be verified in a survey of one's own neighbors or co-workers,all of whom have been observed to worry about these three areas oflife.   The three areas _ retirement, education and health _ share othertraits too.   All are categories of accelerating costs. All have become hugeburdens to business and government as well as to families. And allthree are costs that repeatedly seem to defy solution. Littlewonder that people hide from them!   The categories, along with housing costs in one form or another,are among the social challenges for which individuals most oftenseek assistance from government or business, from the latter in theform of employee benefits.   The responses to coping with long-term medical payments for afamily member seemed especially significant.   Respondents thought the possibility was quite high _ it rated3.4 on a scale of 5 _ and said they hoped to pay the bills from thepatient's savings or retirement funds, from insurance and fromSocial Security or Medicare.   Only 11 percent of 1,000 respondents said they would use theirown savings or wages to cover the cost.   When those who cited insurance coverage were asked if the policywould specifically provide for long-term care only 15 said yes.Another 27 said they didn't know.   According to Robert J. Oberst, the association's treasurer,people are confused about what their policies will cover. ``Unlessspecifically bought for long-term care, most policies will notcover it,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday, July 27</NOTE></DOC>
