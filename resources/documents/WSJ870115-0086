Much of the increase from November, especially the 16.2% surge in auto sales, probably reflected a rush by consumers to make major purchases before repeal of the sales-tax deduction took effect at the beginning of the year.    Separately, it was reported that U.S. car sales in early January tumbled 38.4% from the year-earlier period to the slowest pace in more than four years. The plunge was linked to late 1986's artificially high sales, which were also inflated by financing incentives.    But many economists say the retail-sales report as a whole indicated strength beyond tax-law considerations.    &quot;I was struck by the breadth of the increase in non-auto sales,&quot; said Martin Mauro, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. in New York. Excluding autos, sales increased a brisk 0.9% last month after a 0.3% gain the month before. Auto sales fell 3.4% in November.    &quot;Consumers were spending at a more rapid pace in December,&quot; Mr. Mauro said, &quot;and it wasn't entirely attributable to tax considerations.&quot;    Robert Ortner, undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, said the surge in autos stemmed largely from the tax change and predicted that auto sales would be soft in the first quarter. But he said the rise excluding cars represented &quot;normal, solid, healthy spending.&quot;    Mr. Mauro said his view of the December showing was tempered somewhat by the large revision to the November figure. The latest report said sales fell 0.6% in November; previously the department said November sales rose 0.5%.    The retail sales report follows two Labor Department reports last week showing a drop in the unemployment rate, a stronger-than-expected rise in payroll employment and stable producer prices in December.    Sales for all of 1986 rose 5.2%, as consumer purchasing power was buoyed by the oil-price plunge and incentive financing programs by auto dealers. Economists generally expect growth to be more moderate this year. Sales rose 6.3% in 1985.    Sales of building materials rose 1.8% last month after falling 1.3% in November. Furniture stores posted a 0.6% rise after a 0.2% gain. Department-store sales were up 1.2% after declining 0.5%. Food stores had a 0.8% sales rise in each month.    Overall, sales of durable goods, which are intended to last three years or more, rose 10.2% in December after falling 2% in November. Sales of nondurable goods climbed 0.8% after a 0.3% rise.    For the year as a whole, sales of building materials registered the biggest gain of any category, rising 16.1%. The increase reflected strong home-building activity early in the year. Sales at gasoline stations were down 14.3%, as a result of price declines. Retail sales data aren't adjusted for inflation, although the monthly figures are adjusted for predictable seasonal variations.    Also, the department's retail sales estimates are based on a relatively small sample of reports and frequently are revised substantially as more data are collected. The numbers exclude spending on services, which accounts for a large portion of consumer outlays.    Retail sales last month totaled $126.26 billion, up from $120.94 billion in November. December sales were 8.1% above a year earlier.    For all of 1986, sales rose to $1.445 trillion from $1.374 trillion in 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
