The lockup, which would give KKR the right to buy four of Macmillan's best businesses should its merger with Macmillan fall through, had been challenged by Maxwell Communication Corp. The lockup was granted to KKR as part of its $90.05-a-share merger agreement with Macmillan, which was approved by Macmillan's board Sept. 27. Two days later, Maxwell amended its tender offer to $90.25 a share.    The Delaware Court also conditionally overturned Macmillan's shareholder rights -- or poison-pill -- plan, which Maxwell had challenged. But that decision is a hollow victory for Maxwell because the lockup would make a takeover prohibitively expensive for Maxwell.    Robert S. Pirie, president of Rothschild Inc., Maxwell's U.S. investment bank, said the lockup would cost any acquirer besides KKR $250 million, or about $8 a share, in taxes. &quot;We can't go ahead with the lockup&quot; in place, said Mr. Pirie, adding that Maxwell would probably file an appeal.    Representatives of Macmillan and KKR were elated with the court's decision. A Macmillan spokesman described it as &quot;a pretty positive development.&quot; A KKR spokesman called it &quot;a big victory&quot; and said KKR was prepared to complete its tender offer tonight. Both KKR's and Maxwell's tender offers are scheduled to expire at 12:01 tomorrow.    In his opinion, Vice Chancellor Jack Jacobs said that Maxwell had failed to prove that the breakup fees and expenses granted to KKR by Macmillan, which Maxwell had also challenged, were &quot;execessive or inequitably impeded the auction.&quot;    At the heart of Maxwell's request for injunctive relief was its belief that an auction, which had been held for Macmillan the evening of Sept. 26, was unfair. Judge Jacobs concurred with Maxwell that the auction left &quot;much to be desired and was deficient in certain respects,&quot; but he did not agree that it had been so unfair that Maxwell had been deprived of a fair opportunity to submit its highest bid.    Judge Jacobs acknowledged that the question of the fairness and efficacy of the auction was a difficult one. Although the auction was supposed to be &quot;blind,&quot; meaning neither side would know the other's bid, Macmillan officials disclosed Maxwell's bid to KKR. Maxwell claimed that the disclosure of its bid, along with the failure of the auctioneer to give it information that would help elicit its highest bid, made the playing field anything but level.    If measured in terms of abstract fairness to bidders, Judge Jacobs said, the auction &quot;was hardly even-handed or neutral.&quot; But he pointed out that the auction did &quot;achieve significant value,&quot; and the difference in value between Maxwell's and KKR's bid is at most 58 cents a share. Furthermore, Mr. Jacobs concluded, the auction processes weren't used &quot;to mislead or otherwise wrongfully induce&quot; Maxwell not to submit its highest bid.    Although the Delaware courts have a history of upholding &quot;poison pill&quot; plans, Judge Jacobs said Macmillan's no longer served any purpose because the two highest bids, both of them at fair prices, were on the table. Keeping the rights in place, he said, would deprive shareholders of the opportunity to consider the alternatives.    The court's decision was released after the stock market closed. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Macmillan closed unchanged at $88.75. </TEXT></DOC>
