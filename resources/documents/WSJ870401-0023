Under terms of the agreement, Shandwick will make an initial capital infusion of $3.5 million and may make other payments for a total of $15 million over the next four years.    The acquisition will allow Rogers andamp; Cowan to expand, said Warren Cowan, chairman of the closely held concern. Rogers andamp; Cowan will continue to operate under its own name.    Mr. Cowan said the firm had revenue of nearly $11 million last year, but had &quot;a slow year&quot; in terms of net income. He declined to elaborate. He said the firm's earnings problems stemmed from its acquisition in January 1986 of Rogers andamp; Associates, a public relations firm operated by Ronald J. Rogers, son of Henry Rogers, one of the founders of Rogers andamp; Cowan. The combination was dissolved eight months later.    Rogers andamp; Cowan's clients include Paul Newman, Sylvester Stallone, and Aaron Spelling Productions. Shandwick's clients include Beecham Group, Nestle S.A., and Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. </TEXT></DOC>
