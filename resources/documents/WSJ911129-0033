C. Olivetti andamp; Co.'s failed attemptsto buy the state software company Finsiel S.p.A. will forceOlivetti to rethink its own software division's strategy.   The Italian state holding company, Istituto per laRicostruzione Industriale, rejected two Olivetti offers forFinsiel this month on the ground that the software businessrepresents a major growth sector for state industry. The IRIdecision marks the first major setback for Carlo DeBenedetti, Olivetti's chairman and largest shareholder, afterannouncing earlier this month that he was taking backday-to-day control of his embattled computer company.</LP><TEXT>   Olivetti officials believe that its software business,Olivetti Information Services, is too small and relies tooheavily on its domestic base to stay competitive on its own.Thus it needs to expand, they believe. As a result, Mr. DeBenedetti strongly urged IRI to sell Finsiel, so that itcould be merged with Olivetti Information to form a larger,more viable software company.   With Finsiel's expected revenue of 1.3 trillion lire($1.07 billion) this year and Olivetti Information's 1990sales of 670 billion lire, the two together would have formeda two-trillion-lira company, giving it a strong base fromwhich to expand into the European market that neither so farhave cultivated.   The rejection of the Olivetti offers by IRI ChairmanFranco Nobili has led Mr. De Benedetti to declare publiclythat any prospect of a linkup has now vanished. Mr. DeBenedetti complained before a parliamentary committee thisweek that the Italian government lacks a strategy for thecomputer sector that would enable it to ride out the toughmarket conditions facing many major manufacturers.   &quot;The whole of the Italian computer sector is at acrossroads,&quot; said Mr. De Benedetti. &quot;Either it develops, orit will disappear.&quot;   A takeover of Finsiel would have given OlivettiInformation valuable access to the large Italianpublic-sector market for software contracts, which isdominated by Finsiel. Now that that option has disappeared,the unit will be forced to look abroad for potentialacquisitions to fuel its growth. &quot;They need to expand theirsoftware business so it becomes a bigger part of the Olivettigroup,&quot; said Peter Knox, computer analyst at London brokerUBS Phillips andamp; Drew.   Olivetti Information accounted for 5.3% of Olivetti grouprevenue in 1990 and was the group's fastest-expanding unit inthe first half of this year. But company officials believethat the division still lacks critical mass.   Aside from expanding, one option would be to sell theunit. But Olivetti officials insist that a sale isn't beingactively negotiated. On Wednesday the company issued a tersedenial of press reports that Olivetti Information was beingsold to Cap Gemini Sogeti, a French concern.   Whatever the future for Olivetti Information, the Finsieltalks have been a disappointing first test case for Mr. DeBenedetti since deciding just over two weeks ago to step backin as full-time executive chairman.   His move is aimed at turning Olivetti around after thecompany reported a 73.7 billion-lira loss for the first halfof this year, its first such deficit in 13 years. Olivettihas slashed its work force by 15% but is still sufferingtight profit margins as a result of the highly competitivestate of the computer industry.</TEXT></DOC>
