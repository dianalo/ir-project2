 This paperdocuments experiences at the IBM Myers Corners Laboratory MVS Interactiveprogramming area in putting the Defect Prevention Process theories intopractice.andP;  This paper begins with the proposal to adopt the Defect PreventionProcess at the Myers Corners Laboratory in Poughkeepsie, New York, and ourexperiences thus far.andP;  It is our belief that other organizations can benefitfrom our experiences by understanding how the Defect Prevention Process canbe adapted to best meet the needs of any organization.andM;The software development business is becoming more and more competitivedaily.andP;  The IBM Corporation, for example, is developing more function inshorter time.andP;  Increasing productivity is critical in the softwaredevelopment field.andP;  Rework and testing call upon a significant amount ofresources.andP;  To reduce the development cycle time, IBM program developers havebeen studying ways to reduce error injection rates.andM;The Defect Prevention Process is a key result of these studies and involves athree-step process--kickoff meetings, causal analysis, and action teammeetings--to ensure that defects do not recur.andP;  [1,2]  Kickoff meetings areheld at the beginning of each work phase to review and prepare for theupcoming phase.andP;  Process changes, common errors, techniques, and tools areall highlighted at this meeting.andP;  Causal analysis meetings are held toanalyze defects and their underlying causes, and to create action items thatwill prevent those types of errors in the future.andP;  Action teams evaluate,prioritize, and implement the suggested actions.andM;Implementation of the Defect Prevention Process is expected to reduce thenumber of defects that are injected into a product, until all defects areprevented.andP;  The ability to eliminate defects is increased as more activitiesare automated.andP;  Implementing a process involves more than a mereunderstanding of the philosophies of that process.andP;  It requires anunderstanding of how to incorporate those philosophies into the everyday workenvironment.andP;  This paper illustrates how the Defect Prevention Process can beadapted and modified to suit organizations other than our own.andM;Productivity Task ForceandM;During the spring of 1988, a group known as the Productivity Task Force wasorganizaed and given the objective to increase productivity at the MyersCorners Laboratory by 100 percent over the next two to three years.andP;  Thisobjective was later refined to that of completing the same function withequal or better quality in half the time with the same number of people.andM;Speakers representing organizations throughout the laboratory as well asother areas were invited by the task force to tell of their experiences intopic areas that might help the task force fulfill its objective.andP;  The topicsdiscussed included:andM;* Use of tools to improve productivityandM;* Team ownership of productsandM;* Software reuseandM;* Defect Prevention ProcessandM;The teams comprised members from all areas involved in the developmentprocess--design, development, test, information development, project office,and management.andP;  The initial findings of the task force showed thatproductivity enhancements were being implemented in pockets, meaning thatthere was minimal sharing of ideas and tools among the differentorganizations in laboratory.andP;  The Defect Prevention Process was one of thepromising items for more comprehensive productivity improvements.andP;  The DefectPrevention Process was just starting to be used in other organizations, and apilot project was selected for implementation at our laboratory.andM;A parallel work group composed of representatives from various organizationsat the Myers Corners Laboratory was working to identify the actions necessaryto implement the Defect Prevention Process in the laboratory.andP;  TheProductivity Task Force selected the MVS Interactive programming organizationas the pilot project and allowed the Defect Prevention Process work group todetermine the implementation details.andM;Defect Prevention Process work group proposalandM;The Defect Prevention Process work group outlined the purpose, organization,and follow-on work for each phase of the process--causal analysis, actionteams, and kickoff meetings.andM;Causal analysis.andP;  The purpose of causal analysis is to learn from the errorsmade by analyzing the root cause of the error and generating action items toprevent those errors in the future.andP;  These action items most commonly involveprocess changes, communication enhancements, enhancements to existing toolsand languages, education requirements, changes to the product themselves,requests for new tools, and creation or improvement of documentation.andP;  Thesemeetings are held on a team basis as necessary and organized by the teamleader.andM;One of the objectives of the Defect Prevention Process education is to trainpeople to lead causal analysis meetings.andP;  The leader of a causal analysismeeting should remain objective and involve all participants in thediscussion without becoming involved in the content directly.andP;  The leader'ssole responsibility is to make the meeting run smoothly and effectively, sothat all ideas are heard.andP;  Although some people had already been through theformal Defect Prevention Process training, most of those in the laboratorystill needed to be educated.andP;  The instructors were brought in to educate thepeople in those areas that had agreed to use the Defect Prevention Process.andO;The formal training has the added benefit of generating enthusiasm amongthose who take the class.andM;A database was needed to recorded suggested actions in an easy and efficientmanner.andP;  A database system known as the Defect Prevention System (DPS) wasdeveloped in Raleigh for this purpose.andP;  This system has proved itself to bean excellent vehicle for the entry, tracking, and resolution of suggestedactions.andM;Action teams.andP;  Action teams act on the items suggested at causal analysis.andP;  Ahierarchy of action teams as created for the Myers Corners Laboratory isshown in Figure 1.andP;  This structure was defined to best represent the needs ofthe laboratory.andP;  The bottom of the chart represents the local-area actionteams.andP;  Each local action team represents people who work together to build aspecific product and thus face common problems.andP;  Although each of the localareas in the laboratory follows the same development process philosophies,each area interprets these philosophies in a slightly different manner tobest meet the needs of the product being developed.andP;  Local action teams areresponsible for analyzing all suggested actions that are generated from theareas they represent.andP;  The teams take those actions that can be whollycontained within each area.andM;Many of the suggested actions cannot be handled at the local action teamlevel because they involve the commitment of resources outside a given area.andO;These actions are forwarded to higher-level action teams, which arethemselves members of the Myers Corners Laboratory Action Team Council.andP;  Theresponsibilities of the higher-level teams are again to evaluate andimplement actions forwarded to them, and to facilitate communication amongthe local action teams.andM;This structure ensures that action items are implemented encompassing theproper scope.andP;  The local-area teams are free to evaluate and prioritizeactions that affect their area in a timely fashion and the higher-level teamreflects committed resources to handle actions of a more general nature.andP;  Allaction team assignees were taken from a pool of volunteers who allocated 10percent of their time toward action team duties.andM;Kickoff meetings and kickoff packages.andP;  Kickoff meetings are held on a teambasis and allow the team leaders to prepared their teams for upcoming workphases.andP;  Kickoff packages are used at kickoff meetings to document thephilosophies and methodologies of each work phase.andP;  This ensures that theteam achieves maximum readiness for the work ahead and is aware of processchanges that have been incorporated.andP;  Each local-area action team isresponsible for creating and maintaining the kickoff packages itsorganization needs.andM;Starting the Defect Prevention Process in MVSandM;InteractiveandM;The MVS Interactive programming area represents nine first-line departments,consisting of approximately one hundred programmers, and is represented byone action team.andP;  This area is responsible for the development and test ofseveral IBM products.andP;  These varied responsibilities are dispersed across allthe first-line departments.andP;  Some of the products developed in MVSInteractive follow strict software engineering principles and well-definedsoftware reuse techniques, whereas other products do not.andP;  The entireorganization, however, has agreed to implement the Defect Prevention Process.andO;Our experience shows that the Defect Prevention Process can be applied to anarea that does not follow a common software development process.andP;  Thecommunication that has resulted from the Defect Prevention Process is helpingthe area converge on an improved software development process.andM;The first step toward implementing the Defect Prevention Process in one areawas to identify a manager who was interested in making the Defect PreventionProcess a success.andP;  Management's commitment to the Defect Prevention Processis key to success.andP;  In our laboratory, management has fully supported theactivities in the Defect Prevention Process.andP;  Managers have participated incausal analysis meetings when appropriate, while allowing employees the timenecessary to be a member of an action team.andP;  Management has funded theactivities of the action teams and has provided funding for enhancements totools or for the development of new ones.andP;  They have also funded education,newsletters, and other related activities.andP;  Management has been key inendorsing the Defect Prevention Process and ensuring that it becomes anintegral part of the MVS Interactive organization's development process.andP;  Itis widely recognized that by reducing the number of errors injected intosoftware during the development life cycle, the quality of the product isimproved and productivity increased.andM;The management representative proceeded to solicit volunteers forparticipation in the MVS Interactive organization action team.andP;  Severalemployees in the organization had attended the Defect Prevention Processclass and either volunteered for participation or encouraged others to do so.andO;The next step was to hold regularly scheduled action team meetings andimplement actions to communicate and incorporate the methodologies of theDefect Prevention Process into the development process.andM;Causal analysis.andP;  Members of the action team facilitated many of the earlycausal analysis sessions.andP;  As people in the area become more experienced withthe process, however, this participation has declined.andP;  A proposal to includecausal analysis sessions and kickoff meetings as a part of the developmentprocess was presented to and approved by management.andP;  When developers seetheir suggested actions being implemented, they are more enthusiastic aboutholding these meetings.andM;Kickoff packages and meetings.andP;  The action team decided that acompetent-level design kickoff package should be developed first, becausethat was the phase that most of the organization was entering.andP;  The primaryobjective of component level design is to put into place and document aformalized design.andP;  This design defines the structure and behavior of asingle component, focusing on the definition of functions and state data.andO;Interfaces between functions are also defined.andP;  The component-level design isbased on the overall product design, as defined in the product-level design.andO;Whereas the product-level design emphasized the function and interfaces ofcomponents for the entire product, the component-level design emphasizes thefunctions and interfaces of a subset of the product design at a greater levelof detail.andP;  The IBM raleigh laboratory's component-level design kickoffpackage was used as a base that was modified to reflect the MVS Interactiveprocess.andP;  As more kickoff packages were created, a standard was defined thathas been accepted by other local action teams.andP;  The implementation of theseaction items helped to make the Defect Prevention Process an integral part ofthe MVS Interactive development process by using kickoff packages as thesource of information of all states in the development process.andM;Structure and implementationandM;Causal analysis.andP;  MVS Interactive has found it useful to hold causal analysissessions both as part of the development process and to address specificproblems.andP;  MVS Interactive management has endorsed the incorporation ofcausal analysis and kick off meetings into the development schedules so thattime may be allocated to perform these functions.andP;  Causal analysis meetingsmust be held at a minimum of once during a development phase.andP;  However, theymay be held as often as necessary.andP;  These meetings are coordinated by teamleaders and are held at a team level.andP;  Each team decides how they want toimplement their causal analysis sessions to meet their specific needs.andO;Participation by team members is voluntary.andM;Causal analysis meetings are also scheduled to address specific problems.andO;One such problem is that to reduce the product cycle time, defects in thesubprocesses must be eliminated.andP;  Other causal analysis sessions have beenheld on the reuse process, specification process, Authorized Program AnalysisReport (APAR) certification process, and many other subprocesses.andP;  A causalanalysis meeting can be held to address anything that is making it moredifficult for people to do their work.andP;  Causal analysis sessions on specificproblems are often coordinated by the action team, which assures adequaterepresentation from all affected areas, and the team often leads the meeting.andM;Although managers are not usually involved in causal analysis sessions thatare part of the normal development process, they often participate in thecausal analysis sessions on specific problems.andP;  Causal analysis sessionsinvolve all persons involved with a given problem, including both managersand developers.andP;  The team approach gives managers and developers a forum forworking together to improve the development process at all levels.andM;Causal analysis sessions are no more than two hours long.andP;  The firsthour-and-a-half period is used to discuss defects, their root causes, andactions to take to prevent them.andP;  The last half hour is used to discussgeneral trends.andP;  It is often useful to ask the question &quot;What went right?&quot; toensure that the positive aspects of the process are maintained.andM;As an aid in recording the proceedings of a causal analysis meeting, atemplate has been created for use with a personal computer (PC) functioningas an editor.andP;  The organization owns several PC convertibles that are used atthese meetings.andP;  Figure 2 shows a template that the coordinator of themeeting uses to send minutes of the meeting to all participants easily andquickly.andP;  The Defect Prevention System is being enhanced to automaticallyupload this file, thereby saving considerable time and effort.andM;Actions may also be submitted to the action team in the form of miscellaneousactions and need not be associated with a causal analysis session.andO;Developers often talk over lunch about how such and such might have beenprevented if such and such had happened.andP;  In the past, these ideas were lostbecause there was no formal vehicle through which these ideas might beconsidered.andP;  Now the developer can submit ideas as miscellaneous actions forthe action team's attention.andP;  During the early implementation of the DefectPrevention Process, most of the actions have been of this type.andP;  As morecausal analysis meetings are held, this trend will change.andM;MVS Interactive area action team.andP;  The MVS Interactive action team hsrepresentatives from development, test, management, performance, informationdevelopment, vendor management, and process.andP;  The composition of the actionteam has changed significantly since the team began operations.andP;  Itsmembership now offers the best representation of the organization and willkeep changing to meet that objective.andP;  The team started with only twodevelopers, and more developers have joined as actions relating to design andcode increased.andP;  If the scope of the actions should change significantly, sowill the team.andP;  Two management representatives are on the team to ensuremanagement participation at all times.andM;Because the MVS Interactie developers work with vendors, representation fromvendor management is required.andP;  Many actions dealing with the vendor processhave been implemented.andM;Although there are two process representatives on the team, they serve verydifferent functions.andP;  The MVS Interactive organization has a processrepresentative who is responsible for tracking all process-related activitiesin the area.andP;  The Defect Prevention Process is a large part of thoseactivities.andP;  The other process representative is a member of the ProgrammingMethodology Department.andP;  This department participates on the action team tohelp improve the software development process and is an active member of theteam.andP;  The Programming Methodology Department has been instrumental inimplementing the Defect Prevention Process throughout the laboratory bycoordinating education, installing tools, and implementing actions thataffect the entire laboratory.andM;All team members have equal voice, equal decision-making power, and freedomto make recommendations.andP;  the resolutions are made by consensus.andP;  Actions areassigned on a volunteer basis.andP;  Members of the team have areas of expertise,but the volunteer system ensures that actions are implemented quickly.andO;People often volunteer for actions that eliminate defects they findpersonally irritating.andP;  Although there is little pressure on team members tohave the actions completed, progress is tracked and actions are oftenreassigned when a particular member's workload increases.andP;  No distinction ismade between management and nonmanagement members.andP;  The team is truly a team.andM;The MVS Interactive process representative typically schedules and leads themeetings.andP;  Action team meetings are scheduled bimonthly, at a time that doesnot interfere with the members' primary responsibilities.andM;A typical agenda for an action team meeting begins with the evaluation,prioritization, and assignment of the new action items.andP;  Next, actions thatare ready to be closed are discussed to ensure that the implementation willindeed prevent the defect and ensure that the development process continuesto improve.andP;  All implemented actions are considered for cost effectivenesssuggestion.andP;  Finally, the status of the assigned actions is given.andP;  The mostimportant aspect of the action team is that it is free to modify itself asnecessary to meet the needs of the organization.andM;Kickoff packages and meetings.andP;  All products developed in the MVS Interactivearea follow a similar process.andP;  For each phase of this process, a kickoffpackage has been developed.andP;  The packages provide an interpretation of thestandard IBM programming process [3] as it pertains to MVS Interactive.andM;Section 1 of the kickoff package contains the change activity of thedocument.andP;  Many different teams use the kickoff packages, so it is importantto highlight all the changes that were made.andP;  these can be high-lighted atkickoff meetings.andP;  A kickoff package is one vehicle in which the action teamcan communicate the process changes that have occurred.andP;  The change activityis kept in a table that tells the date the change was made, has an abstractof the change, and references the action that prompted the change.andP;  Thisprovides an easy way to understand the justification for all process changes.andM;Section 2 of the kickoff package contains process information intended toexplain the philosophies of that particular work phase.andP;  The philosophyincludes the purpose of the work stage, the entry and exit criteria,chekcpoints, task descriptions, and validation methods.andP;  Section 3 providesdetails specific to the way in which the philosophies documented in section 2are implemented.andP;  It is ecpected that this section will change with eachiteration of the product cycle as we continually learn to do things better.andO;Finally, section 4 contains reference information to assist in the completionof these tasks.andP;  These materials include tools, common error lists for thatwork phase, checklists, and related documents.andP;  The kickoff packages are usedas part of the development process and are considered living documents thatare changed often.andP;  This encourages the developers to view development as aliving and dynamic process that is being constantly improved.andM;The MVS Interactive action team owns the kickoff packages and is responsiblefor maintaining the accuracy of the packages.andP;  The packages are on line andare available to everyone in the laboratory.andP;  Packages for the major workphases, product-level design, component-level design, module-level design,code, unit test, variation identification, test-case development, andtest-case execution have already been developed or are currently underdevelopment.andP;  Kickoff packages are also being written for the specificationprocess, project leadership, and APAR certification subprocesses, as well asothers as needed.andM;Tools.andP;  The Defect Prevention System is a tool that was brought to the MyersCorners Laboratory from the Raleigh laboratory and is supported by theProgramming Methodology Department.andP;  The MVS Interactive area was assigned aproduct ID and given access to the tool.andP;  This tool is used to document thedescription and status of each action.andM;An action item is created by entering it into the system, either associatedwith a causal analysis session or as a miscellaneous action.andP;  Initialinformation includes the description of the action and the suggester's name,node, and ID.andP;  The action is automatically assigned a status of NEW, and allaction team members receive notification that a new action has been written.andM;After the action has been discussed by the action team and assigned to amember, this member is responsible for keeping the status and all relatedinformation up to date in the system.andP;  Any member of the organization can usethe Defect Prevention System to see the status of any action item.andM;When an action is updated, modified, or closed, a notification is sent to thesuggester and to all action team members.andM;The rational behind rejecting an action is saved as part of the history ofthe action.andP;  This information can be used at a later date if the action hasto be reopened.andP;  For example, when an action is rejected because of its cost,it can be reopened if the defect is pervasive and other measures have notbeen successful in preventing it.andP;  In other words, the tool can be used tobuild business cases for implementing expensive actions.andM;When an action is implemented, information about the effectiveness to preventthe defect and the cost of implementation are input directly into the DefectPrevention System.andP;  This information can be used to generate reports on thebenefits and costs of the process improvement.andM;Communication.andP;  The MVS Interactive action team is responsible forcommunicating all Defect Prevention Process activities to the organization.andO;An action is not considered closed until the implementation of that actionhas been cummunicated to all affected parties.andP;  The kickoff packages documentmany of the process changes, and a monthly newsletter is published tohighlight both Defect Prevention Process news and general information.andO;Anyone is free to submit an article for publication that is felt to be ofgeneral interest to the community.andM;Other action teams.andP;  When the MVS Interactive action team analyzes an actionthat is beyond the scope of the action team to implement, that action isforwarded to the appropriate action team.andP;  The Myers Corners LaboratoryAction Council and Tools Action Team are commonly the receivers of thoseactions.andP;  MVS Interactive has a representative on each of these action teams.andO;Actions may also be transferred from one action team to another.andP;  The DefectPrevention System is being enhanced to allow action items to be automaticallytransferred across different products.andM;Myers Corners Laboratory Action Council.andP;  The Myers Corners Laboratory ActionCouncil is the highest level action team at the laboratory.andP;  It isresponsible for those actions that are beneficial to everyone who works atMyers Corners.andP;  These actions typically involve education and laboratory-wideprocess changes.andP;  The action council is also responsible for communicatingthe activities of the various local teams throughout the laboratory.andP;  Theaction council has representation from each local area, management, the toolsgroup, education, and the Programming Methodology Department.andP;  This ensuresthat all discussion during the action council meetings truly reflect theneeds of the entire laboratory.andP;  Each member of the council has a backup toensure representation at all meetings.andM;The local-area representatives are responsible for explaining the actionsthat were forwarded from their respective action teams.andP;  In addition, thelocal-area representatives are involved in evaluating and prioritizingactions not from their area.andP;  The pervasiveness and importance of actionitems can be determined during the council meetings.andP;  Often one area hasfaced a similar problem and has implemented an action to prevent thatproblem.andM;The managers on the council represent the laboratory director and areinstrumental in giving direction and obtaining resources to implementsuggested actions.andP;  Participation in the action council helps providemanagement with a first-hand appreciation of the problems that are beingfaced by the general community at Myers Corners Laboratory.andP;  Managementactively participates in developing solutions to problems.andP;  Activeparticipation provides highly visible participation by management as part ofthe team, helping to eliminate us-and-them perceptions.andM;The process, tools, and education representatives gain deeper insight intothe problems of the user community.andP;  Participation on the action team givesthem added perspective with which to perform their duties.andM;All members of the action council are responsible for implementing thoseactions assigned to them and communicating action council activities to theirorganizations.andM;Communication is a vital responsibility, and the council has several vehiclesfor promoting information throughout the laboratory.andP;  First, the meetingsthemselves are opportunities for representatives from different organizationsto meet and talk to one another incredible amount of information is sharedduring the meetings.andP;  Problems that one area is experiencing have often beensolved in anotherandgt; people can now contact one another directly.andM;The council also has more formal ways of communicating.andP;  Myers CornersLaboratory publishes a quarterly newsletter titled Technical Vitality.andP;  Onemember of the council is responsible for writing an article for thisnewsletter every quarter.andP;  These articles highlight work being done in thelaboratory that relates to the Defect Prevention Process.andP;  In addition, aDefect Prevention Process bulletin board has been created.andP;  Each month adifferent action team is responsible for posting on this board informationabout what their action team is doing.andM;The action council also maintains three on-line conferencing files, Calledforums, for Defect Prevention Process information.andP;  These conferencing filescan be updated by anyone in the laboratory and items can be searched, viewed,or printed.andP;  Any Myers Corners Laboratory employee can subscribe to a forumto ensure that all updates are sent to that person's mail.andP;  Action teammembers can subscribe to the ATEAM forum for hints and tips on running actionteam meetings, creating kickoff packages, and so forth.andP;  The DefectPrevention System forum contains information about the Defect PreventionSystem and answers questions new users might be having.andP;  Finally, DEFECTPcontains information that has surfaced through the Defect Prevention Processthat might be interesting to anyone in the laboratory.andP;  Other action teamscan put their common errors lists and similar items on this forum.andP;  TheRaleigh laboratory maintains a company-wide forum to discuss DefectPrevention Process information that is common to all laboratoriesimplementing the process.andP;  The action council is continuously workin on waysto improve communication in the laboratory and reduce the amount of reworkdone by the various organizations.andM;Myers Corners Laboratory Tools Action Team.andP;  An aim of the causal analysissessions is to determine those action items that will automatically eliminatea defect from ever reoccurring.andP;  Automatic eliminate is the most effectiveaction item that can be generated.andP;  Because of this focus, many toolenhancements and new tool requirements have been generated.andP;  The MyersCorners Laboratory has a laboratory-level tools group responsible for thedevelopment and maintenance of all tools.andP;  A tool-requirement action team wasformed to meet the growing number of tool-related action items.andP;  This actionteam has representation similar to that of the action council.andP;  This teamevaluates and prioritizes all tool requirements for Myers Corners Laboratory,not just those generated by the Defect Prevention Process.andP;  This ensures thatthe prioritization of the requirements takes all factors into consideration.andM;Local-area representatives are responsible for the justification and specificrequirements for a tool request.andP;  Tool area representatives are responsiblefor implementing most of the actions.andP;  Again, management lends direction,helps obtain resources, and actively participates in resolution of problems.andO;Tools, process, and education are most often handled at the laboratory level,but the local-area teams implement actions in these areas that are specificto their areas.andP;  The action council and Tools Action Team represent committedresources to implement actions far-ranging in scope.andP;  They give the MyersCorners community a place to have their suggestions implemented.andM;BenefitsandM;The MVS Interactive organization has already realized many benefits from theDefect Prevention Process.andP;  It is very difficult to quantitatively measurethe benefits of the process because of the short time it has been in effect.andO;We expect to see, as the Raleigh laboratory has seen, a reduction in errorsacross the whole development process.andP;  We have, however, seen manyqualitative improvements already.andM;The MVS Interactive action team has implemented actions ranging from thedevelopment of a guide, to vending a software product, to standardizingdocument tags so that all documents can be easily printed.andP;  An expert reviewprocess was established to ensure that all specifications are thoroughlyreviewed by appropriate areas.andP;  Focal points have been established to ensurethat activities are carried out in a ccordinated fashion.andP;  Projects haveestablished file naming conventions, so that information is easilyaccessible.andP;  Each action that is implemented allows the organization to learnfrom its mistakes and ensure that those mistakes will not be made in thefuture.andP;  The action team has filled the void of having committed resourcesfocused on prevention instead of detection.andM;All development areas are required to document their process, and often thisis in the form of a process notebook.andP;  These process notebooks are large andhard to use.andP;  The ownership is vague, the notebook is infrequently reviewed,and the information quickly becomes inaccurate.andP;  Once the notebook is out ofdate, the users no longer trust the information contained in it, and theprocess becomes undocumented.andP;  The result of this is that the process itselfbecomes vague and hard to change.andP;  When the process becomes undefined,productivity declines, because the benefits of having a clearly definedprocess are lost.andP;  Responsibilities are no longer clearly defined andcommunication can break down.andP;  The Defect Prevention Process kickoff packageshelp keep this information up to date.andM;The Defect Prevention Process itself continually changes to best meet theneeds of the laboratory.andP;  Many action items have been written to improve theway the process is implemented, including requirements against the DefectPrevention System and actions to improve communication of Defect PreventionProcess throughout the laboratory.andP;  The dynamic characteristics of the DefectPrevention Process have been transferred to the development process by meansof the kickoff packages.andM;The kickoff packages are small documents created to provide information on aspecific task.andP;  They define the philosophies and methodologies of the taskgiving the user of the package both the knowledge needed to perform thespecific task and the reason for doing it.andP;  Responsibilities are defined sothat the user knows just what to do.andP;  The reference sections provideinformation that facilitates those tasks.andP;  reviews of these packages are anecessary part of the development processandgt; hence, the packages (and theprocesses themselves) are continually updated to remain both accurate andeffective.andP;  The user of the package can easily identify the process changesand the justification for those changes.andP;  By understanding the defect aprocess change is intended to elimiante, the developer becomes more aware ofquality considerations.andM;Users of the kickoff packages are now both the author and audience of thepackages.andP;  The MVS Interactive action team has received updates to kickoffpackages while those packages were being developed.andP;  Accuracy is maintained,and the process stays clearly defined.andM;The causal analysis meetings have been effective in both increasing qualityawareness and encouraging people to consider how to improve their everydaywork environment.andP;  The management support of the Defect Prevention Processhas turned the focus away from finding errors to preventing those errors.andO;This is the best way to shorten the product cycle.andM;ConclusionandM;This paper shows how the MVS Interactive area used the Defect PreventionProcess to change the focus of the software development process to qualityawareness.andP;  Because our responsibilities are to develop a software product,the paper emphasizes defect prevention in software development.andP;  The DefectPrevention Process can be applied to tasks ranging from informationdevelopment, to the requirements process, to any task done in a cyclicalfashion.andP;  The dynamic nature of the process allows it to be adapted to a widerange of situations.andM;The flexibility of the Defect Prevention Process enhances its effectiveness.andO;It has the ability to change the mindset of the people performing andmanaging the work, which is the most important aspect of the work environmentto change.andP;  This is done by making people more conscious of the defects madeand harnessing their creative nature to prevent them.andP;  Who can betterunderstand how to eliminate defects than those making the mistakes?andP;  And whocan better find process improvements needed to make this possible than theprocess owners themselves?andM;The MVS Interactive organization strongly believes that we are only nowrealizing the potential of the Defect Prevention Process.andP;  As the processbecomes more ingrained at the Myers Corners Laboratory, we expect to see areduction of defects and improved communication leading to higher qualityproducts and increased productivity.andM;Cited referencesandM;[1.] C.
