Some families, an unspecified but apparently small number, havebeen told five teams are investigating and excavating sites whererelatives are believed to have crashed during air strikes between1964 and 1972. This is the fourth joint operation since October.   ``Due to privacy considerations of the affected families wecannot discuss the specifics,'' a statement from the U.S. delegationsaid. ``However, those families have been notified of theinvestigation and will be fully advised of the results.''   The two dozen U.S. specialists will be in Vietnam until Jan. 23and will leave with 25 sets of remains that are being prepared forrepatriation and identification at the U.S. Army laboratory inHawaii.   Previously, Vietnam had allowed only four U.S. teams in at atime. It has repatriated 63 sets of remains in the past month.   ``The U.S. government is pleased that Vietnam has agreed toexpand the ongoing effort from four to five teams,'' the Americandelegation said. ``The U.S. government appreciates the initiativetaken by Vietnam to repatriate these remains and hopes to continuethe increasing joint cooperation to resolve the long-standinghumanitarian issue.''   Nguyen Can, acting director of Vietnam's office for MIAs, thosemissing in action during the long war that ended in 1975, agreedthat cooperation has been good and the issue is humanitarian ratherthan political.   ``We don't want to use this as any kind of leverage because weunderstand the feelings of the American families whose loved onesdid not come home after the war,'' he said. ``We have our own MIAs,more than the United States.''   Can put the figure at 300,000.   ``We want to solve this question and let bygones be bygones'' hesaid. ``What's the good of keeping this alive? It would only let thespiritual wounds of war bleed, and that would not be helpful to anyunderstanding between the two people.''   Both governments have sought in public pronouncements to separatethe human side of the war from politics, but the MIA issue figuresinto the process of establishing the diplomatic relations Vietnamseeks.   Washington has said all Vietnamese troops must be removed fromCambodia before it will consider an exchange of ambassadors,economic aid and lifting the U.S. trade embargo.   Hanoi has said it will meet the requirement by the end of nextyear, perhaps sooner. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978,overthrowing the murderous Khmer Rouge regime of Pol Pot, and hasoccupied the neighboring country since.   The United States also has sent word to Vietnam that itscooperation in returning remains would be regarded favorably. In thepast, Vietnam slowed the search when it was angered by critical U.S.statements.   Can said some ``bad elements'' in southern Vietnam were``trafficking in remains'' by hiring people to dig in Vietnamesegraves, steal the remains and try to pass them off as American.   He said those Vietnamese mistakenly believed American remainswould get them entry visas to the United States or some other reward.   U.S. policy ``is to accept POW-MIA information from any source,''the American delegation said, but ``we do not view paying forremains as helpful to promoting government-to-government cooperationon accounting.''   ``Paying for remains would encourage scavenger activities atcrash sites by persons lacking the technical recovery knowledge,thus enormously complicating the U.S. government's ability torecover remains,'' the Americans said.   ``Similarly, the U.S. government does not provide refugeeresettlement as a reward for cooperation.''   Fewer than 10 percent of the remains of Americans listed asmissing in Indochina have been recovered since U.S. forces werewithdrawn from Vietnam in early 1973.   Vietnam has returned the remains of 172 Americans identified bythe Army laboratory. Another 2,383 are missing: 1,747 in Vietnam,547 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia and six in China.   U.S. officials acknowledge not all cases will be resolved,because much time has passed and many airmen were lost in jungleterrain or at sea.   The United States ``will continue its efforts to account for allmissing Americans,'' the delegation said.   ``We still have ongoing efforts to account for Americans missingfrom World War II and Korea. This solemn commitment to resolve thefate of missing Americans and to return all recoverable remains totheir native land will not be abandoned.''</TEXT></DOC>
