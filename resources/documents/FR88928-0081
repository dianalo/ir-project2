Notice of the draft Beaufort Sea II general permit was published September30, 1987, at 52 FR 36617. The permit will authorize discharges from exploratoryoperations in all area offered for lease by the U.S. Department of theInterior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) duirng Federal Lease Sale97. A general permit (49 FR 23734, June 7, 1984) was issued May 30, 1984,for all previous Beaufort Sea lease sales including Federal Lease Sales71 and 87, all contiguous inshore state lease sales, and joint Federal/StatesLease Sale BF. Some of the federal lease blocks offered by not leased inthese prior sales may be reoffered in Lease Sale 97. Any such lease blockswill be covered by today's Beaufort Sea II general pemit, as it reflectsRegion 10's most recent Ocean Discharge Criteria Evaluation.  The notice for the Chukchi Sea general permit was published January 29,1988, at 53 FR 2631. The Chukchi Sea permit will authorize discharges fromexploratory operations in all areas offered for lease by the U.S. Departmentof the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) during Federal LeaseSale 109.  The final Beaufort Sea II and Chukchi Sea general permits are being issuedconcurrently and notices of the final permits therefore have been combined.The response to comments on both permtis have also been combined into asingle document  These final permits establish effluent limitations, standards, prohibitions,and other conditions of discharges from facilities in the these areas.Copies of the permits are printed below. The conditions are based on materialcontained in the administrative record. A brief description of the basisfor the conditions and requirements of the final general permits is givenin the final notice and statement of basis published below.

These permits shall become effective on September 28, 1988. Ordinarily,EPA would issued these permits and allow 30 days before making the finalpermits effective. However, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1) EPA may make the permitseffective immediately because this relieves a restriction on the regulatedcommunity by authorizing the discharge of pollutants in compliance withthe terms of the permits. Without a permit, discharges of pollutants areprohibited under section 301 of the Clear Water Act. In addition, EPA findsthat good cause exists under section 553(d)(3) because a later effectivedate would result in significant economic loss due to delays in the commencementof exploratory drilling operations. The 30 period between the date of issuanceand the date of effectiveness affords on opportunity for administrativeappeal, and this procedure is not available for general permits  <T3>Requests for Coverage: </T3>Written request for authorization to dischargeunder the general permits shall be provided, as described in Part I.A.of the final permits, to EPA, Region 10, at least 60 days prior to initiationof discharges.

Introduction  </ITAG>The Regional Administrator of Region 10 is today issuing two final NPDESgeneral permits for discharges from oil and gas stratigraphic and explorationwells in federal waters offered for lease in OCS Lease Sales and 109. On September 30, 1987 (52 FR 36617), Region 10 published a noitice of thedraft permit for the Beaufort Sea II (Lease Sale 97). The Region publishedon January 29, 1988 (53 FR 2631) a notice of the draft permit for the ChukchiSea (Lease Sale 109). Comments and supporting documents on the draft BeaufortSea II and Chukchi Sea permits were received from 6 and 7 parties, respectively,No public hearings were held since no requests to hold them were received.All of the materials submitted during the public comment periods for bothdraft permits are included in the administrative record and were consideredin determining the conditions for today's final permits.Region 10 published detailed fact sheets for both the Beaufort Sea II draftpermit (52 <T3>FR</T3> 36617) and the Chukchi Sea draft permit (52 <T3>FR</T3> 2631). Section I of those fact sheets (General Permits andRequests for Individual NPDES Permits) is being incorporated by referencewithout change as part of the statement of basis for today's final permits.Section II (Covered Facilities and Nature of Discharges) has been includedin Secrtion II of this document. Section III (Statutory Basis for PermitConditions) is incorporated with minor changes which are discussed in SectionIII of today's notice. Section IV of today's notice briefly discusses thebasis for each of the conditions in the final permits and explains changesmade in response to comments and incorporates by reference Section IV ofthe fact sheets. The material in Sections II, III, and IV of the fact sheetsfor the draft permits should also be consulted concerning the applicabilityand scope of the final permit conditions.  Section V of the fact sheets for the draft permits discussed the requiredfinding made with respect to other legal requirements. Section V of today'snotice presents the necessary legal findings for the final permits.  A detailed listing of and response to comments on both permits is includedin the document entitled ``Response to Comments Received on the BeaufortSea II and Chukchi Sea Permits (NPDES General Permits AKG284100 and AKG288000,Respectively).'' The Comments and responses have not been printed in today'snotice because of their number and length. The document and original commentletters have been included in the administrative record for the permits.The document is being sent to all commenters and is available upon requestfrom EPA Region 10. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Covered Facilities and Nature of Discharges </ITAG>The general permits issued today authorize the discharge of drilling muds,drill cuttings, and associated operational wastewaters from exploratoryoperations in federal waters. Exploratory operations are defined as thoseoperations involving the drilling of wells to determine the nature of potentialhydrocarbon reserves. Under the permits, the number of wells from whichdischarges may occur is limited to a maximum of five at a single site.Exploration facilities covered by these general permits are included inthe Offshore Subcategory of the Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Categoy(40 CFR Part 435).  These general permits authorize the following discharges: Drilling mud;drill cuttings and washwater; deck drainage; sanitary wastes; domesticwastes; desalination unit wastes; blowout preventer fluid; boiler blowdown;fire control system test water; non-contact cooling water; uncontaminatedballast water; uncontaminated bilge water; excess cement slurry; mud cuttings;cement at the seafloor; and test fluids. Discriptions of discharges aregiven in Part II.A. of the permits. Drillings muds and cuttings are themajor pollutant sources discharged from exploratory drilling oprations.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Statutory Basis for Permit Conditions  </ITAG>Section III of the fact sheets for both the Beaufort Sea II and ChukchiSea draft permits are incorporated by reference, as supplemented and amendedbelow. A. Technology-Based Effluent Limitations  1. No changes are necessary.  2. BAT and BCT effluent limitations guidelines and New Source PerformanceStandards were proposed on August 26, 1985 (50 <T3>FR </T3>34592). Promulgation is currently expected to occur in March1990. B. Ocean Discharge Criteria  A separate Final Ocean Discharge Criteria Evaluation has been completedfor each of the Beaufort Sea II and Chukchi Sea lease sale areas. C. Section 308 of the Clean Water Act  No changes are necessary. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Specific Permit Conditions </ITAG>A. Approach  The determination of appropriate conditions for each discharge was accomplishedthrough:  (1) Consideration of technology-based effluent limitations to control conventionalpollutants under BCT.  (2) Consideration of technology-based effluent limitations to control toxicand nonconventional pollutants under BAT; and  (3) Evaluation of the Ocean Discharge Criteria for discharges in the OffshoreSubcategory, assuming conditions in (1) and (2), above, were in place. Discussions of the specific effluent limitations and monitoring requirementsderived from (1) through (3) appear below in sections B. through D., respectively.For convenience, these conditions and the regulatory basis for each arecross-referenced by discharge in the following table:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1>Discharge and Permit Condition </H1><H1>Statutory Basis</H1>Drilling muds and cuttings:<ITAG tagnum="3">Authorized muds and additives only</ITAG><D>BAT</D><ITAG tagnum="3">No oil-based muds</ITAG><D>BCT</D><ITAG tagnum="3">No diesel</ITAG><D>BAT</D><ITAG tagnum="3">10% max. oil content of cuttings</ITAG><D>BCT</D><ITAG tagnum="3">No free oil</ITAG><D>BCT</D><ITAG tagnum="3">3 mg/kg cadmium and 1 mg/kg mercury in barite</ITAG><D>BAT</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Monitor metals, oil content and toxicity</ITAG><D>Section 308</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Monitor volume discharged</ITAG><D>Section 308</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Chemical inventory</ITAG><D>Section 308</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Depth and area related discharge rate limits</ITAG><D>Section 403(c)</D>Deck drainage:<ITAG tagnum="3">No free oil</ITAG><D>BCT</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Monitor discharge rate</ITAG><D>Section 308</D>Sanitary wastes:<ITAG tagnum="3">No floating solids</ITAG><D>BCT</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Chlorine 1.0 mg/l (facilities with more than 10 people)</ITAG><D>BCT</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Monitor discharge rate</ITAG><D>Section 308</D>Domestic wastes:<ITAG tagnum="3">No floating solids</ITAG><D>BCT</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Monitor discharge rate</ITAG><D>Section 308</D>Miscellaneous discharges (Discharges 006 to 014 in the permit):<ITAG tagnum="3">No free oil</ITAG><D>BCT</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Monitor discharge rate</ITAG><D>Section 308</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Inventory of added substances</ITAG><D>Section 308</D>Test fluids:<ITAG tagnum="3">pH 6.5-8.5</ITAG><D>BCT andamp; Marine Water Quality Criteria</D><ITAG tagnum="3">No free oil</ITAG><D>BCT</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Oil andamp; grease limits: 48 mg/l monthly average; 72 mg/l daily maximum</ITAG><D>BCT</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Monitor frequency and volume of discharge</ITAG><D>Section 308</D>All discharges:<ITAG tagnum="3">No halogenated phenol compounds, diesel oil, sodium chromate, sodiumdichromate, or trisodium nitrilotriacetic acid</ITAG><D>BAT</D><ITAG tagnum="3">No floating solids</ITAG><D>BCT</D></ITAG>B. BCT Requirements<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Oil and Grease in Test Fluids</ITAG>Limited volumes of formation waters which are encountered during testingof the well are authorized for discharge as test fluids. In response toa comment from API, the Region has deleted the required use of an oil-waterseparator since this requirement may be redundant with the oil and greaselimitation (see Comment 33). However, the Region expects that operatorswill need to use an oil-water separator to ensure compliance with the dailymaximum (72 mg/l) and the monthly average (48 mg/l) limitations on oiland grease in test fluids.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Free Oil and Oil-Based Muds</ITAG>No discharge of free oil is permitted from discharges authorized by thesepermits. Region 10 has determined that the BPT effluent limitations guidelineof no discharge of free oil from the discharge of deck drainage, drillingmuds, drill cuttings, and well treatment fluids should apply to other discharges,including uncontaminated bilge water, uncontaminated ballast water, testfluids, desalination unit wastes, boiler blowdown, non-contact coolingwater, excess cement slurry, blowout preventer fluid, fire control systemtest water, mud, cuttings and cement at the seafloor. Thus, the no freeoil limitation is Region 10's best professional judgment determinationof BPT controls for these discharges. They have been subject to a no freeoil limitation in previous permits issued by Region 10, and past practiceshave not resulted in violations of this limitation.Under the final permits, the discharge of oil-based drilling muds (withoil as the continuous phase and water as the dispersed phase) is prohibitedsince oil-based muds would violate the BCT effluent limitation of no dischargeof free oil.No technology performance data available to Region 10 indicate that morestringent standards are appropriate at this time. Region 10 has, therefore,set BCT effluent limitations equal to the BPT level of control. As such,these limitations impose no incremental costs.Compliance with the free oil limitation for deck drainage and miscellaneousdischarges will be by visual observation for a sheen on the receiving water,except for deck drainage and bilge water under the conditions describedbelow. This requirement is similar to that in the Region's BPT permitsand will not result in any additional costs to the industry. The requirementwas also a condition of Region 10's BAT/BCT permits for the Bering andBeaufort seas (49 <T3>FR</T3> 23734, June 7, 1984), Norton Sound (50 <T3>FR</T3> 23578, June 4, 1985), and Cook Inlet (51 <T3>FR</T3> 35460, October 3, 1986). Region 10 has determined that therequired use of an oil-water separator with the no free oil limitationon deck drainage may be redundant (see Response to Comment 30). Therefore,the requirement that ``(t)he contaminated deck drainage shall be processedthrough an oil-water separator prior to discharge'' (Part II.C.) has beendeleted from the final permits. It is expected, however, that operatorswill need to use an oil-water separator to ensure compliance with the nofree oil limitation.Compliance with the free oil limitation for muds and cuttings will be monitoredby year-round use of the static sheen test (see Response to Comment 23).The static sheen test will also be required for the monitoring of deckdrainage and bilge water during unstable or broken ice and stable ice conditions.This requirement for muds and cuttings was a condition of the Region'sBPT permits and thus imposes no additional cost to industry. These requirementsand those on deck drainage and bilge water were also conditions of theRegion's BAT/BCT permits. Use of the static sheen test will prevent a violationof the free oil limitation as a result of those discharges most likelyto be contaminated with oil. This would not be possible with an after-the-factvisual observation of a sheen on the receiving water.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Oil Content of Cuttings</ITAG>The final permits restrict the discharge of oil-contaminated cuttings byprohibiting the discharge of free oil (see Part IV.B.2. above) and by limitingthe maximum mineral oil content of cuttings. The limitation of 10 percentby weight on oil content is based on the efficiency of conventional cuttingswashers in removing oil from drill cuttings. Region 10 expects that ifmineral oil-based drilling muds or water-based muds with high concentrationsof mineral oil additives are used, drill cuttings would, at a minimum,have to be washed by cuttings washers to meet the free oil limitation.The limitation on the maximum oil content of drill cuttings has been imposedas an additional means of effectively controlling the discharge of oilfrom cuttings associated with these muds.Region 10 expects that cuttings washers will routinely be required onlyfor drilling operations which use mineral oil-based drilling muds or water-basedmuds with high concentrations of mineral oil additives, and not for alldrilling operations. Since such muds are rarely used by exploratory drillingoperations, very few, if any, Alaskan exploratory facilities will requirethe installation of cuttings washers. Any facility requiring a cuttingswasher to meet the 10 percent oil limitation would already require a cuttingswasher to meet the BPT effluent limitation of no free oil. Hence, thereis no incremental cost involved beyond the cost of monitoring compliance,and the limitation passes the BCT cost test.Region 10 has taken an approach to controlling the oil content of cuttingswhich differs from that taken by Regions 4 and 6 in their Gulf of Mexicopermit (51 <T3>FR</T3> 284897, July 9, 1986). Regions 4 and 6 have imposed a visiblesheen test to determine compliance of cuttings with the no free oil limit,and also have prohibited the discharge of cuttings from oil-based mud systems.Regions 4 and 6 adopted the prohibition on the discharge of cuttings fromoil-based mud systems because some of these cuttings contain free oil andthe visible sheen test cannot be conducted until after a discharge to thereceiving water has occurred. Region 10 has chosen to require the staticsheen test rather than the visible sheen test. Unlike the visible sheentest, the static sheen test is conducted prior to discharge and cuttingswhich do not pass the test cannot be discharged. The static sheen testis more appropriate than the visible sheen test for the harsh weather andextended periods of darkness common offshore in Alaska. Although the 10percent oil limitation in these permits and others issued by Region 10is less stringent, by itself, than the prohibition by Regions 4 and 6 ondischarges of cuttings from oil-based mud systems, any cuttings which passthe 10 percent limitation must also pass the static sheen test prior todischarge.EPA is currently studying newly developed technologies for removing oilfrom drill cuttings from oil-based and invert emulsion drilling muds dischargedinto the Gulf of Mexico. These new technologies, if successful, may beable to achieve a limit lower than 10 percent oil and grease and not resultin the discharge of free oil. These permits do not contain terms basedon application of these technologies. However, EPA would consider modifyingthese permits at an appropriate time after evaluating data and informationas it becomes available.The permits require an GC analysis of drill cuttings for oil content dailywhen oil-based drilling fluids or oil additives are used. Analysis is alsorequired daily when drilling fluids could be contaminated with hydrocarbonsfrom the formation. In addition, analysis is required immediately on anysample that has failed the daily static sheen test if a discharge has occurred.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. pH</ITAG>The pH of discharged test fluids (which may have a substantially differentpH from that of the ambient receiving water) has been limited to a rangeof 6.5-8.5 at the point of discharge (see Response to Comment 32). In Region10's best professional judgment, this limitation appropriately reflectsa BPT level of control. No technology performance data available to Region10 indicate that a more stringent standard is appropriate at this time.Therefore, Region 10 is setting a BCT effluent limitation for the pH oftest fluids equal to that of BPT. This limitation will ensure that pH changesgreater than 0.2 pH unit will not occur beyond the edge of the 100 metermixing zone (40 CFR 125.121(c)). This requirement has been and is routinelycomplied with by operations under previous BPT permits and thus, reflectsno cost incremental to BPT.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Floating Solids</ITAG>The BCT prohibition on floating solids is equal to the BPT level of controlfor sanitary wastes. As with the free oil limitations for other waste streams,Region 10 has determined that the BPT effluent limitations guidelines ofno discharge of floating solids from the discharge of sanitary wastes shouldapply to all other discharges as well. Thus, the no floating solids limitationis Region 10's best professional judgment determination of BPT limitationsfor these discharges. They have been subject to this limitation in previouspermits issued by Region 10, and past practices have not resulted in violationsof this limitation. No technology performance data available to Region10 indicate that a more stringent standard is appropriate at this time.Therefore, Region 10 has determined that the BCT effluent limitation onfloating solids from these discharges is equal to the BPT level of control.As such, the extension of this limitation to all discharges will involveno incremental cost.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Chlorine</ITAG>The requirement of maintaining residual chlorine levels as close as possibleto, but no less than 1 mg/1 in sanitary waste discharges for facilitiesmanned by ten (10) or more people is a BCT determination equal to BPT.There is therefore no incremental cost to the industry.C. BAT Requirements<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Diesel Oil</ITAG>The discharge of drilling muds and associated cuttings which have beencontaminated by diesel oil is prohibited. Diesel oil, which is sometimesadded to a water-based mud system, is a complex mixture of petroleum hydrocarbons,known to be highly toxic to marine organisms and to contain numerous toxicand nonconventional pollutants. This limitation controls both the toxicand the nonconventional pollutants present in diesel oil, but Region 10'sprimary concern is to control the toxic pollutants. The pollutant ``dieseloil'' is being used as an ``indicater'' of the listed toxic pollutantspresent in diesel oil which are controlled through compliance with theeffluent limitation (i.e., no discharge). The technology basis for thislimitation is product substitution of less toxic mineral oil for dieseloil.<T3>Diesel is an Indicator of Toxic Pollutants: </T3>Region 10 selected``diesel'' as an ``indicator'' pollutant pursuant to 40 CFR 125.3(h)(1)as an alternative to establishing limitations on each of the specific toxicand nonconventional pollutants present in the diesel-contaminated wastestreams (see response to Comment 14). Available data clearly establishthat diesel oils as a class contain significantly higher levels of toxicpollutants than do mineral oils as a class. The Region has determined thateliminating the discharge of drilling fluids contaminated with diesel oilwill reduce the levels of toxic pollutants present in discharged fluids.Results of the EPA/API Diesel Pill Monitoring Program (DPMP) and otherstudies show that when the amount of disel oil is reduced in drilling muds,the concentrations of toxic pollutants and the overall toxicity of thefluid generally is reduced. BAT-level control of toxic pollutants (i.e.,reduction in concentrations through substitution of mineral oil for dieseloil) will be achieved by regulating diesel oil as an indicator pollutant.A permit limitation that prohibits the discharge of diesel oil is economicallyand technologically feasible.<T3>Mineral Oil as a Substitute for Diesel Oil: </T3>API and other partiescontended, as they have in prior permit proceedings, that survey data onthe relative success rates of diesel oil and mineral oil pills demonstratethat mineral oil is not an acceptable substitute for diesel oil. Region10 has determined that mineral oil-based fluids have a demonstrated productdevelopment and performance as effective substitutes for diesel oil-basedfluids. This determination is based on the following: (1) The availabilityand successful formulation and use of chemical additives that are compatiblewith mineral oils, (2) the commercial availability of mineral oil spottingfluids, (3) the demonstrated performance of mineral oil spotting fluidsas documented by published case histories, (4) the ability to store mineraloil on site or obtain it quickly in critical stuck pipe situations, and(5) a consideration of the available data regarding the performance ofdiesel oil and mineral oil pills. EPA presented information and conclusionssupporting this determination in the proposed and final modification tothe Bering and Beaufort Seas general permits (51 <T3>FR</T3> 29604-06, August 19, 1986 and 52 <T3>FR</T3> 36463-36464, September 29, 1987, respectively). The Regionhas also addressed this issue in the notices for the draft Beaufort SeaII (52 <T3>FR</T3> 36621-36622, September 30, 1987) and Chukchi Sea (53 <T3>FR</T3> 2635-2636, January 29, 1988) permits and in the response tocomments document (see responses to Comments 16[a] and 16[b]). This informationis incorporated herein by reference.<T3>Cost Considerations: </T3>The prohibition on the discharge of dieseloil is a technology-based BAT limitation based on product substitution.Low toxicity mineral oils are available as product substitutes for dieseloil, and do not impose unreasonable additional costs on industry. Region10 has quantified the increased cost associated with the use of a mineraloil pill in place of a diesel pill by assuming that mineral oil would bestored in a rented tank on the rig. In the response to Comment 15(a), Region10 addressed additional costs that API contends are attributable to sidetrackingand redrilling wells spotted with mineral oil pills. Region 10 does notagree that these additional costs would necessarily be incurred. Region10 has concluded that the cost associated with the prohibition on the dischargeof diesel oil clearly is economically achievable for Alaskan offshore operations.<T3>Environmental Concerns: </T3>While an environmental assessment undersection 403(c) was not the basis for the limitation, Region 10 has consideredthe general environmental effects of diesel-contaminated muds in developingthe proposed diesel oil prohibition. Diesel oil is highly toxic to marineorganisms in the water column, and also poses a potential longer term threatto bottom-dwelling (benthic) organisms. Certain diesel oils, such as thefrequently used No. 2 diesel fuel oil, ``are among the most toxic petroleumproducts to marine organisms'' (National Research Council 1983, p. 105).Laboratory studies have demonstrated the higher toxicity of diesel oilsrelative to mineral oils (e.g., see U.S. EPA 1985, p. 4-34). Since dieseloil is known to be highly toxic, substitution of low toxicity mineral oilsfor diesel in drilling fluids will reduce the potential hazard to marineorganisms from these discharges.<T3>Alternatives to Diesel Oil Prohibition (Removal of Diesel Pill andOil Limitation): </T3>One suggested alternative to the diesel oil prohibitionwould be to allow the discharge of drilling muds in which a diesel pillhad been used, provided that the pill is removed and the residual drillingmud meets specified limitations on oil content. Such an approach dependson accomplishing effective pill removal such that the drilling mud canmeet all other effluent limitations. The oil content limitation would beset at a level which not only reflects BAT control of toxic pollutantsin diesel oil but also provides adequate safeguards for the marine environment.The EPA/API DPMP was conducted to address the effectiveness of pill recoveryin removing diesel oil from drilling muds. Final results of the programindicate that the toxicity of drilling muds increases with their dieseloil content, but that pill recovery techniques currently in use are notcapable of consistently reducing diesel oil concentrations to non-toxiclevels. (The reader is referred to the Responses to Comments 16[b], 17,and 20 for the details of this analysis.) Hence, diesel pill and bufferrecovery does not constitute a viable alternative to the diesel prohibition.In contrast, product substitution of mineral oil for highly toxic dieseloil is technologically feasible and economically achievable. Documentationin the administrative record fully supports Region 10's conclusion thatacceptable alternatives exist to the use of diesel oil in oil-based spottingfluids. Hence, Region 10 has determined that the prohibition on the dischargeof drilling fluids and cuttings contaminated with diesel oil is appropriatefor the BAT level of control.Region 10 has considered using ``free oil,'' ``oil-based drilling fluids,''and ``oil content of cuttings'' as indicators of toxic pollutants. Whilethe Region has determined that such effluent limitations would controlthe discharge of toxic pollutants in diesel oils, it is unnecessary todesignate these pollutants as indicators since the same levels of controlhave been established under BCT, which are equal to levels of control requiredby the BPT effluent limitations guidelines. Therefore, redundant limitationsunder BAT are not proposed for these pollutant parameters.<T3>Conclusion: </T3>Region 10 has evaluated alternative control technologiesand alternative control parameters to reduce the toxic pollutants in dischargeddrilling muds. Based upon this evaluation, the Region has determined thatthe prohibition on the discharge of diesel contaminated drilling muds andcuttings is reasonable and appropriate since adequate diesel pill recoveryis unproven and substitution of a mineral oil pill for a diesel pill istechnologically feasible and economically achievable.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Mercury and Cadmium in Barite</ITAG>The permits contain limitations of 1 mg/kg mercury and 3 mg/kg cadmiumin barite, a major constituent of drilling muds. These restrictions aredesigned to limit the discharge of mercury, cadmium, and other potentiallytoxic metals which can occur as contaminants in some sources of barite.An identical limitation is included in the general permits for the Beringand Beaufort seas, Norton Sound, and Cook Inlet.As discussed in the fact sheets for the above permits, the technology basisfor the limitation under BAT is product substitution; i.e., Alaskan operatorscan substitute ``clean'' barite, which meets the above limitations, forcontaminated barite which does not. Numerous offshore exploratory wellshave been drilled in Alaska over the past years, and chemical analyseshave shown that the barite used has not exceeded the limitations. Giventhat ``clean'' barite is available and that operators in the above referencedgeneral permit areas have been complying with an identical limitation,Region 10 believes that this limitation is both technologically feasibleand economically achievable.Region 10 does not believe that the mercury and cadmium limitations forbarite will change the available supply of ``clean'' barite. In determiningthe availability of ``clean'' barite under this provision, Region 10 consideredall reasonable relevant factors, including the cost of obtaining baritewhich meets the limitations. (See Comment 24.) The draft permits containeda provision (Part II B.1.g.) which would allow the Director the discretionto grant a waiver from the limitations on a case-by-case basis if the permittee(1) satisfactorily demonstrates that barite which meets the limitationis not available, and (2) provides results of analyses of the substitutebarite. This provision could be considered an open-ended limit for mercuryand cadmium in barite. To address this potential concern, the Region hasestablished maximum levels of 3 mg/kg mercury and 5 mg/kg cadmium in baritethat will be acceptable for discharge under this provision (see Part II.B.1.g).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Generic muds, Authorized Additives, and Mineral Oil Pills</ITAG>It is Region 10's best professional judgment that the toxic and nonconventionalpollutants present in Alaskan drilling mud systems can most efficientlybe controlled during the drilling fluid formulation process. Therefore,the Region has determined to regulate the pollutants in drilling mud byestablishing a toxicity limitation which is defined as the 96-hour LC50of 30,000 ppm on the suspended particulate phase (using <T3>Mysidopsis bahia</T3>). This limitation applies to the authorizationof all drilling muds and additives. The basis for establishing the toxicitylimitation was the toxicity study conducted on the eight generic muds atEPA's Gulf Breeze Laboratory which demonstrated that the most toxic genericmud was Mud No. 1 (see the response to Comment 26).The final permits limit the discharge of toxic substances in drilling fluidsby allowing the discharge of generic drilling muds (listed in Table 1 ofthe final permits) and additives for which acceptable bioassay or chemicaldata are available (listed in Table 2) as required in Part II.B.1.d. ofthe permits. Tables 1 and 2 have been developed using the 30,000 ppm toxicitycriterion and are similar in content to Tables 1 and 2 in the Cook Inlet/Gulfof Alaska general permit. The generic muds and authorized additives listedin Tables 1 and 2 do not require special authorization prior to dischargeunless the desired concentration exceeds the concentration specified inthe tables. (For background on the development and application of Tables1 and 2, please refer to Section IV.C.3. of the fact sheets for the draftpermits.)The discharge of residual amounts of mineral oil pills (listed in Table3) is authorized in Part II.B.1.e. of the final permits, provided thatthe mineral oil pill and at least a 50 barrel buffer of drilling fluidon either side of the pill are removed from the circulating mud systemand not discharged (see the responses to Comments 26 and 30). Residualamounts of mineral oil pill products listed in Table 3 may be dischargedby operators without prior authorization from Region 10. The residual mineraloil content shall not exceed 2 percent v/v. In the event that more thanone pill is applied to a single well, the previous pill and buffer shallbe removed prior to application of a subsequent pill. The discharged mudmust comply with all other permit requirements including no discharge offree oil. The above requirements have been imposed on Alaskan exploratoryoperations since 1985 under Region 10's existing permits, and the new permitrequirements serve to formally incorporate these restrictions in the permit.Table 3 separately lists spotting compounds (List A) and mineral oil products(List B) which are authorized. One product from each list may be combinedto formulate a complete mineral oil pill. These lists are alphabeticaland were comiled by Region 10 based on the products requested and authorizedunder previous general permits for the Alaskan OCS. (Mention of any tradenames or commercial products does not constitute an endorsement or recommendationby the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.) Due to the toxicity of MudNo. 1, the addition of mineral oil pills to Mud No. 1 is not covered bythis provision and requries authorization under Part II.B.1.f. Any productnot listed on Table 3 must be authorized by Region 10 prior to dischargeunder Part II.B.1.f., and discharges must comply with the provisions ofPart II.B.1.e.Permittees are required to certify in advance of discharge that only genericdrilling muds and authorized additives will be discharged. However, thedischarge of drilling muds containing any additive or component (includingmineral oil pill packages) not allowed under Parts II.B.1.d. or e. shallrequire authorization by Region 10 <T3>prior </T3>to discharge as set forth in Part II.-B.1.f. of the finalpermits. In the authorization process, Region 10 will evaluate whetherthe requested additives or components (including mineral oil pills) maycause the drilling mud to violate the 96-hour LC50 toxicity limitationof 30,000 ppm (for <T3>Mysidopsis bahia</T3>) on the suspended particulate phase. In evaluatinga request for authorization, toixicity is assumed to be additive for mudsand additives, incluidng mineral oil pills. (Any drilling muds authorizedshall have a cumulative toxicity which is less toxic than the 30,000 ppmtoxicity criterion; toxicity is inversely related to the LC50. Therefore,no drilling fluids or additives authorized may have an LC50 lower thanthe specified minimum LC50.)In some cases, interim authorizations for the discharge of muds and additivesmay be granted under Part II.B.1.f. if preliminary bioassay data are submittedand appear acceptable in light of the foregoing criteria, but the Regiondetermines that additional bioassay testing or other analyses are required.For example, such testing may be required to examine possible cumulativeor synergistic effects if the additive is to be used in combination witha number of other additives or if a mud not listed on Table 1 of the permitsis to be used, with or without additives. Because the additional testingmay take a considerable amount of time to conduct, interim authorizationto discharge may be granted, if a reasonable amount of data are available,so that operations are not impaired for an unreasonable amount of time.The information obtained under the requirements of an interim authorizationwill be used in further evaluations of the subject additives of muds.If a permittee wants to use a drilling mud, additive, or mineral oil pillnot listed in Tables 1, 2, or 3, which has been denied authorization underPart II.B.1.f., the permittee has the option of applying for an individualpermit or modification of the general permit. Processing a request foran individual permit or modification of the general permit requires thatpublic notice requirements under 40 CFR 124.10-124.12 are addressed. Thiscan be a time-consuming process, so permittees are advised to use the alternativesavailable within the context of the permit.This approach to limiting toxicity is expected to control the dischargeof listed toxic as well as nonconventional pollutants in drilling muds.Region 10 has determined that it is technically and economically infeasibleto directly limit the toxic pollutants in drilling muds (see response toComment 14[b]). Therefore, the Region has determined that the toxicitylimitations constitute a reasonable approach which is expected to controlnot only listed toxic pollutants, but nonconventional pollutants as well.This procedure also addresses the concerns of a commenter regarding theperceived lack of public notice regarding the authorization process.Under section 308 of the Act, compliance with this permit condition willbe monitored in two ways. First, by requiring that permittees clarify thatonly generic muds and authorized additives including mineral oil pillswill be discharged; and second, by requiring that permittees submit anend-of-well inventory listing all chemicals and the amounts of each addedto each mud system. In addition, permittees must analyze at least one mudsample for metals content and toxicity. The final permits require thatfor any mud system which had a mineral oil pill added, the permittee mustremove the pill and at least a 50 barrel buffer from each side of the pill.The mud must be sampled and analyzed when the mineral oil content in thedischarge is highest. In the event that no mineral oil pill is used, analysesare required on a sample of discharged mud used at the greatest well depth,typically referred to as an ``end-of-well'' sample. The metals data willbe used to verify that mercury and cadmium limits on barite are adequatelycontrolling metal concentrations in used muds. The Drilling Fluids ToxicityTest will provide a comparison between the toxicity of used muds containingmixtures of additives and the bioassay data submitted on individual additivesprior to discharge and is also a check on whether these provisions ensurethat mud toxicity is being adequately controlled.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Other Toxic and Nonconventional Compounds</ITAG>Under the permit discharges of the following pollutants are prohibited:halogenated phenol compounds, trisodium nitrilotriacetic acid, sodium chromate,and sodium dichromate. The class of halogenated phenol compounds includestoxic pollutants, and sodium chromate and sodium dichromate contain chromium,also a toxic pollutant. Trisodium nitrilotriacetic acid is a nonconventionalpollutant. The discharge of these compounds was previously prohibited inthe BPT general permits for the Beaufort Sea and Norton Sound (48 <T3>FR</T3> 54881, December 7, 1983) as well as in the BAT/BCT generalpermits for the Bering and Beaufort Seas (49 <T3>FR</T3> 23734, June 7, 1984), Norton Sound (50 <T3>FR </T3>23578, June 4, 1984), and Cook Inlet (51 <T3>FR </T3>35460, October 3, 1986). These compounds are therefore subjectto BAT limitations. Because operators complied with this provision in theBPT permit, there is no additional cost to the industry.The permit also contains a provision that the discharge of surfactants,dispersants, and detergents shall be minimized except as necessary to complywith the safety requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Administrationand the Minerals Management Service. These products contain primarily nonconventionalpollutants. This provision previously appeared in the BPT permit for theBeaufort Sea and Norton Sound, as well as in the Region's other BAT/BCTpermits. Because operators have complied with the provision in the BPTpermits, there is no additional cost to the industry.D. Requirements Based on the Ocean Discharge Criteria Evaluation<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Drilling Muds, Cuttings, and Washwater </ITAG>Additional restrictions on these discharges are necessary to ensure nounreasonable degradation of the marine environment. Lease Sale 97 includeswater depths from 2 to about 1,000 meters deep; Lease Sale 109 includeswater depths that range from about 18 to 80 meters. (In the Final Noticeof Lease Sale 109, MMS deferred from sale 3.8 million acres. These newdeferrals increase the minimum depth in the Chukchi Sea sale area fromabout 6 to 18 meters.) Discharge rate limitations on total muds and cuttingshave been established in the Ocean Discharge Criteria Evaluation processesin order to allow adequate dispersion of the discharges. These maximumrates are:andbullet; 1,000 bbl/hr for discharges into waters greater than 40 m in depth,andbullet; 750 bbl/hr for discharges into waters greater than 20 m but notmore than 40 m in depth,andbullet; 500 bbl/hr for discharges into waters greater than 5 m but notmore than 20 m in depth,andbullet; 250 bbl/hr for discharges into waters greater than 2 m but notmore than 5 m in depth, andandbullet; No discharge into water depths less than 2 m.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The discharge limitations for depths less than 18 m are applicableonly to the Beaufort Sea II permit; the minimum depth in the area coveredby the Chuckhi Sea permit is greater than 18 m.These limits are necessary because for any given discharge rate, the dilutionof drilling muds and cuttings is not as great in shallow waters as in deeperwaters. However, at any particular water depth, greater dilution closeto the discharge point will be achieved with a lower discharge rate. Thesemaximum rates will ensure that acceptable toxicity limits will not be exceededat the edge of the 100 m mixing zone (Bigham et al. 1984, p. 62).Under the Beaufort Sea II permit, discharge of muds, cuttings, and washwaterare prohibited in the following two areas: (a) between the shore (mainlandand island) and the 2 m isobath and (b) within 1000 m of the StefanssonSound Boulder Patch (see Parts II.B. 2. and 3. of the Beaufort Sea II permit).A provision prohibiting discharge within 1000 m of river mouths or deltasduring unstable or broken ice or water conditions has been deleted fromthe Beaufort Sea II permit since all areas of Lease Sale 97 are more than1000 meters from river mouths or deltas.With regard to (a) above, EPA has extensively studied the nearshore zoneof the Alaskan Beaufort Sea in two Ocean Discharge Criteria Evaluations(Jones andamp; Stokes 1983, 1984). These evaluations have clearly shown thatthese nearshore areas provide important feeding and migratory habitat fora large number of species including fish, waterfowl, and mammals. Further,these areas provide essential feeding and preferred habitat for speciesof major importance for subsistence and commercial fisheries. Concerning(b) above, Region 10 is issuing a final permit that does not authorizedischarges within 1000 m of the Stefansson Sound Boulder Patch as definedat Dulton et al. (1982). The ``Patch'' is a rare and unique biologicalcommunity that is susceptible to adverse effects caused by discharged drillingmuds and cuttings. In accordance with 40 CFR 125.123(b), the Director hasprohibited these discharges as the Region has determined they will causeunreasonable degradation of the marine environment. These prohibitionsare also contained in the previous Beaufort Sea NPDES general permit (49<T3>FR </T3>23734, June 7, 1984).Additionally, several areas included in the final permits are of particularconcern in Region 10. They involve discharges of drilling muds and cuttings:(a) To open water in water depths from 2-5 m (applicable only to the BeaufortSea II permit), (b) below-ice to water depths shallower than 20 m, and(c) within 1000 m of an area of biological concern (e.g., as identifiedin the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the relevant lease salearea). The Director has determined that controlled discharges to theseareas, in accordance with 40 CFR 125.123(a) and the limitations and conditionsin the final permits, will not cause unreasonable degradation of the marineenvironment. Monitoring is required to verify that the discharge of effluentsto these areas will not produce conditions in the future that would leadto unreasonable degradation. These monitoring requirements are the sameas those required by the previous Beaufort Sea general permit, except thatthe monitoring requirements for below-ice discharges has changed from ``anydepth'' to ``waters less than 20 m deep.'' Region 10 believes that theOOC (Offshore Operators Committee) model can successfully be used to predictthe fate of under-ice discharges into waters greater than 20 m deep. (TheRegion has deleted a provision from Part II.B.4 of the Chukchi Sea permitwhich would have excluded ice thickness from measurement of the 20 m waterdepth. Region 10 was concerned that this wording may lead to confusionas ice cover conditions changed at the drilling site.)<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Other Discharges (003-015)</ITAG>These discharges are adequately controlled by the technology-based limitationsin Part II. C. through E. of the final permtis to ensure no unreasonabledegradation of the marine environment.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Other Legal Requirements </ITAG>A. Oil Spill Requirements Section 311 of the Act prohibits the discharge of oil and hazardous materialsin harmful quantities. Routine discharges specifically controlled by thepermits are excluded from the provisions of section 311. However, thesepermits do not preclude the institution of legal action or relieve permitteesfrom any responsibilities, liabilities, or penalties for other, unauthorizeddischarges of oil and hazardous materials which are covered by section311 of the Act. B. Endangered Species Act Based on information in the Ocean Discharge Criteria Evaluations and inthe separate Final Environmental Impact Statements prepared for FederalLease Sales 97 and 109, EPA concluded that the discharges authorized bythese general permits are not likely to adversely affect any endangeredor threatened species nor adversely affect its critical habitat. EPA requestedcomments from the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service and the National MarineFisheries Service on this determination on the draft permit. Both agenciesconcurred in writing with EPA's determination of no adverse effect. C. Coastal Zone Management Act The draft permits and consistency determinations were submitted to theState of Alaska for state interagency review at the time of public notice.The State of Alaska has concurred that the activities allowed by the ChukchiSea permit are consistent with local and state Coastal Management Plansand waived their right to review the Beaufort Sea permit due to the similaritywith the previous Beaufort Sea general permit (AKG284000). D. Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act No marine sanctuaries as designated by this Act exist in the vicinity ofthe permit areas. E. State Water Quality Standards and State Certification No state waters are included in these permits; therefore, a state certificationunder Section 401 regarding compliance with water quality standards isnot required. F. Executive Order 12291 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the reviewrequirements of Executive Order 12291 pursuant to section 8(b) of thatorder. G. Paperwork Reduction Act EPA has reviewed the requirements imposed on regulated facilities in thesegeneral permits under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq. </T3>Most of the information collection requirements have alreadybeen approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in submissionsmade for the NPDES permit program under the provisions of the Clean WaterAct. In addition, the environmental monitoring requirements pursuant tosection 403(c) of the Clean Water Act in Part II.B.4 of this permit aresimilar to the monitoring requirements that were approved by OMB for thefirst Beaufort Sea general permit (48 <T3>FR </T3>54881, December 7, 1983). The new requirements are also similarto the Beaufort Sea general permit (49 <T3>FR </T3>23734, June 7, 1984) and the Norton Sound general permit (50<T3>FR </T3>23578, June 4, 1985). H. The Regulatory Flexibility Act After review of the facts presented in the notice of intent printed above,I hereby certify, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that thesegeneral permits will not have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities. This certification is based on the fact that the regulatedparties have greater than 500 employees and are not classified as smallbusinesses under the Small Business Administration regulations establishedat 49 <T3>FR </T3>5024 <T3>et seq. </T3>(February 9, 1984).

Requests to be Covered by General Permit  Written request to be covered by this permit shall be provided to EPA atleast 60 days prior to initiation of discharges. The request shall includethe following information:  1. Name and Address of the permittee.   2. General location (lease and block numbers) of operations and discharges. 3. Any discharge or operating conditions which will require special monitoring(Part II.B.4.) or will require special consideration by EPA.  4. Certification that only authorized muds and additives will be discharged(Part II.B.I.c.).  5. Certification of lessee's responsibility. The permittee shall be theowner and/or operator of the facility. However, the lessee may become thepermittee after certifying that the lessee assumes responsibility for compliancewith the permit. If the lessee has multiple leases, the lessee may submita single certification for all of its leases. Submission of this certificationdoes not remove the responsibility of the owner or operator for compliancewith the conditions of the permit.  6. If possible, the request for coverage shall also contain any informationrequired for the permittee's request to EPA for authorization to dischargemuds and additives not listed in Tables 1 and 2 (see Part I.B.4. Below). B. Authorization to Discharge  The permittee's discharges are not authorized until written notificationis received from EPA that operations at the discharge site have been assigneda permit number under this general permit. A permit number cannot be assigneduntil the following information is received. This information shall beprovided to EPA in the request for coverage. If possible, but in no caseless than 30 days prior to commencement of discharges.  1. Name and location of discharge site, including lease block number andapproximate coordinates.  2. Range of water depths (below mean lower low water) in lease block, anddepth of discharge.  3. Initial date and expected duration of operations.  4. In necessary, request for EPA authorization to discharge muds or additivesnot listed in Tables 1, 2 or 3 (Part II.B.1.F.).  C. Commencement of Discharges  The permittee shall notify EPA, Region 10, during the 7-day period priorto initiation of discharges from the facility and from each well. The notificationshall include the exact coordinates (latitude and longitude) and waterdepth of the discharge site, and may be oral or in writing. If notificationis given orally, written confirmation must follow within 7 days.  D. Sites Requiring Environmental Surveys  All operators that locate within the areas covered by this general permitshall submit to EPA copies of any exploration plans, biological surveys,and/or environmental reports required by the Regional Supervisor, FieldOperations of the Minerals Management Service, for the identification and/orprotection of biological populations or habitats. If the final explorationplans and environmental reports are identical to review copies receivedby Region 10, permittees need not submit them under this permit provision.Permittees shall notify Region 10 in writing when no exploration plan orenvironmental report will be sent.

The discharge of drilling mudsor cuttings which fail the Static Sheen Test is prohibited. Whenever muds or cuttings fail the Static Sheen Test and a discharge hasoccurred in the past 24 hours, the permittee is required to analyze anundiluted sample of the material which failed the test to determine thepresence or absence of diesel oil. The determination and reporting of resultsshall be performed according to Part II.B.1.a. above. c. <T3>Certification of discharge of authorized muds and additives. </T3>Thepermittee is required to certify at the time coverage is requested underthe general permit that only generic muds and authorized additives (PartII.B.1.d.), mineral oil pills (Part II.B.1.e.), or muds, additives authorized,and mineral oil pills in accordance with Part II.B.1.f. will be dischargedd. <T3>Generic drilling muds and authorized additives. </T3>Only generic drillingmuds and authorized additives shall be discharged. The generic mud typeswhich have been authorized for discharge are given in Table 1, with specifiedlimitations on composition. A list of additional authorized mud additivesis given in Table 2. Additives listed in Table 2 may be discharged at the specified maximumallowable concentrations in Generic Muds Nos. 2 through 6 without priorauthorization from Region 10. Only those additives so designated may bedischarged in Generic Mud No. 1. e. <T3>Authorization to discharge mineral oil pills listed in Table 3. </T3>Thedischarge of residual amounts of mineral oil pills (mineral oil plus additives)is authorized by this permit provided that the mineral oil pill and atleast a 50 bbl buffer of drilling fluid on either side of the pill areremoved from the circulating drilling fluid system and not discharged tothe waters of the United States. In the event that more than one pill isapplied to a single well, the previous pill and buffer shall be removedprior to application of a subsequent pill. Residual mineral oil concentrationin the discharged mud shall not exceed 2% v/v (API Retort Test). The dischargedmud must comply with all permit conditions, including no discharge of freeoil. Mineral oil pills which have been authorized are given in Table 3. Noneof the mineral oil pills listed on Table 3 may be discharged in GenericMud No. 1. Should drilling mud containing residual mineral oil pill (after pill andbuffer removal) be discharged the following information shall be reportedwithin 60 days of discharge: (1) Dates of pill application, recovery, and discharge; (2) Results of the Drilling Fluids Toxicity Test on samples of:  (a) The mud before each pill is added and  (b) The mud after removal of each pill and buffer (taken when residualmineral oil pill concentration is expected to be greatest); (3) Spotting compound and mineral oil products used; (4) Volumes of spotting compound, mineral oil, water, and barite in thepill; (5) Total volume of mud circulating prior to pill application, volume ofpill formulated, and volume of pill circulated;(6) Volume of pill recovered, volume of mud buffer recovered, and volumeof mud circulating after pill and buffer recovery;(7) Percent recovery of the pill (include calculations); (8) Estimated concentrations of residual spotting compound and mineraloil in the sample of mud discharged, as determined from amounts added andtotal mud volume circulating prior to pill application; (9) Measured oil content of the mud samples, as determined by the API retortmethod; and (10) An intemization of other drilling fluid specialty additives containedin the discharged mud. f. <T3>Authorization to discharge drilling muds, additives, and mineral oilpills not listed in Tables 1, 2, or 3. </T3>The discharge of drilling mudscontaining any additive or component (including mineral oil pill packages)not allowed under parts II.B.1. d. or e. shall require authorization byRegion 10 <T3>prior </T3>to discharge. In the authorization process, Region 10 willevaluate whether the requested additives or components may cause the drillingmud to violate the 96-hour LC50 toxicity limitation of 30,000 ppm (for<T3>Mysidopsis bahia</T3>) on the suspended particulate phase. In evaluatinga request for authorization, toxicity is assumed to be additive for mudsand additives, including mineral oil pills. Authorization will be grantedonly for drilling muds (including all components and additives) which areless toxic than the 30,000 ppm toxicity criterion; toxicity is inverselyrelated to the LC50, therefore no drilling fluids or additives authorizedmay have an LC50 lower than the specified minimum LC50. Discharges of mineraloil pills authorized under this paragraph must comply with the provisionsof Part II.B.1.e.The permittee shall supply the information listed below to Region 10 andshall submit it with the information required by Part I.B. (1) Approximate date and duration of proposed discharge. (2) Bioassay testing and reporting of results in accordance with the DrillingFluids Toxicity Test or other procedures approved in advance by Region10 that produce results which will assure equivalent protection levels.Additives may be tested with this methodology in a standard reference mud,a generic mud, or in the proposed drilling mud system. <T3>The bioassay report shall specify the concentration of each constituentin the tested drilling fluid. </T3>Bioassay reports shall include wheneverpossible toxicity values for the base of reference muds. Region 10 recognizesthat such data may not be available in all instances. (3) Chemical characterization of the drilling mud, authorized additiveor mineral oil pill; estimate of total amount required for any particularwell, requested application rate (lb/bbl or percent by volume) in the drillingmud. For the particular well under consideration, a description of drillingmud type and list of other additives (including additives listed on Tables2 or 3), including concentrations (lb/bbl or percent by volume) likelyto be present in the drilling mud. Additives may be authorized on an interim basis at the discretion of Region10, if preliminary bioassay data and other information are submitted andappear acceptable in light of the foregoing criteria, but the Directordetermines that additional information is required. The requested additionalinformation may include bioassay data on a used drilling mud sample containingthe requested additive. Region 10 will also consider any cost information provided by permitteesas part of its evaluations. Drilling muds, additives, or mineral oil pills not authorized under PartsII.B.1.d., e., or f., may be requested by means of an individual permitor modification of the general permit. g. <T3>Mercury and cadmium content of barite. </T3>The permittee shall notdischarge a drilling mud to which barite was added if such barite containedmercury in excess of 1 mg/kg or cadmium in excess of 3 mg/kg (dry weightbasis). The permittee shall analyze a representative sample of stock bariteonce prior to drilling each well and submit the results for total mercuryand total cadmium in the Discharge Monitoring Report upon well completion.If more than one well is drilled at a site, new analyses are not requiredfor subsequent wells if no new supplies of barite have been received sincethe previous analysis. In this case, the DMR should state that no new baritewas received since the last reported analysis. Analyses shall be conductedby absorption spectrophotometry and results expressed as mg/kg (dry weight)of barite. If the permittee is unable to comply with this provision due to the lackof availability of barite which meets the above limitations, the Directormay, on a case-by-case basis, allow the discharge of barite which exceedsthese limitations. Prior to discharge the permittee shall demonstrate onthe satisfaction of the Director that barite which meets the limitationsis unavailable and shall provide the results of analyses of the substitutebarite. The substitute barite shall not exceed 3 mg/kg mercury and 5 mg/kgcadmium (dry weight). h. <T3>Chemical inventory. </T3>For each mud system discharged, the permitteeshall maintain precise chemical inventory of all constituents added downhole,including all drilling mud additives used to meet specific drilling requirements.The permittee shall report the following for <T3>each </T3>mud system; (1) Generic mud type (from Table 1), (2) nameand total amount (volume or weight) of each constituent in discharged mud,(3) the total volumes of mud created and added downhole, and (4) maximumconcentration of each constituent in the discharged mud.
