News on the GOP memo about Foley:   Lee Atwater, the Republican Party's national chairman, said hehad no prior knowledge of a memo dripping with innuendo about newlyelected House Speaker Tom Foley.   But in the end it does not matter whether the GOP chairman knewabout the memo, authored by Atwater aide Mark Goodin, because it wasa perfect expression of Atwater-style politics.   In fact, it has been reported that Atwater's first response toGoodin's mischief was that it wasn't ``out of bounds.'' The memocame from Goodin's desk, but the ultimate inspiration for it isclear.   Goodin resigned his post as communications director for theRepublican National Committee, which means only that both he andAtwater got off too easily.   But Goodin was a small potato in the foul-tasting political stewAtwater has been cooking since entering politics. This whole episodeis not about Goodin's bush league indiscretion; it's about LeeAtwater's standards of political conduct. ...   A fervent hope is that this episode will mark the beginning ofthe end of Atwater's politics of sleaze.   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu described the memo as``wrong not because it damages our relationship with the Democrats.It's wrong because it's wrong.'' Sununu said both he and PresidentBush had reprimanded Atwater. But the president needs to go muchfurther than he did. ...   If he continues to support Atwater as leader of the party, hewill share responsibility for Atwater's activities. Bush is toodecent and too capable a person to need what Atwater has to offer,and the GOP doesn't need it either.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 12   The Portsmouth (N.H.) Herald on the GOP memo about Foley:   In some convoluted way, Republican ex-official Mark Goodin mayhave performed a public service when he tried to smear Thomas Foley,the newly elected Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives.   There's a lesson here: A legislator who conducts himselfethically may still have to dodge political mud.   But his reputation gives him a better chance of emerging clean.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 11   The Seattle Times on AIDS:   As the reports at the past week's international conference inMontreal make clear, the search for effective defenses against AIDScontinues to be a maddeningly slow proposition.   More and more, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome isassuming a strong resemblance to cancer. With no magic bulletslikely to be found anytime soon, AIDS increasingly is regarded as adisease that is here to stay. Breakthroughs toward improvedtreatment and even cures most likely will occur one plodding,methodical step at a time.   Many of the data presented at Montreal were a repeat ofinformation already made public in numerous reports in scientificjournals. A striking exception was the presentation by Dr. JonasSalk, the polio-vaccine pioneer, on the research he's been doingwith colleagues at the National Institutes of Health and at theUniversity of Southern California.   Salk expressed restrained optimism that an experimental vaccinehe has developed eventually could immunize people already infectedwith HIV, the AIDS virus, against developing the disease itself. ...   Members of Salk's team told The New York Times they did not wantto ``raise false hopes.'' Still, amid the years of frustration andbleak despair over the incurability of AIDS _ despite billions ofdollars in research spending _ the Salk report afforded at least onevery welcome bright spot.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 12   Journal-World, Lawrence, Kan., on computer crime:   Computer experts continue to look for cures for the growingepidemic of computer viruses, yet they see no sure way so far tostop outbreaks which threaten all but the most isolated andelaborately protected systems.   Some experts say the threat is so acute it may force the nationto rethink its growing dependence on computers of all sizes.   Experts say we've only barely scratched the surface of thecomputer crime problem, and many fear the great damage that can bedone until there are more answers than questions.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 12   Vicksburg (Miss.) Evening Post on protecting the environment:   OK, fellow Americans, it comes down to this. Yes, you are willingto die for your country. But will you sweat for your environment?   In Vermont, the answer seems to be yes. ... The VermontLegislature has passed a bill that would halt the sale orregistration of vehicles equipped with air-conditioners that usechlorofluorocarbon, a coolant know to eat the earth's protectiveozone layer. ..   Ah, but does Vermont's commendable social conscience come tooeasily? Even in the depths of July, the temperature then averages amild 70 degrees (and) ... only about half of Vermont drivers botherto buy cars (equipped with air conditioners).   So what about an un-air conditioned August in Mississippi? A bitsticky, huh?   But would we rather stay cool now and leave the creepingcatastrophe of ozone depletion _ complete with increases in skincancer, eye disease, plant and animal deaths, food chain disruptions_ to be faced by our children?   Vermonters aren't sacrificing much. But they have answered thatquestion.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 9   The Daily Republic, Mitchell, S.D., on the need for nuclearreactors:   The Bush administration's plan to build two new military(nuclear) reactors in South Carolina and Idaho should be shelved.   Defense Department officials, used to crying ``national defense''at the drop of a hat, believe we need additional reactor-generatedtritium, a radioactive gas, for nuclear warheads. We need to havemore than enough, they argue, because unilateral disarmament isotherwise inevitable.   But the idea of spending $6.8 billion over the next 10 years toput up the reactors, considering the safety problems with the restof this country's reactors, makes absolutely no sense.   We don't need more tritium. We instead need Defense Departmentofficials who don't use ``national security'' jargon as an excuse toask for anything under the sun _ including $6.8 billion nuclearreactors.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
