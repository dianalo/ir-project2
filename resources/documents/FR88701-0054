The area underconsideration covers approximately 38,800 acres and starts 1 mile southof Helena, Montana and 6 miles west of Clancy, Montana, extending southto the Helena National Forest boundary and west to the eastern edge ofthe Tenmile Creek drainage divide. The legal description for the area includesportions of sections 34 and 35, T10N R4W; sections 1-5, 8-17, 19-24 and26-35, T9N R4W; sections 14, 22-26, 35 and 36, T9N R5W; sections 1-3, 11-15,21-27 and 34-36, T8N R5W; sections 1, 2, 12, 13 and 24-26, T7N R5W; sections6, 7, 18 and 19, T7N R4W; sections 5-8, 17-20 and 29-31, T8N R4W, PrincipalMeridian.The proposed management activities include trail construction, campgroundconstruction and renovation, wildlife and fishery habitat improvement,timber sales, prescribed burning, livestock forage improvement, road constructionand reconstruction and access management in various portions of the managementarea for the 1988 to 1995 period. The Forest Service will consider a rangeof alternatives from deferring any activities, to implementing activitiesother than timber sales and road construction, to implementation of allactivities including timber sales and road construction, to acceleratingimplementation of activities scheduled for the next decade (1996-2005)into the 1988 to 1995 period. The activities considered are activitiesprojected for implementation over the next 50 years by the Helena NationalForest Plan Final Environmental Impact Statement, approved May 28, 1986,as well as some which have been proposed during the scoping process todate.Public participation will be important during the analysis. The first pointof public participation is during the scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7).The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistancefrom Federal, State, and local agencies and other individuals or organizationswho may be interested in or affected by the proposed action. This inputwill be used in preparation of the draft environmental impact statement(DEIS). The scoping process includes:1. Identifying potential issues.2. Identifying issues to be analyzed in depth.3. Eliminating insignificant issues or those which have been covered bya relevant previous environmental analysis.4. Identifying additional alternatives.5. Identifying potential environmental effects of the proposed action andalternatives (i.e., direct, indirect, and cumulative effects, and connectedactions).6. Determining potential cooperating agencies and task assignments.Scoping has already been initiated through letters to potentially affectedparties sent December 22, 1987 and meetings with several citizens organizationsand sporting groups. Additional public involvement will include releaseof the draft alternatives for public review and comment in June 1988, andan open house at the time of release of the Draft Environmental ImpactStatement. The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the JeffersonRanger District, Deerlodge National Forest have cooperated in developmentof the issues and alternatives and have been invited to continue as theanalysis continues.The draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) is expected to be filedwith the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for publicreview in August, 1988. At that time EPA will publish a notice of availabilityof the DEIS in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will be45 days from the date the EPA's notice of availability appears in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> It is very important that those interested inmanagement of the Park Lake area participate at that time. To be most helpful,comments on the DEIS should be as specific as possible and may addressthe adequacy of the statement or the merits of the alternatives discussed(see the Council on Environmental Quality regulations for implementingthe procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40CFR 1503.3). In addition, Federal court decisions have established thatreviewers of draft EIS's must structure their participation in the environmentalreview of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency tothe reviewers' position and contentions, <T3>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC,</T3> 435 U.S. 519, 553(1978) and that environmental objections that could have been raised atthe draft stage may be waived if not raised until after completion of thefinal environmental impact statement. <T3>Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris,</T3> 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D.Wis. 1980). The reason for this is to ensure that substantive commentsand objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time whenit can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final EIS.After the comment period ends on the DEIS, the comments will be analyzedand considered by the Forest Service in preparing the final environmentalimpact statement. The final EIS is scheduled to be completed by November1988. In the final EIS the Forest Service is required to respond to thecomments received (40 CFR 1503.4). The responsible official will considerthe comments, responses, environmental consequences discussed in the EIS,and applicable laws, regulations, and policies in making a decision regardingthis proposal. The responsible official will document the decision andreasons for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision willbe subject to review under applicable Forest Service regulations.Ernest R. Nunn, Supervisor of the Helena National Forest, is the ResponsibleOfficial.<ITAG tagnum="6">Ernest R.
