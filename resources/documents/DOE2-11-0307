The objective isto provide Britons with the energy they need at a competitive price withoutunacceptable damage to the environment. The aims are the safe and sensibleuse of non-renewable sources of energy, improved efficiency in energysupply, conversion, distribution and use and the development of renewableresources of energy. The ways that these aims and objectives are to beachieved are discussed in more detail under the headings energy efficiency,coal, oil, gas, electricity and renewables. The potential of nuclearpower is recognised. The policy for nuclear power stations is that existingplants should be maintained, unless already obsolete, and those undercontruction should be completed with the highest safety standards applied.Research and development on the fast breeder reactors and fission reactorplants should continue, even though no justification is seen for thepressurized water reactor at Sizewell-B. The JET nuclear fusion projectshould continue. The problem of spent fuel reprocessing and nuclear wastedisposal must be addressed. A greater openness on nuclear power is advocated.(U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
