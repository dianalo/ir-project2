The decision resolves two separate legal challenges towage ordinances enacted in the San Francisco Bay area. Thelaws, closely watched by other states, required developers ofmajor commercial projects to pay prevailing wages asdetermined by the state's Department of Industrial Relations.The resulting wages approximated what union workers earned;the laws had the support of some unions as well as localofficials, who contended they ensured job safety.</LP><TEXT>   But federal Judge Charles Legge ruled that the measureswere an &quot;impermissible interference in the collectivebargaining process&quot; under the National Labor Relations Actand also violated the federal Employee Retirement IncomeSecurity Act.   He added, &quot;They are examples of `an interest-group deal inpublic-interest clothing.' The resolutions and the ordinanceare designed to protect certain construction workers,primarily members of certain unions, from competition inwages.&quot;   The counties and cities argued that such laws are withinthe police power of the state to protect workers, much likechild-labor laws. They also contend that the measurescountered a tendency of large, nonunion construction projectsto attract transient workers, and made up for the addedburden that such projects imposed on local services andfacilities.   &quot;This is a dangerous precedent,&quot; said Thomas R. Adams, aSan Mateo, Calif., attorney for union supporters of the laws.&quot;Prevailing-wage regulation has existed for decades, and ithas never before been thought to be pre-empted by any aspectof federal law. We view this decision as a radical departurefrom the established principles of law regarding prevailingwages.&quot;   The decision is believed to be among the first by afederal court to address the issue; a California state courtearlier upheld one of the ordinances on different grounds.   For years, state and federal officials have been able todictate prevailing wages on government projects. InCalifornia there has been a movement over the past two yearsto extend the notion to the private sector. But other states,including Florida, have been studying the idea.   The decision is a victory for the U.S. Chamber ofCommerce, which had challenged a prevailing-wage law enactedlast August by Contra Costa County, Calif. In a separatecase, the judge granted a request by the Associated Buildersand Contractors trade group to strike down prevailing-wageresolutions passed by the California cities of San Bruno andSouth San Francisco.   Such laws &quot;replace private bargaining with publicgovernment fiat and take the bargaining out of thebargainers' hands, where it has been for decades,&quot; said JamesSeverson, a partner at McCutchen, Doyle, Brown andamp; Enersen, whorepresented the U.S. Chamber. &quot;I think it ought to give greatconcern to any city or county or municipality thinking ofadopting any ordinance like this.&quot;   ---   BENEFITS LAW APPLIES to statements made by insuranceagents, judge rules.   By interpreting the federal Employee Retirement IncomeSecurity Act broadly enough to encompass sales pitches, afederal judge in San Francisco handed an important victory toinsurance companies.   Erisa, the federal regulatory system that controls mostworker-benefits plans, limits the grounds upon which insurerscan be sued. Moreover, under the legal doctrine of&quot;pre-emption,&quot; Erisa bars state-law claims from being broughtagainst defendant companies.   Douglas Hallett, a lawyer for the insurer, Executive LifeInsurance Co., Los Angeles, said the decision by Judge FernSmith was among the first to extend Erisa to statements madebefore an employee benefit plan was actually sold. ExecutiveLife is a failed former unit of First Executive Corp.   &quot;This ruling insulates insurers from agent misconduct,&quot;said Mr. Hallett, of the Los Angeles office of Coudert Bros.   The suit was brought by two employee benefit associationsagainst Executive Life and its former agent who sold thembenefits packages, claiming that the agent misrepresented keyterms. The insurance plans later lapsed.   Judge Smith noted that the insurer itself didn't breachany fiduciary duties or commit any fraud against theassociations. Thus the associations were effectively deprivedof any remedy against the insurer, the judge ruled.   Lucia Savage, a San Francisco attorney for one of theassociations, Sante Mineral Waters Employees' WelfareBenefits Trust, called the ruling a &quot;Catch-22,&quot; because itmeant that the associations were deprived of any remedy.   ---   STANDARD IS TIGHTENED for foreign governments seeking U.S.court aid.   The federal appeals court in Manhattan clarified when arequest known as a rogatory letter can be used. Rogatoryletters enable foreign governments to ask a U.S. judge toorder that evidence be turned over for use in a foreign courtproceeding.   The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled thatrogatory letters can be enforced only when they are forimminent foreign proceedings. Reversing a lower-court judge,the court said the requests aren't valid if the proceeding ismerely &quot;probable.&quot;   The case involved a Brazilian investigation of fourPanamanian companies that had U.S. accounts at MorganGuaranty Trust Co. The companies were being investigated forpossible tax-law and currency-law violations.   Brazilian authorities sought information about the U.S.accounts, leading to a grand-jury subpoena ordering MorganGuaranty to turn over records. The lower-court judge ruledthat the rogatory-letter request was proper, because it wasprobable that a judicial proceeding would be held in Brazilin the case.   The federal appeals court, however, said that standard wastoo lenient and could allow invasions of privacy in the U.S.by foreign governments. The appeals court saidrogatory-letter requests only apply when foreign judicialproceedings are &quot;very likely to occur and very soon tooccur.&quot;   Thomas E. Engel, a New York attorney for the Panamaniancompanies, said the decision could set an important standardfor other cases involving foreign-banking investigations. Hesaid rogatory letters in such cases are typically granted.   A spokesman for J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., the parent of MorganGuaranty, said, &quot;We think the standard the Second CircuitCourt of Appeals has applied is much more sensible&quot; than thatcited by the lower-court judge.   The U.S. supported turning over the documents. Nelson W.Cunningham, an assistant U.S. attorney, said the governmenthas not yet decided whether it will appeal the decision.   ---   EX-ASBESTOS MAKERS lose a bid to require U.S. to help paydamages.   The U.S. appeals court in the District of Columbia ruledthat the government isn't obligated to help pay asbestospersonal-injury damages under federal law. Three formerasbestos makers -- Eagle Picher Industries Inc., UNRIndustries Inc. and GAF Corp. -- had alleged that thegovernment should be required to pay damages in connectionwith asbestos exposure at federal shipyards.   The companies argued that the U.S. was negligent in notenforcing safety rules about asbestos, which can cause cancerand other diseases years after exposure. The appeals courtupheld a lower-court ruling dismissing the federal claims.   But the appeals court sent the companies' state-law claimsback to the trial judge. In allowing the companies to pursuethe state claims, the court could open the way for theex-asbestos makers to finally require the U.S. to pay some ofthe personal injury-damages, said Joseph Hollingsworth, anattorney for UNR with the law firm Spriggs andamp; Hollingsworth inWashington.   The companies have been rebuffed in their previous effortsto seek such payments.   ---   TRW's FORMER POLICY CHIEF sues company for wrongfuldischarge.   Pat Choate, author of &quot;Agents of Influence,&quot; a book highlycritical about the power of Japanese lobbyists to influenceU.S. policy, claims that he was wrongfully fired from his jobat TRW Inc. last year due to the company's fear of Japanesereprisals. In a suit filed in Washington, D.C., SuperiorCourt, Mr. Choate alleged that the dismissal made himunemployable and asked for $5 million in compensatory damagesand $25 million in punitive damages.   Lawyers for the Cleveland-based TRW have not seen thecomplaint, a company spokesman said. But he said theelimination of Mr. Choate's &quot;position had nothing to do withthe book&quot; or &quot;any pressure from anyone -- including theJapanese.&quot;   ---   NOTED: A 39-year-old federal judge who spent only fouryears on the bench has retired to join the Los Angeles lawfirm Irell andamp; Manella. Layn R. Phillips, formerly a U.S.district judge based in Oklahoma, will be a litigationpartner in the 191-lawyer firm's Newport Beach, Calif.,office. Mr. Phillips worked for the Justice Department andthe Federal Trade Commission before becoming a judge. He saidfinancial considerations and his desire to be an advocateplayed a role in his decision to leave the bench.</TEXT></DOC>
