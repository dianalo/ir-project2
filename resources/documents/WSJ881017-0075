(Luxembourg), a new private banking holding company formed last month, announced a price of $57 a share for an issue of 5.1 million shares.    The issue will raise about $290 million, the company said. The offering is aimed at international investors as part of a major restructuring of the European activities of Republic New York Corp.    Republic New York will hold 49% of Safra Republic in exchange for Republic New York's five banking subsidiaries in Switzerland, Luxembourg, France, Guernsey and Gibralter, according to a spokesman. The five units are valued at $430 million.    Financier Edmond J. Safra, a Lebanese citizen based in Geneva, will buy 20%, or 3.7 million shares, of Safra Republic for about $211 million. He will serve as chairman of Safra Republic.    The financier already owns a controlling 33% interest in Republic New York, the spokesman said. The entire transaction will raise about $500 million, bringing Safra Republic's capital to nearly $1 billion.    Republic New York will retain its units in London and Milan. Its U.S. units include Republic National Bank of New York and Williamsburgh Savings Bank.    The aim of the operation is to reinforce the Republic group's position in the European Community before the EC's consolidation into a unified market in 1992, the spokesman said.    The new company marks the end of Mr. Safra's five-year non-competition agreement with American Express Co., which bought his trade development bank in 1983. Mr. Safra has estimated the private-banking market to be worth at least $1 trillion. He expects the market to grow as the 1992 target nears for ending the EC's restrictions on investment and foreign exchange.    Safra Republic shares are expected to be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and later on the Geneva, Zurich and Basel exchanges in Switzerland. </TEXT></DOC>
