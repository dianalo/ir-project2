The PGA Tour'sleading money-winner, Corey Pavin, who began the day a stroke behind Stewart,and Masters champion Ian Woosnam were among them, shooting 79s.;    When a25-mph wind kicked up to dry out Hazeltine's rain-softened greens, it put theclassic U.S. Open premium on playing from the fairway and hitting precise ironshots.;    &quot;The USGA got what they wanted today,&quot; said Stewart, who was forcedto hit two full driver shots into the northwest wind to reach the uphill452-yard par-4 18th. &quot;The golf course is showing all its teeth.&quot;;    Stewart,the 1989 PGA champion, will try to reverse the results of his fourth round atthe 1986 Open at Shinnecock Hills, when he led with six holes to play butfaltered badly to finish sixth, four shots behind Raymond Floyd.;    &quot;I'm abetter player now,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;I'm past that stage.&quot;;    Stewart will havea formidable playing partner in Simpson, who stared down Tom Watson to win the1987 Open at the Olympic Club in San Francisco.;    Since that victory,Simpson never has been more than five shots out of the lead in the Open at theend of the day in 18 rounds.;    Despite the stroke gap between the final twoand the rest of the field, neither Stewart nor Simpson expects to play today'sround as if it were match play.;    &quot;It can't ever be match play, because thisis a medal-play tournament,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;Scott and I play two differenttypes of golf. I hit the ball farther than Scott. He is a great thinker, agreat manager and a great putter.&quot;;    Simpson has learned to push out anythoughts of winning until the deed is done. Although he finished with a 68 atOlympic, his fourth rounds have been his weakest of the tournament. He closedwith a 74 at Brookline in 1988 after being the third-round co-leader, he fadedto a 75 at Oak Hill in 1989, and he shot a final-round 73 last year atMedinah.;    &quot;It's hard not to think of winning, but you try to get it out ofyour mind as quick as you can,&quot; he said.;   LEADER BOARD; Scott Simpson      70-68-72--210; Payne Stewart       67-70-73--210; Nick Price         74-69-71--214; Scott Hoch          69-71-74--214; Brian Kamm         69-73-73--215; Fred Couples        70-70-75--215; Nolan Henke        67-71-77--215; Hale Irwin          71-75-70--216; Rick Fehr          74-69-73--216; Craig Parry         70-73-73--216; Sandy Lyle         72-70-74--216; Larry Nelson        73-72-72--217; Jim Gallagher, Jr. 70-72-75--217; Craig Stadler       71-69-77--217; Corey Pavin        71-67-79--217; ...; HANGING ON; Craig Stadler  71-69-77--217; Corey Pavin   71-67-79--217; Nick Faldo     72-74-73--219; LOSING THE GRIP; Tom Watson    73-71-77--221; Raymond Floyd  73-72-76--221; OOPS; Jack Nicklaus 70-76-77--223; (box) WEATHER A FACTOR:  Expect lower scores in Open today.Page 12D  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Chaska, Minn.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910616  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  687  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday June 16, 199100168227,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
