President Bush's record on appointing women and minorities is more outstanding than the article states. Women and minorities constitute 29% of the president's personnel selections. More such appointments are forthcoming.    The president has chosen 56 women for positions within his administration in just the first six months. This is more than was done in all of 1981 (45). It is also within striking (and surpassing) distance of the most nominations President Carter made in any year of his administration (72 in 1980).    Another point of comparison is to look at the numbers for the Senior Executive Service -- the top ranks of the career civil service, which has been choosing people for years, not just six months. In 1988, women constituted only 8.7% (vs. 20% for President Bush) and minorities only 6.2% (vs. the president's 13%).    We do not believe in quotas or judging people merely as numbers. This is dehumanizing. What matters about President Bush's appointments is not the percentages but the responsibilities he has entrusted to his appointees. Women and minorities are confirmed or pending confirmation to such important and responsible position as cabinet and deputy-cabinet posts; the Federal Trade Commission; the Federal Communications Commission; general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board; general counsels of cabinet departments; the commissioner of Social Security; and such other &quot;nontraditional&quot; jobs as ambassadors and top-line Defense Department positions.
