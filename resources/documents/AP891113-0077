(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vice President Dan Quayle saidtoday that the eventual reunification of Germany is inevitable andthat when it comes, the rejoined nation will be ``allied with theforces of freedom and democracy, which is the West.''   ``... East Germany is East Germany because of the communistsystem,'' Quayle said. ``Do away with the communist system and it'sGermany.''   The vice president told the Republican Governors Associationthat the GOP has delivered on the issues of peace and opportunityin the 1980s and that it is no accident that ``the forces offreedom and democracy are on the march in Eastern Europe.''   He said it is Democrats, not President Bush, who have been timidin dealing with change at home and abroad, because all they want todo is spend more money.   ``The Democrats haven't offered one creative idea on how tomanage the evolving situation in Eastern Europe or the Soviet Unionexcept to criticize the president,'' Qualye told a group ofreporters later. He said the administration has been properlycautious but still ``out front on this issue.''   In Germany, where the East German government has opened theBerlin Wall permitting free travel to the West and has promisedelections, ``Eventually you will see reunification,'' Quayle saidin the interview. ``It's going to take some time.''   He said that reunification would not mean the elimination of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact but wouldrequire a change in the responsibilities of those militaryalliances, in Western relations with the Soviet bloc and in theinstitutions and culture of East Germany itself.   ``... A unified Germany in defense alliances will continue tolook West, it will continue to be allied with the forces of freedomand democracy, which is the West,'' Quayle said.   At the same time he cautioned against unilateral reductions inU.S. troop strength in Europe, saying that precipitous cuts coulddamage both Western security and the movement toward freedom in theEast.   Quayle was the keynote speaker as the Republican governorsopened a day and a half of conferences on politics, issues andproblems of state government.   Fifteen of the 22 GOP state governors were on hand at the firstmajor party gathering since the Nov. 7 elections in which Virginiaand New Jersey elected Democratic governors.   But association leaders said the outcome was no surprise.   The New Jersey defeat will thin the ranks of the GOP governorsto 21. Virginia will remain Democratic unless a recount overturnsthe closest gubernatorial election in state history.   Gov. Mike Hayden of Kansas, chairman of the Republicangovernors, said Sunday night that last week's balloting confirmedwhat the party already knew: There is a big job ahead if the GOP isgoing to elect more governors next year.   He told a news conference it is vital that Republicansaggressively recruit the best candidates available. Asked whetherthat meant that the GOP candidates this year _ James Courter in NewJersey and J. Marshall Coleman in Virginia _ were not the strongestof entries, he replied: ``Well, they didn't win.''   One issue that hurt them was abortion, which both men opposedbut on which both tempered their positions during the campaign.Hayden and his colleagues said Republicans could defuse that issueby handling it head-on in 1990.   Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina said Republicancandidates should spell out clear positions on the abortion issueand avoid being typecast simply as pro-life or anti-abortionpoliticians.   Campbell is opposed to abortion except in cases of rape, incestor threat to the life of the mother, but he bristled at a questiondescribing him as a ``pro-life'' Republican, calling it anoversimplification.   Campbell said Republicans running in 1989 allowed themselves tobe cornered on the issue, while Democrats were able to define theirown views and the positions of their GOP rivals as well.   ``You'll beat nothing with something every time you put it onthe table,'' he said.   Quayle joined the governors in a golf tournament Sunday _ histeam finished second.   He and Lee Atwater, the Republican national chairman, weredelivering the administration's political message to the governors,looking toward a 1990 campaign in which 36 states will electgovernors, 34 will choose senators and all 435 House seats will beat stake.   Atwater was concentrating on the politics of reapportionment.Governors and legislatures chosen in 1990 will have a major hand inreapportioning House seats after next year's Census. The party thatcontrols state government controls the crucial redistrictingprocess.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and William Bennett, directorof the Office of National Drug Control Policy, also are addressingthe governors.</TEXT></DOC>
