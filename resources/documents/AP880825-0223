The daily Le Soir reported Tapie, 43, has already reached a``tentative'' takeover accord under which 150 of the 350 jobs wouldbe saved.   In recent years, Tapie has bought a range of failing firms andmade them profitable, becoming something of a symbol of Frenchentrepreneurial spirit.   Donnay, the world's number one racket maker a decade ago, wasdeclared bankrupt last Friday by a Belgian court after failing toreach agreement with creditors on new funds and a restructuring ofits debt.   Hours later, Damaco International of Hong Kong, became the firsttakeover candidate.   Donnay, based in Couvin near the French border, ismajority-owned by the Donnay family. It reached its peak when BjornBorg advertised its rackets but began to lose money after theSwedish tennis ace retired in 1981.   Donnay has debts of 1.4 billion Belgium francs ($35 million). In1987, its revenue was 1.16 billion francs ($29 million), down athird from 1986, and posted a loss of 80 million francs ($2million).   Early in the decade, Donnay made over 1.5 million rackets a yearand had a staff of 600. After Borg retired, its output of tennisrackets fell by 50 percent and its staff was cut to 350.   Officials said this was because Donnay ignored the trend forrackets made of synthetic products and failed to sign a new tennisstar to advertise its product.</TEXT></DOC>
