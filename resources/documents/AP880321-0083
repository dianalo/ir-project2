The money was used by Secord and Hakim to invest in arms, foodand real estate businesses for their personal gain, the ChicagoTribune reported, citing unidentified sources close to theinvestigation by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.   According to the report, Secord and Hakim transferred the moneyfrom Swiss bank accounts in three installments from August toNovember 1986. The two reportedly used $760,000 from the accountsto buy a one-third interest in Forway Industries, a military supplycompany in New Jersey, and $50,000 on a plan to work with Forway tomarket a laser sight for night weapons firing, the newspaper said.   The Tribune said Walsh obtained some of his information throughthe help of Willard Zucker, an attorney and financial adviser whohas been granted immunity from prosecution. The Geneva-based Zuckermanaged the Swiss bank accounts and allegedly set up shellcorporations to mask the diversion of $18 million of the money paidby the Iranians, the Tribune said.   A federal grand jury indicted Secord and Hakim, along with Lt.Col. Oliver North and former National Security Adviser JohnPoindexter last week on charges of conspiring to siphon the profitsfrom the Iranian arms sales and use the money for the benefit ofthe Contras fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government. It alsoaccused Secord, Hakim and North of using some of the money forpersonal gain.   The four have said they would plead innocent at an arraignmentThursday.   The indictment also charged Secord and Hakim of conspiring topay illegal gratuities to North.   Zucker and a spokesman for Walsh declined to comment about thematter, the Tribune said.   Secord was in meetings today and unavailable for immediatecomment, said Joan Corbin, a secretary at Washington, D.C.-basedAmerican Trade Consultants.   Secord's attorney, Tom Green, was traveling and also unavailableto comment immediately, said Julie Linwood, a secretary at Green'sWashington, D.C. law firm.</TEXT></DOC>
