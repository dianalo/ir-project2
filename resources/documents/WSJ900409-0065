Mr. Buckey, who was indicted in March 1984, will be triedon eight counts of child molestation involving three girlswho were once pupils at the now-defunct Virginia McMartinPreschool in the upscale California community of ManhattanBeach.</LP><TEXT>   Earlier this year, after nearly three months ofdeliberations in the 28-month trial, a jury in Los AngelesSuperior Court acquitted Mr. Buckey and his 63-year-oldmother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 out of 65 counts ofchild molestation. But Mr. Buckey's victory was cut short bythe prosecution's decision to retry the remaining 13 countson which the jurors had become hopelessly deadlocked. Sincethen five of the unresolved counts have been dismissed.   The Los Angeles district attorney alleged that from 1978to 1983, Mr. Buckey, the grandson of the school's founder,and Mrs. Buckey, the school's director, molested 11youngsters at the once-prestigious school. The children alsoaccused their former teachers of a litany of horrificmisdeeds including satanic rituals, child-pornography ringsand animal mutilations.   Mr. Buckey, 31, has steadfastly proclaimed his innocence.His lawyer, Danny Davis, has argued that the case grew out ofmass hysteria resembling the Salem witch hunts of 1692. Ifconvicted, Mr. Buckey, who has spent nearly five years inprison, faces a maximum 15-year prison term. A representativeof the Los Angeles district attorney said time served wouldlikely be subtracted as time and a half.   Jury selection is expected to take at least a monthbecause of the difficulty of finding individuals who aren'topinionated about the case. The trial is expected to take atleast six months.   ---   IMELDA MARCOS ASKS JUDGE to lift her bail restrictions.   Benjamin Cassiday, an attorney for Mrs. Marcos, told U.S.Judge John Keenan that she wants to return to the Philippinesfor the deposition of defense witnesses.   He also said he will seek a deposition from CorazonAquino, who became president of the Philippines in early 1986after Mrs. Marcos's husband, the late Ferdinand Marcos, wasousted from power. The deposition is necessary, the lawyerstated in an affidavit, to authenticate a taped radiobroadcast in which Mrs. Aquino said she directed the formerU.S. ambassador to the Philippines to remove the Marcosesfrom that country.   Mrs. Marcos, whose trial began last month, is charged withstealing more than $160 million from the Philippines andconcealing most of the money through real-estate purchases inthe U.S. She has sought to have her trial in federal court inNew York thrown out on the grounds that she was brought tothe U.S. against her will during the revolution that broughtPresident Aquino to power. Judge Keenan previously rejectedthat claim. Federal prosecutors say Mrs. Marcos came to theU.S. voluntarily.   In his affidavit, Mr. Cassiday, who was in the Philippineslast month, said a &quot;general atmosphere of intimidation in thePhilippines&quot; makes it impossible for many potential defensewitnesses to come to the U.S. to testify. &quot;Every witness thatI interviewed demonstrated . . . that he or she wasintimidated by the combined power of the Aquinoadministration in the Philippines and the U.S. government,&quot;he said in the affidavit. &quot;As a result of this pervasive fearit was necessary for me to change hotel rooms repeatedly sothat witnesses that I interviewed couldn't be identified byFilipino government agents.&quot;   Potential witnesses say they believe they may be jailed bythe U.S. or that the Aquino administration won't permit themto return home if they come to the U.S. to testify, Mr.Cassiday wrote.   ---   WINDMERE WINS $30 million judgment from N.V. Philips.   After a six-year battle, Windmere Corp. won the judgment,which will be trebled, in antitrust litigation involvingPhilip's Norelco shavers. The award was made Friday in U.S.District Court for the Southern District of Florida.   In 1984, Dutch-based Philips and its North AmericanPhilips Corp. unit sued Windmere, a personal-care-productsmaker in Miami Lakes, Fla., and one of its suppliers. Philipsalleged unfair competition and patent infringement related toWindmere's rotary electric shaver.   Windmere filed a counterclaim alleging that Philips droveit out of the three-head rotary-shaver market by offering 35%to 40% discounts on old models of its Norelco shaver,underselling Windmere by 25% to 30%. Windmere, represented bythe Chicago law firm of Winston andamp; Strawn, said it suffereddamages of between $13 million and $39 million and abandonedthe market as a result. U.S. officials of Philips and lawyersat Sullivan andamp; Cromwell, the New York law firm representingthe company, couldn't be reached for comment.   Upon hearing the verdict, David M. Friedson, Windmerepresident and chief executive officer, sent employees homeearly Friday afternoon.   ---   ARBITRAGERS CONVICTED of insider-trading charges.   A federal jury in New York convicted Wall Streetarbitrager Victor Teicher and Ross Frankel, former head ofarbitrage research at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. The twowere implicated in the &quot;Yuppie Five&quot; case in 1986 in whichfive young Wall Street professionals were charged withtrading on inside information about corporate-takeover plans.   Mr. Teicher, 38, and his securities firm, Victor Teicher andamp;Co., were convicted of one count of conspiracy and elevencounts of securities fraud. Mr. Teicher also was convicted oftwo counts of mail fraud.   Mr. Frankel, 33, was convicted of one count of conspiracy,one count of securities fraud, one count of mail fraud, onecount of perjury and two counts of obstruction of justice.   Lawyers for the defendants said they would appeal.   The defendants each face maximum fines of $250,000 on eachcount and substantial prison sentences. The Teicher firmcould be fined a maximum of $500,000 on each count.   The trial was the second half of a case that also includedas defendants Marcus Schloss andamp; Co. and Ronald Yagoda,formerly head of the arbitrage-trading room at MarcusSchloss. In July, the New York arbitrage firm was convictedof two insider-trading related charges and Mr. Yagoda wasacquitted.   The Securities and Exchange Commission last week settledits civil charges against Mr. Yagoda. That settlementincludes an unusual provision for Mr. Yagoda, who didn'tadmit any wrongdoing: After a one-year suspension from thesecurities industry, he will have to keep a log for threeyears recording all communications he has about any companiesin which he trades or causes trading.   The log will be available to the SEC for review.   ---   Michael J. McCarthy contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
