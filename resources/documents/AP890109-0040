The British Midland Airways jet, carrying 126 people, crashedSunday while attempting an emergency landing about 10 minutes afterleaving London's Heathrow Airport en routeto Belfast. Authoritiessaid at least 37 people were killed.   Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said the aircraft was purchased lastfall by GPA Leasing in Shannon, Ireland, which leased it to BritishMidland. He said it is the first accident involving a 737-400 or a737-300, which is 10 feet shorter than the 400 series.   The 737-400 was certified by the Federal Aviation Administrationin September and 17 of the $28 million to $32 million jets are inuse, Gamble said Sunday.   British Midland chairman Michael Bishop said the company hadtaken delivery of the twin-engine plane only 12 weeks ago. He saidthe plane reported severe vibrations in one of the engines abouteight minutes into the flight. Witnesses said one of the engines wason fire as it attempted to land at an airport about 100 miles northof London.   Gamble said the engine used on both 737 models is the CFM-56,which is built in France by a consortium made up of General Electricand SMECMA, a French concern.   He said the engines are brought to the United States andreassembled and tested at a General Electric plant near Cincinnati.The completed engines are shipped to the Boeing plant at Renton, asuburb of Seattle, where the 737 is manufactured.   The CFM-56 has been the world's top-selling commercial jet engineduring the past two years surpassing GE's rival, Pratt andamp; WhitneyAircraft, in the market for powering standard-body jets ofshort-to-medium-range routes.   More than 5,900 of the engines have been sold to more than 100operators since the engine entered service in 1982.   Dwight E. Weber, a spokesman for CFM International and the GEaircraft engine business group, declined to speculate on the rolethe CFM-56 may have played in Sunday's crash.   ``We'll be working with the airline to determine the cause,''Weber said Sunday. ``Once the cause is determined, if it'sengine-related, we'll be working with the customers who operate theengine to determine if it's an isolated case or a fleetwideprogram.''   A Boeing team was to travel to England today aboard a 737-300that was being delivered to British Midland, said David Jimenez,another Boeing spokesman.   The 737-400 was rolled out in January 1988, and the first flightwas in March. Depending on the interior design, the jet can seat 130to 150 passengers.</TEXT></DOC>
