<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-35-1120 </DOCNO><TEXT>'Solar economy' was the title of a study on the possibility of havingan energy supply structure exclusively based on solar energy (with a50% share by 2030). Solar power generation, the potential of solar energy,and energy conservation options are discussed. The concepts of a centralizedhydrogen economy and a solar economy are compared. Decentralisation isviewed as an important factor in assuring the adaptation of power generationfrom renewable energy sources to the constantly changing energy demand.Energy conversion at community level should be given preference. To date,public utilities have been successful by different means in preventingthe integration of decentralized solar systems. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
