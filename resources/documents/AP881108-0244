Pilots have until 3 p.m. CST Thursday to cast their ballots foror against the strike deadline of midnight Sunday. The deadline wasset after contract talks between the Eagan-based airline and the AirLine Pilots Association reached an impasse Nov. 1. No new talks arescheduled.   ``We're very encouraged at the participation level to thispoint,'' Jim Halverson, an ALPA representative, said Monday. ``Thereare a lot of pilots who are still out and about and flying.''   Results won't be announced until balloting closes, he said. Amajority of those voting must support the strike deadline for themeasure to pass.   Nothwest has said it is considering mediation as an option tosettle the dispute, but spokesman Red Tyler said Monday that norequest has been made. Halverson said the union isn't interested inmediation.   Talks have been held 102 times during the last 19 months andHalverson said more than half the contract issues are unresolved.   The carrier and union are negotiating for a combined contractcovering 2,800 pre-merger Northwest pilots and 2,000 former Republicpilots. The two pilot groups have been working under separatecontracts since Northwest's acquisition of Republic in 1986.   There are differences over wages, work schedules, fringe benefitsand length of contract.   Tyler said Northwest does not expect a work stoppage, regardlessof the outcome of the strike vote.   Northwest wants a contract effective through June 30, 1993, whilethe union is seeking a pact that expires June 30, 1990.   Under the Railway Labor Act, airline contracts continue in effectuntil they are amended by the parties or until efforts to reach newcontracts are exhausted.</TEXT></DOC>
