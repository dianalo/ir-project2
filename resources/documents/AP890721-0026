Roosevelt had the New Deal, JohnF. Kennedy the New Frontier. Lyndon Johnson had the Great Society.If Budget Director Richard Darman has his way, the catch-phrase forthe Bush years will be ``the New Balance.''   Darman, who is considered one of the administration's toppolitical strategists, said the term sums up what George Bush hasbrought to the presidency.   ``There is new balance. One sees it in the tone and style ofbipartisan approaches to the budget and foreign policy,'' Darmansaid Thursday in a speech to the National Press Club.   The budget director said it also was evident in what he calledthe administration's balanced proposals on the savings and loancrisis, cleaning up air pollution and scaling back defense spending_ all areas where Bush has sought compromise in place of stakingout unwavering ideological positions as Reagan did.   ``Maybe it's time to assert that not all approaches to publicpolicy-making should soar with winged feet, that from time to timeAmerica may benefit from leadership with its feet close to theground and with strides suited for the longer race,'' Darman said.   Darman also used his first major policy address since takingover as the administration's point man on the budget last Januaryto attack what he called ``cultural now-now-ism.''   He said that was a shorthand label for ``our collectiveshortsightedness, our obsession with the here and now, ourreluctance adequately to address the future.''   Darman said one difficulty politicians face in trying to take along-term approach to problems is that ``voters and lobbyists forthe present are far better represented than the voters of thefuture.''   He called the federal budget deficit a prime example of thecountry's philosophy of ``buy now and let others pay later.''   While the deficits soared during the Reagan years, Darmansidestepped questions about whether the prior administration, inwhich he also served, should be held responsible for failing toachieve solutions to the deficit and other long-term problems.   ``Reagan brought us back our national pride and optimism,''Darman said in response to a question after the speech. ``The nextjob (for Bush) is to build on that.''   By adopting the New Balance as a catch-phrase, Darman said theadministration could answer critics who carp about Bush's lack ofthe ``vision thing.''   ``We have come to demand drama and catch-phrases as if they wereconstitutionally protected rights,'' Darman said. ``It's as if eachnew White House communications director were a national accountmanager obliged to outdo the creative talents who brought priorgenerations the political equivalent of New Tide, New Cheer and NewDawn.''   Darman did concede one problem with using New Balance as theadministration's slogan _ it's also the name of a popular runningshoe.</TEXT></DOC>
