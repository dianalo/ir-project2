To be exact, he is suing the principal of Moscow Vocational School 79, who fired him as a shop teacher. In the fussier courts of the U.S., a plaintiff with a case like his could hardly hope for a more sympathetic hearing than this Soviet judge provides at the Kievsky Region People's Court.    The school's star witness, the deputy principal, has taken the stand midway through the five-hour trial.    &quot;When Yuri Ivanovich was on duty,&quot; he says, &quot;he admitted a visitor who shouldn't have been allowed in.&quot; The judge, a smartly dressed woman, assumes a look of profound disbelief.    &quot;What have you got to hide?&quot; she demands. &quot;Military secrets?&quot; The visitor, it soon transpires, came from the Communist Party. The judge looks down at the principal, who sits in the first row of hard benches. &quot;Why did you reprimand Yuri Ivanovich for letting a party official into the building?&quot;    &quot;Anybody could say he was from the party,&quot; the principal mumbles. &quot;He just walked in. Unfortunately, he came to my office.&quot;    The judge's voice oozes sarcasm. &quot;Why unfortunately? What was so terrible? Weren't you pleased to see the party?&quot;    &quot;The rules say you don't let people in,&quot; the principal declares bravely. &quot;Are you opposed to the rules?&quot;    &quot;Yes,&quot; snaps the judge.    Impartiality isn't a hallmark of Soviet law. But the chatty, catty atmosphere of a Soviet trial isn't a police-state perversion, either. Judges do get at the facts. Justice is swift, simple, cheap and open to drug dealers and divorcees alike. For a foreigner keen on watching the Russians squabble among themselves, a bench in the back of a Soviet courtroom is the best seat in the empire.    The first lawyer to run the Soviet Union, V.I. Lenin, liked it this way. So does the second, M.S. Gorbachev. For a reformer like him, the law is a wonderful tool. A rewrite of the penal code, due this year, should take some of the criminality out of personal initiative. It will rethink capital punishment and let suspects seek counsel sooner. In January, a statute took effect that expands the right to sue paper pushers. A freedom-of-information act is on its way. Lawyers even talk of a jury system.    In the U.S., law reformers want fewer lawsuits. Here, they want more -- to help weaken the bureaucrats' hammerlock on Soviet society. &quot;We legal people,&quot; says a public defender, &quot;are very glad to have a lawyer in charge.&quot;    Common criminals, and some dissidents, have benefited already. The conviction rate in People's Court, long nearly 100%, appears to have dropped. More defendants lodged appeals last year. Fewer went to prison. The anti-drinking drive has no doubt cut the crime rate, but something more is afoot: Police and prosecutors no longer seem to see the loss of a case as a black mark against the state.    For all his railing against corruption, though, Mr. Gorbachev won't easily repeal one time-honored legal precept. It's called &quot;telephone law.&quot; The Communist Party invokes it by picking up the phone to tell a judge how to decide a case. &quot;The danger was clear in the 1920s,&quot; says Arkady Vaksberg, who writes for Literaturnaya Gazeta. &quot;It's a shame. All this time later, we still have it.&quot;    Telephone law means that Soviet justice, even in cases with scant political content, remains justice for not-quite all. &quot;A lot depends,&quot; says Victor Kusin, a lawyer and a critic of the regime, &quot;on the status of the person who brings the complaint.&quot; Not to mention the status of the person he complains against.    Yuri Mityunov knows all about telephone law. Like Yuri Fidulov, he has brought a suit for wrongful dismissal. In 1986, Moscow Radio fired him from his job analyzing broadcasts to Latin America. Before that, he had worked at the Council for Religious Affairs. And before that, as a student, Mr. Mityunov had served as an agent for the KGB.    His legal troubles began in real estate. A few years back, some big shots from the Bolshoi Theater bumped him out of his apartment in central Moscow. Mr. Mityunov tried to file suit. The courts gave him the runaround. He got into a shoving match with a bureaucrat, whom he accused of assault. Again, the courts ignored him. The KGB, he says, stepped in on his behalf, but all it could offer was an apartment, where he now lives, in a defense ministry complex.    &quot;It was a political game,&quot; Mr. Mityunov says in his sitting room one afternoon, &quot;but there was nothing the KGB could do. The Moscow City Soviet turned out to be stronger.&quot;    Still, he couldn't dispel his anger at the bureaucrat who had shoved him. With the dawn of &quot;glasnost,&quot; Mr. Mityunov went back to court, only to be rebuffed once more. In a huff, he quit the Communist Party. Moscow Radio promptly fired him. He sued.    &quot;Under Soviet law,&quot; Mr. Mityunov says, &quot;there is no way they can sack me for leaving the party.&quot; But in People's Court last October, he lost -- and he has lost his KGB connection, too. &quot;I've appealed,&quot; he says, &quot;but it doesn't matter. The party decides, not the court. The fact that I can talk about this to you I owe to Gorbachev. But as far as my case goes, it makes no difference.&quot;    Most Westerners probably expect as much from Soviet justice. What may come as a surprise is the law's service to the citizen who doesn't happen to have a KGB connection but still argues with his cousin over his aunt's will or gets hit on the head by a falling icicle. As long as nobody picks up a telephone, the legal system works.    For starters, this is no litigious society. Without private capital, disputes among companies get shunted into arbitration. With police everywhere, the crime rate stays low. Kievsky region has 750,000 people; last year, its People's Court heard 4,000 cases, fewer than 1,000 of them criminal. A city of nine million, Moscow has 1,500 lawyers (New York has 70,000), and they aren't overworked. Anyone can walk into a legal consultation office and buy advice on the spot.    &quot;He didn't do it,&quot; says an old woman whose son has been charged with rape. &quot;An innocent person is going to prison.&quot; In an office on Kalinin Prospect she waits for her turn with a lawyer as a hubbub of consultation rises from behind wooden partitions.    &quot;The police want to know why she's not working,&quot; a young man says of another woman, seated beside him. &quot;She's married and has a child. So has she got the right not to work? We came to find out.&quot;    A man standing with a folder under his arm says: &quot;I have to leave my apartment. The state needs it. I'm demanding a similar amount of space. I've been to People's Court. Moscow City Court is my next step. I keep on going for the sake of justice. It's cheap.&quot;    &quot;Do you get a lot of nut cases in America, too?&quot; asks Evgenia Tikonova in her cubicle behind a partition. &quot;They're not entirely normal. They like filing papers.&quot;    One of 50 lawyers working out of this office, she takes all comers for a salary of 300 rubles a month, or $500. She charges 15 rubles a case -- five rubles extra if the client gets a 100-ruble award, 30 extra for a 1,000-ruble award. No Russian wins punitive damages; no lawyer asks a contingency fee. &quot;Dreadful,&quot; says Mrs. Tikonova of such American excesses. &quot;A lack of spirituality.&quot;    Divorce tops the list of cases that come to her. But if a state truck runs somebody down, the state prosecutes the driver for a crime, and the victim sues him for lost earnings. The same holds when a doctor's scalpel slips. A Russian stuck with a new car that won't start can sue the state. So can someone refused a pension or an apartment.    The lawyers of Kalinin Prospect file their suits at the People's Court in Moscow's Kievsky region. From there, cases can move on appeal to City Court, to the Supreme Court of the Russian Republic, and then up to the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union. But the mood in this lower court, which shares quarters with an outpost of the Interior Ministry, recalls no big-city courthouse in America. It's quiet inside, dimly lit, and as criminal trials proceed, only a few police appear.    Nina Bunina, dishwasher, stands in the dock of courtroom four, accused of buying 20 bottles of vodka for six rubles each and selling them for 11. That's a crime, not a coup. The judge, a woman young enough to look fresh from law school, reads out depositions by co-workers and neighbors: The accused skips work; drunks knock on her door. In a Soviet court, just about anything is admissible.    &quot;Buying for one price and selling for another is speculation,&quot; the judge says. Flanking her sit two men -- lay assessors, on duty for two weeks; their opinions count as much as the judge's, but their eyes have glazed over. Mrs. Bunina studies her feet. &quot;Didn't you understand that?&quot; asks the judge.    &quot;Not really,&quot; Mrs. Bunina replies. Her lawyer jumps in to elicit the requisite contrition; People's Court, as Lenin conceived it, remains the Soviet Union's leading morality play. &quot;Do you regret what you did?&quot; he asks. Mrs. Bunina reddens on cue. &quot;I won't do it any more. I'll work honestly,&quot; she says. &quot;Yes, I regret it.&quot;    Down the hall, in Room One, a weightier trial is progressing. A dark-bearded man from Turkmenia stands accused of drug smuggling. He was arrested in Moscow holding a bagful of poppy seeds. Amazingly, he is pleading not guilty.    When a couple of outsiders sit in, the defense lawyer doesn't like it. &quot;Do you want some Americans sniffing around?&quot; he asks his client. The man shrugs. &quot;Have you got permission to be here?&quot; the prosecutor wants to know. It is pointed out that in the Soviet Union courts are open to anyone. The trial continues, exploring how poppy seeds made their way into the defendant's trousers. Then, when the visitors leave during a recess, the prosecutor remembers reform.    &quot;Come again,&quot; she says cheerily. &quot;This is glasnost.&quot;    The verdicts seem to confirm that. Mrs. Bunina and the man from Turkmenia are both found guilty, and both get a year of &quot;corrective labor,&quot; but neither goes to prison. Yuri Fidulov, the teacher fired by the principal of Technical School 79, gets his job back. Yet the fate of Yuri Mityunov, the ex-KGB man who lost a wrongful dismissal suit against Moscow Radio, confirms something else.    On the morning of his appeal, which Mr. Mityunov has invited a reporter to cover, the police mount a roadblock at the courthouse. They divert cars and trucks, allowing buses and trolleys to pass. They check pedestrians' credentials, and let most everyone through. At the sight of a foreign-correspondent's press card, however, an officer bars the way. &quot;Gas,&quot; he says. &quot;Gas leak.&quot;    So without benefit of spectators, as Mr. Mityunov later reports, the case is postponed. &quot;It wasn't a gas leak,&quot; he says when told why his guest didn't turn up. &quot;I'd call it a glasnost leak.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
