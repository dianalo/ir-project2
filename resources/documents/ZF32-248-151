Consequently, Goodnight looked around for the best Ccompiler and chose Lattice C. The two companies merged and built the SAS/Ccompiler, which was instrumental in developing SAS's Multiple VendorArchitecture.andP;  Darbyshire describes this architecture as SAS's version of SAA- it enables applications to be portable within the SAS softwareenvironment.andO;SAS then used this architecture to rewrite the SAS System - the developerssplit the SAS code into three layers: the host, the supervisor and theapplications layer, which were all rewritten using the SAS/C compiler.andO;Around 90% of the product is now system independent as the applications layerand the supervisor layer is now host independent.andP;  The final 10% of theSystem is the host layer and it is this layer that has to be rewritten foreach hardware implementation the company supports.andP;  This rewriting of thesoftware has also changed the way that the company is structured, since itnow has one application development team and some small host developmentteams so that releases of the SAS System should be consistent across allsupported environments.andM;Little painandM;This new architecture has led to a very impressive generator of portableapplications.andP;  For example, if an application is developed under OS/2 runningwith Presentation Manager and is then shifted to a DEC VAX it will runDECwindows.andP;  If it is then moved to a Unix workstation that application willthen look and feel like Motif.andP;  Running under MVS on a 3278 terminal it willuse SAS's own windowing system - in short it adapts to whatever windowingtechnique is offered by the device driver.andP;  When it comes to databasemanagement systems Darbyshire says that SAS users can live wih or withoutthem depending on the application.andP;  The system offers data sets, which areused by the majority of SAS users at MVS sites.andP;  However, SAS does offerapplication tools to enable users to both abstract and work against data heldin DB2, Oracle or Ingres.andP;  Another benefit offered by Multiple VendorArchitecture is that applications can be moved with relatively little pain towork against another database management system, so that, for example, anapplication can be moved from the MVS environment to the VAX environmentwhere it will work against data held in Rdb as long as the table names arefirst changed in the application.andP;  The SAS Institute claims 20,000 sitesworld-wide of which 8,500 are IBM or plug-compatible mainframe users, 3,500are DEC VAX or some other proprietary mini site, while the rest are mainlyMS-DOS, aside from around 1,000 Unix sites.andP;  The personal computer and Unixusers can only use version 6, the majority of mini users are in the processof moving across to version 6, but the bulk of MVS sites are holding back andholding on to version 5.andP;  Of course, the EIS hook might just change that...andO;</TEXT></DOC>
