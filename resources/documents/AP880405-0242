ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   F.W. Woolworth Co., faced with the prospect ofbecoming Dart Group Corp.'s latest takeover target, is shoring upits defenses.   Woolworth said Monday that a partnership controlled by DartChairman Herbert Haft _ who is fresh from an unsuccessful raidagainst Stop andamp; Shop Cos. _ had disclosed it planned to acquire $15million or more of the retailer's stock.   The nation's 13th largest retailer, which built its reputationrunning a national chain of five-and-dime stores before expandinginto specialty retailing, said its board approved a ``poison pill''takeover defense after Dart's disclosure.   Woolworth issued a statement that its board adopted the defense``to deter coercive or unfair takeover tactics.''   Wall Street indicated it expected the Hafts to make a bid soonfor Woolworth. The retailer's stock shot up $8.87{ to $54.12{ inNew York Stock Exchange composite trading.   Based on Monday's closing stock price and the company's roughly65.7 million common shares outstanding, Woolworth had a marketvalue of about $3.6 billion.   Less than a month ago, Dart terminated a $1.03 billion bid forBoston-based Stop andamp; Shop after its target agreed to a leveragedbuyout by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   Landover, Md.-based Dart owns and operates Trak Auto Inc. andCrown Books Corp.   The Hafts repeatedly have said they were serious about buyingand operating a retailer, but doubts linger about their actualintentions. Dart's string of unsuccessful but profitable takeovermoves against such retailers as Dayton Hudson Corp., SupermarketsGeneral Corp. and Safeway Stores Inc. in recent years has givenHaft and his son, Dart President Robert Haft, reputations ascorporate raiders.   Dart has made millions of dollars from its takeover forays byacquiring stock and later either selling it back to the targetcompany or to another suitor.   Robert Haft was not available when a reporter called for commentMonday.   A source close to Dart confirmed the partnership had disclosedin a March 18 filing with the federal government of its intentionsto acquire a Woolworth stake. The source declined to say whether atakeover bid was in the offing.   Joseph Carroll, a Woolworth spokesman, declined to comment whenasked what steps the company might take if and when the Hafts makea takeover bid.   Woolworth's poison pill would make a hostile takeover moreexpensive by allowing the company's shareholders to buy its stockat a steep discount. It becomes effective when an investor acquires20 percent of Woolworth's stock, on the commencement of a tenderoffer for 30 percent or more of the retailer's shares, or when ahostile bidder acquires at least 15 percent of the company's stock.   Edward Johnson, a retail industry analyst with Prescott Ball andamp;Turben Inc., said that if faced by a hostile buyout attemptWoolworth might consider going private under a leveraged buyout.   Other options open to the retailer include acquiring anothercompany itself or spinning off one of its units to shareholders.   Johnson said Woolworth's low stock price and the company'slow-rental properties and successful specialty store formats makeit an attractive target. Woolworth, founded 109 years ago by FrankW. Woolworth as a five-and-dime store, has grown to an empire ofmore than 6,300 general merchandise and specialty stores worldwide.In recent years, the company has shifted its focus from itswell-known Woolworth stores to its specialty operations, whichinclude Kinney shoe stores and Foot Locker and Lady Foot Lockerathletic footwear stores.   For the fiscal year ended Jan. 30, Woolworth earned $251 millionon sales of $7.14 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
