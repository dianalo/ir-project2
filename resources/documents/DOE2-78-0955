The magnetic refrigerator equippedwith 14 pieces of GGG (gadolinium-gallium-garnet) single crystal unit(30mm in diameter 10mm in length) in the rotating disk operates alongthe gradient of the magnetic field produced by a racetrack superconductingmagnet, whose maximum magnetic field is 4.5 Tesla and the minimum fieldis 1.1 Tesla. The final goal of their program is to liquefy gaseous heliumevaporated from a liquid helium vessel of the racetrack superconductingmagnet by the rotating magnetic refrigerator which operates by usingthe magnetic field of the superconducting magnet. A 0.12W refrigerationpower in the 0.72rpm operation has been achieved under condition of 4.2Kto 11.5K operation. The helium evaporation rate of this magnet systemis estimated as the order of 10mW, and the achieved refrigeration powerof 0.12W at 4.2K is sufficient for cooling the superconducting magnet.</TEXT></DOC>
