This rule amends various Export Control CommodityNumbers on the CCL in Commodity Group 6 (Metals, Minerals and Their manufactures)and in Commodity Group 7 (Chemcials, Metalloids, Petroleum Products andRelated Materials). This rule also amends the licensing requirements fortechnical data related to certain commodities in Group 7.These revisions have resulted from a review of strategic controls maintainedby the U.S. and certain allied countries through the Coordinating Committee(COCOM). Such multilateral controls restrict the availability of strategicitems to controlled countries. With the concurrence of the Department ofDefense, the Department of Commerce has determined under the Export AdministrationAct, as amended, that this rule is necessary to protect U.S. national securityinterests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule is effective September 15, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>For questions of a technical natureon Metals, Minerals and Their Manufactures, call Jeff Tripp, Office ofTechnology and Policy Analysis, Telephone: (202) 377-1309.For questions of a technical nature on Chemicals, Metalloids, PetroleumProducts and Related Materials, call Jeff Tripp, Office of Technology andPolicy Analysis, Telephone: (202) 377-1309.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared.2. This rule contains a collection of information subject to the requirementsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This collection has been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under control number 0694-0005.3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(c) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruleimplements regulatory changes based on review in COCOM. Further, no otherlaw requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity forpublic comment be given for this rule.Accordingly, it is being issued in final form. However, as with other Departmentof Commerce rules, comments from the public are always welcome. Commentsshould be submitted to Patricia Muldonian, Office of Technology and PolicyAnalysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, P.O.Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Parts 379 and 399.</ITAG>Computer technology, Exports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,Science and technology.Accordingly, Parts 379 and 399 of the Export Administration Regulations(15 CFR Parts 368-399) are amended as follows:1.
