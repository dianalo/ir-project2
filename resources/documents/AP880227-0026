Thesoldiers waited for the inevitable violence.   Noon prayers every Friday have surpassed religious significancesince Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip begantheir protests 11 weeks ago. Mosques have become the rallying pointfor dissent and the release of pent-up frustrations.   The latest violence came at the Al-Omari Mosque in Gaza onFriday, as it did elsewhere in the territories. And, as expected,the soldiers wasted little time breaking up the demonstration,responding to the stone-throwing with tear gas and rubber bullets.   This time, there were no injuries a Al-Omari, the main mosque inGaza City, capital of the territory snatched from Egypt during the1967 Middle East War. The building was erected by the Romans andlater transformed into a mosque.   Friday's sermon by Khamis Murtaja, a lecturer at the IslamicUniversity in Gaza, was moderate. A worshipper whispered to avisitor seated discreetly in the rear of the mosque that Murtaja,like other speakers, has been warned by Israeli authorities toavoid inflammatory rhetoric.   Murtaja's sermon to several hundred listeners called forpatience and prayer in the face of the current difficulties.   ``God will help those who remain patient,'' he said. ``It is atest of their faith. If we cannot remove injustice by force, wemust be patient. Don't despair. Don't complain. The solution comesonly from God. If you complain to other than God, it issubmission.''   But as Murtaja called for moderation, leaflets signed by thefundamentalist Islamic Jihad organization were being circulated inthe mosque. Their message was vastly different.   ``The land of Palestine is the center of the struggle and theessence of the universal conflict,'' said the leaflet from IslamicJihad, whose influence has been growing, particularly in the GazaStrip.   ``The salvation of the Arab people, in particular thePalestinian people, and the salvation of all human beings isrelated to the destruction of this hateful, racist entity,'' theleaflet said, refering to Israel.   It called on the people to escalate the fight against Israel,saying ``the mosques must be transformed into centers ofconfrontation.''   The moment the prayers were over, dozens of youths rose to theirfeet shouting ``Allahu Akhbar,'' Arabic for ``God is great,'' anddash for the exit.   Outside they picked up stones and pelted the nearest group ofsoldiers, shouting taunts and curses.   The soldiers charged, firing tear gas canisters and rubberbullets. The youths scattered, darting into the myriad ofsidestreets and alleys. The army declared the area a closedmilitary zone until calm is restored.   Army vehicles raced up and down the streets, three abreast,chasing demonstrators. A woman ran down a main avenue waving herarms and screaming: ``They have seized two mosques.''   It is not true. At least not here. But numerous witnesses saidsoldiers raided a mosque in the nearby Jabaliya refugee camp, whereone Palestinian youth died and about 20 injured in the clashes.</TEXT></DOC>
