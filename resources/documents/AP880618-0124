(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The chance to swim with a pod ofdolphins and even hop a ride on a passing dorsal fin has touristslining up at attractions in the Florida Keys, but someenvironmental activists worry the animals will be exploited.   Three attractions and a resort in the Keys charge as much as $50each to tourists who have been on waiting lists for more than amonth to take their 15-minute ``dolphin encounter.''   ``Where else are you able to get up close and feel the dolphin'sskin and experience its gentleness and the way it uses itsecho-location systems?'' said Mike Wood, curator of Theater of theSeas ocean park in Islamorada. ``People leave here with a whole newappreciation for these animals. It's a tremendous educationalexperience.''   Stormy and Genie, the attraction's two 7-foot-long Atlanticbottlenose dolphins, have splashed along with 12 swimmers every dayfor the past year. They appear to relish the human contact _nuzzling kisses on the cheeks of young women, wagging theirpowerful tails to stand in the water and ``dance,'' and even flyingout of the water to turn somersaults above swimmers' heads.   The dolphins chirp and click after each task until the trainerhas rewarded them with fish. The wide-eyed tourists come away withspectacular photographs and a few minutes they'll never forget.   ``This is something I've wanted to do my whole life and now Ican say I've done it,'' Alan Larosee of North Providence, R.I.,said as he climbed out of the oceanside, landlocked lagoon.   But the environmental group Greenpeace is not as enthusiastic.   It views any public display of dolphins for profit asexploitative and is calling for government regulation of swimprograms.   ``The dolphin swims in the Keys have been very popular andthat's been encouraging several big resorts around the country tothink about capturing dolphins for a program of their own,'' saidLesley Scheele of the Fort Lauderdale chapter of Greenpeace.   ``Our concern is that this could escalate to the point whereeverybody trying to lure a tourist is applying to capture dolphinsfor a swim program,'' she said. ``This could end up putting a majorstrain on wild populations.''   Dolphins have been a protected species since 1972 under theMarine Mammal Protection Act, which allows for the tightlycontrolled capture of dolphins for public display.   But the law doesn't specifically address ``dolphin encounters''or how they should be operated.   ``I've seen some places where they dump 10 people in the waterand they're all grabbing at one dolphin _ all the animal wants todo is get away,'' said Chip Hershaw, a trainer at the non-profitDolphin Research Center on Grassy Key, which has operated a swimprogram for three years.   ``There's a right way and and wrong way to go about it,'' hesaid.   Theater of the Seas, Dolphin Research Center and Dolphins Plusin Key Largo are the only places that have been granted federaldisplay permits along with special experimental permits to run theswim programs, while Hawk's Cay Resort operates dolphin swims withonly a display permit, said Brian Gorman, a spokesman for theNational Marine Fisheries Service in Washington, D.C.   The regulatory agency has conducted public hearings on the issuehere and in Washington and has appointed an expert panel to come upwith a set of dolphin encounter guidelines, Gorman said.   Until those rules are issued, expected by mid-summer, thefisheries service has ordered a moratorium on any more dolphin swimprograms. That has delayed plans by a Hyatt Hotel in Hawaii tocapture six dolphins for swims with guests, Gorman said.   ``Ideally, we'd like to see the dolphin swims restricted to onlynon-profit research facilities, places where there's a realeducational mission,'' said Ms. Scheele of Greenpeace. ``Anytimeprofit is the main motive there's a possibility of abuse.''   The group has also recommended that any swim facility be set upto allow dolphins to come and go from the wild freely and not beforced to interact with humans, said Bo Bricklemyer, a Greenpeaceattorney in Washington.   There may also be health risks when humans swim with dolphins,Ms. Scheele said, since it is not known exactly what is causing avirus that has killed hundreds of dolphins in the last year alongthe East Coast. She said there has been no proof that dolphins andhumans have exchanged such viruses.   Wood of Theater of the Seas agrees there should be someregulation, but he feels many checks are already in place toprotect dolphins and said for-profit attractions can help in thateffort.   ``The whole idea that we're out to rape the oceans of all thedolphins is incredibly misleading,'' he said. ``The federalgovernment nowadays makes it a long, arduous and expensive processjust to get the approval to capture a dolphin _ there's no way thelaw would allow a big run on dolphins.''   Federal law allows fewer than 100 dolphins to be taken forscientific or public display purposes every year, yet as many as12,500 dolphins are allowed to be ``incidentally'' killed in netsin the commercial harvests of tuna and other fish, Gorman said.   ``The number of dolphins that could ever be taken for swimprograms is a drop in the bucket,'' Wood said. ``Greenpeace hastheir priorities way out of line here. It's programs like ours thatcreate the awareness to save the dolphins that are reallyendangered.   ``We're not getting rich off the dolphin swim program either,''he said. ``If we wanted to get rich we could run this like a rideat Disney World. We would never allow that to happen.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Fri AMs, June 24</NOTE></DOC>
