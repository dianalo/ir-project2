Wear process testing and crack-detectionby vibroacoustical, XRF, and spectral analysis methods are discussed,with attention to the incorporation of stochastic process models in pdfcalculations for the damage levels and suitable diagnostics of variousstructural and mechanical elements. 10 references.</TEXT></DOC>
