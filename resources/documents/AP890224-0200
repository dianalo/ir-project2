While the men _ two private consultants and a suspended Navyprocurement specialist _ are no longer accused of racketeering, theyface a number of other criminal charges stemming from the Jan. 7indictment, including bribery and theft of government property.   U.S. District Judge Richard Williams issued his ruling from thebench, and said he would file a written order next week, accordingto Gerard Treanor, a lawyer for William L. Parkin, a defendant.   Treanor said the judge agreed with the defense arguments thatprosecutors had not presented enough evidence to satisfyracketeering charges against consultants Parkin and Fred H. Lackner,and Stuart E. Berlin, a Navy official who has been suspended withoutpay.   Defense attorneys said a significant result of the dismissal wasthat the government would no longer be able to seize cash and otherassets of the defendants under provisions of the RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.   The three men were charged with racketeering and conspiracy tocommit racketeering as part of a 27-count indictment returned by afederal grand jury.   The 86-page indictment also included charges against TeledyneElectronics of Newbury Park, Calif., a defense contractor that is abranch of Teledyne Inc. of Los Angeles, and three Teledyne employees.   But neither Teledyne Electronics nor its employees were chargedwith racketeering, which carries a penalty of 20 years in prison anda fine of $250,000. The penalty for conspiracy to commitracketeering is five years in jail and a $250,000. Conviction on aracketeering charge can also result in forfeiture of any propertygarnered illegally.   Attorneys said Williams also dismissed some wire fraud countsagainst the defendants, but refused to grant motions to drop othercharges. The trial is set to begin on March 27.   In the indictment, the first in the government's 2-1@2 yearinvestigation into the defense purchasing system, prosecutorsclaimed that Teledyne and three of its officers agreed to pay Parkin$160,000 to assist them in obtaining a Navy contract related toradar.   The indictment contended that Parkin then paid Lackner, aCalifornia-based consultant, who, in turn, paid Berlin to manipulatethe contracting procedures so that Teledyne was assured of receivingthe contract.   The government's coast-to-coast investigation of the $150-millionPentagon purchasing system, code-named ``Operation Ill Wind,''centers of allegations that companies paid private consultants toillegally obtain information about lucrative contracts. Prosecutorsbased much of their information on telephone wire taps.</TEXT></DOC>
