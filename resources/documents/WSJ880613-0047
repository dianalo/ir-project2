The North proposal, which would have violated U.S. law, was advanced to the Reagan administration's crisis planning group, but never carried out.    The scheme is disclosed in &quot;Best Laid Plans,&quot; a new book by David Martin and John Walcott about America's faltering war against terrorism. Mr. Martin is the Pentagon correspondent for CBS News; Mr. Walcott covers national security matters for The Wall Street Journal. U.S. News andamp; World Report is publishing excerpts from the book today.    The book also documents that:   --The administration's &quot;moderate&quot; contact in the Iran-Contra affair was, in fact, a member of the Ayatollah Khomeini's terror network.    --After the hijacking of TWA Flight 847 in 1985, the Joint Chiefs of Staff rejected a plan to fire cruise missiles at a terrorist meeting in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley; intelligence later concluded that two top leaders of Iran's terror network attended the meeting.    --Mr. Reagan's &quot;involvement in foreign affairs was episodic, anecdotal, impulsive, and rarely decisive.&quot; When told that Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger refused to join the French in a retaliatory raid after the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, Mr. Reagan's only response was: &quot;Damn, I sure wish we could do it.&quot;    In a detailed reconstruction of the U.S. 1986 attack on Libya, the book tells how Marine Lt. Col. North proposed that Mr. Waite would set up a meeting with Col. Gadhafi in the dictator's Tripoli headquarters just before the planned bombing. The ostensible purpose of the meeting would have been to enlist the Libyan strong man's help in gaining freedom for hostages held in Lebanon.    Under the proposed scheme, Mr. Waite -- who wouldn't be told of the real mission -- would leave the compound and Col. Gadhafi would spend the night there rather than in the underground bunkers or desert tents where he usually stayed. When, hours later, U.S. bombers hit the compound, the Libyan would almost certainly be killed.    &quot;North's scheme was discussed and quickly rejected,&quot; the book says. Col. North was then told to draw up a White House statement to be used if Gadhafi was killed in the raid. The statement characterized the Libyan's death as &quot;fortuitous.&quot;    The administration is barred from assassination plots by an order President Reagan issued early in his administration. &quot;Reagan administration officials had absolutely no qualms about killing Gadhafi,&quot; the book reports, &quot;but they couldn't plan to do it.&quot;    The attack on Libya followed a tortuous period of failed attempts to unseat or at least contain the troublesome dictator. Although Secretary of State George Shultz claimed in 1983 that these schemes had put the Libyan leader &quot;back in his box,&quot; Libyan-sponsored violence increased.    Although the book links Col. Gadhafi to a string of anti-American attacks, it says Iran and Syria were both more deadly in their terrorist activities. Neither made a good target for reprisals, however. Syria's alliance with the Soviet Union presented massive complications, as did Iran's purported negotiations on behalf of the U.S. with hostage-takers in Lebanon.    The book describes problems with the 1986 raids, including the damage to a Tripoli residential area hit by mistake.    &quot;The carnage in the Bin Ghashir neighborhood . . . was as ghastly as the scene of any terrorist attack -- severed hands lying in the rubble, a father grieving over the body of his three-year-old child, exposed electrical wires crackling in pools of blood, water and sewage.&quot;    Soon after the raid, the book reports, the administration began planning a possible second attack. Col. North again proposed luring Col. Gadhafi to a spot where bombers could target him. Under the new plan, a friendly foreign leader would have telephoned the Libyan dictator so that the U.S. could pinpoint his whereabouts through its vast eavesdropping machinery. &quot;The notion was instantly shouted down by North's colleagues,&quot; says the book.    According to the book's authors, Col. North &quot;originally agreed to be interviewed but later declined at the insistence of his attorney.&quot;    Col. North's attorney couldn't be reached for comment.    Col. North faces criminal charges for activities in the administration's Iran-Contra affair, also detailed in &quot;Best Laid Plans,&quot; which covers the U.S. battle against terrorism from 1981 through 1987. Fired from his national security post in November 1986 in connection with the affair, Col. North left the Marines earlier this year. </TEXT></DOC>
