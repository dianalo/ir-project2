Sign Refugee Agreement</HEAD><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The pro-Hanoi government in Cambodia hassigned an agreement with the U.N. refugee agency to allow Cambodianrefugees to return home from camps along the Thai border, stateradio reported today.   An official Cambodian government broadcast said the agreement,signed Monday in Phnom Penh, deals with ``principles and proceduresto welcome back voluntarily repatriated Cambodian refugees.''   ``The memorandum has been signed and the UNHCR (U.N. HighCommissioner for Refugees) would be ready to facilitate Cambodianrefugees who ... wish to return,'' said a U.N. refugee agencyofficial in Bangkok, Kaiser Zaman.   Only about 17,000 of the quarter-million Cambodians along theThai-Cambodian border are being assisted by the U.N. body, butothers could seek transfer to the U.N. refugee camp of Khao I Dangand then apply for repatriation, refugee sources said.   Large numbers of Cambodians fled violence, starvation and diseaseas Vietnamese troops invaded their country in late 1978 and oustedthe brutal Khmer Rouge. Vast camps were set up along the frontier,most of them controlled by various anti-Phnom Penh guerrilla groups,including the Khmer Rouge.   During a news conference last month, Cambodian Prime Minister HunSen said his government would be willing to welcome all 250,000refugees.   Refugee officials generally believe most will not seekrepatriation because of the continued conflict in Cambodia.   Only about 4,000 Laotian refugees in Thailand have returned homeunder a similar U.N. refugee program that began in 1985.   Last June, the U.N. refugee agency submitted the names of threeCambodian refugees who wished to return to Phnom Penh authorities as``test cases.'' The government has yet to respond to theserepatration requests.</TEXT></DOC>
