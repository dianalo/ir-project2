DuPeza to make sure they had the ADP tools to get the job done.andM;DuPeza, who retired last month as director of the Executive Office of thePresident's IRM Division, said his main goal when he took the post in 1985was to make the IRMD a dynamic unit that provided the most cost-effectivetechnology.andM;&quot;When I came here I found it was too much of a reactive organization, notenough proactive,&quot; DuPeza said.andP;  &quot;There was no leadership or direction and noperformance tools.andP;  It was like driving a car with the dashboard removed.&quot;andM;The EOP IRM Division provides services to the White House staff, thepresident when he travels, the Office of Management and Budget and variousspecial projects such as the Tower Board and Drug Free America.andM;Because EOP users demand more services during a crisis or after an unexpectedevent, responding to their needs required intensive efforts by the IRMDivision.andP;  DuPeza said he needed to make the IRM staff of 1,200 public andcontractor employees function as a cohesive unit.andM;To avoid independent organizations within the IRM division and to improveinternal communications, he established a number of committees, including theInformation Technology Coordinating Committee, Change Management Committeeand Security Management Review Board.andP;  Officials from the IRM office alsoparticipated in the Budget Season Coordinating Committee and vendor supportmeetings.andM;&quot;Because of the need to be responsive, we make little discernment betweencontractor and civil service [employees].andP;  We consider it an integratedenvironment,&quot; DuPeZa said.andM;&quot;With the urgency of our tasks we've got to get the job done.andP;  No one personhas an idea what change may do to the system and that is why we have aconsortium of the key players.&quot;andM;In devising the EOP system architecture, DuPeza said, the EOP needed aflexible environment to allow for future upgrades, meet changes in clientneeds and adopt a mix of hardware and software at the best price.andM;EOP users have shown interest in fourth-generation languages and databasesoftware, so officials decided on an integrated micro-mini-mainframeenvironment with IBM mainframes that could provide downsizing for processingat the most productive level.andM;&quot;We said it will at least be IBM mainframes.andP;  If you have that then you haveSNA [Systems Network Architecture] as a de facto standard,&quot; DuPeza said.andM;&quot;We will be micro-mini-mainframe integrators.andP;  We're pushing forinteroperability and that means using industry and government standards.&quot;andM;While he could not described the EOP systems in detail because of securityconcerns, DuPeza said the EOP again needed to think ahead with itscommunications structure and that is why he chose fiber optics.andM;The IRM Division has gone from coax metallic to fiber optics for themainframe connection.andP;  It has 36 gigabits of bandwidth to meet user needswell into the next decade, he said.andP;  The government's Ethernet standard alsois being developed, and DuPeza said it should provide a backbone fiber-opticnetwork.andM;&quot;We chose fiber optics because it's a wave of the future and fiber optics hadarrived,&quot; DuPeza said.andM;&quot;The fiber gives us lots of options as the technology improves and moves intovoice-data-video-integration.andP;  There's a lot to become available in ISDN[Integrated Services Digital Network] and we want to be ready for it.&quot;andM;While acquiring technology was not a major problem, DuPeza said the ExecutiveOffice of the President lacked adequate measurement tools to monitorequipment performance and ensure it was getting the best equipment at thebest price.andM;To improve management capability, DuPeza said EOP acquired a variety ofmeasurement tools in the last two years, including an SNA gateway and an IBMCICS tool for on-line trouble shooting.andM;&quot;We've always been concerned on what the return on investment is.andO;Information costs money to find, originate, process, disseminate and store,&quot;DuPeza said.andM;&quot;We're constantly balancing between the cost of updating and the return oninvestment.andP;  Every piece of equipment costs money and you have to be able tobreak down the resources, identify bottlenecks and provide the improvements.&quot;andM;Looking back on his tenure at the White House, DuPeza said his majorcontribution was helping provide the IRM division with the tools to makecost-effective decisions in an increasingly complex environment.andP;  Without theability to monitor performance and measure results, it is impossible to makeinformed decisions, he said.andM;&quot;What good is a system if you don't have management controls? Each piece ofequipment has a cost associated with it,&quot; DuPeza said.andP;  &quot;If informationdoesn't lead to better decisions it has no value.andP;  And why waste thetaxpayers' money to get the information?&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
