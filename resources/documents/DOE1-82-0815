Experience at the Cracow Mining and Metallurgical Academywith electric monitoring of coal cutters, based on the use of thyristorizedtransformers (supplying electric motors driving the advancing mechanismof coal cutters) is outlined. These controlling mechanisms assure automaticadaptation of advance speed to the hardness and cutting resistance ofcoal seams. Principles of the systems are described and shown in 6 diagrams.3 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
