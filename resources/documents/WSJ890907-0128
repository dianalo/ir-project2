Productivity outside the farm sector increased at an annual rate of 0.7% in the latest period after declining at a 1.3% rate in the first quarter, the Labor Department said. In a preliminary report last month the department put the second-quarter productivity increase at a 0.2% rate.    While the rise is still meager, it is also heartening. With the civilian unemployment rate at a low 5.2%, growth in worker productivity is increasingly vital to the country's economic expansion, which has continued for nearly seven years. Manufacturing productivity showed a particularly healthy gain -- a 2.9% annual rate instead of the 2.4% rate originally estimated -- which bodes well for American competitiveness abroad.    Nevertheless, the report contained some disturbing figures.    The productivity of American businesses outside of the financial sector continued to slip in the second quarter, falling at a 0.2% annual rate after plunging at a 1.8% rate in the first quarter. This was the government's first estimate of productivity in that sector, which excludes such financial businesses as insurance companies, stock and commodity brokers and banks.    And the report contained evidence that inflation is still rooted in the economy.    Hourly wages for workers outside the farm sector grew in the second quarter at a slightly faster rate than the department initially calculated: 5.6% instead of 5.5%. And that is far more rapid than the 4.8% rate of growth in the first quarter.    The escalation in labor costs means businesses may be inclined to raise their prices. At the same time, the wage increases weren't raising the living standards of American workers. After adjusting for inflation, wages actually fell at a 0.7% annual rate.    There was some slowing in the rise of labor costs per unit of production, however, but this figure still climbed at a hefty 4.9% annual rate. That was less than the original second-quarter estimate of 5.2% and below the 6.2% rate of the first quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
