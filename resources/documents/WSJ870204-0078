Harris Jr.Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AMITENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)PHARMACEUTICALS, HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT (PHA) </IN><TEXT>   Pesch andamp; Co. said a unit proposed buying all of American Medical International Inc.'s shares outstanding for about $1.74 billion, or $20 a share.    Pesch, a health-care, information systems and real estate development concern, said it told American Medical's board that the bid is contingent on getting needed financing. The proposal will remain open until Feb. 17.    The closely held concern is operated by LeRoy A. Pesch, who last year led a $406.2 million leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp., a Dallas health-care concern. A spokeswoman for Dr. Pesch said acquiring American Medical would further the Lake Forest, Ill.-based company's plans to build an international health-care network.    The new proposal appears to have taken American Medical International by surprise. In Beverly Hills, Calif., a spokesman for the company declined to comment on the Pesch bid. He said a package containing the proposal was received yesterday, but hadn't been analyzed.    &quot;We haven't had any contact with Dr. Pesch. We don't even know if he is a shareholder,&quot; the American Medical spokesman said.    Trading in American Medical was very heavy yesterday; the stock was the third most active on the New York Stock Exchange with volume of 3.2 million shares. The composite closing price was $19.25, up $1.375. There are 86.9 million common shares outstanding.    Randall Huyser, an analyst who follows health-care stocks for San Francisco-based Montgomery Securities, said he believes American Medical &quot;fiercely wants to remain independent&quot; and would oppose a $20-a-share bid. But he said its options were limited because the industry currently is hurting, and another health-care concern wouldn't be likely to emerge with a higher, friendly offer. He suggested that American Medical might propose taking the company private itself at a price &quot;in the low 20s.&quot;    American Medical, the nation's fourth-largest hospital chain, with 159 health-care facilities in the U.S. and abroad, posted hefty losses last year and began a reorganization that involved consolidation of regional offices, personnel reductions and the closing of its unprofitable group health-insurance operations. It has said it is considering formation of a real estate investment trust as a means of raising capital without taking on more debt.    Pesch said it is making its bid through its Alpha Health Systems Corp., a holding company set up to acquire health-care companies. Pesch said it wouldn't have any further comment on the proposal until today.    The spokeswoman for Dr. Pesch said he hadn't any comment on whether, or how, American Medical might be merged with Republic Health. Dr. Pesch owns 62% of the holding company for Republic Health.    Before concentrating on health-care management in 1976 by starting his own consulting firm, Dr. Pesch established himself in academic and government service. He taught at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University, among other schools, and served as dean of the medical school at the State University of New York in Buffalo. He was president and chief executive officer of Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago from 1971 to 1975.    Mr. Huyser of Montgomery Securities said it isn't clear where the Pesch group would obtain financing for such a large acquisition. Pesch didn't explain how it might finance the purchase.    There has been speculation in the past that the Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas, might be interested in finding a partner and making a bid for American Medical. An investment group including Bass family members owns 11.4% of American Medical.    Dr. Pesch's spokeswoman said she didn't have any information on whether the Bass family is involved in the offer. The Bass family wouldn't comment.    For the year ended last Aug. 31, American Medical had a net loss of $97.3 million, compared with a year-earlier profit of $163.8 million, or $1.94 a share. Revenue rose 31% to $3.46 billion from $2.65 billion.    In the latest first quarter, the company had net income of $28.6 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with $28.7 million, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 16% to $931 million from $805.2 million.    Mr. Huyser said that in an industry environment in which occupancy levels are low and Medicare reimbursement has been difficult, American Medical has more belt tightening to do. He said the reorganization effort last year helped a situation in which &quot;overhead was just wildly out of control.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
