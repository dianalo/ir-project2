A radio station and newspaper in Baku, the capital ofAzerbaidzhan, reported also that the republic's premier, Gasan N.Seidov, had traveled to the affected area.   ``The unrest has been stopped. Businesses and establishments oftrade and public eating are working in a normal rhythm and classesare taking place in schools and other educational establishments,''the Baku Worker newspaper reported.   The newspaper's article, referring to the Azerbaidzhan city ofSumgait, was read to The Associated Press by Soviet ForeignMinistry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov.   ``Order and peace have been ensured by law enforcement organs.People caught in the unrest have been detained,'' the Baku Workernewspaper reported.   Gerasimov said in a telephone interview that he could notconfirm rumors circulated by Armenian activists that as many as 20people had been killed in Sumgait. But he added, ``There washooliganism and there can be deaths in such cases.''   On Tuesday, Gerasimov told a news briefing that authoritiesclamped a curfew on Sumgait. He suggested the unrest in Sumgait,and demonstrations and violence elsewhere in the Caucasus region inwhich at least two people died, were due to a ``mistake'' made 65years ago when a territory composed largely of Armenians was madepart of neighboring Azerbaidzhan.   He said ``there were certain injuries'' in Sumgait, anindustrial city of more than 160,000 people in Azerbaidzhan wherehooligans were blamed for touching off the Sunday riot.   ``The situation is calm there today, but it is tense,''Gerasimov said at the Tuesday briefing.   Moscow-based foreign journalists have been barred from theregion, and only sporadic reports from witnesses, activists and theofficial media have reached the Soviet capital. Most telephonecalls placed to Baku and Sumgait today did not go through.   A man answering the telephone at the Ministry of InternalAffairs in Baku said ``everything is over'' when asked about theunrest in Sumgait. The conversation was cut off before a reportercould ask the person's name and position.   Baku Radio, monitored by the London-based British BroadcastingCorp., reported today that two non-voting members of the nationalruling Politburo, Georgy P. Razumovsky and Pyotr N. Demichev, hadvisited businesses and other establishments in Baku to speak to the``working people of these multinational collectives.''   It did not say when the tour occurred or say whether the twoofficials also went to Sumgait. They had visited the Armeniancapital, Yerevan, last week during demonstrations there.   Asked about reports that Soviet tanks are patrolling the streetsof Sumgait, that ethnic Azeris are attacking Armenians in thestreets and that there have been at least two deaths in the city,Gerasimov told the briefing,``There is a curfew,'' but that he hadnot heard anything about tanks being sent into the city.   Asked if troops remained in the city Tuesday, Gerasimov said:``I don't know, but I guess so. Presumably.''   The violence in Sumgait, reported Monday by Tass, the officialSoviet news agency, followed earlier outbreaks 150 miles away inNagorno-Karabakh, the contested region in Azerbaidzhan, and massivebut apparently peaceful demonstrations in Yerevan, the capital ofArmenia.   Hovik Vassilian said in a telephone interview today that he andother Armenian activists were angry that the official mediareported that the unrest had been quelled. He said he heard fromtravelers and from telephone calls to residents of the region thatdemonstrations were continuing in Nagorno-Karabakh and that foodwas in short supply.   The demonstrators demanded that Nagorno-Karabakh, part ofAzerbaidzhan since 1923, be made part of Armenia. More thanthree-quarters of the region's population of 157,000 are ethnicArmenians.   On Saturday, a Soviet prosecutor reported that two people livingin a region of Azerbaidzhan that borders on Nagorno-Karabakh hadbeen slain in unrest caused by the territorial dispute.   On Friday, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed forrestraint in Azerbaidzhan and Armenia and promised that theCommunist Party Central Committee would review relations among theSoviet Union's more than 100 nationalities.   Predominantly Moslem Azerbaidzhan is the largest of three Sovietrepublics in the Caucasus. It is bordered on the west by largelyChristian Armenia and Georgia and on the north by the RussianRepublic. The Caspian Sea runs for nearly 800 miles along itseastern edge.</TEXT></DOC>
