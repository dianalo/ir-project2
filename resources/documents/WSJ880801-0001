Commerce Department officials said that effective today, the U.S. will change its export-control regulations to allow computers with a processing data rate, or PDR, of 550 million bits of information per second to be shipped routinely to China. For several years, the upper limit for hassle-free computer shipments has remained at a PDR of 285 million bits. Applications to sell China more-powerful computers frequently were delayed or denied.    The U.S. action proceeds from a ruling set down early last month by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, the Paris-based body through which the U.S. aligns its export rules with those of 14 European allies and Japan. The other Cocom members are expected to amend their rules similarly.    The new threshold &quot;covers just about all the computers that we wanted to export to China but have been blocked,&quot; said Roger Sullivan, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, a trade body representing U.S. companies that do business with the mainland. Among the computer products China can obtain more easily under the new ruling are most of Digital Equipment Corp.'s VAX models, most of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s workstations, and some of International Business Machines Corp.'s medium-power computers.    In addition, the new ruling raises the PDR level of computers that can be sold in bulk to China to 116 million bits per second from 15 million. This will let a U.S. vendor ship several personal computers to a Chinese company under a single license.    Effective today, the U.S. will also raise the upper limit for allowable computer exports to the Soviet Union and other East Bloc countries from a rate of 48 million bits of information a second, to a 78 million a second. This would allow the Soviets to acquire some of IBM's older computer models. U.S. officials said the new East Bloc rules are merely an adjustment to the increasing availability of high quality technology, rather than a signal that the West is easing its strategic controls.    The new regulations will also ease restrictions on the export of such peripherals as cathode-ray tubes, disk drives and computer memories. Mr. Sullivan said the council was assured of further liberalization by next October.    The council was disappointed, however, by Cocom's decision to raise export thresholds for telecommunications equipment only slightly. Details of new regulations affecting such products weren't available, but Mr. Sullivan said such U.S. suppliers as American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and ITT Corp. will continue having difficulty serving the growing Chinese telecommunications market.    The Reagan administration decided last March to further liberalize exports to China after being assured by Beijing that it no longer sells Silkworm missiles to Iran and other Persian Gulf belligerents. </TEXT></DOC>
