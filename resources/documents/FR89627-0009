(i) A request for the delegationof original classification authority shall be made only when there is ademonstrable and continuing need to exercise such authority and the followingconditions exist:(A) The normal course of operations or missions of the organization resultsin the origination of information warranting classification;(B) There is a substantial degree of local autonomy in operations or missionsas distinguished from dependence upon a higher level of command or supervisionfor relatively detailed guidance;(C) There is adequate knowledge by the originating level to make soundclassification determinations as distinguished from having to seek suchknowledge from a higher level of command or supervision; and(D) There is a valid reason why already designated classification authoritiesin the originator's chain of command or supervision have not issued orcannot issue classification guidance to meet the originator's normal needs.(ii) Each request for a delegation of original classification authorityshall:(A) Identify the title of the position held by the nominee and the nominee'sorganization;(B) Contain a description of the circumstances, consistent with paragraph(a)(3)(i) of this section, that justify the delegation of such authority;and(C) Be submitted through established channels to the Secretary of Defense,the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, the senior officialdesignated by each under andSection; 5.3(a) of E.O. 12356, or the appropriateTop Secret classification authority.(4) <T3>Training Requirements for Original Classification Authorities</T3>.Heads of DoD Component shall establish procedures to ensure that all originalclassification authorities in their Component, to include themselves, areindoctrinated in the fundamentals of security classification, limitationson their authority to classify information, and their responsibilitiesas such. This indoctrination shall be a prerequisite to the exercise ofsuch authority and shall be a matter of record that is subject to audit.Heads of DoD Components shall ensure this indoctrination is given to allpresent original classification authorities within 12 months of the effectivedate of this part.(b) <T3>Derivative Classification Responsibility</T3>. Derivative applicationof classification markings is a responsibility of those who incorporate,paraphrase, restate, or generate in new form, information that is alreadyclassified, or those who apply markings in accordance with guidance froman original classification authority. Persons who apply derivative classificationsshould take care to determine whether their paraphrasing, restating, orsummarizing of classified information has removed all or part of the basisfor classification. Persons who apply such derivative classification markingsshall:(1) Respect original classification decisions;(2) Verify the information's current level of classification as far aspracticable before applying the markings; and(3) Carry forward to any newly created documents the assigned dates orevents for declassification and any additional authorized markings.(c) <T3>Record and Report Requirements</T3>. (1) Records of designations oforiginal classification authority shall be maintained as follows:(i) <T3>Top Secret Authorities</T3>. A current listing by title and organizationof officials designated to exercise original Top Secret classificationauthority shall be maintained by:(A) The Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Policy) (ODUSD(P))for the Office of the Secretary of Defense; the Organization of the JointChiefs of Staff; the headquarters of each Unified Command and the headquartersof subordinate Joint Commands; and the Defense Agencies.(B) The Offices of the Secretaries of the Military Departments for theofficials of their respective departments, including Specified Commandsbut excluding officials from their respective departments wo are servingin headquarters elements of Unified Commands and headquarters of JointCommands subordinate thereto.(ii) <T3>Secret and Confidential Authorities</T3>. A current listing by titleand organization of officials designated to exercise original Secret andConfidential classification authority shall be maintained by:(A) The ODUSD(P) for the Office of the Secretary of Defense.(B) The offices of the Secretaries of the Military Departments for theofficials of their respective departments, including Specified Commandsbut excluding officials from their respective departments who are servingin headquarters elements of Unified Commands and headquarters elementsof Joint Commands subordinate thereto.(C) The Director, Joint Staff, for the OJCS.(D) The Commanders-in-Chief of the Unified Commands, for their respectiveheadquarters and the headquarters of subordinate Joint Commands.(E) The Directors of the Defense Agencies, for their respective agencies.(iii) If the listing of titles of positions and organizations prescribedin paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section discloses intelligenceor other information that either qualifies for security classificationprotection or otherwise qualifies to be withheld from public release understatute, some other means may be recommended by the DoD Component by whichoriginal classification authorities can be readily identified. Such recommendationsshall be submitted to ODUSD(P) for approval.(iv) The listings prescribed in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of thissection shall be reviewed at least annually by the senior official designatedin or pursuant to andSection; 159a.92(a)(1), andSection; 159a.93 (a) or (b)or designee to ensure that officials so listed have demonstrated a continuingneed to exercise original classification authority.(2) The DoD Components that maintain listings of designated original classificationauthorities shall, upon request, submit copies of such listings to ODUSD(P).(d) <T3>Declassification and Downgrading Authority</T3>. (1) Authority to declassifyand downgrade information classified under provisions of this part shallbe exercised as follows:(i) By the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the Military Departments,with respect to all information over which their respective Departmentsexercise final classification jurisdiction;(ii) By the official who authorized the original classification, if thatofficial is still serving in the same position, by a successor, or by asupervisory official of either; and(iii) By other officials designated for the purpose in accordance withparagraph (d)(2) of this section.(2) The Secretary of Defense, the Secretaries of the Military Departments,the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Directors of the DefenseAgencies, or their senior officials designated under andSection; 159a.93(b) or (c) may designate additional officials at the lowest practicableechelons of command and supervision to exercise declassification and downgradingauthority over classified information in their functional areas of interest.Records of officials so designated shall be maintained in the same manneras prescribed in andSection; 159a.12(c)(1)(i) for records of designationsof original classification authority.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart C_Classification</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 159a.14 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Classification responsibilities.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Accountability of Classifiers</T3>. (1) Classifiers are accountablefor the propriety of the classifications they assign, whether by exerciseof original classification authority or by derivative classification.(2) An official who classifies a document or other material and is identifiedthereon as the classifier is and continues to be an accountable classifiereven though the document or material is approved or signed at a higherlevel in the same organization.(b) <T3>Classification Approval</T3>. (1) When an official signs or approvesa document or other material already marked to reflect a particular levelof classification, he or she shall review the information contained thereinto determine if the classification markings are appropriate. If, in hisor her judgment, the classification markings are not supportable, he orshe shall, at that time, cause such markings to be removed or changed asappropriate to reflect accurately the classification of the informationinvolved.(2) A higher level official through or to whom a document or other materialpasses for signature or approval becomes jointly responsible with the accountableclassifier for the classification assigned. Such official has discretionto decide whether a subordinate who has classification authority shallbe identified as the accountable classifier when he or she has exercisedthat authority.(c) <T3>Classification Planning</T3>. (1) Advance classification planning isan essential part of the development of any plan, operation, program, researchand development project, or procurement action that involves classifiedinformation. Classification must be considered from the outset to assureadequate protection for the information and for the activity itself, andto eliminate impediments to the execution or implementation of the plan,operations order, program, project or procurement action.(2) The official charged with developing any plan, program or project inwhich classification is a factor, shall include under an identifiable titleor heading, classification guidance covering the information involved.The guidance shall conform to the requirements contained in andSection; 159a.17.(d) <T3>Challenges to Classification</T3>. If holders of classified informationhave substantial reason to believe that the information is classified improperlyor unnecessarily, they shall communicate that belief to their securitymanager or the classifier of the information to bring about any necessarycorrection.(1) Each DoD Component shall establish procedures whereby holders of classifiedinformation may challenge the decision of the classifier. (2) Challenges to classification made under this subsection shall includesufficient description of the information being challenged to permit identificationof the information and its classifier with reasonable effort. Challengesto classification shall also include the reason or reasons why the challengerbelieves that the information is classified improperly or unnecessarily.(3) Challenges received under this subsection shall be acted upon within30 days of receipt. The challenger shall be notified of any changes madeas a result of the challenge or the reasons why no change is made. (4) Pending final determination of a challenge to classification, the informationor document in question shall be safeguarded as required for the levelof classification initially assigned.(5) The fact that an employee or military member of the Department of Defensehas issued a challenge to classification shall not in any way result inor serve as a basis for adverse personnel action.(6) The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to or affect declassificationreview actions undertaken under the mandatory review requirements of andSection;159a.26 of this part or under the provisions of 32 CFR Part 285.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 159a.15 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Classification principles, criteria, and considerations.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Reasoned Judgment</T3>. Reasoned judgment shall be exercised in makingclassification decisions. A positive basis must exist for classification.Both advantages and disadvantages of classification must be weighed. If,after consideration of the provisions of this section, there is reasonabledoubt, the provisions of andSection; 159a.10(a)(2) apply.(b) <T3>Identification of Specific Information</T3>. Before a classificationdetermination is made, each item of information that may require protectionshall be identified. This requires identification of that specific informationthat comprises the basis for a particular national advantage or advantagesthat, if the information were compromised, would or could be damaged, minimized,or lost, thereby adversely affecting national security.(c) <T3>Specific Classifying Criteria</T3>. A determination to classify shallbe made only by an original classification authority when, <T3>first</T3>, the information is within paragraphs (c) (1) through (10)of this section; and <T3>second</T3>, the unauthorized disclosure of the information, eitherby itself or in the context of other information, reasonably could be expectedto cause damage to the national security. The determination involved inthe first step is separate and distinct from that in the second. Exceptas provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the fact that the informationfalls under one or more of the criteria shall not mean that the information<T3>automatically</T3> meets the damage criteria. Information shall beconsidered for classification if it concerns:<ITAG tagnum="15">(1) Military plans, weapons, or operations;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(2) Vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, projects,or plans relating to the national security;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(3) Foreign government information;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(4) Intelligence activities including special activities, or intelligencesources or methods;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(5) Foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(6) Scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to thenational security;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(7) U.S. Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials orfacilities;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(8) Cryptology;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(9) A confidential source; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(10) Other categories of information that are related to nationalsecurity and that require protection against unauthorized disclosure asdetermined by the Secretary of Defense or Secretaries of the Military Departments.Recommendations concerning the need to designate additional categoriesof information that may be considered for classification shall be forwardedthrough channels to the appropriate Secretary for determination. Each suchdetermination shall be reported promptly to the Director of Security Plansand Programs, ODUSD(P), for promulgation in an Appendix to this part andreporting to the Director, ISOO.</ITAG>(d) <T3>Presumption of Damage</T3>. Unauthorized disclosure of foreign governmentinformation, the identity of a confidential foreign source, or intelligencesources or methods is presumed to cause damage to the national security.(e) <T3>Limitations on Classification</T3>. (1) classification may not be usedto conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error, toprevent embarrassment to a person, organization or agency, or to restraincompetition.(2) Basic scientific research information not clearly related to nationalsecurity may not be classified.(3) A product of nongovernment research and development that does not incorporateor reveal classified information to which the producer or developer wasgiven prior access may not be classified until and unless the governmentacquires a proprietary interest in the product. This prohibition does notaffect the provisions of the Patent Secrecy Act of 1952.(4) References to classified documents that do not reveal classified informationmay not be classified or used as a basis for classification.(5) Classification may not be used to limit dissemination of informationthat is not classifiable under the provisions of E.O. 12356 or this partor to prevent or delay public release of such information.(6) Information may be classified or reclassified after receiving a requestfor it under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, or the mandatoryreview provisions of this part (andSection; 159a.26) if such classificationis consistent with this part and is accomplished personally and on a document-by-documentbasis, except as provided in paragraph (e)(7) of this section, by the Secretaryor Deputy Secretary of Defense, by the Secretaries or Under Secretariesof the Military Departments, by the senior official designated by eachSecretary under andSection; 5.3(a) of E.O. 12356, or by an official withoriginal Top Secret classification authority.(7) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the Military Departmentsmay reclassify information previously declassified and disclosed, and theymay classify unclassified information that has been disclosed, if theydetermine in writing that the information requires protection in the interestof national security and the information may reasonably be recovered. Anysuch reclassification or classification shall be reported to the DUSD(P)for subsequent reporting to the Director, ISOO.(f) <T3>Classifying Scientific Research Data</T3>. Ordinarily, except for informationthat meets the definition of Restricted Data, basic scientific researchor its results shall not be classified. However, classification would beappropriate if the information concerns an unusually significant scientificbreakthrough and there is sound reason to believe that it is not knownor within the state-of-the-art of other nations, and it supplies the UnitedStates with an advantage directly related to national security.(g) <T3>Classifying Documents</T3>. Each document and portion thereof shallbe classified on the basis of the information it contains or reveals. Thefact that a document makes reference to a classified document is not abasis for classification unless the reference citation, standing alone,reveals classified information. The overall classification of a documentor group of physically-connected documents shall be at least as high asthat of the most highly classified component. The subject or title of aclassified document normally should be unclassified. When the informationrevealed by a subject or title warrants classification, an unclassifiedshort title should be added for reference purposes.(h) <T3>Classifying Material Other Than Documents</T3>. (1) Items of equipmentor other physical objects shall be classified only when classified informationmay be derived from them by visual observation of their internal or externalappearance or structure, or by their operation, test, application, or use.The overall classification assigned to end items of equipment or objectsshall be at least as high as the highest classification of any of its integratedparts.(2) If mere knowledge of the existence of the item of equipment or objectwould compromise or nullify its national security advantage, its existencewould warrant classification.(i) <T3>State of the Art and Intelligence</T3>. Classification requires considerationof the information available from intelligence sources concerning the extentto which the same or similar information is known or is available to others.It is also important to consider whether it is known, publicly or internationally,that the United States has the information or even is interested in thesubject matter. The state-of-the-art in other nations may often be a vitalconsideration.(j) <T3>Effect of Open Publication</T3>. Classified information shall not bedeclassified automatically as a result of any unofficial publication orinadvertent or unauthorized disclosure in the United States or abroad ofidentical or similar information. Appearance in the public domain of informationcurrently classified or being considered for classification does not precludeinitial or continued classification. However, such disclosures requireimmediate determination of the degree of damage to the national securityand reevaluation of the information to determine whether the publicationhas so compromised the information that downgrading or declassificationis warranted. Similar consideration must be given to related items of informationin all programs, projects, or items incorporating or pertaining to thecompromised items of information. Holders should continue classificationuntil advised to the contrary by a competent government authority.(k) <T3>Reevaluation of Classification Because of Compromise</T3>. Classifiedinformation, and information related thereto, that has been lost or possiblycompromised, shall be reevaluated and acted upon as follows:(1) The original classifying authority, upon learning that a loss or possiblecompromise of specific classified information has occurred, shall preparea written damage assessment and;(i) Reevaluate the information involved and determine whether (A) Its classificationshould be continued without change; (B) The specific information, or partstherof, should be modified to minimize or nullify the effects of the reportedcompromise and the classification retained; (C) Declassification, downgrading,or upgrading is warranted; and (D) Counter-measures are appropriate andfeasible to negate or minimize the effect of the compromise.(ii) Give prompt notice to all holders of such information when the determinationis within categories (A), (C), or (D) of paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section.(2) Upon learning that a compromise or probable compromise has occurred,any official having original classification jurisdiction over related informationshall reevaluate the related information and determine whether one of thecourses of action enumerated in paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section shouldbe taken or, instead, whether upgrading of the related information is warranted.When such a determination is within categories (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph(k)(1)(i) of this section, that upgrading of the related items is warranted,prompt notice of the determination shall be given to all holders of therelated information.(l) <T3>Compilation of Information</T3>. Certain information that would otherwisebe unclassified may require classification when combined or associatedwith other unclassified information. However, a compilation of unclassifieditems of information should normally not be classified. In unusual circumstances,classification may be required if the combination of unclassified itemsof information provides an added factor that warrants classification underparagraph (c) of this section. Classification on this basis shall be fullysupported by a written explanation that will be provided with the materialso classified. (m) <T3>Extracts of Information</T3>. Information extracted from a classifiedsource shall be derivatively classified or not classified in accordancewith the classification markings shown in the source. The overall and internalmarkings of the source should supply adequate classification guidance.If internal markings or classification guidance are not found in the source,and no reference is made to an applicable and available classificationguide, the extracted information shall be classified according either tothe overall marking of the source, or guidance obtained from the classifierof the source material.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 159a.16 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Duration of original classification. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General</T3>. When a determination is made by an official with authorityto classify originally information as Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential,such official must also determine how long the classification shall remainin effect.(b) <T3>Duration of Classification</T3>. (1) Information shall be classifiedas long as required by national security considerations.(2) When it can be determined, a specific date or event for declassificationshall be set by the original classification authority at the time the informationis classified originally. Such dates or events shall be consistent withnational security. Any event specified for declassification shall be anevent certain to occur. (3) Original classification authorities may not be able to predeterminea date or event for automatic declassification in which case they shallprovide for the indefinite duration of classification.(4) Information classified under predecessor orders and marked for declassificationreview shall remain classified until reviewed for declassification underthe provisions of this part.(c) <T3>Subsequent Extension of Duration of Classification</T3>. The durationof classification specified at the time of original classification maybe extended only by officials with requisite original classification authorityand only if all known holders of the information can be notified of suchaction before the date or event previously set for declassification. Anydecision to continue classification of information designated for automaticdeclassification under E.O. 12065 or predecessor orders, other than ona document-by-document basis, shall be reported to the DUSD(P) who shall,in turn, report to the Director, ISOO.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 159a.17</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Classification guides.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General</T3>. (1) A classification guide shall be issued for each classifiedsystem, program, plan, or project as soon as practicable before the initialfunding or implementation of the system, program, plan or project. Successiveoperating echelons shall prescribe more detailed supplemental guides thatare considered essential to assure accurate and consistent classification.In preparing classification guides, originators shall review DoD 5200.1-H\5\.<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ See footnote 2 to andSection; 159a.3.(2) Classification guides shall:(i) Identify the information elements to be protected, using categorizationto the extent necessary to ensure that the information involved can beidentified readily and uniformly;(ii) State which the classification designations (that is, Top Secret,Secret, or Confidential) applies to each element or category of information;(iii) State declassification instructions for each element or categoryof information in terms of a period of time, the occurrence of an event,or a notation that the information shall not be declassified automaticallywithout approval of the originating agency; and(iv) State any special public release procedures and foreign disclosureconsiderations.(3) Each classification guide shall be approved personally and in writingby an official who:(i) Has program or supervisory responsibility over the information or isthe senior agency official designated by the Secretary of Defense or Secretariesof the Military Departments in accordance with andSection; 5.3(a) of E.O.12356; and(ii) Is authorized to classify information originally at the highest levelof classification prescribed in the guide.(b) <T3>Multiservice Interest</T3>. For each classified system, program, project,plan, or item involving more than one DoD Component, a classification guideshall be issued by: (1) The element in the Office of the Secretary of Defensethat assumes or is expressly designated to exercise overall cognizanceover it; or (2) The DoD Component that is expressly designated to serveas the executive or administrative agent for the particular effort. Whenthere is doubt which Component has cognizance of the information involved,the matter shall be referred to the DUSD(P) for resolution.(c) <T3>Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation</T3>. A program securityclassification guide shall be developed for each system and equipment developmentprogram that involves research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTandamp;E)of classified technical information. For each such program covered by anapproved Decision Coordinating Paper (DCP) or Program Objective Memorandum(POM), initial basic classification guidance applicable to technical characteristicsof the system or equipment shall be developed and submitted with the proposedDCP or POM to the Director, Defense Research and Engineering for approval.A detailed classification guide shall be developed and issued as near intime as possible to the approval of the DCP or POM.(d) <T3>Project Phases.</T3> Whenever possible, classification guides shallcover specifically each phase of transition, that is, RDTandamp;E, procurement,production, service use, and obsolescence, with changes in assigned classificationsto reflect the changing sensitivity of the information involved.(e) <T3>Review of Classification Guides</T3>. (1) Classification guides shallbe reviewed by the originator for currency and accuracy not less than onceevery 2 years. Changes shall be issued promptly. If no changes are made,the originator shall so annotate the record copy and show the date of thereview.(2) Classification guides issued before August 1, 1982, that are in currentuse must be updated to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of thissection. Such updating shall be accomplished by the next biennial review.Converting previous declassification determinations directed by classificationguides shall be accomplished in accordance with the following:(i) Automatic declassification dates or events remain in force unless changedby competent authority in accordance with andSection; 159a.16(c).(ii) Dates for declassification review shall be changed to automatic declassificationdates or provide for the indefinite duration of classification.(f) <T3>Distribution of Classification Guides</T3>. (1) A copy of each approvedclassification guide and changes thereto other than those covering SCIor a Special Access Program and which discloses information that requirespecial access, shall be sent to the Director of Freedom of Informationand Security Review, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (PublicAffairs), and to the Director of Security Plans and Programs, ODUSD(P).A copy of each approved classification guide covering SCI shall be submittedto and maintained by the Senior Intelligence Officer who has security cognizanceover the issuing activity.(2) Two copies of each approved classification guide and its changes shallbe sent by the originator to the Administrator, Defense Technical InformationCenter (DTIC), Defense Logistic Agency, unless such guide is classifiedTop Secret, or covers SCI, or is determined by the approval authority ofthe guide to be too sensitive for automatic secondary distribution to DoDComponents, such as a Special Access Program guide revealing the natureof the Program.

If an entire major componentis unclassified, the first page of the component may be marked at the topand bottom with the designation ``UNCLASSIFIED'' and a statement included,such as, ``All portions of this (annex, appendix, etc.) are UNCLASSIFIED.''When this method of marking is used, no further markings are required onthe unclassified major component.(c) <T3>Portion Marking.</T3> (1) Each section, part, paragraph, or similarportion of a classified document shall be marked to show the level of classificationof the information contained in or revealed by it, or that it is unclassified.Portions of documents shall be marked in a manner that eliminates doubtas to which of its portions contains or reveals classified information.Classification levels of portions of a document, except as provided inparagraph (e) of this section, shall be shown by the appropriate classificationsymbol placed immediately following the portion's letter or number, orin the absence of letters or numbers, immediately before the beginningof the portion. In marking sections, parts, paragraphs, or similar portions,the parenthetical symbols ``(TS)'' for Top Secret, ``(S)'' for Secret,``(C)'' for Confidential, and ``(U)'' for unclassified, shall be used.When appropriate, the symbols ``RD'' for Restricted Data and ``FRD'' forFormerly Restricted Data shall be added, for example, ``(S-RD)'' or ``(C-FRD).''In addition, portions that contain Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information(CNWDI) will be marked ``(N)'' following the classification, for example,``(S-RD)(N).''(2) Portion marking of DoD documents containing foreign government informationshall be in accordance with andSection; 159a.77(d).(3) Illustrations, photographs, figures, graphs, drawings, charts and similarportions of classified documents will be clearly marked to show their classificationor unclassified status. Such markings shall not be abbreviated and shallbe prominent and placed within or contiguous to the portion. Captions ofsuch portions shall be marked on the basis of their content alone by placingthe symbol ``(TS),'' ``(S),'' ``(C),'' or ``(U)'' immediately precedingthe caption.(4) If, in an exceptional situation, parenthetical portion marking is determinedto be impracticable, the document shall contain a statement sufficientto identify the information that is classified and the level of such classification.Thus, for example, each portion of a classified document need not be markedseparately if all portions are classified at the same level, provided astatement to that effect is included in the document. In the case of classifiedcompilations, the explanations required by paragraph (d) of this sectionmeet this requirement.(5) When elements of information in one portion require different classifications,but segregation into separate portions would destroy continuity or context,the highest classification required for any item shall be applied to thatportion or paragraph.(6) Waivers of the foregoing portion marking requirements may be grantedfor good cause. Any request by a DoD Component senior official for a waiverof portion marking requirements shall be submitted to the DUSD(P) and includethe following:(i) Identification of the information or class of documents for which suchwaiver is sought;(ii) Detailed explanation of why the waiver should be granted;(iii) The Component's judgment of the anticipated dissemination of theinformation or class of documents for which the waiver is sought, and(iv) The extent to which such information subject to the waiver may bea basis for derivative classification. Waivers shall be granted only upona written determination by the DUSD(P) as the designee of the Secretaryof Defense, that there will be minimal circulation of the specified documentsor information, and minimal potential usage of these documents or informationas a source for derivative classification determinations; or there is someother basis to conclude that the benefits of portion marking are clearlyoutweighed by the increased administrative burdens. The granting and revocationof portion marking waivers shall be reported to the Director of the ISOOby the DUSD(P).(d) <T3>Compilations</T3>_(1) <T3>Documents.</T3> When classification is required to protect a compilationof unclassified information pursuant to andSection; 159a.15(1), the overallclassification assigned to such documents shall be placed conspicuouslyat the top and bottom of each page and on the outside of the front andback covers, if any, and an explanation of the basis for the assigned classificationshall be included on the document or on its text.(2) <T3>Portions of Documents.</T3> If a classified document contains particularportions that are unclassified when standing alone, but classified informationwill be revealed when they are combined or associated, those portions shallbe marked as unclassified, the page shall be marked with the highest classificationof any information on or revealed by the page, and an explanation shallbe added to the page, or to the document, to explain the classificationof the combination or association to the holder. This method of markingalso may be used if classified portions on a page, or within a document,will reveal information of a higher classification when they are combinedor associated than when they are standing alone.(e) <T3>Subjects and Titles of Documents.</T3> Subjects or titles of classifieddocuments shall be marked with the appropriate symbol, ``(TS),'' ``(S),''``(C),'' or ``(U)'' placed immediately following and to the right of theitem. When applicable, other appropriate symbols, for example, ``(RD)''or ``(FRD),'' shall be added. (Subjects or titles of documents should beunclassified, if possible.)(f) <T3>File, Folder, or Group of Documents.</T3> When a file, folder, or groupof classified documents is removed from secure storage it shall be markedconspicuously with the highest classification of any classified documentincluded therein or shall have an appropriate classified document coversheet affixed.(g) <T3>Transmittal Documents.</T3> A transmittal document, including endorsementsand comments when such endorsements and comments are added to the basiccommunication, shall carry on its face a prominent notation of the highestclassification of the information transmitted by it, and a legend showingthe classification, if any, of the transmittal document, endorsement, orcomment standing alone. For example, an unclassified document that transmitsas an attachment a classified document shall bear a notation substantiallyas follows: ``UNCLASSIFIED WHEN SEPARATED FROM CLASSIFIED ENCLOSURE.''(h) <T3>Electronically Transmitted Messages.</T3> (1) The copy of a classifiedmessage (for example, DD Form 173, Joint Messageform) approved for electronictransmission and maintained as the record copy shall be marked as requiredby andSection; 159a.31(d) for other documents. Additionally, copies not electronicallytransmitted (such as, mail and courier copies) shall be marked as requiredby andSection; 159a.31(d).(2) The first item of information in the text of a classified electronicallytransmitted message shall be its overall classification. Paper copies ofclassified electronically transmitted messages shall be marked at the topand bottom with the assigned classification. Portions shall be marked asprescribed herein for paper copies of documents. When such messages areprinted by an automated system, classification markings may be appliedby that system, provided that page markings so applied are clearly distinguishableon the face of the document from the printed text.(3) The originator of a classified electronically transmitted message shallbe considered the accountable classifier under andSection; 159a.15(a). Thehighest level official identified on the message as the sender or, in theabsence of such identification, the head of the organization originatingthe message, is deemed to be the classifier of the message. Thus, a ``Classifiedby'' line is not required on such messages. The originator is responsiblefor maintaining adequate records as required by andSection; 159a.31(d)(2)to show the source of an assigned derivative classification.(4) The last line of text of a classified electronically transmitted messageshall show the date or event for downgrading, if appropriate, and the dateor event for automatic declassification or ``Originating Agency's DeterminationRequired,'' by abbreviated markings from andSection; 159a.34.

(Use of this Standard Form is required when existing suppliesof similar purpose forms are exhausted or by September 30, 1986, whicheveroccurs earlier).(iv) <T3>Dissemination. </T3>Access to the combination of a vault or containerused for the storage of classified information shall be granted only tothose individuals who are authorized access to the classified informationstored therein.(3) <T3>Electrically Actuated Locks. </T3>Electricially actuated locks (forexample, cypher and magnetic strip card locks) do not afford the requireddegree of protection of classified information and may not be used as asubstitute for the locks prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.(f) <T3>Repair of Damaged Security Containers. </T3>Neutralization of lock-outsor repair of any damage that affects the integrity of a security containerapproved for storage of classified information shall be accomplished onlyby authorized persons who are cleared or continuously escorted while soengaged. (1) A GSA-approved security container is considered to have been restoredto its original state of security integrity if:(i) All damaged or altered parts (for example, locking drawer, and drawerhead) are replaced; or(ii) When a container has been drilled immediately adjacent to or throughthe dial ring to neutralize a lock-out, the replacement lock is equal tothe original equipment, and the drilled hole is repaired with a tapered,hardened tool-steel pin, or a steel dowel, drill bit, or bearing with adiameter slightly larger than the hole and of such length that when driveninto the hole there shall remain at each end of the rod a shallow recessnot less than \1/8\ inch nor more than \3/16\ inch deep to permit the acceptanceof substantial welds, and the rod is welded both on the inside and outsidesurfaces. The outside of the drawer head shall then be puttied, sanded,and repainted in such a way that no visible evidence of the hole or itsrepair remains on the outer surface after replacement of the damaged parts(for example, new lock).(2) GSA-approved containers that have been drilled in a location or repairedin a manner other than as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section,will not be considered to have been restored to their original state ofsecurity integrity. The Test Certification Label on the inside of the lockingdrawer and the ``General Services Administration Approved Security Container''label, if any, on the outside of the top drawer shall be removed from suchcontainers.(3) If damage to a GSA-approved security container is repaired with welds,rivets, or bolts that cannot be removed and replaced without leaving evidenceof entry, the cabinet is limited thereafter to the storage of Secret andConfidential material.(4) If the damage is repaired using methods other than those permittedin paragraphs (f) (1) and (3) of this section, use of the container willbe limited to unclassified material and a notice to this effect will bepermanently marked on the front of the container.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 159a.38</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Custodial precautions.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Responsibilities of Custodians. </T3>(1) Custodians of classified informationshall be responsible for providing protection and accountability for suchinformation at all times and for locking classified information in appropriatesecurity equipment whenever it is not in use or under direct supervisionof authorized persons. Custodians shall follow procedures that ensure thatunauthorized persons do not gain access to classified information.(2) Only the head of a DoD Component, or single designee at the headquartersand major command levels, may authorize removal of classified informationfrom designated working areas in off-duty hours, for work at home or otherwise,provided that a GSA-approved security container is furnished and appropriateregulations otherwise provide for the maximum protection possible underthe circumstances. (See also andSection; 159a.55.) Any such arrangementsapproved before the effective date of this part shall be reevaluated and,if continued approval is warranted, compliance with this paragraph is necessary.(b) <T3>Care During Working Hours. </T3>DoD personnel shall take precautionto prevent unauthorized access to classified information.(1) Classified documents removed from storage shall be kept under constantsurveillance and face down or covered when not in use. Cover sheets shallbe Standard Forms 703, 704, and 705 for, respectively, Top Secret, Secret,and Confidential documents. (Use of these Standard Forms is required whenexisting supplies of similar purpose forms are exhausted or by September30, 1986, whichever occurs earlier).(2) Preliminary drafts, carbon sheets, plates, stencils, stenographic notes,worksheets, typewriter ribbons, and other items containing classified informationshall be either destroyed immediately after they have served their purpose;or shall be given the same classification and secure handling as the classifiedinformation they contain.(3) Destruction of typewriter ribbons from which classified informationcan be obtained shall be accomplished in the manner prescribed for classifiedworking papers of the same classification. After the upper and lower sectionshave been cycled through and overprinted five times in all ribbon or typingpositions, fabric ribbons may be treated as unclassified regardless oftheir classified use thereafter. Carbon and plastic typewriter ribbonsand carbon paper that have been used in the production of classified informationshall be destroyed in the manner prescribed for working papers of the sameclassification after initial usage. However, any ribbon in a typewriterthat uses technology which enables the ribbon to be struck several timesin the same area before it moves to the next position may be treated asunclassified.(c) <T3>End-of-Day Security Checks. </T3>Heads of activities that process orstore classified information shall establish a system of security checksat the close of each working day to ensure that the area is secure; StandardForm 701, ``Activity Security Checklist'' shall be used to record suchchecks. An integral part of the security check system shall be the securingof all vaults, secure rooms, and containers used for the storage of classifiedmaterial; Standard Form 702, ``Security Container Check Sheet'' shall beused to record such actions. In addition, Standard Forms 701 and 702 shallbe annotated to reflect after-hours, weekend, and holiday activity. (Useof these Standard Forms is required when existing supplies of similar purposeforms are exhausted or by September 30, 1986, whichever occurs earlier).(d) <T3>Emergency Planning. </T3>(1) Plans shall be developed for the protection,removal, or destruction of classified material in case of fire, naturaldisaster, civil disturbance, terrorist activities, or enemy action. Suchplans shall establish detailed procedures and responsibilities for theprotection of classified material to ensure that the material does notcome into the possession of unauthorized persons. These plans shall includethe treatment of classified information located in foreign countries.(2) These emergency planning procedures do not apply to material relatedto COMSEC. Planning for the emergency protection including emergency destructionunder no-notice conditions of classified COMSEC material shall be developedin accordance with the requirements of NSA KAG I-D. (3) Emergency plans shall provide for the protection of classified materialin a manner that will minimize the risk of injury or loss of life to personnel.In the case of fire or natural disaster, the immediate placement of authorizedpersonnel around the affected area, preinstructed and trained to preventthe removal of classified material by unauthorized personnel, is an acceptablemeans of protecting classified material and reducing casualty risk. Suchplans shall provide for emergency destruction to preclude capture of classifiedmaterial when determined to be required. This determination shall be basedon an overall commonsense evaluation of the following factors: (i) Level and sensitivity of classified material held by the activity;(ii) Proximity of land-based commands to hostile or potentially hostileforces or to communist-controlled countries; (iii) Flight schedules or ship deployments in the proximity of hostileor potentially hostile forces or near communist-controlled countries; (iv) Size and armament of land-based commands and ships; (v) Sensitivity of operational assignment; and (vi) Potential for aggressive action of hostile forces. (4) When preparing emergency destruction plans, consideration shall begiven to the following: (i) Reduction of the amount of classified material held by a command asthe initial step toward planning for emergency destruction; (ii) Storage of less frequently used classified material at more securecommands in the same geographical area (if available); (iii) Transfer of as much retained classified material to microforms aspossible, thereby reducing the bulk that needs to be evacuated or destroyed;(iv) Emphasis on the priorities for destruction, designation of personnelresponsible for destruction, and the designation of places and methodsof destruction. Additionally, if any destruction site or any particularpiece of destruction equipment is to be used by more than one activityor entity, the order or priority for use of the site or equipment mustbe clearly delineated; (v) Identification of the individual who is authorized to make the finaldetermination when emergency destruction is to begin and the means by whichthis determination is to be communicated to all subordinate elements maintainingclassified information; (vi) Authorization for the senior individual present in an assigned spacecontaining classified material to deviate from established plans when circumstanceswarrant; and (vii) Emphasis on the importance of beginning destruction sufficientlyearly to preclude loss of material. The effect of premature destructionis considered inconsequential when measured against the possibility ofcompromise. (5) The emergency plan shall require that classified material holdingsbe assigned a priority for emergency evacuation or destruction. Prioritiesshould be based upon the potential effect on national security should suchholdings fall into hostile hands, in accordance with the following generalguidelines: (i) <T3>Priority One. </T3>Exceptionally grave damage (Top Secret material);(ii) <T3>Priority Two. </T3>Serious damage (Secret material); and (iii) <T3>Priority Three. </T3>Damage (Confidential material). (6) If, as determined by appropriate threat analysis, Priority One materialcannot otherwise be afforded a reasonable degree of protection from hostileelements in a no-notice emergency situation, provisions shall be made forinstallation of Anticompromise Emergency Destruct (ACED) equipment to ensuretimely initiation and positive destruction of such material a <NOTE/>in accordance with the following standard: ``With due regardfor personnel and structural safety, the ACED system shall reach a stagein destruction sequences at which positive destruction is irreversiblewithin 60 minutes at shore installations, 30 minutes in ships, and 3 minutesin aircraft following activation of the ACED system.'' b <NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>a Technological limitations, particularly as to personneland structural safety, place constraints on the amount of material thatcan be accommodated in buildings, ships, and aircraft by current ACED systems;therefore, only Priority One material reasonably can be so protected atthis time. Nevertheless, after processing Priority One material in an emergencysituation involving possible loss to hostile forces, it is imperative thatPriority Two material and then Priority Three material be destroyed insofaras is possible by whatever means available. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>b The time frames indicated above are those for the initiationof irreversible destruction, not necessarily for the completion of suchdestruction. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>c SM 701-76 is available on a strict need-to-know basis fromthe Chief, Documents Division, Joint Secretariat, OJCS. (7) An ACED requirement is presumed to exist and provisions shall be madefor an ACED system to protect Priority One material in the following environments:(i) Shore-based activities located in or within 50 miles of potentiallyhostile countries, or located within or adjacent to countries with unstablegovernments; (ii) Reconnaissance aircraft, both manned and unmanned, that operate withinJCS-designated reconnaissance reporting areas (see Memorandum by the Secretary,Joint Chiefs of Staff (SM) 701-76, Volume II, ``Peacetime Reconnaissanceand Certain Sensitive Operations''; c(iii) Naval surface noncombatant vessels operating in hostile areas whennot accompanied by a combatant vessel; (iv) Naval subsurface vessels operating in hostile areas; and (v) U.S. Navy Special Project ships (Military Sealift Command-operated)operating in hostile areas. (8) Except in the most extraordinary circumstances, ACED is not applicableto commands and activities located within the United States. Should therebe reason to believe that an ACED requirement exists in environments otherthan in those listed in paragraph (d)(7) of this section, a threat andvulnerability study should be prepared and submitted to the head of theDoD Component concerned or his designee for approval. The threat and vulnerabilitystudy should include, at a minimum, the following data, classified if appropriate:(i) Volume and type of Priority One material held by the activity, thatis, paper products, microforms, magnetic tape, and circuit boards. (ii) A statement certifying that the amount of Priority One material heldby the activity has been reduced to the lowest possible level; (iii) An estimate of the time, beyond the time frames cited above, requiredto initiate irreversible destruction of Priority One material held by theactivity, and the methods by which destruction of that material would beattempted in the absence of an ACED system; (iv) Size and composition of the activity; (v) Location of the activity and the degree of control it, or other UnitedStates authority, exercises over security; and (vi) Proximity to potentially hostile forces and potential for aggressiveaction by such forces. (9) When a requirement is believed to exist for ACED equipment not in theGSA or DoD inventories, the potential requirement shall be submitted tothe DUSD(P) for validation in accordance with subsection V. B. of DoD Directive3224.3 \19\<NOTE/>d.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ See footnote 1 to andSection; 159a.3. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>d Information on ACED systems may be obtained from the Officeof the Chief of Naval Operations (OP-09N), Navy Department, Washington,DC 20350. (10) In determining the method of destruction of other than Priority Onematerial, any method specified for routine destruction or any other meansthat will ensure positive destruction of the material may be used. Ideally,any destruction method should provide for early attainment of a point atwhich the destruction process is irreversible. Additionally, classifiedmaterial may be jettisoned at sea to prevent its easy capture. It shouldbe recognized that such disposal may not prevent recovery of the material.Where none of the methods previously mentioned can be employed, the useof other means, such as dousing the classified material with a flammableliquid and igniting it, or putting to use the facility garbage grinders,sewage treatment plants, and boilers should be considered.(11) Under emergency destruction conditions, destruction equipment maybe operated at maximum capacity and without regard to pollution, preventivemaintenance, and other constraints that might otherwise be observed.(12) Commands and activities that are required to maintain an ACED systempursuant to paragraph (d)(7) of this section, shall conduct drills periodicallyto ensure that responsible personnel are familiar with the emergency plan.Such drills should be used to evaluate the anticipated effectiveness ofthe plan and the prescribed equipment and should be the basis for improvementsin planning and equipment use. Actual destruction should not be initiatedduring drills.(e) <T3>Telecommunications Conversations. </T3>Classified information shallnot be discussed in telephone conversations except as authorized over approvedsecure communications circuits, that is, cryptographically protected circuitsor protected distribution systems installed in accordance with NationalCOMSEC Instruction 4009.(f) <T3>Security of Meetings and Conferences. </T3>Security requirements andprocedures governing disclosure of classified information at conferences,symposia, conventions, and similar meetings, and those governing the sponsorshipand attendance of U.S. and foreign personnel at such meetings, are setforth in DoD Directive 5200.12\20\,<NOTE/> DoD Instruction 5230.20\21\,<NOTE/> DoD 5220.22-R, and DoD 5220.22-M.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ See footnote 1 to andSection; 159a.3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ See footnote 1 to andSection; 159a.3.(g) <T3>Safeguarding of U.S. Classified Information Located in Foreign Countries.</T3>Except for classified information that has been authorized for releaseto a foreign government or international organization pursuant to DoD Directive5230.11\22\,<NOTE/> and is under the security control of such government or organization,the retention of U.S. classified material in foreign countries may be authorizedonly when that material is necessary to satisfy specific U.S. Governmentrequirements. This includes classified material temporarily transferredinto a foreign country via U.S. Government personnel authorized to escortor handcarry such material pursuant to andSection; 159a.59, as applicable.Whether permanently or temporarily retained, the classified materials shallbe stored under U.S. Government control as follows:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ See footnote 1 to andSection; 159a.3.(1) At a U.S. military installation, or a location where the United Statesenjoys extraterritorial status, such as an embassy or consulate.(2) At a U.S. Government activity located in a building used exclusivelyby U.S. Government tenants, provided the building is under 24-hour controlby U.S. Government personnel.(3) At a U.S. Government activity located in a building not used exclusivelyby U.S. Government tenants nor under host government control, providedthe classified material is stored in security containers approved by theGSA and is placed under 24-hour control by U.S. Government personnel.(4) At a U.S. Government activity located in a building not used exclusivelyby U.S. Government tenants but which is under host government control,provided the classified material is stored in GSA-approved security containerswhich are further secured in a locked room or area to which only U.S. personnelhave access.(5) When host government and U.S. personnel are co-located, U.S. classifiedmaterial that has not been authorized for release to the host governmentpursuant to DoD Directive 5230.11, shall, to the extent possible, be segregatedfrom releasable classified material to facilitate physical control andprevent inadvertent compromise. However, U.S. classified material thatis releasable to the host country need not be subject to the 24-hour U.S.control requirement provided the host government exercises its own controlmeasures over the pertinent areas or containers during non-duty hours.(6) Foreign nationals shall be escorted while in areas where nonreleasableU.S. classified material is handled or stored. However, when required byoperational necessity, foreign nationals may be permitted, during dutyhours, unescorted entry to such areas provided the nonreleasable informationis properly stored or is under the direct personal supervision and controlof cleared U.S. personnel who can prevent unauthorized access.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 159a.39</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Activity entry and exit inspection program.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Policy. </T3>(1) Commanders and heads of activities shall establishand maintain an inspection program to deter and detect unauthorized introductionor removal of classified material from DoD owned or leased installationsand facilities. This program does not replace existing programs for facilityand installation security and law enforcement inspection requirements.(2) The inspection program shall be implemented in a manner which doesnot interfere unduly with the performance of assigned missions.(3) The inspection program shall be implemented in a manner which doesnot significantly disrupt the ingress and egress of persons who are employeesof, or visitors to, defense installations and facilities.(4) Inspections carried out under this program shall be limited to theextent feasible to areas where classified work is being performed, andcover only persons employed within, or visiting, such areas.(5) Inspections carried out under this program shall be performed at asufficient frequency to provide a credible deterrent to those who wouldbe inclined to remove classified materials without authority from the installationor facility in question.(6) The method and frequency of such inspections at a given installationor facility is at the discretion of the commander or head of the installationor facility, or other designated official. Such inspections shall conformto the procedures set forth in the following:(i) <T3>Inspection Frequency. </T3>(A) Inspections may be aperiodic, that is,at irregular intervals.(B) Inspections may be accomplished at one or more designated entry/exitpoints; they need not be carried out at all entry/exit points at the sametime.(C) Inspections may be done on a random basis using any standard whichmay be appropriate, for example, every third person; every tenth person;every hundredth person, at the entry/exit point(s) designated.(D) Inspections at a particular entry/exit point(s) may be limited as appropriateto various periods of time, for example, one week, one day, or one hour.(E) Inspections shall be conducted at all entry/exit points after normalduty hours, including weekends and holidays, on a continuous basis, ifpracticable.(b) <T3>Inspection Procedures and Identification. </T3>(1) Inspections shallbe limited to that which is necessary to determine whether classified materialis contained in briefcases, shoulder or handbags, luggage, athletic bags,packages, or other similar containers being removed from or taken intothe premises. Inspections shall not be done of wallets, change purses,clothing, cosmetic cases, or other objects of an unusually personal nature.(2) DoD Components shall provide employees who have a legitimate need toremove classified material from the installation or activity with writtenor printed authorizations to pass through designated entry/exit points.(See andSection; 159a.59(f)) This may include:(i) The authorization statements prescribed in andSection; 159a.59.(ii) If authorized in Component instructions, wallet-size cards which describein general terms the purpose(s) for authorizing the employee to removeclassified material from the facility (for example, use at meetings ortransmission to authorized recipients).(3) Inspectors are to ensure that personnel are not removing classifiedmaterial without authorization. Where inspectors determine that individualsdo not appear to have appropriate authorization to remove classified material,they shall request such individual to obtain appropriate authorizationbefore exiting the premises. If, due to the circumstances, this is notfeasible, the inspector should attempt to verify by telephone the authorityof the individual in question to remove the classified material with theemploying office. When such verification cannot be obtained, and if removalcannot be prevented, the inspector shall advise the employing office andappropriate security office as soon as feasible that classified materialwas removed by the named individual at a particular time and without apparentauthorization.(4) If the employing office determines that classified material was removedby one of its employees without authority, it shall request an investigationof the circumstances of the removal by appropriate investigative authorities.Where such investigation confirms a violation of security procedures, otherthan espionage or deliberate compromise, for which andSection; 159a.50 applies,appropriate administrative, disciplinary, or legal action shall be taken.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart G_Compromise of Classified Information</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 159a.41</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy.</ITAG>Compromise of classified information presents a threat to the nationalsecurity.

Procedures shallbe established by the head of each DoD Component to prevent unnecessaryaccess to classified information. There shall be a demonstrable need foraccess to classified information before a request for a personnel securityclearance can be initiated. The number of people cleared and granted accessto classified information shall be maintained at the minimum number thatis consistent with operational requirements and needs. No one has a rightto have access to classified information solely by virtue of rank or position.The final responsibility for determining whether an individual's officialduties require possession of or access to any element or item of classifiedinformation, and whether the individual has been granted the appropriatesecurity clearance by proper authority, rests upon the individual who hasauthorized possession, knowledge, or control of the information and notupon the prospective recipient. These principles are equally applicableif the prospective recipient is a DoD Component, including commands andactivities, other Federal agencies, DoD contractors, foreign governments,and others.(2) Because of the extreme importance to the national security of Top Secretinformation and information controlled within approved Special Access Programs,employees shall not be permitted to work alone in areas where such informationis in use or stored and accessible by those employees. This general policyis an extra safeguarding measure for the nation's most vital classifiedinformation and it is not intended to cast doubt on the integrity of DoDemployees.

To assurecompliance, each contract, agreement, or other arrangement that involvesthe release of classified material to foreign entities shall either containtransmission instructions or require that a separate transportation planbe approved by the appropriate DoD security and transportation officialsprior to release of the material. (See DoD TS-5105.21-M-3 \31\<NOTE/> for guidance regarding SCI.)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ See footnote 13 to andSection; 159a.33(j)(1) Classified material to be released directly to a foreign governmentrepresentative shall be delivered or transmitted only to a person who hasbeen designated in writing by the recipient government as its officer,agent, or employee (hereafter referred to as the designated representative).Foreign governments may designate a freight forwarder as their agent. Thiswritten designation shall contain assurances that such person has a securityclearance at the appropriate level and that the person will assume fullsecurity responsibility for the material on behalf of the foreign government.The recipient will be required to execute a receipt for the material, regardlessof the level of classification.(2) Classified material that is suitable for transfer by courier or postalservice, and which cannot be transferred directly to a foreign government'sdesignated representative as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section,shall be transmitted by one of the methods specified in paragraph (b),(c), or (d) of this section, for the designated classification level to:(i) An embassy, consulate, or other official agency of the recipient governmenthaving extraterritorial status in the United States, or to(ii) A U.S. Embassy or a U.S. military organization in the recipient countryor in a third-party country, if applicable, for delivery to a designatedrepresentative of the intended recipient government. In either case, theassurance in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and a receipt, must be obtained.(3) The shipment of classified material as freight via truck, rail, aircraft,or ship shall be in compliance with the following:(i) <T3>Shipment Resulting from Foreign Military Sales (FMS). </T3>DoD officialsauthorized to approve a FMS transaction that involves the delivery of U.S.classified material to a foreign purchaser shall, at the outset of negotiationor consideration of proposal, consult with DoD transportation authorities(Military Traffic Management Command, Military Sealift Command, MilitaryAirlift Command, or other, as appropriate) to determine whether secureshipment from the CONUS point of origin to the ultimate foreign destinationis feasible. Normally, the United States will use the Defense TransportationSystem (DTS) to deliver classified material to the recipient government.If, in the course of FMS case processing, the foreign purchaser proposesto take delivery and custody of the classified material in the United Statesand use it own facilities and transportation for onward shipment to itsterritory, the foreign purchaser or its designated representative shallbe required to submit a transportation plan for DoD review and approval.This plan, as a minimum, shall specify the storage facilities, deliveryand transfer points, carriers, couriers or escorts, and methods of handlingto be used from the CONUS point of origin to the final destination andreturn shipment when applicable. (See Appendix E to this part) Securityofficials of the DoD Component that initiates the FMS transaction shallevaluate the transportation plan to determine whether the plan adequatelyensures protection of the highest level of classified material involved.Unless the DoD Component initiating the FMS transaction approves the transportationplan as submitted, or it is modified to meet U.S. security standards, shipmentby other than DTS shall not be permitted. Transmission instructions orthe requirement for an approved transportation plan shall be incorporatedinto the security requirements of the United States Department of DefenseOffer and Acceptance (DD Form 1513).(ii) <T3>Shipments Resulting from Direct Commercial Sales. </T3>Classified shipmentsresulting from direct commercial sales must comply with the same securitystandards that apply to FMS shipments. Defense contractors, therefore,will consult, as appropriate, with the purchasing government, the DIS RegionalSecurity Office, and the owning Military Department prior to consummationof a commercial contract that will result in the shipment of classifiedmaterial to obtain approval of the transportation plan.(iii) <T3>Delivery within the United States, Its Territories, or Possessions.</T3>Delivery of classified material to a foreign government at a pointwithin the United States, its territories, or its possessions, shall bemade only to a person identified in writing by the recipient governmentas its designated representative as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of thissection. The only authorized delivery points are:(A) An embassy, consulate, or other official agency under the control ofthe recipient government.(B) Point of origin. When a designated representative of the recipientgovernment accepts delivery of classified U.S. material at the point oforigin (for example, a manufacturing facility or depot), the DoD officialwho transfers custody shall obtain a receipt for the classified materialand assure that the recipient is cognizant or secure means of onward movementof the classified material to its final destination, consistent with theapproved transportation plan.(C) Military or commercial ports of embarkation (POE) that are recognizedpoints of departure from the United States, its territories, or possessions,for onloading aboard a ship, aircraft, or other carrier authorized underparagraph (e)(3)(v) of this section.

Classification and Downgrading Instructions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. During the development of a plan, or the planning of an operationby the headquarters of the using Component, the code word and its meaningshall have the same classification. When dissemination of the plan to otherDoD Components or to subordinate echelons of the using Component is required,the using Component may downgrade the code words assigned below the classificationassigned to their meanings in order to facilitate additional planning implementation,and execution by such other Components or echelons, but code words shall,at a minimum, be classified Confidential.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. A code word which is replaced by another code word due to a compromiseor suspected compromise, or for any other reason, shall be canceled, andclassified Confidential for a period of 2 years, after which the code wordwill become unclassified.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. When a plan or operation is discontinued or completed, and is notreplaced by a similar plan or operation but the meaning cannot be declassified,the code word assigned thereto shall be canceled and classified Confidentialfor a period of 2 years, or until the meaning is declassified, whicheveris sooner, after which the code word will become unclassified.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. In every case, whenever a code word is referred to in documents,the security classification of the code word shall be placed in parenthesesimmediately following the code word, for example, ``Label (C).''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. When the meaning of a code word no longer requires a classification,the using Component shall declassify the meaning and the code word andreturn the code word to the available inventory.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">6. Security Practices</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The meaning of a code word may be used in a message or other document,together with the code word, only when it is essential to do so. Activecode words may be used in correspondence or other documents forwarded toaddresses who may or may not have knowledge of the meaning. If the contextof a document contains detailed instructions or similar information whichindicates the purpose or nature of the related meaning, the active codeword shall not be used.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. In handling correspondence pertaining to active code words, careshall be used to avoid bringing the code words and their meanings together.They should be handled in separate card files, catalogs, indexes, or lists,enveloped separately, and dispatched at different times so they do nottravel through mail or courier channels together.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Code words shall not be used for addresses, return addresses, shippingdesignators, file indicators, call signs, identification signals, or forother similar purposes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">7. Former Words</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">All code words formerly categorized as ``inactive'' or ``obsolete''shall be placed in the current canceled category and classified Confidential.Unless otherwise restricted, all code words formerly categorized as ``canceled''or ``available'' shall be individually declassified. All records associatedwith such code words may be disposed of in accordance with current practices,provided such records have been retained at least 2 years after the codewords were placed in the former categories of ``inactive,'' ``obsolete,''or ``canceled.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">8. Non-DoD Words</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Nicknames or code words originating outside of the Department of Defensethat are jointly used by the originating organization and the Departmentof Defense shall be registered with the DUSD(P) to prevent confusion withDoD-originated words.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="75">Appendix D_Federal Aviation Administration Air Transportation, SecurityField Offices (See </ITAG>andSection;<T4> 159a.59(c)(1)(i))</T4><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>City </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"/><T3>State </T3><ITAG tagnum="23">Anchorage </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Alaska </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Atlanta </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Georgia </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Baltimore </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Maryland </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Boston </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Massachusetts </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Chicago (O'Hare) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Illinois </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Cleveland </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Ohio </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Dallas </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Texas </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Denver </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Colorado </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Detroit </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Michigan </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Honolulu </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Hawaii </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Houston </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Texas </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Kansas City </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Missouri </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Las Vegas </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Nevada </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Los Angeles </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">California </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Miami </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Florida </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Minneapolis </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Minnesota </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Newark </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">New Jersey </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">New Orleans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Louisiana </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">New York (John F.
