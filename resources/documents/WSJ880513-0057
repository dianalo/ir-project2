Egyptian inscriptions in the third millennium B.C. praised rulers who weren't influenced by gifts. Hammurabi (1711-1669 B.C.), according to one version of his famous code, imposed penalties on judges who changed their rulings after accepting bribes.    Yet official corruption has nearly always flourished. And, despite some well-publicized enforcement cases in recent years, it continues to thrive. Here's a sampling of some government officials whom money has been able to buy.    KAKUEI TANAKA   Prime Minister of Japan, 1972-74   Price: $2 million   HE TOOK THE MONEY from Lockheed Corp. to persuade All Nippon Airways to buy Lockheed Tristar jets. In 1983, he was convicted on bribery charges for doing it.    ALBERT B. FALL   U.S. Interior Secretary   Price: $100,000+   IN 1922, HARRY F. SINCLAIR's Mammoth Oil Co. paid him for exclusive drilling rights on the government's huge Teapot Dome, Wyo., oil reserve. Adjusted for inflation, the bribe would be worth about $600,000 in 1988.    GEOFFREY G. LINDENAUER   New York City Official   Price: $410,000   THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR of the city's Parking Violations Bureau pleaded guilty in 1986 to racketeering and mail fraud charges for taking bribes and kickbacks from various computer contractors.    FRANK COCCIA   Defense Department Official   Price: $330,000+ -   THE CLOTHING AND textile procurement officer pleaded guilty this year to bribery and other criminal charges for taking money from seekers of government contracts.    ELTON GISSENDANNER   State Official   Price: $80,000+   THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR or the Florida Department of Natural Resources, pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in 1987. His plea came during the course of a trial in which the government charged that he had accepted more than $80,000 in bribes from a drug smuggler.    JAMES TANSEY   Police Inspector   Price: $38,000   THIS NEW YORK STATE police inspector obtained false Vermont birth certificates and baptismal certificates from a nonexistent church to establish identities for legitimate undercover work. But he also sold such certificates to illegal Irish immigrants. He pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to defraud the U.S., among other charges. According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven A. Standiford in New York, Mr. Tansey received a total of at least $38,000 for the documents. Thanks to New York law, Mr. Tansey still receives his full pension.    ALEXANDER EXUM   Lottery Official   Price: $5,500 and the use of a Honda   THE MARKETING EXECUTIVE for the District of Columbia lottery board, pleaded guilty in 1986 to accepting the bribe from a contractor.    JAMES MONROE   U.S. Secretary of State   Price: $5,000, loan   IN 1813, THE FUTURE president accepted the loan (equal to his yearly salary) from John Jacob Astor, whose American Fur Co. needed federal assistance in expanding its trade in U.S. territories. According to federal Judge John T. Noonan Jr. of San Francisco, a legal scholar, Mr. Monroe didn't repay the loan until 1828, four years after he left the presidency.    ---   Ms. Hagedorn covers the retail industry from The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
