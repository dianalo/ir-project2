(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rain, floods and a tornado heaped moremisery on Hugo-wrecked South Carolina on Monday, interruptingrebuilding efforts from the storm that pummeled the coast 12 daysago.   Relief officials deluged with clothing urged donors to sendbuilding supplies, food and cash.   ``I feel sorry for the people. It's terrible. It adds insult toinjury,'' National Weather Service meterologist Dick Shenot saidafter 2.5 inches of rain fell in a 24-hour period on Charleston,the town hardest hit by Hugo's 135-mph winds.   A tornado in Lebanon, about 25 miles north of here, left twoinjured. About 100 people in Anderson County, 200 miles north, hadto be evacuated due to flooding.   The Broad and Blair rivers in Gaffney, the Congaree River in St.Matthews, the Waccamaw River in Conway and the Saluda River inChappells all spilled over their banks Monday.   The Tiger River rose 12 feet above flood stage, damaging a majortelephone cable and knocking out long-distance service fromSpartanburg to Asheville, N.C., said Ron Laughlin, spokesman forATandamp;T. He had no estimate of the number of people affected, but saidservice was expected to be restored by nightfall.   In neighboring North Carolina, also deluged by rain Monday andalso still recovering from the wrath of Hugo, Monroe rescuers werelooking for three people missing when a creek flooded and sweptaway their car. A fourth passenger was rescued after clinging to adowned tree for more than an hour.   Aid from across the nation continued to pour into South Carolinafor victims of the hurricane. The response has been sooverwhelming, though, that some officials don't know what to dowith everything.   ``We have clothing backed up on us, including in boxcars thathave come from the West Coast,'' Maj. Ken Bush of the SalvationArmy said. ``People, generally speaking, only want a number ofclothes ... and we've reached that certain amount. We'rebacklogged.''   In the fishing village of McClellanville, population 500, about10 classrooms in the local school are filled ``from floor toceiling with used clothing.''   ``Used clothing has almost choked us to death,'' Billy Newsom ofthe American Red Cross said.   Bush and Newsom said donations of non-perishable food items arestill desperately needed. As cleanup efforts progress, hardwareitems will be in demand to help repair homes and businesses, Bushsaid.   Sixty trucks carrying canned food, clothing and other reliefmaterial reached Charleston on Monday, said Charleston Mayor JosephRiley, praising the cities across the country which have sent aid.   ``There has never been in our country's history this degree ofcommunity sharing,'' Riley said. ``You can bet your bottom dollarthat the next city that has a disaster, Charleston will berepresented'' in giving aid.   A cash and food drive held at 10 college football games in sixSoutheastern states over the weekend generated about $60,000 andsix tractor-trailer loads of canned goods, said organizer U.S. Sen.Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.   His colleague, Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., took to the Senatefloor Monday and continued his criticism of the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency, the agency coordinating the federal government'sresponse to the disaster.   ``FEMA does not have but 10 centers in South Carolina 10 daysafter the disaster,'' he said. ``And, as far as I know, they stillhaven't given out a financial grant yet.''   Marilyn Quayle, the vice president's wife, visited thehardest-hit areas of South Carolina and worked briefly at a FEMAcenter in Moncks Corner on Monday. ``I don't think news accountscan adequately describe the damage that is in this state. It'sreally incredible,'' Mrs. Quayle said. ``It was very beneficial forme to see and really understand what the state is going through. Wewill be taking back information to the vice president andpresident.''   ``It was wonderful. I wasn't expecting it,'' said AnnabellFrazier, who was interviewed by Mrs. Quayle for federal aid. Theroof of Ms. Frazier's home blew off and water poured into the houseduring the hurricane.   Hurricane Hugo slammed into South Carolina Sept. 21 with 135 mphwinds, leaving at least 18 dead, 50,000 homeless, 270,000 jobless,and homes, businesses, schools and municipal buildings damaged ordestroyed as far inland as Sumter and north to North Carolina. Inall, 29 people were killed on the U.S. mainland.   Damage has been estimated at $3 billion or more, with cropdamage placed at some $100 million.   Insurance agents have fanned out across the state since the dayafter the hurricane hit. State Farm Insurance Co., the largest homeand automobile insurer in the state, expects to handle 130,000claims worth $500 million, said company President Edward Rust Jr.   ``It would be the largest single disaster we've everencountered,'' he said.   There were signs the city was returning to normal. Classesresumed Monday at the College of Charleston, the Medical Universityof South Carolina and Baptist College. Cadets at The Citadel wereasked to return Wednesday.   An 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew was scaled back to 9 p.m. until 5a.m., enforced by National Guardsmen toting M-16 rifles.   The Ben Sawyer Bridge, which links the barrier islands of Isleof Palms and Sullivans Island to neighboring Mount Pleasant, wasexpected to be back in place by Wednesday. The span of the swingbridge was knocked into the Intracoastal Waterway during thehurricane, cutting off all access to the islands by vehicle.   In Myrtle Beach, beachfront property owners were told they couldbegin applying for permits to repair seawalls, homes and businessesthat were less than two-thirds damaged by the hurricane.   The Beachfront Management Act, enacted in 1988 to limitdevelopment along the state's 187-mile coast, prohibits rebuildingor repairs on structures that are more than two-thirds damaged.   About 5,900 structures in North Myrtle Beach, Myrtle Beach,Georgetown County and Charleston were damaged or destroyed, saidDonna Gress, spokeswoman for the South Carolina Coastal Council,which enforces the law.   Also Monday, The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that twostate firms will buttress eight miles of beach from North MyrtleBeach to Pawleys Island later this week at a cost of about $820,000.   The sand is meant to block further erosion during expected hightides in mid-October at oceanfront properties already damaged byHurricane Hugo.   The federal government will pay 75 percent of the cost under anarrangement with FEMA. More beaches may be declared eligible forsuch federal money or for state funds, said Tucker Eskew, spokesmanfor Gov. Carroll Campbell.</TEXT></DOC>
