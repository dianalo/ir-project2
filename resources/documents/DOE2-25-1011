Ghilarducci, published in the Industrial relations Journal(vol 17, No. 2, Summer 1986) is discussed and the author subsequentlyresponds to the comments made. The thesis under discussion is that the1981 strike of the US Professional Air Traffic Controller's Organisation(PATCO) inspired the Thatcher government to plan and implement a 'managementstrike' against the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). This thesisis seen to be highly questionable by the commentators, because accordingto them, the Thatcher government strategies and objectives date fromat least the early 1970s. In addition, they claim that Ghilarducci overlookssimilarities between the two unions, when in fact there are a number.Both had a leadership which was relatively new, militant and unmindfulof the need to establish links with the labour movement and both unisonsaw major policy changes as the goal of their strikes. It was on theseobjectives, which were beyond the scope of normal collective bargaining,that the government-employer 'victories' in each case relied. 24 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
