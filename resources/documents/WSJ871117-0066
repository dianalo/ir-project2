The earnings figure included a $2.2 million tax credit. Third-quarter sales increased 33% to $46.2 million from $34.7 million.    The maker of electronic parts and controls said profit from continuing operations totaled $13.2 million, or 17 cents a share, after a $18.2 million gain from the settlement of patent litigation.    But excluding the gain, Oak Industries said it doesn't expect to report a profit from continuing operations for the year.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Oak Industries' shares closed at $1.125, up 12.5 cents.    Oak Industries in July reached a $20.1 million settlement in its patent litigation against M/A-Com Inc., Burlington, Mass., and General Instrument Corp., New York. </TEXT></DOC>
