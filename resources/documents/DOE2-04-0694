Of the 25 patients with various focalhepatic lesions evaluated, 16 were diagnosed as having hemangiomas: eightproven by surgery, two proven by angiography, and six proven by maintaininga stable clinical course ranging from 6 to 12 months with normal follow-upliver function tests. Although fourteen of these were detected by planarimaging, two were detected by SPECT only. Two patients with large hemangiomashad false-negative scans, whereas the remaining seven patients had otherliver lesions.</TEXT></DOC>
