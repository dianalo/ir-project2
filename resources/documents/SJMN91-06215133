It's a soul salvation that's proving to bedoubly auspicious.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  I NEVER KNEW DISCO --THEN CAME KIMBALL'S  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  CLUBS  </MEMO><TEXT>     First off, summer is the unkindest season for jazz clubs. With a plenitudeof wineries and weekend festivals competing for jazz fans' time and money,regular venues have to scramble each year to fill seats. Kimball's decision todrag those old platform glitter-boots out of the closet not only tapped theOakland area's natural market for soul music, it coincided with a Vesuvianeruption of retro-soul being re-issued on compact disc. (To wit, those zealotsdown at Rhino Records in Santa Monica have just released a mind-blowing 15volumes of funky dance music from the Nixon/Ford era.);    There was a time,not too long ago, when one did not admit an affinity for '70s soul in politecompany. Anyone who dared to wax nostalgic on the enduring legacy of the HuesCorporation or Patti LaBelle was thought to be incredibly gauche, culturallystunted or both. The enjoyment of favorite thangs was a private affairshrouded in shame and denial. (&quot;Hi, my name is Marvin, and I'm a funk-aholic.I started with a few eight-track tapes, just a social thang . . .&quot;) But nowthat the funk genie is back out of the bottle, we thought a sold-out Spinners'show would be a good time to, ah, git up, git down and shake that thang.;   The 360-seat club, upstairs in a renovated warehouse in the Emery BayMarketplace, aspires to a standard far higher than that of even the best rock'n' roll clubs. Comparing Jane and Kimball Allen's 2-year-old showcase (theyalso run Kimball's in San Francisco) to a rock club would be as preposterousas comparing a $40 cabernet to a six-pack of Bud. The gracious brick-walledmain room is a tiered, amphitheater-style setup with excellent sightlines,jazz portraits on the walls, miles of polished blond wood and a superb Meyersound system.;    We found the pre-show dinner (done by new chef Tim Quinn) tobe ambitious nouvelle cuisine. Such dishes as swordfish with pistachio pestoand basmati rice would be right at home in Berkeley's rarefied gourmet scene.Service was unparalleled by any club we've been to in recent years. Everyonefrom the doorman to the busboy exuded a certain warmth that made us feel theywere genuinely glad to see us. Why in the name of rock 'n' roll can't otherclubs train their people this way? Is it that jazz people expect a higherlevel of service or that rock people meekly accept a lower one? Go figure.;   The immaculately turned-out Spinners crowd comprised couples from their 20s totheir 60s. Foolishly I had assumed the group had three, maybe four bigdance-floor ditties to their credit. They had 10 solid hits that wereinstantly recognizable -- even to these callow young ears. The quintet was theepitome of Philly-style romantic soul -- as tight and funky as a 15-year-oldpair of polyester bell-bottoms. As a backing band pounded through &quot;Working MyWay Back to You,&quot; the five pop warhorses trotted out in matching blackdouble-breasted suits dripping with pounds of gold braid. It was all there,from the synchronized dancing (which should be an Olympic sport, if and whenthe Olympics are ever held in Detroit) to the gospel-infusedget-down-on-your-knee-and-tell-it-baby vocal delivery.;    As they pacedthrough &quot;Could It Be I'm Falling in Love&quot; and &quot;That's the Way Love Goes,&quot;couples began to scrunch together in the booths. By the time they got to &quot;ThenCame You&quot; and &quot;One of a Kind (Love Affair)&quot; a lot of hands that had first beenheld when these songs were young got held again.;    Walking back to the car,we felt almost wistful. Not for the music of our childhoods but for the factthat tomorrow night we'd be back in the rock 'n' roll demimonde, a worldwithout pastel linens and pistachio pesto.;  Kimball's East; 5800 ShellmoundSt.,; Emeryville; Details: Shows Wednesdays,; Thursdays and Sundays at 8; and10 p.m.; Fridays and; Saturdays at 9 and 11 p.m.; (415) 658-2555  </TEXT><BYLINE>  David Plotnikoff Music Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910802  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  25  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  750  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday August 2, 199100215133,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
