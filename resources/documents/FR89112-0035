Following an inflight fire whichoriginated in a lavatory area, the FAA issued four Airworthiness Directives(AD) to require specific improvements in cabin fire protection. AirworthinessDirective 74-08-09 (39 FR 12998; April 10, 1974), applicable to all transportcategory airplanes, requires 1,000 hour periodic inspections and repairs,as necessary, of all lavatory trash receptacles to ensure fire containmentcapability. It also requires preflight briefings informing passengers notto smoke in lavatories, and the installation of ashtrays near lavatoryentrances and no-smoking signs on each side of the lavatory doors. Subsequentto issuance of the AD, andSection;25.853 of the FAR was amended to incorporatethese requirements for ashtrays and no-smoking signs. Section 121.571 ofthe FAR was adopted to require that passengers be given briefings regardingsmoking. Three additional AD's, 74-21-03 (39 FR 36466; October 10, 1974),75-02-04 and 75-02-05 (39 FR 13555; January 24, 1975), were issued forspecific airplane models, requiring inspection and repair of lavatory electricalcomponents and modification of lavatory trash receptacles to ensure firecontainment. Together, the AD actions were intended to eliminate likelyignition sources, end smoking in lavatories, and provide fire-safe trashreceptacles in the event that fire occurs in a receptacle despite theseprecautions.In addition to these AD actions, an FAA-contracted study was conductedto consider the feasibility of a total cabin integrated fire managementsystem. This study included analysis of fire-related accident and incidentdata taken over a 10-year period, a survey of available technology, andanalysis of fire detection, monitoring and extinguishing options for allareas of a typical wide-body passenger cabin. The results of this studyare contained in DOT Report No. FAA-RD-76-54, Feasibility and Tradeoffsof a Transport Fuselage Fire Management System, dated June 1976, availablefrom the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), Springfield, Virginia22151. While the study did provide useful data concerning fire protection,features of the integrated system, such as fire detectors, were not adoptedat the time because the AD actions were considered to have provided adequatefire protection. Subsequent to the AD actions, there were two cabin fires which indicatedthat additional measures were needed to enhance protection against suchfires. One of the fires occurred in flight near Cincinnati, Ohio, on June2, 1983, and resulted in 23 fatalities. The other occurred on the groundat Tampa International Airport in Florida on June 25, 1983, and resultedin evacuation of the airplane with no injuries or loss of life. Followingthe fires, the FAA conducted an inspection survey of the fire containmentcapabilities of lavatory trash receptacles in the U.S. air carrier fleet.The survey was conducted to determine the effectiveness of previous FAAactions to correct deficiencies in fire protection and to determine whetheror not those corrective actions provide adequate fire safety. The surveyrevealed that the fire containment capabilities of trash receptacles werecompromised by the wear and tear typical of service. Considering the seriousnessof inflight cabin fires, an expanded approach to fire protection was considerednecessary.In regard to extinguishment of inflight cabin fires, andSection;25.851 currentlyspecifies that one conveniently located hand fire extinguisher must beprovided for each airplane with a passenger capacity of 7 through 30; twomust be provided for each airplane with a passenger capacity of 31 through60; and three are required for each airplane with a passenger capacityof 61 or more. These standards were adopted in 1956 when the largest airplanesin service had passenger capacities of less than 100, and those under developmentwere not expected to exceed 200 passengers. Since that time, the size ofcommercial transport airplanes has increased dramatically. For example,certain versions of the Boeing 747 have been certificated under Part 25for a maximum of 660 passengers. Service experience has shown that threeextinguishing are insufficient for large transport airplanes; and, as amatter of practicality, most operators of the large transport airplanescurrently in service have elected to install more than three extinguishersin such airplanes.The FAA has also conducted cabin fire extinguishers tests using varioustypes of hand extinguishers. These tests demonstrated that for a fire ina large airplane cabin, extinguishers containing Halon 1211 (bromochloro-difluoromethane,CBrClF<T2>2</T2>) are safe from the standpoint of toxicity, and far more effectivein range and knockdown capability than other extinguishers currently inservice. The results of these tests are contained in DOT Report No. DOT/FAA/CT-82-111,Inflight Aircraft Seat Fire Extinguishing Tests (Cabin Hazard Measurement),dated December 1982. A copy of this report has been placed in the RulesDocket and is available for inspection. A copy may be purchased from NTIS.Halon 1211 extinguishers have their greatest effectiveness of Class B andC fires; however, those with 9 pounds or greater capacity are also ratedfor Class A fires. (Fire classes are as defined in the National Fire ProtectionAssociation Standard 10.) Halon 1211 extinguishers are not to be used forClass D (burning metal) fires. Although not rated for Class A fires, suchextinguishers with less than 9 pounds capacity have been shown to be effectivein extinguishing surface Class A fires. Halon 1211 extinguishers are especiallyuseful for combatting flammable fluid fires, such as those that might becaused by terrorist activities. Under the air carrier airworthiness surveillanceprogram, the FAA issued a general notice (GENOT), dated November 29, 1980,to inspectors and air carrier operators encouraging the voluntary installationof at least two Halon 1211 extinguishers in each airplane.Subsequent to the above action, the FAA adopted Admendment 121-185 (50FR 12726; March 29, 1985) applicable to airplanes used in air carrier serviceunder the provisions of Part 121 of this Chapter. This amendment requires(1) the installation of a smoke detection system, or equivalent, in eachlavatory after October 29, 1986, (2) a built-in fire extinguisher for eachlavatory disposal receptacle after April 29, 1987, (3) additional handfire extinguishers for airplanes with passenger seating capacities of 30or fewer and 60 or more after October 29, 1985, and (4) at least two ofthe required hand fire extinguishers to contain Halon 1211, or equivalent,as the fire extinguishing agent after April 29, 1986.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>Although Amendment 121-185 provides improved cabin fire protection fortransport category airplanes used in air carrier service, it does not applyto other transport category airplanes, such as those used for executivetransportation. Mandatory retrofit of such other airplanes to incorporatethese improvements is not considered justifiable from an economic standpoint;however, it does appear that such improvements are warranted for futuretransport category airplanes. Accordingly, this notice proposes to amendPart 25 of the FAR to require these improvements for airplanes for whichapplication for type certificate is made after the effective date of theamendment. In addition, Part 21 would also be amended to require theseimprovements for all transport category airplanes manufactured after adate one year after the effective date of the amendment, regardless ofwhen the application for type certificate was made. The compliance timeof one year is necessary for airplanes not already required to comply underthe provisions of Part 121 to provide sufficient time in which to makethe necessary design changes, procure the required materials and parts,and introduce the modifications into production.Section 25.851 would be amended to require additional extinguishers forthe passenger compartments of airplanes with passenger capacities greaterthan 200. (Part 25 currently requires the same number of extinguishersfor passenger capacities of 61 through 200 as is now required by Part 121.)The maximum capacity presently envisioned is 700. Should larger airplanesbe presented for certification in the future, additional standards in theform of special conditions may be warranted. Similarly, additional standardsmay be warranted for airplanes with nonstandard interior arrangements inwhich the minimum number of extinguishers does not provide ready accessto an extinguisher in each area of the cabin.As noted above, Halon 1211 has demonstrated superior performance in combattingcabin fires, particularly surface fires. Some of the required hand fireextinguishers would, therefore, have to contain this agent or equivalent.For an airplane with a passenger capacity that is more than 30, but lessthan 61, at least one of the two required passenger compartment extinguisherswould have to contain Halon 1211, or equivalent. For an airplane with alarger passenger capacity, at least two of the required passenger compartmentextinguishers must contain Halon 1211, or equivalent.Section 25.851 presently requires one hand fire extinguisher convenientlylocated in the pilot compartment. This extinguisher is in addition to anyextinguisher required for a passenger compartment.Section 25.851 currently specifies that a readily accessible hand fireextinguisher must be available for use in each Class A or Class B cargoor baggage compartment. While Class E compartments are not required tobe accessible to crewmembers in flight, the proposed amendment to andSection;25.851 would require a readily accessible hand fire extinguisher for anyClass E compartment that is accessible in flight. In addition, a hand fireextinguisher would be required for each galley located above or below thepassenger compartment because the extinguishers located in the passengercompartment are not readily available at those locations.Due to an apparent editorial error, andSection; 25.851(b) currently impliesthat the requirements of that paragraph do not apply to fire extinguishmentsystems which are installed in addition to those required by the minimumstandards of Part 25. Whether a fire extinguishment system installed inan airplane is required by the regulations or is installed on a voluntarybasis is obviously irrelevant insofar as potential hazards to the occupantsare concerned. Accordingly, andSection; 25.851(b) would be changed to correctthis error. In addition, minor changes are proposed in the format of andSection;25.851 which are clarifying in nature only.This notice proposes a new andSection; 25.854 which would require transportcategory airplanes to be equipped with smoke detectors and with increasedfire extinguishment capabilities for lavatories, which have been shownby experience to be more critical for fire protection than other areasof the cabin.Smoke detector systems would be required in lavatories. While lavatorieshave a lower smoke and fire incidence rate than galleys, they are moresensitive from a fire detection standpoint for several reasons. They aremore often unattended, they are closed from view by a door, and they containventilation systems designed to keep odors, and thus sensory smoke detection,away from the passenger cabin. In addition, galleys are generally occupiedonly by trained flight attendants. Lavatories, on the other hand, are frequentedby the general traveling public, some of whom may not be conscious of thehazards of smoking in the lavatory. As part of the smoke detector systems,a warning light would be required in the cockpit, or a warning light oraudio warning would be required in the passenger cabin which provides aclear and unmistakable signal, readily detectable by a flight attendant,taking into consideration the positioning of flight attendants throughoutthe flight. Because the lavatory smoke detectors would serve to enhancethe present capability of the crewmembers to visually detect fires in thecabin and would not serve as primary detection systems, such as those usedin isolated cargo compartments, it would be unnecessary for the detectorsto meet all of the performance and environmental requirements in TechnicalStandard Order (TSO) No. C1b, which are now applicable to the type of primarydetectors used in isolated cargo compartments. Service experience has shownthat nearly all lavatory fires are detected by cabin personnel early enoughto allow prompt control and extinguishment. Thus, a commercially availablesmoke detector, such as the type commonly used in residential buildings,which is demonstrated to serve its intended function as installed, couldbe considered adequate under the proposals.Lavatory trash receptacles would be equipped with automatic fire extinguishers.These could be small extinguishant-charged bulbs with thermal fuse plugs,as are currently used in trash receptacles in a number of transport airplanes.As proposed, the lavatory smoke detectors and automatic fire extinguisherswould be required in addition to the fire containment capability currentlyrequired for lavatory trash receptacles because, as indicated by the inspectionsurvey referenced earlier, fire containment capability is subject to deteriorationin service, and additional measures of fire protection may be necessary.The automatic fire extinguishers would counter a fire as quickly as possibleat its inception and would be a practicable means of keeping response timeto a minimum, which is a key principle of fire protection in general. Thesmoke detectors would be a necessary complement to the extinguishers toenable crewmembers to quickly detect a fire and determine if additionalactions, such as use of hand extinguishers, are necessary to control thefire and prevent rekindling. The requirement for trash receptacle firecontainment capability would be retained since containment capability,degraded or not, delays the propagation of fire and provides a needed incrementalmeasure of fire protection.As proposed, the cabin fire safety improvements contained in this noticewould apply to transport category airplanes in general, including the smallerairplanes designed specifically for executive transportation. Due to theirrelatively small size, the executive airplanes would not be affected bythe proposals to increase the number of hand fire extinguishers in airplaneswith passenger capacities greater than 200 and to use Halon-filled extinguishersin airplanes with passenger capacities greater than 30. Such airplaneswould, however, have to comply with the proposed lavatory fire protectionrequirements. Many of these airplanes have small lavatories with very limitedoccupant space and small trash receptacles. In addition, the lavatoriesin these airplanes are not frequented by the general public. Comments areespecially requested concerning the need for and the appropriateness ofthe proposed lavatory fire protection requirements for these airplanes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation</ITAG>I. Cost Benefit AnalysisThe FAA proposes to amend Part 25 of the FAR to require improved inflightcabin fire protective measures for transport category airplanes for whichapplication for type certification is made after the effective date ofthe amendment. The proposed amendment would require that (1) each lavatorybe equipped with a smoke detector system, (2) each lavatory trash receptaclebe equipped with an automatic discharge fire extinguisher system, (3) morehand fire extinguishers be provided in the passenger compartment of airplaneswith more than 200 seats, on a ratio of one fire extinguisher per additional100 seats, and (4) that one or two of the required passenger compartmenthand fire extinguishers, as specified, contain Halon 1211 or equivalentas the extinguishing agent. In addition, the FAA proposes to amend Part21 of the FAR to require each transport category airplane manufacturedafter [a date one year after the effective date of the amendment] to incorporatethe improved inflight cabin fire protective measures, regardless of thedate of application for type certificate.These proposals respond to findings resulting from investigations of inflightcabin fires and an FAA survey designed to determine the effectiveness offire safety requirements in the current U.S. air carrier fleet. These findingsclearly indicate that inflight cabin fire protective measures need to beimproved. Similar requirements have recently been adopted for airplanesoperated in air carrier service under the provisions of Part 121.The benefits of the smoke detector and fire extinguisher proposal are theprospective reduction in fatalities, injuries, and property damage resultingfrom fires originating in the lavatories and other areas in the passengercabin. Estimating these benefits quantitatively is difficult because ofthe limited number of inflight cabin fire accidents and the necessity forusing judgement in determining the effectiveness of the proposals in dealingwith accidents that involve cabin fires. There have been few major cabinfire accidents worldwide; however, when such accidents have occurred, thelosses have been catastrophic.Estimating the benefits, as well as the costs, of the proposals is furthercomplicated by the difficulty of accurately predicting the types and numbersof new or significantly modified airplanes that will be certificated underPart 25 in the future. In this analysis, the FAA, therefore, compares benefitsto costs on a per airplane basis. This method results in a relevant presentationof this relationship between benefits and costs while avoiding predictionof the types and numbers of new airplanes that would be certificated underPart 25.Because each of the fire protection measures proposed in this notice iscurrently required under Part 121, air carriers operating under the provisionsof Part 121 already have to comply regardless of whether or not these proposalsare adopted. The majority of all airplanes type certificated under Part25 will be operated under Part 121; therefore, few costs would be attributableto the proposals contained in this notice. Nevertheless, the FAA is evaluatingthe costs of these proposals to demonstrate that these measures are costbeneficial.<ITAG tagnum="81">Benefits</ITAG>Only those fires believed to have originated in the passenger cabin arerelevant to this analysis. Post-crash fires, flight deck fires, belly cargofires, fires aboard freighter airplanes, and all other fires that did notoriginate in the passenger cabin were excluded in establishing this baseline. Only two major cabin fire accidents which meet this criterion haveoccurred in worldwide operations in the last 15 years. They were the VarigBoeing 707 fire at Paris, France, in July 1973, and the Air Canada McDonnellDouglas DC-9 fire at Cincinnati, Ohio in June 1983. Two other fires whichcould be considered significant were the 1979 Pakistani 707 and the 1980Saudi Lockheed L-1011. Evidence regarding the origin of the Pakistani 707fire is not clear; therefore, that accident was discounted for conservatism.The Saudi L-1011 fire is not considered in the analysis because it mayhave originated in the cargo hold rather than the cabin.The two accidents considered in this analysis suggest an average historicalrate of two catastrophic cabin fire accidents during a 15 year period.Although this historical rate reflects worldwide operations, forecast growthin the activity of U.S. carriers during the future 15-year period consideredin this analysis is sufficient to make the exposure of future U.S. aircarrier operations comparable to the exposure of historic worldwide operations.An estimate of two catastrophic cabin fire accidents per 15 years has,therefore, been adopted for developing the benefits in this analysis.To determine the benefits which will result from preventing an accident,it is necessary to estimate the average costs expected to be associatedwith that accident.In its FAA Aviation Forecast published in 1987, the FAA predicts that theaverage number of seats in an airplane used in air carrier domestic operationswill be 171 in 1996 which is the midpoint in the 15 year study horizon.The load factor is estimated to be 61 percent and, therefore, the averagenumber of passengers per flight is expected to be 103. Allowing for flightdeck and cabin crew, the FAA estimates that an average of 108 persons willbe carried on a typical transport category airplane. Note that this isa conservative estimate since it does not take into account the greaternumber of passengers per airplane in international operations.The FAA estimates fatalities from future inflight cabin fire related accidentsby applying the average proportional fatalities from the two historic accidentsas follows: the Varig Boeing 707 and the Air Canada DC-9 accidents hadfatality rates of 100 percent and 50 percent respectively. Thus, the averagefatality rate for these accidents was 75 percent. Applying this rate tothe average number of persons aboard a transport category airplane yieldsan estimated 81 fatalities per accident. For the purpose of analysis, theFAA uses a minimum economic value for a human life of $1,000,000. Thisis the accepted minimum value used by economists in government policy analysis.Therefore, the estimated fatality loss is $81,000,000. An airplane with171 seats is estimated to cost about $34,000,000, i.e., $200,000 per seat.If the airplane is destroyed halfway through its life, the loss is estimatedto be $17,000,000. The total loss to society due to an accident is, therefore,$98,000,000. Discounting this value as a uniform series over the 15-yearperiod of the airplane to allow for the random nature of such accidentsat the 10 percent interest rate prescribed by OMB yields an average accidentcost of $49.7 million. This will be the average benefit realized for everyaccident prevented by the proposed rulemaking. To calculate the benefitsper airplane, the present value of an accident times the number of accidentsdivided by the number of airplanes in 1996 is calculated. The FAA forecaststhat there will be 3990 airplanes in the air carrier fleet in 1996. Theaverage benefits per airplane are, therefore, $24,900 (two accidents times$49.7 million per accident divided by 3,990 airplanes).Given the probability of an accident and the cost associated with thataccident, it is necessary to consider the probability that an accidentwill occur in an area of the cabin where each of the protective measuresproposed in this notice would be operative, and should such a fire scenariooccur, what would be the effectiveness of a particular protective measurein preventing that accident.<ITAG tagnum="81">Benefits for Lavatory Safety Devices</ITAG>Developing estimates to the benefits attributable to the lavatory smokedetectors and to the automatic fire extinguishers in the lavatory trashreceptacles requires that some allocation be made of those potential futureaccidents which would be expected to originate in a lavatory. These potentialaccidents need to be allocated further into those where the smoke detectorwould be the piece of protective equipment relied upon to prevent the accident,and those that would rely upon the automatic fire extinguisher in the trashreceptacle.In both of the catastrophic accidents cited above, the fire appears tohave originated in a lavatory. It would, however, be unrealistic to assumethat all catastrophic cabin fire accidents would necessarily originatein lavatories in the future. Service Difficulty Reports (SDR), maintainedby the FAA's National Safety Data Branch in Oklahoma City, indicate thatonly 12.1 percent of in-cabin smoke and fire incidents occur in lavatories.The SDR data indicate that the vast majority of these incidents, 64.3 percent,occur in airplane galleys, and the remaining 23.6 percent occur in otherareas of the cabin. Although none of the catastrophic cabin fires experiencedto date are believed to have originated outside of a lavatory, some allowancemust be made for the possibility that a major cabin fire could originatein one of the locations where 87.9 percent of the smoke and fire incidentshistorically have occurred. A strong indication of the particularly insidiousnature of lavatory fires is, however, that both of the catastrophic accidentsexperienced to date have originated where a relatively small minority ofthe incidents occur. This reflects the fact that fires in closed lavatorycompartments are more likely to go undetected than in other areas of thecabin.In the judgement of the FAA, which is based on accident and incident dataover a prolonged period of time, the vast majority of fatal cabin fireaccidents would originate in lavatories, but some future fatal accidentscould be expected to originate in galleys or other areas of the cabin.For purposes of this analysis, FAA assumes that over time an average of80 percent of all random catastrophic cabin fire accidents would originatein lavatories and the remaining 20 percent would originate elsewhere inthe cabin.Of the two previous accidents involving lavatory fires, the Varig Boeing707 accident was attributed to a fire originating in the trash receptacle.In its accident report the National Transportation Safety Board does notmake a precise determination of the fire's origin. The evidence indicates,however, that (1) the fire propagated through the lavatory vanity, (2)initially the direction of airflow vented smoke overboard and permittedthe fire to burn undetected, and (3) smoke became noticeable in the openarea of the lavatory when the fire penetrated the lavatory liner. Thesefindings suggest that approximately half of potential accidents involvinglavatory fires would occur where the automatically activating trash receptaclefire extinguishers would be the primary means of defense, and the otherhalf of these potential accidents would occur in other areas of the lavatorywhere the smoke detector would be the significant defensive measure. Theautomatically activating fire extinguishers can only be effective, however,if the door of the trash receptacle seals properly; otherwise the extinguishantdissipates, and its fire-suppressant capabilities are lost. The inspectionsurvey, discussed previously, reveals that the fire-containment capabilitiesof a trash receptacle can become compromised by the wear and tear of typicalservice. In these instances, the lavatory smoke detector would be the principalpiece of equipment in preventing a trash receptacle fire incident frombecoming a major accident. Further, a review of the SDR data concerningthe fire incidents that have occurred in the lavatory indicates that forevery incident originating in the trash receptacle, there are slightlymore than two incidents that have originated in other areas of the lavatory.Typically, they are electrical in origin; and frequently involving theflush pump motor. For these reasons, FAA considers that the lavatory smokedetector will be the operative piece of equipment in preventing potentiallavatory fires more often than will the trash receptacle extinguisher.The FAA has, therefore, assumed that of the 80 percent of all potentialfire accidents expected to originate in the lavatory, an average of 45percent of all potential accidents will involve the smoke detector as theprotective equipment relied upon to prevent a major accident from developing,and only 35 percent of all potential accidents will involve the trash receptaclefire extinguisher.Estimates must also be made concerning the effectiveness of the particularpiece of equipment in preventing an accident in those random combinationsof circumstances where all existing safeguards have failed and, in theabsence of the proposed preventive measures, a major cabin fire accidentwould occur. The FAA assumes that, given such circumstances where the lavatorysmoke detector would be the relevant device, a catastrophic accident couldbe averted an average of 50 percent of the time. The FAA assumes that theaverage effectiveness of the trash receptacle will be 75 percent. The FAAexpects the automatic fire extinguisher to be relatively more effectivethan the smoke detector in those circumstances where it is the primarymeans of protection because of the simplicity of its operation. The benefits of a smoke detector would, therefore, be $5,600 per airplane($24,900 in accident avoidance benefits per airplane times 45 percent ofthe total occurrences times 50 percent effectiveness), and the benefitsof the trash receptacle fire extinguisher would be $6,500 ($24,900 in accidentavoidance benefits per airplane times 35 percent of the total occurrencestimes 75 percent of effectiveness). <ITAG tagnum="81">Benefits of the Halon 1211 Fire Extinguisher in the Cabin </ITAG>The potential benefits of the Halon 1211 fire extinguisher proposals havebeen estimated in a manner similar to the lavatory fire prevention proposals.As stated previously, FAA has assumed that over a prolonged period of time,an average of 80 percent of passenger cabin fires would involve the lavatory,and the remaining 20 percent of potential catastrophic cabin fire accidentswould involve either the galley or other general areas of the passengercabin not previously specified. The FAA estimates that the proportion ofpotential cabin fire accidents where the Halon 1211 fire extinguisherswill be the critical preventive measures will be about 8 percent. The relativelyhigher proportion allocated to the galley area reflects the fact that themajority of all passenger cabin fire incidents, 64.3 percent, occur inairplane galleys. Further, many airplane galleys are less visible becausethey are not located on the main deck of the cabin. The remaining portionof potential catastrophic accidents represents fire scenarios where theHalon 1211 extinguisher would be the critical protective piece of equipment.Although the Halon extinguisher is a state-of-the-art hand fire extinguisherwhich is effective against all classes of fires, its primary advantageover existing extinguishers is that it is especially effective againstfires that involve volatile liquids. Because the Halon extinguishers aretypically lighter than the extinguishers they would replace, there wouldalso be a fuel savings that would be sufficient to offset the procurementcosts. This offset will be discussed in greater detail in the costs section.Finally, estimates must be made concerning the effectiveness of the Halon1211 fire extinguishers when given a situation in which all existing safeguardshave failed and the proposed protective measure would be the last lineof defense. The FAA has estimated an average effectiveness of 50 percentfor this proposal. The benefits of the Halon 1211 fire extinguishers would be $990 ($24,900in accident avoidance benefits per airplane times 8 percent it being therelevant device times 50 percent its effectiveness). <ITAG tagnum="81">Costs</ITAG>As noted above, estimating the costs of the proposal to amend Part 25 iscomplicated by the uncertainty inherent in predicting the number of newairplane designs that will be type certified in the future, when theseairplanes will be type certificated, and how many will be produced. Asa result, the costs are estimated on a unit basis. They also have beendiscounted on the basis of a 15 year life and a 10 percent discount rate.In addition, the expected number of lavatories in newly designed airplanesis assumed to be the same as those in a Boeing Model 767. The Model 767is used as the prototype of future transport category airplanes becauseit is considered to be the approximate median size of such airplanes. <ITAG tagnum="81">Cost of Lavatory Smoke Detectors </ITAG>The FAA estimates that the cost of installing smoke detectors would be$50 each, including the cost of the unit itself. The FAA assume that eachlavatory would be equipped with its own smoke detector. Such detectorswould not have to meet all of the requirements of a technical standardorder applicable to primary detection systems because they would serveessentially as backup to flight attendants and not as primary detectionsystems, such as those used in isolated cargo compartments. Commerciallyavailable smoke detectors of the type commonly used in residential buildings,have been demonstrated to function properly when installed in an airplanelavatory and would be considered suitable for compliance with the proposedstandards. The Model 767 has five lavatories. Thus five lavatory smoke detectors wouldhave to be installed in each airplane, on the average, resulting in a costof $250 per airplane. Each additional pound of weight in a transport categoryairplane is assumed to result in an average additional fuel consumptionof 15 gallons per year. Based on a fuel price of 70 cents per gallon, eachdetectors would result in an average additional cost of about $3 per yearsince it would weigh about one quarter of a pound. Maintenance costs forthe smoke detectors would be $85 per unit per year, based on an averagewage rate of $40 per hour and a ten percent replacement cost factor forthe units. Thus, the average total present value cost per airplane forlavatory smoke detector would be $3,600 (five units times $50 per unit,plus five units times $88 per year variable cost times 7.606 the discountfactor for a uniform annual series). <ITAG tagnum="81">Cost of Automatically Activating Fire Extinguishers </ITAG>The costs of the proposed lavatory trash receptacle fire extinguishers,which would be capable of discharging automatically upon the occurrenceof a fire, have been estimated in a manner similar to that used to estimatesmoke detector costs. Each automatic extinguisher would cost $300 includinginstallation. Thus, an airplane with five lavatories would require fiveautomatic extinguishers at a total cost of $1500. The proposed automatic extinguishers weigh about one pound. At the previouslystated fuel consumption rate of 15 gallons per pound per year, the automaticextinguishers would require 75 additional gallons per airplane per year.At 70 cents per gallon, the present value fuel cost for these extinguisherswould come to $400, using the 7.606 discount factor. Maintenance of automatic fire extinguishers is relatively simple, involvingonly periodic weighing of units to determine if they remain charged. Assumingthat each extingusher would be inspected twice a year, that each inspectionwould take 20 minutes of labor at $40 per hour, the present value of laboris $1000. Units would be expected to be replaced at a yearly rate of 5percent or an expense of $75 per year having a present value of $570. Thetotal of all present value costs associated with the automatic lavatoryfire extinguisher system is, therefore, estimated to be $3,470 per airplane.<ITAG tagnum="81">Cost of Requiring Two Halon 1211 Fire Hand Extinguishers in the PassengerCabin </ITAG>The FAA considers that this proposal would not result in any additionalcosts. The Halon 1211 extinguishers would merely replace a like numberof other types of extinguishers. The Halon 1211 extinguisher costs about$40, about the same as the average cost of other types of extinguishers.The Halon 1211 extinguishers are slightly more expensive to maintain thanother types of extinguishers since they require an additional $10 per extinguisherto recharge; however, they are about 3 pounds lighter than other typesof extinguishers. As a result, the installation of these extinguisherswould generate fuel cost savings which would more than offset the additionalmaintenance costs. <ITAG tagnum="81">Comparison of Costs and Benefits </ITAG>As noted previously, lavatory smoke detectors are estimated to have $5,600in benefits per airplane. Since the costs of these detectors would be $3,600the benefit to cost ratio would be about 1.6 to 1. The FAA projects the installation of automatic fire extinguishers in lavatorytrash receptacles to generate $6,500 in benefits per airplane, at a costof $3,470. The benefit to cost ratio would, therefore, be 1.9 to 1. The Halon 1211 proposal is not expected to generate any net costs sincethe savings in fuel costs from the lighter weight of this extinguisherwould more than offset any other costs. The benefits are expected to be$990 per airplane. This proposal would, therefore have a postive benefitto cost ratio. The proposal to increase the number of available hand fire extinguishersin relation to increased passenger seats on new airplanes would not generateany additional costs because it is consistent with current industry practices.For the same reason, no additional benefits would result. <ITAG tagnum="81">International Trade Impact Analysis </ITAG>The proposals would have little or no impact on trade for both U.S. firmsdoing business in foreign countries and foreign firms doing business inthe U.S. Airplanes imported from foreign manufacturers would have to meetU.S. requirements, and thus would gain no competitive advantage. The proposedsafety feature would not have to be installed in airplanes exported toforeign countries by U.S. manufacturers if the foreign country does notrequire them. Foreign manufacturers would, therefore, gain no competitiveadvantages in this regard. II. Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress toensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionatelyburdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to reviewrules which may have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.'' All of the rules proposed in this notice would affect the manufacturersof commercial transport category airplanes who would produce new airplanesunder Part 25. None of these manufacturers are considered as small entitiesin accordance with FAA criteria which state that a small manufacturer isone with 75 employees or less. Because these proposals do not have ``asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,''no review is required in this regard by the RFA. These proposals are not likely to result in an annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more, or a major increase in costs for consumers, industry,or Federal, State, or local government agencies. Accordingly, it has beendetermined that this is not a major regulatory action under Executive Order12291. A regulatory evaluation of this action, including a Regulatory FlexibilityDetermination and a Trade Impact Assessment, has been placed in the regulatorydocket, and a copy may be obtained by contacting the person identifiedunder the caption ``<T2>For Further Information Contact</T2>.''<ITAG tagnum="81">Federalism Implications</ITAG>The regulations set forth in this notice would be promulgated pursuantto authority in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C.1301 <T3>et. seq.</T3>) which statute is construed to preempt State law regulatingthe same subject. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it isdetermined that such regulation does not have federalism implications warrantingthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons given earlier in the preamble, the FAA has determined thatthis is not a major regulation as defined in Executive Order 12291. TheFAA has determined that this action is significant as defined in Departmentof Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979). In addition, it is certified under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act that this regulation, at promulgation, will not have asignificant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial numberof small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>14 CFR Part 21Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.14 CFR Part 25Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, the FAA proposes to amend Parts 21 and 25 of the Federal AviationRegulations (FAR), 14 CFR Parts 21 and 25, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 21_CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES FOR PRODUCTS AND PARTS</ITAG>1.
