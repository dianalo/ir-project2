The holding company said it has been &quot;unfairly associated&quot; with other banks in New England that have had major loan losses in recent quarters. The company said its People's Savings Bank unit doesn't have a &quot;large exposure to construction and commercial loans that have caused the loan-loss problems in many of the banks.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
