In an opinion made public Thursday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Courtof Appeals in Manhattan upheld a lower court ruling allowing thefunding cuts.   A Department of Health and Human Services rule adopted in 1988prohibits the use of Title X funds for programs that assist a womanin obtaining an abortion, such as abortion counseling and referrals.   The rule also prohibits funding for activities that ``encourage,promote or advocate abortion.''   Title X funds are the largest source of federal funding forfamily planning services, the opinion said.   The panel ruled that the restrictions do not violate the freedomof speech of health care providers and that the limits oncounseling services do not violate the rights of pregnant women.   The plaintiffs, who include private and public agencies, willprobably ask for an injunction against enforcement of theregulations pending a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, saidSuzanne Lynn, chief of the Civil Rights Bureau for the stateAttorney General's office, who represented the State of New York inappealing the regulations.   ``The regulations make it impossible to give quality counselingto pregnant women,'' said Lynn.   ``This is a frightening decision in terms of the rights of womento obtain abortions and the rights of health care providers andwomen to speak about things related to medical care,'' agreedRachael Pine, lawyer for the Reproductive Freedom Project of theAmerican Civil Liberties Union.   The Health and Human Services regulation was also appealed inColorado and in Massachusetts. In both states, a lower court issuedan injunction against the regulations pending appeals, Pine said.   Those appealing the regulation in New York included the State ofNew York, New York City, The New York City Health and HospitalsCorp., Planned Parenthood of NYC, Planned Parenthood ofWestchester-Rockland and Health Services of Hudson County, N.J.</TEXT></DOC>
