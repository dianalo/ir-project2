<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-50-0473 </DOCNO><TEXT>This invention relates to a system for heating or cooling a room, saidsystem being installed in the floor, walls, or ceiling and in which aheating or cooling medium circulates in a space between a wall or floorcovering and the wall, ceiling, or floor. In this space, a heating/coolingline extends and is at least partially connected with a thermally conductivesheet. In the scope of this invention, it was established that heat transferbetween the line and the wall or floor surface has heretofore been mainlyby conduction, so that only a modest part of the heat is transferred,with the temperature difference between line and surface being too highfor good energy economy. The objective of this invention is to providean improved system of the aforementioned type, with lower heat losses,reduced structural height and better heat transfer, and increased feasibilityof installation. The objective is achieved by designing the distancebetween the inner and outer layers to be essentially equal to the heightof the line measured in the direction of the wall thickness, and by makingthe total surface of the thermally conductive sheet about twice as largeas the surface of the sheet directly enveloping the line. According toa further characteristic of the invention, an underfloor convector iscreated. These measures result in substantially improved heat transfer,namely by convection in addition to conduction, so that the system canbe operated at a low supply temperature, thus enhancing the economy ofthe heating/cooling system. 20 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
