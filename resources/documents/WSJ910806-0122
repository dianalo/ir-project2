Those rules barred even thewell-dressed, perfect-smelling editors of The Wall StreetJournal from using the library if engaged in thinking asopposed to reading or studying. The opinion does not permitRichard Kreimer or any other homeless person to harass women.It did not deal with Mr. Kreimer's conduct in any way,because the sole issue presented was the facial validity ofthe regulations. It does not permit libraries to becomeshelters and, indeed, the opinion states just the opposite:   &quot;One cannot dispute the right and obligations of thelibrary trustees to assure that the library is used for thegeneral purposes for which it is intended. Libraries cannotand should not be transformed into hotels or kitchens, evenfor the needy. The public has the right to designate which ofits institutions shall be utilized for particular purposes.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   What troubles me is the intentional merging by a respectedand sophisticated newspaper of the principle enunciated andthe conduct involved. Judges who protect the rights of peopleaccused of crimes do not condone those crimes or ignore itsvictims. A newspaper, the ultimate beneficiary of the FirstAmendment, should understand that protection of the right offree speech is not necessarily an endorsement of what isspoken.   Nothing in my opinion puts the homeless in an exaltedclass, as you suggest. Quite to the contrary, the opinionrequires that the library regulations apply to all equally,but that they be clear and specific as to what is and is notprohibited -- in essence, that they comply with theConstitution. I recognize that standards may be difficult toarticulate, but that is the function of library boards andnot the courts. Indeed, if we attempted to do otherwise yousurely would accuse us of judicial legislation.   For you to conclude that a decision declaring regulationsvoid for vagueness permits harassment of women by thehomeless is a syllogism unworthy of a great and respectednewspaper. Likewise the greatness of our judicial systemrests upon the public confidence in it, and such editorialsundermine that confidence.   A decision that declares invalid for vagueness aregulation that purports to prohibit certain conduct doesnot, as you suggest, grant a permanent license to perform theconduct sought to be prohibited. It merely requires that thelanguage be more precise -- the same precision one would hopeto find in The Wall Street Journal.   H. Lee Sarokin   U.S. District Court   District of New Jersey   Newark, N.J.</TEXT></DOC>
