This evidence, together with aHubble parameter of H/sub o/ andgt; 70 (km/S . Mpc) = (14 x 10/sup 9/ years)/sup-1/, cannot be recoiled in a Friedmann model with {Lambda}= 0. It requiresa cosmological constant on the order of 10/sup -56/ cm/sup -2/, whichis equivalent to a vacuum density of rho/sub v/ = 10/sup -29/ g . cm/sup-3/. Friedmann-Lemaitre models ({Lambda}andgt; 0) with a hot big bang havebeen calculated. They are based on a present value of the baryonic matterdensity of rho/sub o/ = 0.5 x 10/sup -30/ g . cm/sup -3/, as derivedfrom the primordial /sup 4/He and /sup 2/H abundances. For a Hubble parameterof H/sub o/ = 75 (km/s . Mpc), the author's analysis favors models thatcan be represented by a model with Euclidean metric (deceleration parameter,q/sub o/ = -0.93; age, t/sub o/ = 19.7 x 10/sup 9/ years) and by a closedmodel with perpetual expansion (q/sub o/ = 1.0;t/sub o/ = 22 x 10/sup9/ years). The possible behavior of the vacuum density is discussed withthe help of Steeruwitz formulae in the context of the closed model withan additional inflationary phase at very early times.</TEXT></DOC>
