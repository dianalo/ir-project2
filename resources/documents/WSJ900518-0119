In addition, the Sandamp;L said that the Office of ThriftSupervision has joined the list of regulatory bodiesinvestigating its junk-bond ties to Drexel Burnham LambertInc. and that the probe includes a look at &quot;certain expensesand activities of former association officers.&quot; All thedisclosures were made in the company's first-quarter reportto the OTS.</LP><TEXT>   The April deposit outflow, combined with totalfirst-quarter withdrawals of $200 million, means the thrifthas lost about 16% of its $2.8 billion retail-deposit base atyear end.   Columbia experienced an additional $733.4 million inwithdrawals through April because of maturing brokereddeposits and faces a further $1.2 billion in withdrawals ofsuch deposits in the rest of the year. Retail deposits areconsidered a more crucial indicator of investor confidence,however, and are also a generally cheaper and more stablesource of funds.   Nonetheless, Columbia officials said the thrift is highlyliquid and does not foresee a cash squeeze.   &quot;Columbia and its subsidiaries have liquidity which isnearly two times the legal requirement,&quot; said a spokesman.&quot;We continue to be encouraged by the confidence shown by ourdepositors at this time. We believe we have sufficientliquidity to meet all foreseeable liquidity requirements.&quot;   Columbia had about $1.1 billion in cash or cashequivalents at March 31 to cushion further withdrawals. Thecompany is also raising cash by selling assets. It is alsobelieved to be examining other strategies for raising fundsin light of a number of new restrictions placed on theinstitution because of its financial troubles. Under federallaw, Columbia, insolvent since Feb. 28, is prohibited fromtaking or rolling over brokered deposits, which havehistorically accounted for about 60% of its deposits. Inaddition, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Franciscorecently put restrictions on its ability to obtain furtheradvances from it.   The payment omission on its 11.5% subordinated debt couldbe more ominous for the company's common shareholders thanthe debt holders themselves, some of which have alreadymarked down the debt about 90% of face value.   Some analysts believe Columbia will likely attempt to swapthe debt for equity in an attempt to help boost capitallevels. In the OTS filing, for instance, the thrift confirmedprevious reports that it plans to offer to swap some $72.9million in other subordinated debt outstanding for newpreferred stock, a plan that could further gut the interestsof common shareholders. The spokesman declined to comment onany plans for the 11.5% debt.   The company also declined to comment on the OTSinvestigation, which according to the filing, was initiatedlate last year but only recently came to Columbia'sattention. The Securities and Exchange Commission and theManhattan U.S. attorney's office have been inquiring into thepossible existence of an illegal &quot;stock-parking&quot; arrangementbetween Drexel and Columbia. Parking is essentially a shamsale of a security that is designed to hide the true ownerfor tax or disclosure purposes. Columbia was one of Drexel'sbiggest junk-bond clients.   The company also declined to comment on the OTS expenseprobe. According to proxy materials for the company's June 5annual meeting, Columbia paid its top executives $4 millionin bonuses last year, the huge operating lossnotwithstanding. Former Chief Executive Thomas Spiegel's payas a consultant to the company has been reduced to $1 a year-- from a $500,000 annual rate -- because of regulators'objections.   For 1989, Columbia reported a net loss of $591.1 million,or $30.11 a share. It reported a net loss for the firstquarter of $293.3 million, or $14.62 a share. The companyhopes to stem the flow of red ink by selling its $2.9 billionjunk-bond portfolio, which has eroded in value by about $1billion since last year, triggering all the losses.</TEXT></DOC>
