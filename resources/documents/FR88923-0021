Authority </ITAG>These regulations are issued under the authority of sections 2002, 9001,9002, 9003, 9004, 9005, and 9006, 9007, and 9009 of the Solid Waste DisposalAct of 1970, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of1976, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6912, 6991, 6991(a), 6991(b), 6991(c), 6991(d),6991(e), 6991(f), and 6991(h)). <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background </ITAG>A. Subtitle I of RCRA The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 extended and strengthenedthe provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended by the ResourceConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976. One major portion of RCRAas amended, Subtitle I, provides for the development and implementationof a comprehensive regulatory program for ``underground storage tanks''containing ``regulated substances'' and releases of these substances tothe environment. Subtitle I defines ``underground storage tank'' as a tank system, includingits piping, that has at least 10 percent of its volume underground. Throughoutthis preamble and final rule, the terms ``underground storage tanks,''``USTs,'' and ``UST systems'' include both the underground storage tankvessel and the underground piping connected to it. ``Regulated substances'' are defined as substances defined as hazardousunder the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and LiabilityAct of 1980 (CERCLA), except hazardous wastes regulated under SubtitleC of RCRA, and petroleum. Subtitle I excludes the following from the definition of USTs: andbullet; Farm or residential tanks of 1,100 gallons or less capacity storingmotor fuel for noncommercial purposes; andbullet; Tanks storing heating oil for consumptive use on the premiseswhere stored; andbullet; Septic tanks; andbullet; Pipeline facilities (including gathering lines) regulated underthe Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, the Hazardous Liquid PipelineAct of 1979, or State laws comparable to these Acts; andbullet; Surface impoundments, pits, ponds, and lagoons;andbullet; Storm-water or wastewater collection systems; andbullet; Flow-through process tanks; andbullet; Liquid traps or associated gathering lines directly related tooil or gas production and gathering operations; and andbullet; Storage tanks situated on or above the floor of underground areas,such as basements and cellars.Subtitle I contains several major provisions for the regulation of USTsystems. Section 9002 requires UST system owners to notify states of theexistence of their UST systems. These notification requirements were addressedin a final rule published by EPA on November 8, 1985 (50 FR 46602). Section9002, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of1986 (SARA), also requires that states use the notifications they receiveto compile tank inventories. Under Federal grant agreements, states areproviding EPA with aggregated data from these notifications. Under section 9003, EPA must promulgate regulations applicable to all ownersand operators of UST systems as necessary to protect human health and theenvironment. In promulgating these regulations, section 9003(b) authorizesthe Administrator to distinguish between types, classes, and ages of undergroundstorage tanks. Section 9003 requires EPA to issue design, construction,installation, and compatibility standards for new tanks, as well as requirementsapplicable to all tank owners and operators concerning leak detection,recordkeeping, reporting, closure, corrective action, and financial responsibility.Section 9003(h), as amended by SARA, gives EPA_and states under cooperativeagreements with EPA_authority to clean up petroleum releases from UST systemsor to require their owners and operators to do so. It also establishesa trust fund to finance these activities. Section 9004 permits EPA to authorize states to implement their own USTprograms in place of the Federal requirements if the state's requirementsare ``no less stringent'' than EPA's and provide for adequate enforcement.Programs which are less stringent in certain areas may receive approvalfor an interim period. Other provisions of Subtitle I pertain to definitions (section 9001); entry,inspection, and information gathering (section 9005); enforcement (section9006); Federal facilities (section 9007); state authorities (section 9008);and studies and reports to Congress required of EPA (section 9009). This preamble and final rule pertain to the requirements mandated by sections9003 (a), (c), (e) and (g); they also meet the study requirements of sections9009 (a) and (b). Final rules for state program approval requirements,under section 9004, are found elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4> Final rules for financial responsibility requirementsfor petroleum UST systems, under sections 9003 (a) and (d), will be promulgatedby EPA at a later date. Section 9003(c) requires EPA to establish the following minimum technicalrequirements for all UST systems: To maintain a leak detection system orcomparable system designed to identify releases to protect human healthand the environment; to maintain records of any such release detectionsystem; to report releases and corrective action taken; to take correctiveaction in response to a release; and to close tanks to prevent future releases.Under section 9003(e), EPA must also establish performance standards fornew UST systems. At a minimum, these standards must include design, construction,installation, release detection, and compatibility standards. Until the promulgation of today's final rule, section 9003(g) establishedan ``Interim Prohibition'' that allowed installation of UST systems afterMay 8, 1985, only if the UST system is protected from corrosion, preventsreleases due to corrosion or structural failure for the operational lifeof the tank, and is constructed of material compatible with the substanceto be stored. The law allowed an exemption from the requirement of corrosionprotection if an UST system is located at a site having a soil resistivitymeasured at 12,000 ohms/cm or greater. An interpretive rule concerningthe Interim Prohibition was published on June 4, 1986 (51 FR 20418). TheseInterim Prohibition requirements are replaced by today's final rule fornew tank standards, except in those few cases where the Agency has decidedto defer regulatory action on some types of UST systems. For these deferredUST systems, the Interim Prohibition will continue to apply until EPA takesaction in the future either to regulate or not regulate them (see andSection;andSection;280.10 and 280.11 of the final rule). B. Operating Principles Faced with the mandate of Subtitle I, EPA recognized several unusual aspectsof the regulated universe that have created special problems in developingan effective regulatory approach. First, the regulated universe is immense,including over 2 million UST systems estimated to be located at over 700,000facilities nationwide. Second, over 75 percent of the existing systemsare made of unprotected steel, a type of tank system proven to be the mostlikely to leak and thus create the greatest potential for health and environmentaldamage. Third, most of the facilities to be regulated are owned and operatedby very small businesses, essentially ``Mom and Pop'' enterprises not accustomedto dealing with complex regulatory requirements. Fourth, numerous technologicalinnovations and changes are now underway in various sectors of the USTsystem service community. In response to the unique aspects of this regulated community, and theclear need for comprehensive management of USTs during their operatinglife, EPA has identified and followed several key operating principles,described briefly below, in developing the final regulations for USTs.andbullet; The UST program must be based on sound national standards thatprotect human health and the environment. andbullet; The UST regulatory program must be designed to be implementedat the state and local levels. State and local governments have been andcontinue to be the authorities most capable of effective oversight of USTsystems and response to releases. andbullet; The regulations must be kept simple, understandable, and easilyimplemented by the owner and operator in order to facilitate voluntarycompliance. Section 9003(b) specifically indicates that technical capabilitycan be considered in developing the Subtitle I rules. andbullet; The regulations must not inhibit new UST technological developments.andbullet; The regulations must be designed to retain the flexibility necessaryto accommodate, where possible, the special needs of the UST regulatedcommunity, which is largely composed of small businesses with limited resourcesavailable for capital improvements. andbullet; In order to encourage the utmost voluntary compliance, the regulationsshould build upon current industry trends and tie into and utilize ongoingindustry initiatives toward more sound UST management. Toward this end,section 9003(b) specifically authorizes EPA to consider industry practicesand consensus codes in developing appropriate UST regulations. The Agencyexpects the nationwide use of these new management practices to yield directenvironmental benefits.By reflecting these operating principles in the final UST regulations,the Agency believes it has taken the most effective approach toward protectinghuman health and the environment. C. Summary of April 17 Proposed Rule On April 17, 1987, EPA proposed regulations for USTs storing either petroleumor hazardous substances (other than hazardous wastes regulated under SubtitleC of RCRA) (52 FR 12662). These proposed regulatory measures set requirementsfor both new and existing UST systems to control the major causes of releasesfrom these tank systems and included, among other things, corrosion controls,proper installation requirements, and spill and overfill prevention measures.Figure 1 illustrates several key aspects of the regulatory program proposedin April 1987; requirements for corrosion protection and monthly releasedetection at all new UST systems; the phase-in of either monthly releasedetection or periodic tightness testing combined with inventory controlat all existing USTs, within 3 years if unprotected from corrosion andwithin 5 years if protected; and the upgrading of all existing UST systemsto the new tank standards within 10 years. In addition, the proposed newand upgraded tank standards for hazardous substance USTs required secondarycontainment with interstitial monitoring. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus(s) 017 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C  </ITAG>Figure 1 does not illustrate several other requirements and standards proposedfor both new and existing UST systems: The design and installation of newUST systems; spill and overfill prevention; UST system repair; system closure;release detection methods and performance; and release confirmation, reporting,and response (including corrective action requirements). These proposedrequirements and the manner in which they may have changed in the finalrule are described in detail later in today's preamble. Several major pointsof departure from the proposal are identified and discussed in sectionIII below. D. Public Comment on the Proposal EPA received over 5,000 individual comments from over 1,100 commenterson the April 17 proposal, including verbal and written comments from thethree public hearings. In general, these public comments supported theAgency's overall approach to the proposed regulations and the substantiverequirements for new and existing UST systems. Many comments addressed specific parts of the proposed rule, suggestingchanges or calling attention to potential problems. These specific commentsare discussed below in today's preamble. In summary, many comments tendedto center on three areas: Concern for the impact the UST rule would haveon small businesses, calls for EPA to adopt more stringent requirementsfor certain sensitive areas, and suggestions on the best way to phase inrelease detection. (See the corresponding sections in today's preamblefor a full discussion of these comments.) The financial responsibilityrequirements generated more public comment than any other single area.Comments on this issue will be addressed in the financial responsibilityfinal rule that will appear in a later <T4>Federal Register</T4>. E. Summary of the Supplemental Notice and the Notice of Availability ofNew Information After the April 17 proposal appeared, EPA realized that some aspects ofthe technical standards needed to be clarified and that more public commenton these matters was needed. Consequently, EPA published a SupplementalNotice on December 23, 1987 (52 FR 48638). This Supplemental Notice dealtwith four areas pertaining to the proposed technical requirements:(1) Use of ``static inventory control'' to monitor used oil UST systems;(2) A listing of substances subject to petroleum UST standards; (3) Alternatives to release monitoring for piping and tanks protected fromexternal corrosion; and (4) An alternative definition of ``flow-through process tank.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Public response concerning these issues is discussed in later sectionsof this preamble. On March 31, 1988, EPA published a Notice of Availability of additionalinformation for public comment. It announced the availability of informationpertaining to several technical areas of the proposed rule including generaloperating requirements, release detection and tank closure. This new informationwas submitted by commenters, gathered in meetings or conferences and producedby Agency research programs. Few public comments were provided concerningthese documents. F. Influences on the Final Rule In the preamble to the April 17 proposal, the Agency discussed the scopeand nature of the problem posed by UST systems and several important influenceson the development of the proposal (52 FR 12665-12671). Today's final rulebuilds on that earlier information and has benefited from numerous commentsprovided by the public on the issues highlighted in the proposal. The followingsection briefly discusses several areas that have received further considerationfrom EPA in the development of today's final rules. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Scope of the Problem </ITAG>The preamble to the proposed rule (52 FR 12665) presented estimates ofthe number of leaking UST systems based on EPA studies, local governmentexperiences, and industry estimates. Among the statistics cited were thepercentage of systems failing tightness testing, the percentage of systemsactually leaking, the correlation of tank age to failure, and the extentand impact of soil and ground-water contamination from USTs. After theproposed rule was issued, EPA completed an additional study of the causesof release from UST systems. This new study was placed into the publicdocket and announced as available for comment in the December 23, 1987,Supplemental Notice. This study, ``Causes of Release from UST Systems,''and the public comments on it were important in developing today's preambleand final rule. a. <T3>Current Estimates of ``Non-Tight'' UST Systems. </T3>In the preambleto the proposal (52 FR 12665), EPA cited evidence that numerous UST systemsare non-tight and may be leaking. This evidence was based largely on threestudies: EPA's ``Underground Motor Fuel Tanks: A National Survey'' reportedtank tightness testing results and found that 35 percent of over 450 tanksystems surveyed nationwide failed tightness testing; Suffolk County'sUST program data revealed that 26 percent of over 6,000 tank systems testedin this New York county failed; and a Chevron-sponsored testing programfound that nearly 10 percent of over 3,000 of their UST systems failed.Commenters responding to the proposal who had experience with tightnesstesting provided various claims that between 11 and 48 percent of existingUST systems failed under test conditions. In an EPA-sponsored meeting,a group of experienced, independent installation contractors expressedtheir expert judgment that increased awareness of the UST problem, useof better tanks, and use of better installation and maintenance procedureshave decreased the probability of present-day systems testing non-tightto about 20 percent, in contrast to the 50 percent of UST installationsthey believed would have tested non-tight several years ago.After publication of the proposal, EPA studied several additional piecesof information concerning causes of release from UST systems. For example,EPA further reviewed the records of over 10,000 tightness test resultsfrom local UST programs (in Suffolk County, New York; Austin, Texas; andSan Diego, California). EPA also analyzed an extensive and detailed historicalset of records from a Texas tank testing company (the Service Station TestingCompany of San Antonio, Texas). The EPA-sponsored report, ``Causes of Releasefrom UST Systems,'' is based on all these data and concludes that approximately25 percent of existing UST systems are found to be non-tight when testedusing current methods and that loose tank fittings or faulty piping causes84 percent of these tightness test failures. Figure 2 summarizes the Agency'sfindings concerning the causes-of-release profile as derived from tanktesting results and documented follow-up at over 10,000 UST systems conductednationwide. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus(s) 023 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C  </ITAG>b. <T3>Estimated UST Systems with Releases. </T3>Current indications concerningthe number of UST systems nationwide that have had releases in the pastor are now leaking are less precise than the tank tightness data, but theAgency believes the information that is available is significant nonetheless.As discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule, in many places in thenation that are still without state or local UST regulatory programs today,release detection only takes place when someone sees or smells the release(52 FR 12665). These historical data suggest that only about 10 percentof release incidents in these areas are discovered by inventory controlsor mechanical release detection methods. Although the large number of incidentsthat are known to threaten or have contaminated ground-water wells is significant,it is not an accurate prediction of leaking UST systems because most USTsystems are not located near wells. As the result of aggressive UST monitoring programs in two states, over5,000 UST sites in California and 3,000 sites in Florida have been identifiedas having had releases during the past three years. These recent discoveriesalready exceed 10 percent of the number of UST sites in each of these states,and the number of releases identified in just these two states may soonexceed the cumulative total of releases reported to all the states up until1985 (see 52 FR 12665). At a more local level, UST system programs in DadeCounty, Florida, and San Jose, California, have also identified (throughrequired release detection and system closure procedures) that well over10 percent of their UST facilities have had some noticeable or significantreleases into the surrounding soil and groundwater. Thus, the initial findingsby state and local UST regulatory programs that are particularly aggressiveappear to corroborate an industry-sponsored study (than previously citedChevron investigation) that found approximately 10 percent of their 1,000UST facilities located throughout the South and Southwest of the UnitedStates have had an adverse impact on nearby ground water in the form ofreleased product floating on top of the ground-water table (see 52 FR 12666).Public comments received in response to the proposal concerning this subjectare not conclusive. Some industry sources provided very low estimates,claiming that from 0 to 3 percent of UST systems have had releases. Othersclaimed the actual number of leaking tank systems could be as high as 50percent in some areas. Many estimated that the actual range is somewherebetween 8 to 20 percent of UST sites, and the average of all estimatesreported by commenters falls into this range. As shown in the previousfigure (Figure 2), approximately 25 percent of all systems are now testingas non-tight. About 15 percent of the sites whose systems were tested actuallyproved to have a leak under normal operating conditions (tank and deliverypiping leaks), and this proportion falls within the above-estimated rangeprovided by the commenters. Some commenters attempted to provide additional insight into the relationshipbetween tank age and failure by indicating that tanks begin to fail tightnesstests (and leak) at a much greater frequency after 12 years. In addition,the recent EPA causes-of-release study includes one study that indicated10 to 13 percent of the tanks that are 12 to 13 years old were non-tight.This is more than double the proportion of non-tight tanks tested in otherage groups. In another study, of the tanks actually found to be leaking,42 percent of the leakers were 15 to 20 years old, and 30 percent of theleakers were 10 to 15 years old. All of the tanks that were leaking weremade of bare steel. This demonstrates that the critical age in a typicalunprotected steel tank's life is the period between 10 to 20 years of agewhen breakthrough from corrosion is most likely to begin. Some commenters disputed the severity of the threat posed to the nationby leaking UST systems, which was discussed in the preamble to the proposedrule. For example, one suggestion was that the data presented in the preambleindicate less than 0.008 percent of the total area of the United Statesis affected by contamination due to leaking UST systems. In general, EPAfinds this line of reasoning unpersuasive. In particular, this argumentignores, (1) that population density in the nation is not uniform (withmost areas being sparsely populated or unpopulated); (2) that tank systemsare generally located near populated areas to provide the fuel for thesecenters of human activity and; (3) that there are numerous documented casesof drinking water wells that have been threatened or already destroyedby leaking UST systems nationwide. The dispersal of leaked contaminantswithin ground-water aquifers can also affect an area many times largerthan the soil-contaminated area. Further information gathered over thecoming years of UST program implementation will ascertain the full magnitudeof the impacts that leaking UST systems pose in terms of contaminationto the nation's environment, but EPA concludes that the evidence collectedto date, including the information provided by commenters on the proposal,clearly supports the need for today's final rules. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. New Cause-of-Release Information </ITAG>EPA's new information concerning releases from UST systems comes primarilyfrom public comment and an EPA-sponsored study (``Causes of Release fromUST Systems'') that was made available for public comment in the December23, 1987, Supplemental Notice. Review of this information has resultedin the following findings concerning the major causes of releases today:andbullet; Most releases do not come from the tank portion of UST systems,because piping releases occur twice as often as tank releases; andbullet; Spills and overfills are the most common causes of releases; andbullet; Various nonoperational UST components at the top of USTs are looseand leak in the event of overfills; andbullet; Although the older bare steel tanks fail primarily by corrosion,the ``new generation'' USTs (i.e., coated and cathodically protected steel,fiberglass-clad steel, and fiberglass tanks) have nearly eliminated failureinduced by external corrosion; andbullet; Corrosion, poor installation techniques and workmanship, accidents,and natural events (e.g., frost heaves) are the four major causes of failurefor piping; and andbullet; When piping fails, pressurized systems pose a significant addedthreat of sudden, large releases.Thus, the major causes of releases from UST systems are due to failuresof unprotected tanks, leaks in delivery piping, leaks from vent pipes andfittings on top of the tank, and spill and overfill errors. Comments receivedon the original proposal (52 FR 12665-12668) and the Supplemental Noticeconcerning causes of release generally tend to corroborate the above findings.The following information summarizes some of the most relevant findingsthat are important in guiding today's standard-setting. a. <T3>Tanks. </T3>Most existing tanks are made of bare steel. Numerous tankfailure histories indicate that when bare steel tanks fail they almostalways do so because of external corrosion. Of all of the current causesof release, corrosion of bare steel (tanks and pipes) is by far the mostimportant. Tank manufacturers have responded to this problem with a ``new generation''of tanks. Innovative tanks began to appear about 20 years ago in the UnitedStates in three basic forms: Fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP); steelwith a corrosion-resistant coating and cathodic protection; and steel-FRPcomposite. A dramatic acceleration in the use of new generation tanks occurredwith the introduction of the federal law's ``Interim Prohibition'' threeyears ago. These protected tanks now are estimated to account for about20 to 25 percent of existing USTs. Although ``new'' in terms of protectivedesigns, some of each of the new types of tank systems have been in theground for over 20 years. Reported failures observed in the field due tocorrosion (or other reasons) are very rare. Failures (leaks) at all existing FRP tanks appear to have occurred at lessthan a rate of 0.05 percent per year of the total FRP tanks installed nationwide.Many commenters and other sources support the field estimates collectedby EPA that less than 0.5 percent of the total number of existing FRP tankshave ever leaked. Although some installation-related failures have occurredin the past, heightened installer awareness of proper practices and techniquesappropriate to FRP technology, manufacturer-sponsored contractor educationprograms, and production quality assurance appear to be responsible fora consistently decreasing failure rate of FRP tanks. The most importantreported failure mode for these tanks is improper installation practices.One new tank type, the STI-P3, is a favorite of corrosion engineers. Thesesteel tanks have an external noncorrodible coating and a factory-appliedmetal anode that sacrifices itself to protect any bare spots on the tank,and the tank vessel is electrically isolated from any attached piping.Very few failures have ever been reported, and those failures are due toinstallation damage or improper maintenance, not design. In Ontario, Canada,where STI-P3 tanks have been widely used, the number of tank releases dueto corrosion is reported to be declining as old tanks are replaced withSTI-P3 tanks. The steel-FRP composite tanks have not been used as widely as either theFRP or coated and cathodically protected tanks described above. Approximately65,000 have been installed in this country. No corrosion-related failureshave been reported. Many commenters suggested that this type of tank hasseveral advantages over both FRP and coated and cathodically protectedsteel tanks, such as durability, no need for maintenance, and an addedbarrier between the tank and the environment should the steel tank be breachedby internal corrosion. As the threat of external corrosion is reduced by new tank designs, internalcorrosion may eventually become the primary cause of failure for steeltanks. Internal corrosion, however, occurs far less frequently and takeslonger to manifest itself than external corrosion. Many commenters havereported problems with internal corrosion under the drop tube (i.e., fillpipe located within the tank) of steel tanks. Data submitted from the tanklining industry confirm these reports. The tank manufacturing industry,however, began to respond to this problem several years ago by including``striker plates'' under all openings of their new tanks. Lining tank interiors is another way to prevent releases due to internaland external corrosion. Tank interior lining has been employed by majorcorporations and small businesses both as a short-term solution for potentiallyleaking tanks and as a preventive measure for temporarily giving structurallysound, non-leaking existing tanks the same protection from corrosion-inducedreleases that ``new generation'' tanks have. Data indicate this to be asuccessful procedure for extending an existing tank's operational life.Even when employed in the absence of external cathodic protection, failurerates are reported to be very low, apparently because current industryconsensus codes only recommend the use of lining when the tank shell isassessed to be able to withstand the expected rate of corrosion at thesite (determined by assessing the tank's existing condition). b. <T3>Piping. </T3>Most commenters rated delivery piping the most significantsource of releases and reported releases occurring twice as frequentlyfrom piping as from bare steel tank releases. Two types of piping systemsare commonly used: Suction piping, which is used in low-volume applicationswhere only a few dispensers are needed; and pressurized piping, which isused in high-volume applications where many dispensers are fed from onetank. Each piping system has unique advantages and disadvantages, discussedbelow. Suction piping is considered by commenters to be safer than pressurizedpiping because it operates at less than atmospheric pressure. If the pipedevelops a leak, air or ground water is usually drawn into the pipe insteadof product leaking out. Commenters suggested, however, that suction pipingsystems do not operate efficiently in a number of settings, such as athigh altitudes, in hot climates, or in high-volume delivery situations.Pressurized piping systems reportedly are used at about 95 percent of newretail motor fuel system installations. If the delivery line is breached,free product is released until the pressure in the pipe equals the pressureoutside the pipe. Without add-on instrumentation or devices, large volumesof product can be pushed out of breaches in the piping when product isdelivered to the pump. Pressurized piping simply pushes more volume tomeet this increase in demand, releasing large amounts of product quicklyinto the environment.Comments received by EPA indicate that the releases from pressurized pipingsystems can be catastrophic in the absence of monitoring and automatedpump flow restriction devices. Incidents involving releases of thousandsof gallons have been reported to EPA by experienced installers. It is estimatedthat at least 70 percent of the volume of product lost through pressurizedpipe releases could be avoided by retrofitting each line with a simple,inexpensive, continuous in-line pressure monitor that automatically restrictsproduct flow in the presence of a significant line leak. Both suction and pressurized piping are often damaged by external corrosion.Cathodic protection of steel piping would significantly reduce corrosionfailures. Presently, most steel piping is protected by galvanizing andcoating, or coating and wrapping. The threaded portions at joints are themost common failure points because the protection is removed from themwhile threading and is never replaced. In these cases, cathodic protectionwould reduce joint failures. Other joint failures result from untightenedjoints, cross-threaded joints, or improperly made joints. Improving theinstaller's education and skills in the complex task of pipe installationwould reduce these piping failures. Also, installers and others have estimated that piping is damaged 10 percentof the time at new installations between the installation of equipmentand completion of paving. They strongly recommend that a test of new equipmentbefore start-up is essential as a sound practice, particularly with pressurizedpiping. Natural forces and accidents also cause piping failures. The piping isnear the surface of the ground and, thus, subject to frost heaves and overloading.In addition, the starting and stopping of product delivery causes the pipingto move and shift. This eventually causes joint failure in many pipingsystems. ``New generation'' piping systems comparable to the ``new generation''of tanks are under development but not widely used. c. <T3>Nonoperational Components. </T3>Nonoperational components consist oftank bung holes, tank manholes, vent and fill lines, vapor recovery lines,and manifold piping (the piping used in connecting tanks together). Thesecomponents, all located above the top of the tank, are called nonoperationalbecause releases from these sources do not occur under normal operatingconditions. Releases from them are usually unseen because they are underground.These releases are episodic and usually of small volume, because they onlyoccur when the tank is overfilled or when manifolded tanks are filled throughthe piping connecting the tanks together. Generally, when an overfill occurs,the volume of product contained in the fill tube above the loose nonoperationalcomponent will be forced out into the environment until the product levelin the UST drops below the leaking component. These leaking, nonoperationalcomponents are reported to be most often caused by improper installationpractices, such as loose bung hole plugs not being tightened at installationor vent lines being handtightened on top of the tank. Two solutions are available to stop this type of release: either ensureproper installation of these different types of fittings or eliminate overfills.Elimination of overfilling of the tank is the surest remedy and is probablythe easiest to accomplish with overfill shutoff devices now widely available.Most releases associated with nonoperational components would be preventedif overfills were successfully eliminated. d. <T3>Spills and Overfills. </T3>In addition to episodic releases from nonoperationalcomponents, there is an even more prevalent source of release that takesplace at the tank fill port during tank filling. Although usually smallin volume, spill and overfill releases are probably the most common causesof release from UST systems. These releases usually occur at the surfaceof the ground around the top of the fill pipe when the delivery truck'shose is disconnected from the fill pipe. Most of these releases go unreporteddue to the typically small volume of product lost (generally, less thanthe volume of the delivery truck's hose). Most excavated bare steel tanks,however, show evidence of spilled material, such as dissolved asphalt coatingnear the fill pipe. Regulatory officials in Dade County (Florida) citespills and overfills as the primary cause of release_45 percent of reportedreleases. These surface releases are at least twice as numerous as tankor piping releases. Spills most often occur at the fill pipe opening when the delivery truck'shose is disconnected, usually releasing only a few gallons. Overfills occurfar less frequently but usually release much larger volumes. Overfillsgenerally result in a release from loose, nonoperational components locatedabove the tanks (as discussed in the previous section), or from the topof the tank's vent pipe as product is forced out during overfilling ofthe system. Experienced installation contractors emphasize to EPA thatthe control of spills and control of overfills are two different problemsand equipment that controls one may not control the other. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Industry Codes and Practices </ITAG>In the preamble to the proposed rule (52 FR 12670), EPA identified numerousindustry consensus codes and recommended practices that influenced thedevelopment of the proposed regulatory program. A table was provided listingseveral codes and practices concerning the proper management of UST systemsthat have been developed, mostly in the past decade, by industry associations,nationally recognized professional organizations, and independent testinglaboratories. Since the proposal of the Federal rule over a year ago, theseconsensus code-making groups and industry standard-setting activities havecontinued at an increased rate. (Refer to section IV.H.1. for a more detaileddiscussion clarifying the use of codes developed by nationally recognizedorganizations or independent testing laboratories.) Table 1 reflects a sampling of the current status of this national consensuscode-making network. The codes and standards marked with an asterisk havebeen reviewed, updated, or revised over the past year. For example, lastsummer, the American Petroleum Institute reviewed several of its recommendedpractices (e.g., API 1631 and 1615) and improved the guidance providedin these documents. In addition, several new codes are now under developmentor have been recently added. For example, the National Leak PreventionAssociation was formed and developed an industry consensus code for theinterior lining of tanks (NLPA 631). <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 004 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus(s) 037-040 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C  </ITAG>Table 1 provides a snapshot of the depth and scope of the collective wisdomthat has developed over the past several years in the United States concerningthe proper standards for UST systems. The recent updates and additionsto this list of industry consensus codes and recommended practices reflectwhat appears to be a resurgence of interest in several areas of sound USTmanagement practices. Numerous commenters on the proposal cited specificdevelopments in these consensus codes and provided copies of some of themost recent codes that were added or updated and revised. In general, theyprovided a reminder to EPA that this improving body of knowledge shouldbe understood and considered during the development of today s final rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Industry Trends </ITAG>The nature and extent of the public response to the proposal has generallyconfirmed that a significant level of voluntary industry upgrading andreplacement programs is already underway. The closure and replacement trendsbriefly discussed in the preamble to the proposal (52 FR 12671) were confirmedby some commenters. Numerous major oil companies, independent marketersof retail motor fuel, transportation fleet operators (government and private),and various manufacturers with USTs have clearly embarked on their ownUST system management programs before promulgation of today's final rule.One of the most encouraging trends has been the increasing use of protectedUST systems nationwide. EPA estimates that there are currently over 450,000UST systems in use today that are protected from external corrosion. Thisexpanding use of an important and necessary approach to the preventionof releases has increased rapidly over the past three years, particularlyafter the Interim Prohibition went into effect in May 1985 (section 9003(g)of RCRA), making illegal the installation of bare steel UST systems. EPAestimates that, during the past three years over 50,000 new protected tankswere installed annually. To date, over 210,000 FRP tanks, 120,000 coatedand cathodically protected tanks, and 65,000 steel-FRP composite tankshave been installed. In addition, an estimated 70,000 tanks have had theirinteriors lined to prevent releases, and another 50,000 UST systems areestimated to have been provided with field-installed corrosion protectionsystems. According to tank manufacturers, the number of new bare steeltanks installed over the past three years has dropped precipitously. Early findings from several local UST programs visited by EPA staff sincethe proposal have confirmed the beginnings of an accelerated rate of closureof old, substandard UST systems (for example, in Suffolk County, New York;Austin, Texas; Dade County, Florida; and Sunnyvale, California). A rapidrate of closure appears to manifest itself when each of these, and severalother, local UST programs initiate their release detection requirements.Thus, EPA's earlier projections that as much as three-fourths of the existingUST universe will be closed, upgraded, or replaced to the requirementsof the Interim Prohibition within 10 years appears to be realistic (52FR 12671). Today's final rule will further ensure that these positive changesare accomplished and increased. EPA believes these are important developments because the successful implementationof this program depends a great deal on the regulated community's voluntarycompliance. The Agency is convinced that the most widespread compliancewill be facilitated by technically sound standards that are capable ofeasy implementation by a highly varied regulated community. Thus, as muchas possible, the Federal technical requirements must rely on familiar industrycodes and build on recognized and effective trends occurring in the fieldof UST management that are consistent with protection of human health andthe environment. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. UST System Technology Development </ITAG>As discussed in the preamble to the proposal, the array of technical controloptions available to address causes of releases, as well as response toreleases that occur, also appears to be growing. Numerous commenters providedtechnical information to EPA about newly available equipment being marketedfor use in the prevention, detection, and correction of releases from USTsystems. New equipment for use either inside or outside of the UST systemto detect releases from the underground tank or attached piping is beingintroduced for sale at many trade shows and industry fairs nationwide,including less expensive methods for providing secondary containment withinterstitial monitoring for both existing and new UST systems. Several new types of equipment capable of preventing spills and overfillsappear to be less costly and more easily retrofitted to existing tanksthan earlier models. For example, several new models of line leak detectorshave recently been introduced to the UST market that are more sophisticatedand sensitive than older types of equipment. In addition, numerous companieshave contacted EPA about their development efforts in the area of retrofittingpreventive devices onto existing tanks or refurbishing old tanks. Makersof nylon tanks are in the process of soliciting the approval of UnderwritersLaboratories of Canada in that country. Finally, vapor gas vacuum extractiontechniques for use in the subsurface cleanup of volatile substances arealso under accelerated development and investigative use in several placesnationwide. This cleanup technique has reportedly had widespread use inWest Germany for a number of years. In summary, business in the UST control technology sector appears to bebooming, and invention is proceeding at a rapid pace. All this activityis a good indication that in the future, simpler, cheaper, and more dependableequipment will be produced to aid in the prevention, detection, and correctionof releases. Experienced persons in UST management in the public and privatesectors have told EPA staff that the current level of control technologydevelopment by far exceeds any previous efforts within this industry. Inorder to avoid interfering with this ongoing development of innovativeand more environmentally protective new technologies, the Agency has chosento write regulations that allow room for these new developments. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Leaking USTs Present a Unique Regulatory Challenge </ITAG>EPA believes its approach to setting standards for UST systems on a nationalscale will have to be different from most national environmental programsbecause the UST problem is significantly different. This difference ismainly due to three factors: The large number of facilities to be regulated,the comprehensive scope of the regulations, and the nature of the regulatedcommunity. The most significant problem is the sheer size of the regulated community.Nationally, over 700,000 UST facilities account for about 2 million USTsystems, an average per state of about 14,000 UST facilities and 40,000UST systems. Estimates indicate that roughly 75 percent of existing USTsystems are unprotected from corrosion. In addition, because a relativelyhigh proportion of UST facilities (10 to 30 percent) already have had aleak, or will soon leak unless measures are taken to upgrade them, theaverage number of leaking UST systems may range from 1,400 to 4,200 perstate in the near future. The large number of tank owners and tank systems has also led EPA to concludethat the final federal UST standards must include a phase-in period forcertain requirements that apply to existing tank systems. Although allfederal requirements are in effect immediately for new tanks, owners andoperators will have additional time to upgrade existing tank systems tothe corrosion protection standard for new UST systems, and to install releasedetection equipment for existing UST systems. This phased-in approach isneeded to establish a reasonable schedule that recognizes the limited capabilityof 700,000 UST owners and supporting service and manufacturing industriesto respond immediately to new national regulations, and provides sufficientflexibility for implementing agencies. The experience of states that havealready been operating UST regulatory programs is that it takes severalyears for most owners or operators of existing UST systems to understand,plan, and arrange for the purchase, scheduling, and installation of necessaryservices and equipment required by the regulations. The phase-in approachalso has the added benefit of allowing time for continued development andimprovement of available technologies in the marketplace for preventionand detection of releases from UST systems (as discussed previously inthis section of the preamble). In addition, today's final rule establishes comprehensive requirementsfor the management of a wide range of UST systems. These final standardsfor UST systems are designed to reduce the number of releases of petroleumand hazardous substances, increase the ability to quickly detect and minimizethe contamination of soil and ground water by such releases, and ensureadequate cleanup of contamination. To do this, the standards in some waymust affect every phase of the life cycle of a storage tank system: Selectionof the tank system; installation, operation and maintenance; closure anddisposal; and cleanup of the site in cases of product release. As a result,these standards must be technically adequate to ensure the wide array andneeded level of improved performance when implemented. At the same time,these wide ranging requirements must be straightforward enough to be understoodand to be carried out successfully hundred of thousands of times nationwide.A third problem is the nature of the regulated community. A large proportionof USTs are owned by small businesses with $500,000 or less in total assets.For example, 72 percent of all retail motor fuel outlets are owned by smallbusinesses. An important influence in the making of today's technical standardshas been EPA's attempt to minimize the regulatory impact on small businesseswithout compromising the statutory requirements to protect human healthand the environment. EPA's efforts to minimize the regulatory impact arediscussed in a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis conducted for this rule,as specified by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, and a summary ofthat analysis is presented later in this preamble. Specifically, the Agency is convinced that the national UST standards mustbe kept simple and implementable by state and local officials because manyUST facilities are owned and operated as small local businesses, such as``Mom and Pop'' gasoline service stations and convenience stores. Thesesmall entrepreneurs, who are used to operating their business with minimalregulation, will be significantly affected by environmental regulationsfor UST systems. The experience of state and local agencies with UST programsis that large national businesses that own tanks are generally willingand have already begun to comply with UST requirements. Owners of smallbusinesses, however, generally need constant reminders and technical assistanceto bring them into compliance. Given the nature of this regulated community,a regulatory program often will be most effectively carried out by thelevel of government closest to the problem, and thus able to respond quicklyand to create a visible presence. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Emerging State and Local UST Programs and EPA's Approach to Regulation</ITAG>Many states and localities have adopted requirements applicable to USTsystems. Although these state and local requirements are diverse and varyin stringency, EPA believes that the formulation of federal standards shouldbuild upon the many effective state and local programs now in operationor about to begin operating in order to utilize this reservoir of accumulatedUST experience in a way that can rapidly develop into a strong federal-statepartnership for addressing this national concern. Section 9004 also indicatesCongressional intent that states with effective programs are to play amajor role in implementing the program. At least 18 states and hundreds of local programs are currently addressingthe ground-water contamination and cleanup problems posed by leaking USTsystems through established regulatory programs. Several states, such asCalifornia, New York, and Florida, and local UST programs such as thosein Suffolk County (New York), Dade County (Florida), and Austin (Texas),have established specific UST system regulations that include standardsfor design, construction, and installation of new UST systems; closure,retrofitting, and repair of existing UST systems; and release detectionand corrective action requirements for all UST systems. EPA believes thistype of state and local UST program activity nationwide will increase significantlywith today's promulgation of EPA's technical standards. Similar to theexperiences in the three lead states identified above, other states willbegin to wrestle for the first time with the reality of how to implementtheir UST programs. As the dangers posed by existing UST systems becomemore widely known, local UST programs and involvement should increase significantlyover current levels. Given the large number of UST facilities, tank systems, and potential cleanupsneeded, EPA is convinced that many aspects of this regulatory program willbe most effectively carried out at the state level of government. Localgovernment involvement in this regulatory program will be important. Forexample, a small city with about 700 facilities and 2,000 tank systemswithin its jurisdiction should be able to implement a manageable regulatoryprogram. If each of those 700 facilities installs one new tank during thenext five years, that would be about three installations per week. If thatsmall city requires a city inspector to be present at each installation,an inspector must be in the field three times a week for this task alone.In addition, the inspector could be required to be present for periodictank testings, closures, upgrading or retrofit, and cleanups. Confronted with the above implementation realities, EPA has developed amore decentralized approach for addressing the realities of the nationalUST regulatory program. This approach is based on several critical factors.First, as more and more state and local governments become involved, thework of the UST program must be routinely carried out in thousands of jurisdictionsnationwide. Several operating state and local UST programs already reportthat they are very busy ``running the store,'' expressing surprise at thesize of the regulated community, and that fairly simple tasks must be routinelyrepeated numerous times for the implementing agency to be successful inbringing UST systems into, and maintaining, compliance. Second, visits to several state and local UST programs have shown thatthey have often developed their own unique requirements and methods ofimplementation, adapted to the types of tanks, physical environment, andregulated community with which they are concerned while they are, at thesame time, all geared toward solving similar technical problems. They needthe flexibility to continue and to improve upon approaches which addressthe specific environmental needs of their communities. They have commonimplementation problems, however, and have expressed the need for bettertechnical aids, such as data management tools. Third, many state and local governments that already implement UST programsreport a significant level of visible on-site monitoring, requiring a constant``regulatory presence'' to effectively ensure this regulated community'scompliance with UST requirements. A significant environmental gain is achievedthrough implementation at the local level by these individual UST programs.Thus, improving their performance will produce maximum environmental benefitsand best ensure the success of the UST program nationwide. As the headof the ``distribution system'' of UST-related technical information andimplementation tools, EPA believes that its implementation efforts shouldbe focused on serving the network of state and local programs through listeningto their concerns and helping them solve implementation problems with toolsthat improve the effectiveness of their programs. Finally, EPA believes that a more decentralized approach to the federalimplementation of the UST program is needed to ensure real gains in protectionof human health and the environment. Because there are so many UST sitesnationwide, it would be very difficult to establish a credible federalimplementation presence through compliance monitoring and enforcement atthe federal level. A more realistic and effective approach is for EPA toprovide support tools and guidance to state and local regulators that canbe used to improve their programs compliance performance. In adopting this role, the Agency has recognized that it must not onlyestablish sound national standards but, more importantly, must focus onimproving the performance of the state and local implementing agencies.Approval of state programs to operate ``in lieu of'' the federal programtakes on a new meaning under this approach because it becomes a basic soundnesstest to ensure that the work associated with implementation of these stateor local requirements will, in fact, cause the needed level of improvementin UST system management when carried out by the regulated community. Therequisite state enforcement authority and technical standards must be ensuredand will be the focus for approval by EPA. Thus, overall successful performanceand implementation of this new national program is less focused on implementingdetailed, national technical standards than it is on establishing the nationalUST program in a way that ensures effective, environmentally protectiveprograms at the grassroots level and improving the performance of theseprograms over time. EPA's final requirements for state program approvalare presented in detail elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Thus, in recognition of its approach to UST implementation, EPA has attemptedto establish final technical standards that are protective of health andthe environment but, at the same time, are simple, understandable and implementableby state and local officials. EPA also recognizes that there is often morethan one proper way to address specific technical problems that are thefocus of the final regulations. Therefore, the Agency has attempted toidentify and offer as many effective alternative technical approaches aspossible particularly where this flexibility can be applied in the futureby the implementing agencies. In this way, the final technical requirementsremain focused on the key environmental problems which the implementingagencies face. Promoting the network of state and local implementationis the best way to ensure that significant protection of human health andthe environment will be achieved by today's final requirements. G. Conclusions Since Proposal EPA has drawn several conclusions from the influences discussed above andin the background sections of the preamble to the proposed rule (52 FR12663-12671). Some of these conclusions support the direction and emphasisset forth in the proposal, and others indicate a need for change in thefinal rule. Given the large size of the existing regulated universe and the proportionof these UST systems that have leaked or are presently leaking, there isa need to finalize today's rules as an important step to alleviate thisimportant threat to the nation's ground-water resources. The number ofsites needing significant cleanup due to a number of poor past UST managementpractices is expected to be in the tens of thousands nationwide.Cause-of-release information related to unprotected tanks supports EPA'sproposed approach for upgrading of unprotected tanks. The new information,however, indicates a need for more frequent monitoring of unprotected tanksthan was proposed. By contrast, protected tanks appear to need less frequentmonitoring than proposed. Also, pressurized piping systems need more stringentmonitoring than was proposed. Increased activity in the review and improvement of national consensuscodes supports EPA's proposed reliance on these codes as providing themost up-to-date consensus practices and expertise concerning what constitutesproper UST system management. The nationwide increase in the use of protectedsystems, the recent number of tank closures, and the development of newprevention, detection, and corrective action technologies are encouraging.The final rules must be designed to foster and take advantage of thesetrends. They must be simple and easily implementable by the regulated communityto ensure the maximum level of voluntary participation by tank system ownersand operators. The Agency continues to believe that the size and natureof this regulated universe presents several unique regulatory challengesthat necessitate the phase-in of some of the requirements for existingUST systems to ensure that genuine implementation is accomplished. The continuing and rapid emergence of numerous state and local UST programsis expected and will be encouraged by EPA because this is where the ``realwork'' of this new national program must actually take place. The Agency'sapproach to UST program implementation must start with a technically soundset of national standards. These requirements, however, must be kept simpleand implementable because most improvements in actual UST performance (andprotection of human health and the environment) are expected to be achievedby working closely with state and local governments over time to increasethe level of the effectiveness of their UST programs. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Today's Final Rule </ITAG>This section provides a summary of EPA's final rule. It also identifiesand describes several major points of departure from the proposed rule,several alternative strategies, public comments on them, and the Agency'srationale for the direction of the final rule in several other key areas.More detailed summaries of all the public comments and the Agency's responsesto them can be found in the ``Comment and Response Summaries BackgroundDocument'' that has been placed into the public docket in support of today'sfinal rule. A. Summary of Today's Final Rule EPA is today promulgating regulations for underground tanks storing eitherpetroleum or hazardous substances other than hazardous wastes regulatedunder Subtitle C of RCRA. These requirements establish measures for bothnew and existing UST systems to prevent, detect, and clean up releasesfrom these systems. These final requirements of Part 280 fulfill the mandatesof RCRA sections 9003 (a), (c), and (e), and sections 9009 (a) and (b).The major elements of today's final rule are noted below. andbullet; New UST systems must be designed and constructed to retain theirstructural integrity for their operating life, in accordance with nationalconsensus codes of practice (see Table 1 provided earlier in this preamble).All tanks and attached piping used to deliver the stored product must beprotected from external corrosion. Cathodic protection must be monitoredand maintained to ensure that UST systems remain free of corrosion. andbullet; Nationally recognized industry installation standards must befollowed in placing new UST systems in service (see Table 1). Owners andoperators of new USTs must certify that proper installation procedureswere followed and identify how the installation was accomplished. andbullet; Owners and operators of both new and existing UST systems mustfollow proper tank filling practices to prevent releases due to spillsand overfills. In addition, owners and operators of either new or upgradedUST systems must use devices that prevent overfills and control or containspills. andbullet; Tanks must be repaired in accordance with nationally recognizedindustry codes (see Table 1). These national codes include several teststhat must be conducted to ensure quality repairs. andbullet; To close UST systems, industry-recommended practices must be followed:the UST system can be removed from the ground or left in place after removingall regulated substances and cleaning the tank, filling it with an inertsubstance, and closing it to all future outside access (see Table 1). Inaddition, owners and operators must perform an assessment at the time ofUST closure to ensure that a release has not occurred at the site. If arelease has occurred, then corrective action must be taken. andbullet; Release detection must be instituted at all UST systems. For petroleumUST systems, several methods will be allowed, although tank owners andoperators must adhere to requirements concerning their use. In addition,owners and operators must follow special requirements for pressurized deliverylines. Petroleum UST systems are not required to have secondary containmentwith interstitial monitoring. All new or upgraded UST systems storing hazardoussubstances, however, are required to have secondary containment with interstitialmonitoring, unless an alternate release detection method is approved bythe implementing agency. The owners and operators must demonstrate to theimplementing agency that a release detection method will detect releasesof the stored substance in a manner no less stringent than the releasedetection methods allowed for petroleum USTs and that a method of correctiveaction is available to clean up a release of the hazardous substance shouldone occur. andbullet; Generally, release detection at existing UST systems must be phasedin over a 5-year period based on the age of the tank. The oldest UST systems(usually unprotected from corrosion) are required to phase in release detectionwithin 1 year, and the newest tank systems (usually protected from corrosion)by the end of the 5-year period. Release detection for all pressurizeddelivery lines must be retrofitted within 2 years. andbullet; Periodic tank tightness testing (every 5 years) combined withmonthly inventory control is allowed at new or upgraded UST systems for10 years after new tank installation or existing tank upgrade. After 10years, monthly release detection is required. andbullet; Either monthly release detection or a combination of annual tanktightness testing with monthly inventory control is required of substandardexisting USTs until they are upgraded. Existing UST systems must be upgradedor closed within 10 years of the effective date of the final rule, or within1 to 5 years if a release detection method is not available that can beapplied during the required phase-in period for release detection. Upgradingof petroleum UST systems includes retrofitting of corrosion protectionand both spill and overfill controls at all tanks. Upgrading of hazardoussubstance UST systems also includes secondary containment and interstitialmonitoring or an alternate release detection method approved by the implementingagency.andbullet; Tank owners and operators must report suspected releases. Indicationsof a release must be reported to the implementing agency, including positiveresults from release detection methods, unless the initial cause of thealarm has been immediately investigated and the alarm is found to be false.After reporting suspected releases, owners and operators must perform releaseinvestigation and confirmation tests and, where a release is confirmedmust begin corrective action. andbullet; Owners and operators of leaking UST systems must follow measuresfor corrective action. Immediate corrective action measures include mitigationof safety and fire hazards; removal of saturated soils and floating freeproduct; and an assessment of the extent of further corrective action needed.A corrective action plan would be required for long-term cleanups addressingground-water contamination, although these cleanups could begin upon notificationof the implementing agency by the owner and operator. Cleanup levels wouldbe established on a site-by-site basis as approved by the implementingagency. B. Major Points of Departure from April 17 Proposal Today's final rule includes four release detection requirements that representsignificant changes to the proposed rule: (1) More frequent tank tightness testing (annual) of unprotected tanksduring the initial 10-year upgrading period; (2) Less frequent monitoring of new and upgraded tanks until age 10; (3) Phase-in of release detection over 5 years at existing tanks basedon age; and (4) More stringent release detection for all pressurized piping systems.The final requirements in each of these areas, and EPA's rationale forrevising the proposal, are summarized below and shown graphically in Figure3. The shaded areas indicate the major changes from the proposed approach.More detailed discussions of these major points of departure are also providedin later sections of today's preamble. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus(s) 059 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. More Frequent Tank Tightness Testing of Existing Unprotected TanksDuring the 10-Year Upgrade Period </ITAG>In the proposed rule (andSection;andSection; 280.40 and 280.41), EPA providedowners and operators of existing UST systems without corrosion protectionwith two options for release detection, but only during the proposed 10-yearupgrade period. The two options were: (1) To perform monthly release detectionmonitoring or, (2) to conduct monthly inventory control combined with atank tightness test every 3 years. The option of tank tightness testing(in combination with inventory control) was proposed because tightnesstesting is already widely practiced. The proposed frequency of testingevery 3 years was based on the Agency's belief that the industry couldnot accomplish testing of such a large universe of existing tanks on amore frequent basis because the supply of testing services could not respondto such a large demand. Several commenters suggested that the proposed tank tightness testing alternativebe allowed in the final rule but only if the testing were required morefrequently. EPA now shares the concerns of those commenters. The Agencyis particularly concerned about unprotected existing tanks, which havethe greatest probability of leaking. New information on causes of releasehas prompted the Agency to believe that tightness testing conducted onceevery 3 years leaves too much time between tests during which an unprotectedsteel tank may develop corrosion holes and release product. Therefore,in the final rule the Agency requires that tank testing be performed everyyear during the 10-year upgrade period, instead of every third year aswas proposed. Because unprotected steel tank systems pose the greatestthreat to the environment and public health, EPA believes that increasingthe frequency of tightness testing will provide better environmental protectionand is therefore warranted. With regard to EPA's initial concern that such a frequency would be impracticalor difficult to achieve, numerous public comments were received from therelease detection industry indicating their belief that more frequent tanktightness testing is feasible. Commenters also verified that tank tightnesstesting is already a commonly used release detection method, and its technologyand resources are currently widely available. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Less Frequent Monitoring of New and Upgraded Tanks Until Age 10</ITAG>EPA's proposed approach for new USTs required either frequent-to-continuous(at least monthly) release detection monitoring or semiannual tank tightnesstesting in combination with monthly inventory control. The Agency proposedfrequent-to-continuous monitoring at new tanks because, the more frequentlyrelease detection is applied, the more likely an actual release will bedetected when it occurs, as explained in detail in the proposal (52 FR12720), and thus it was believed to be needed to ensure adequate protectionof the environment and public health. Several commenters questioned the proposal to require more frequent releasedetection at new protected tanks than at existing (older) unprotected tanks.New information on causes of release (see section II.F. of the preamble)confirms that new tanks are the least likely to leak. The probability ofnew or upgraded tanks leaking, particularly early in their operationallifetime, is extremely low. Therefore, the Agency agrees with commenterswho suggested that new tanks should be allowed to be monitored less oftenthan proposed. Today's final rule replaces the proposed semiannual tank testing with arequirement to conduct tank testing at least every fifth year during thefirst 10 years of the UST's operational life at a new or upgraded UST.As proposed, however, tank testing must be used in combination with monthlyinventory control to be considered an approved release detection method.Because long-term experience with tank corrosion protection technologyis not yet extensive, and because existing bare steel tanks rarely failbefore 10 years of age, today's final rule requires monthly release detectionat protected and upgraded tanks only after they pass their tenth year ofoperation. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Gradual Phase-in of Release Detection Based on Age </ITAG>EPA proposed to phase in release detection at existing UST systems overa 3-year period for USTs unprotected from corrosion and a 5-year periodfor USTs protected from corrosion. This approach was proposed because itwas believed to be the fastest schedule reasonably implementable and wouldrequire unprotected tanks (which have the greatest potential to leak) tohave release detection in place sooner than protected tanks. In the preambleto the proposal (52 FR 12677), the Agency identified three approaches towardsphasing in of release detection: (1) A rapid phase-in (over 1 to 2 years),(2) a gradual phase-in (over 3 to 5 years), and (3) a class approach requiringa rapid phase-in at the most sensitive UST locations and more gradual phase-inelsewhere. After considering public comments received on this issue, theAgency has decided in today's final rule to retain the gradual phase-inapproach but to base the phase-in on the age of the UST system, with theoldest tanks being required to have release detection first. The preamble to the proposal solicited public comment on the appropriatenessof considering tank age, vulnerability of hydrogeology, distance to drinkingwater wells, distance to vital ecological systems, and any other factorsin the selection of a phase-in approach for release detection. Most commenterssupported the gradual phase-in to take place over time periods rangingfrom 3 to 10 years, but recommended that it be based on age. A few recommendedthe rapid phase-in approach, and most of those recommended that the phase-inbe based on age. Today's final rule requires the oldest tanks, with or without corrosionprotection, to apply release detection within the first year and the newesttanks no later than 5 years after the effective date of today's rule. Thisapproach is believed to offer several advantages: (1) EPA has concludedthat the phasing in of release detection at all existing UST systems inthe large universe is implementable within 5 years; (2) the age-based sequencingschedule ensures that implementation of the requirements will take placein an orderly fashion that will spread out the demand for release detectionservices and avoid bottlenecks; (3) it gives higher priority to older,unprotected tanks, which have been found to have the greatest potentialto leak; and (4) it still allows the newer, protected tanks, which arethe least likely to be leaking, to wait until the fifth year, as did theproposed rule. In choosing the gradual approach, the Agency agrees withthose commenters who cited the rapid approach as being impossible to implementwith such a large universe of UST systems. In addition, the gradual approachis supported by numerous existing industry, state, and local managementprograms which utilize the gradual approach as the most feasible phase-inapproach. The reasons the Agency is taking this gradual phase-in approachare discussed in more detail later in this preamble (section IV.D.2.).The class approach was deemed unimplementable for other reasons discussedin more detail later in this section of the preamble.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. More Stringent Requirements for Pressurized Piping </ITAG>The proposed rule contained release detection requirements for pressurizedpiping in addition to those requirements for new tank systems. Specifically,automatic release detection and shutoff devices were proposed for the pressurizedpiping at new tank systems unless continuous release detection or interstitialmonitoring was installed. Suction piping systems were exempt from the proposedrequirements if other minimum construction requirements were met (see 52FR 12774). Information obtained by the Agency at the time of the proposalindicated that 20 to 30 percent of all reported releases are due to pipingfailures. EPA also suspected that pressurized piping systems, which arereportedly the most commonly used withdrawal system at new retail motorfuel installations, were responsible for the larger releases. Information obtained by EPA after publication of the proposal (see sectionII.F. of today's preamble) indicates that piping system failures are responsiblefor a much greater percentage (80 to 85 percent) of release incidents thanpreviously thought. Public comments received by EPA confirmed the Agency'sbelief that failure of pressurized piping systems frequently results inlarge releases. In today's rule, EPA has set forth more stringent release detection requirementsfor pressurized piping systems. Systems must be: (1) Equipped with automaticshutoff devices or automatic flow restrictors and use either annual linetesting or monthly release detection monitoring; or (2) have continuousinterstitial or vapor monitoring combined with either shutoff devices oralarms. These requirements will ensure that product releases from the mostvulnerable portion of the UST systems are minimized. (Today's preamblesection IV.D.3.b. discusses these requirements more fully.) C. Alternative Approaches Considered <ITAG tagnum="81">1. New UST Systems Containing Petroleum </ITAG>In the preamble to the proposed rule (52 FR 12673-12675), EPA describedthree basic regulatory options that were considered for new petroleum tanks:(1) Protected single-walled tanks with release detection; (2) secondarycontainment with interstitial monitoring; and (3) a class approach underwhich more protective requirements would apply to UST systems located wherea release could pose a particularly high risk. The Agency solicited commentson each of these general approaches to regulate new petroleum tanks, andannounced that, based on comments received and on any additional data gatheredprior to promulgation, it would give further consideration to each of thembefore finalizing today's rules. Numerous comments were received concerningthese options, and EPA developed additional information after the proposalthat is relevant to this issue. (EPA solicited comment on this new informationin the December 23, 1987, Supplemental Notice and in the March 31, 1988,Notice of Availability.) Based on EPA' s information and on public comment, the Agency has decidedto proceed with the proposed approach of protected single-walled tankswith release detection for new petroleum UST systems. The Agency's basicrationale for this choice as explained in the preamble of the proposalremains unchanged. The following discussion briefly highlights some ofthe concerns raised by commenters and the influences that the new informationhad on this final decision. a. Option 1: <T3>Protected Single-Walled Tanks With Release Detection. </T3>Severalcommenters supported EPA's proposed approach of allowing protected single-walledtanks with release detection to be used at all new petroleum UST systems.They agreed that this approach is protective of human health and the environment,confirmed that it is already widely in use by industry and in numerousstate programs, and that it is available as a viable and effective alternativeto interstitial monitoring. Some commenters, however, suggested that the approach of protected single-walledUST system with leak detection approach is not as implementable as secondarycontainment. They stated that secondary containment is a more straightforwardtechnical approach because, in the long run, it simplifies implementationby allowing relatively easy determination of the UST's compliance status.Another disagreement with this option is the belief expressed by some commentersthat the probability of releases to the environment occurring at single-walledtanks with release detection is much greater compared to UST systems withsecondary containment and interstitial monitoring. EPA agrees with those commenters who suggested that there will probablybe more releases to the environment from protected single-walled UST systemswith release detection than from systems equipped with interstitial monitoring.One of the advantages of secondary containment is the potential for detectinga leak before a release to the environment actually occurs. Secondary containmentthus provides a second barrier against release. Although there are several reasons why EPA has not mandated secondary containmentwith interstitial monitoring at new petroleum UST systems, the most importantreason is that it is not believed to be necessary to protect human healthand the environment at such systems (in contrast to hazardous substanceUST systems, discussed in section III.C.3. below). The new causes of releaseinformation (discussed previously in today's preamble) shows that the useof new, protected, single-walled USTs has, so far, resulted in the virtualdisappearance of failures, because these new USTs have preventive controlsfor the main cause of past tank failures: Corrosion of unprotected, baresteel. This new information also revealed that protected UST piping thatis carefully installed and immediately tested is expected to significantlyreduce the occurrence of release incidents from this other major componentof the UST system (a reduction of at least two-thirds according to experiencedinstaller estimates). Piping failures will not, however, be prevented tothe same degree as tank failures. Thus, the Agency has concluded that petroleum releases will be dramaticallyreduced using protected UST systems. This fact must also be consideredwith the knowledge that numerous effective methods of release detectionare available and are being used at petroleum UST systems nationwide. Thesemethods of detection will enable actions to be taken that will minimizethe extent of the few releases that do occur. Also, the nature of petroleumproducts and the widely available technologies for their clean up providesthe means to ensure that adverse impacts from such releases (when theyoccur) can be managed and remediated. In consideration of all of the above factors, the Agency has concludedthat single-walled protected UST systems combined with the release detectionrequired today will adequately protect human health and the environment.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>As discussed earlier in this section of the preamble, today'sfinal approach to new petroleum UST systems has been further tailored toallow infrequent tightness testing of protected or upgraded tanks (combinedwith inventory control) for the first 10 years of their operating life,with more release monitoring required of the UST system piping_includingcontinuous monitoring of pressurized lines.</ITAG>b. Option 2: <T3>Secondary Containment With Interstitial Monitoring. </T3>Several commenterssupported the use of secondary containment with interstitial monitoringfor various reasons, including: Product releases would be completely containedand prevented from adversely impacting the environment and public health;it is a more rapid and reliable form of release detection; the cost iscomparable to single-walled UST systems with release detection; and theneed for conducting site assessments and corrective action would be avoided.Others, however, opposed its required use with new petroleum tanks forreasons such as: The greater capital and installation costs do not justifythe environmental gains that would be achieved (in comparison to the single-walledapproach); and this approach is not compatible with current trends in industrythat are well underway in upgrading existing UST systems. As previously stated, EPA agrees that secondary containment with interstitialmonitoring would most likely result in fewer releases to the environmentcompared to protected single-walled UST systems with release detection.UST systems having secondary containment and interstitial monitoring arenot perfect, however, and failures of these systems will also occur andresult in some releases into the environment that will have to be remediated.Although protected single-walled systems would result in more releases,the Agency has concluded that this increase is not a significant addedthreat to human health and the environment given that release detectionwill minimize the extent of these additional releases, and the availabilityof petroleum cleanup technologies is widespread and capable of alleviatingany resultant adverse impacts. In addition, the Agency is concerned thatmany owners and operators would delay upgrading their existing petroleumUST systems to the extent allowed by law or even to the point of noncompliance,because of the perception on the part of many commenters of the significanceof higher capital and installation costs that would result from requiringsecondary containment and interstitial monitoring (compared to protectedsingle-walled USTs with release monitoring).c. Option 3: <T3>Classification Approach. </T3>EPA recognized from the outset that releasesfrom petroleum UST systems located in certain sensitive areas pose a greaterrisk of harming human health and the environment than others. As a consequence,one of the regulatory options the Agency considered extensively in developingthe final rule was a federal classification approach based upon the potentialimpact of a release. Under this approach, a class or classes of UST systemslocated in high-risk areas would be subject to more protective requirementsthan UST systems located in less sensitive areas. Although the proposed baseline standards for prevention and detection ofreleases made no differentiation based on class, the Agency requested commentin the April 17 proposal on the general desirability and feasibility ofa classification approach to regulating UST systems. EPA also sought commenton a specific, two-tiered classification scheme. Under this scheme, ownersand operators of UST systems located in high-risk areas, defined as thearea within a specified distance of a public drinking-water well, wouldbe required to use secondary containment. The baseline standard of protected,single-walled tanks with release detection would be allowed in low-riskareas. EPA received several comments that favored or opposed inclusion of a federalclassification approach in the final rule. Several commenters in favorof a class approach suggested, and the Agency has considered since proposal,alternative regulatory schemes with respect to how requirements shoulddiffer among UST systems in different classes. The schemes examined includedaccelerating the schedule for upgrading of existing UST systems to newtank standards or for compliance of existing UST systems with release detectionrequirements in high-risk areas; imposing more stringent design requirements(e.g., secondary containment) in high-risk areas; and imposing more stringentdesign requirements in all areas except those designated as low risk bythe implementing agency. The Agency also explored several potential criteriaproposed by commenters for differentiating among classes. Hydrogeologiccriteria, such as proximity to ground water used for drinking water, wereconsidered most extensively. The criterion EPA selected for detailed analysiswas distance to a public water well. (For discussion of the results ofthe analysis see the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Technical Regulations.)As pointed out by several commenters, the concept of a classification approachto regulating UST systems is appealing for many reasons. Because the potentialimpact of a release is greater in more sensitive areas, a classificationapproach tailors the level of protection to the risk posed in a particulararea. EPA's analyses of various classification schemes indicated that,without considering the costs of implementation, the benefits of a classificationapproach, primarily in terms of corrective action costs avoided, couldbe significant. Cleanup of contamination is especially difficult and expensivein sensitive areas, such as where ground water used for drinking wateris affected. Classification could also provide a priority-setting schemefor enforcement and corrective action. Despite the advantages, EPA has not included a classification approachin the final rule. Commenters' arguments against a Federal classificationapproach influenced the Agency's decision. EPA agrees with commenters thatthe baseline requirements set by the final rule will adequately protectthe environment in all areas while also encouraging timely voluntary complianceby avoiding unnecessary additional complexity and providing reasonableflexibility for UST system owners and operators. Although EPA supportsthe concept of differential protection based on the potential impact ofa release, the Agency believes that, for this program, classification atthe Federal level is neither feasible nor practical. EPA is particularlyconcerned about the potential hindrance to state program approval and thedifficulties of implementing a classification approach at the federal level.Due to the size and nature of the community to be regulated, the successof this program depends largely upon implementation at the state and locallevels. Most states, however, have not developed classification systems.Development of appropriate and workable classification schemes could takesignificant time and resources given the number of environmental and otherfactors that must be considered. The Agency is concerned that the stepsnecessary to define criteria and then identify high-risk and low-risk areasin states that have not yet done so could delay implementation of the programand divert scarce resources from efforts to achieve the improvements ofthe baseline UST regulatory requirements, which will provide most of thebenefits. This additional complication may discourage states from seekingapproval altogether. The Agency has concluded that the potential reluctanceof states to implement this program as a consequence of requiring a classificationapproach could result in less successful protection of the environmentand human health. In addition, even without implementation delays, a federal classificationscheme is not likely to provide significant real additional protection.Several commenters stated (and the Agency has concluded) that, at the federallevel, any criteria used to classify would have to be simple (such as specifieddistance to a water well) because implementation of a classification schemebased on more complex criteria would not be feasible. Yet, given the diversehydrogeologic conditions that exist in the United States, no single, simpleclassification criterion would be appropriate everywhere. For example,a distance to drinking-water well criterion, as presented in the preambleto the proposal, is meaningless in locations such as Phoenix, Arizona,where the depth to ground water is so great that releases from UST systemswill rarely contaminate drinking-water wells; or in places like Dade County,Florida, where ground water may move so fast that a release could travelthe standard distance within a short period of time. Because defining andidentifying high-risk areas is so highly dependent on local (site-specific)hydrogeologic and other factors, EPA believes that state and local implementingagencies can make the most meaningful determinations of classes. Although the Agency has concluded that a classification approach at thefederal level is neither feasible nor desirable, EPA believes that a classificationapproach to regulating UST systems at the state or local levels, wherelocal environmental conditions are better known, may be both feasible andappropriate. Under today's approach, the Agency allows but does not requirestates to use a classification approach if it is appropriate for the conditionsin the state. For example, states that have already developed a classificationscheme may decide to use it to regulate USTs. For such states, the potentialdifficulties associated with implementing a classification approach toregulating UST systems may be significantly reduced. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Existing UST Systems Containing Petroleum </ITAG>a. <T3>Mandatory Upgrading or Replacement of Substandard UST Systems. </T3>Inthe preamble to the proposal, the Agency identified four regulatory approachesto scheduling the upgrade or replacement of substandard existing UST systems:(1) Rapid upgrade or replacement (within 3 to 5 years of final rule promulgation),(2) gradual upgrade or replacement (within 6 to 12 years of final rulepromulgation), (3) no required upgrade or replacement, and (4) schedulingof upgrade/replacement based on a class approach (upgrade or replace tankslocated in environmentally vulnerable areas first). EPA proposed to implementscheduling of mandatory upgrade/replacement using the gradual approach(within 10 years after the effective date of the final rule) and has retainedthis requirement in today's final rule. Many commenters supported the proposed 10-year compliance period for thereasons identified in the preamble to the proposal (52 FR 12676). However,some recommended a shorter time period, stating their belief that industryresources could meet the demand and that a faster upgrading schedule wouldprevent a significant number of future product releases. In contrast, othercommenters suggested a longer compliance period than proposed and arguedthat more time was needed to become familiar with the UST regulations,that owners of multiple tank systems would not be able to finance upgrades/replacementsin 10 years or less, and that the service industry would need more timeto implement upgrades for this large universe of existing tank systems.As stated in the proposal, the Agency agrees that if upgrading could becompleted in the shorter compliance period (3 to 5 years) it would decreasethe number of product releases and thereby provide greater protection ofhuman health and the environment. However, the Agency also agrees withthose commenters who believe that the large number of existing UST systemsessentially precludes industry from implementing upgrade requirements fasterthan the proposed 10-year period. Furthermore, EPA is in agreement withmany of these same industry commenters who indicated that a 10-year complianceperiod is a reasonable time period and would not be overly burdensome.EPA is aware of numerous industry upgrading programs that have alreadystarted and will be completed within this time frame. EPA continues to believe that the alternative of not requiring upgrade/replacementof substandard systems is simply unacceptable because the Agency has concludedthat UST owners probably would not upgrade if it is not required. The universeof 1.4 to 2 million UST systems largely consists of unprotected, bare steeltanks. The new causes of release information summarized previously in thispreamble (and derived from the ``Causes of Release from UST Systems'' report)confirms that the unprotected segment of the UST universe is very likelyto leak due to corrosion and piping failures and, therefore, presents asignificant threat to the public health and environment. Historical tankreplacement rates, established trends in the closure of existing retailmotor fuel businesses over time, and the imposition of this new regulatoryprogram are expected together to result in rapid decrease in these substandardUST systems nationwide. However, a totally voluntary program of UST systemupgrading is not expected by EPA to result in the timely upgrade or replacementof UST systems on a nationwide basis, particularly given the large numberand heterogeneous nature of this universe of existing UST systems. In orderto ensure human health and the environment are protected, the Agency hasestablished a clear national goal of upgrading all substandard UST systemswithin 10 years that rejects a purely voluntary approach as inadequate.This goal is intended to prompt all UST owners and operators to plan forand undertake the upgrading steps that are needed to protect human healthand the environment. Another option considered by the Agency in development of the proposalwas to further require upgrade and replacement based on the use of a classapproach that scheduled more rapid UST system upgrades/replacements inthe most vulnerable areas (e.g., ecologically sensitive sites or sitesin close proximity to drinking water sources) while allowing other USTsystems to be phased in on a more gradual basis. Many commenters recommendedstaggering the implementation schedule for upgrade/replacement based onother factors (besides class) such as tank age, tank size and type, proximityto human populations, and the measured corrosivity of a site. The commonconcern among these commenters was that a staggered schedule would preventall owners from being allowed to wait until the last minute to bring theirexisting substandard tank systems into compliance and would, thereby, ensurea more even, implementable, and serviceable demand for tank upgrade/replacementover the 10-year period. The Agency has decided not to require the phase-in of upgrading based onthe class approach strategy, or on the basis of any other factor, for severalreasons. Although many factors on which to base tank upgrade/replacementhave been identified, because of the serious ramifications to the ownerand operator associated with the technical requirements for upgrading,EPA believes no single risk-based factor is appropriate or applicable tomandate nationwide for all existing UST systems. Today's general 10-yearrequirement in the final rule also allows implementing agencies in approvedstates, or under State law, the opportunity to decide the staggered scheduleon which upgrades should be conducted and what factor(s) are most applicableto their tank population. Regardless of what type of state action is taken,upgrading is already rapidly taking place through numerous industry programs.Today's final approach allows them to continue to use the numerous differentphase-in approaches that are already successfully underway. EPA believesthis flexibility should also encourage others to upgrade because they canset their own schedules to meet the 10-year deadline. Thus, EPA has concludedthat much of this regulated community will have completed these voluntaryprograms of closure and upgrading within the mandated 10-year period, and,therefore, the number of existing USTs that otherwise will have to be upgradedby the end of this upgrading period is expected to be relatively small.The implementation of today's final requirements for release detection(and the financial responsibility requirements to be provided later) arealso expected to prompt rapid upgrading and should work to ensure thatthe implementation difficulties at the end of the 10-year period that werecited by some commenters are not encountered due to a backlog of upgradingdemand. In summary, EPA believes that the 10-year upgrade requirement will notpresent an undue burden on industry and is implementable, but is neededto prompt a significant portion of this regulated community into makingthe upgrades and improvements necessary to protect human health and theenvironment. It will also provide industry and the states with some flexibilitythat will allow (and thereby encourage) them to determine their own approachesand schedules for ensuring tank upgrade/replacement programs are implementedexpeditiously within the nationally mandated timeframe. b. <T3>Methods of Release Detection. </T3>The majority of existing UST systemsare not currently being monitored for releases to the environment. Therefore,EPA continues to believe that a fundamental goal of today's regulatoryapproach must include the establishment of reliable release detection atall UST systems. In the proposal (52 FR 12676), the Agency required allexisting substandard UST systems to comply with one of the six releasedetection methods proposed for new USTs (52 FR 12713). The dual objectiveof this proposed approach was to allow for the continued development ofrelease detection technologies and also to ensure that only sound and reliablerelease detection methods were used. Particularly for petroleum UST systems,the Agency believed many releases would be detected if an appropriate methodwas selected and properly used. In the preamble to the proposal (52 FR 12676), EPA identified that a widevariety of release detection methods (applied either internally or externallyto the tank) were currently on the market but with limited data availableconcerning their performance. This lack of performance data and field experiencewas corroborated by many commenters. Although numerous comments were receivedregarding the release detection methods proposed (see section IV.D. oftoday's preamble for a summary and discussion of these comments), the Agencydid not receive any comments that opposed the general approach of mandatingthe use of at least one of the allowed methods at existing UST systems.Other commenters noted their successful use of different types of methods.Performance data obtained from commenters and from EPA-sponsored researchsince proposal support the Agency s decision to retain the proposed approachin the final rule. (EPA solicited public comment concerning this new informationon March 31, 1988; 52 FR 10403.) The Agency is convinced that the proposedrelease detection methods, when properly applied and performed as specifiedin the final rule, will successfully detect the large number of leaks believedto already have occurred. For example, over the past year in Californiaand Florida, several thousand UST system releases have been identifiedusing these methods of release detection, and there appear to be few instanceswhere releases have been later discovered through other means (e.g., off-siteimpacts) when release detection was being properly conducted at a site.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Hazardous Substance UST Systems </ITAG>UST systems containing hazardous substances were proposed to have secondarycontainment with interstitial monitoring unless the owner or operator obtaineda variance by demonstrating that another release detection method wouldbe effective in detecting releases of that substance from a single-walledUST (see 52 FR 12677, April 17, 1987). The reasons for selecting this proposedapproach were: (1) Information is not available on the applicability anddemonstrated reliability of release detection methods at most hazardoussubstance USTs, and (2) few industry and state and local agency UST programsyet apply to hazardous substance USTs and, thus, there is little collectiveexperience on management of such USTs. The Agency recognized that somerelease detection methods for petroleum UST systems might also performwell at some hazardous substance USTs. Hazardous substance USTs, however,store an array of individual chemical compounds that vary widely in theirphysical and chemical characteristics and that may not be readily or reliablydetected using release detection methods developed for single-walled USTsystems storing petroleum products. They also may not be able to be asreadily addressed by corrective action technologies that are already widelyavailable for petroleum releases. Therefore, the proposed approach requiredsecondary containment at all new hazardous substance UST systems, unlessowners and operators could demonstrate that an alternative release detectionmethod could be reliably applied and operated. Several commenters were opposed to the proposed secondary containment approachat new hazardous substances UST systems because: (1) They do not believethat chemicals designated as hazardous substances are any more hazardousthan petroleum products (and, therefore, should not have to meet more stringentrequirements), and (2) EPA has not provided a technically valid explanationof why single-walled USTs are appropriate for petroleum products but notfor hazardous substances. It was also suggested that, instead of havinga lengthy and costly variance procedure on a case-by-case basis, the Agencyshould incorporate a variance in the final rule for certain classes ofhazardous substances. The Agency has decided to retain secondary containment for all new hazardoussubstance USTs in today's final rule because EPA has not received any additionalinformation or data since proposal to convince the Agency that reliableand appropriate release detection methods are generally available for hazardoussubstance USTs. The Agency continues to believe that under certain conditions,hazardous substances will pose a greater risk to human health or the environmentthan petroleum products. Furthermore, there are proven, reliable and availablerelease detection methods and cleanup technologies for petroleum, whereasthe applications of these same release detection methods and cleanup technologiesare neither proven nor available for hazardous substances. Also retained in the final rule is the proposed exception for those ownersand operators who, by means of a variance, can demonstrate that a releasedetection method (other than interstitial monitoring) can be successfullyinstalled and operated at a specific hazardous substance UST system todetect releases of the stored substance. An additional requirement in thefinal rule is that an owner and operator must also demonstrate that a correctiveaction method is available to clean up the release. The Agency decidednot to structure the variance procedure by classes of hazardous substancesbecause physical properties of chemicals within a class can be quite variable(for example, wide ranges in solubility and volatility) and require differentcorrective action approaches, and one release detection method would notreliably detect all of the chemicals within that class. (A more detaileddiscussion on the final rule regarding hazardous substance USTs is presentedin section IV.D. of today's preamble.) A detailed discussion of the methods of release detection allowed for existingpetroleum UST systems is also presented in section IV.D. of today's preamble.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Corrective Action </ITAG>An important facet of today's final strategy for regulating undergroundstorage tanks is to ensure that public and private drinking water suppliesare protected, and that necessary steps are taken to abate other healthand safety threats (such as fires and explosions) due to present and futurereleases from UST systems. As described previously in this preamble, tensof thousands of UST systems are believed to have already leaked substantialquantities of regulated substances into the environment and numerous publicand private wells have already been threatened or destroyed. As discussedin the preamble to the proposal (52 FR 12678), the development of a regulatoryprogram for corrective action started with three assumptions: (1) The needto implement the requirements through the extensive participation of stateand local UST programs; (2) the approach taken must be able to work asthe nature of the UST corrective action problem changes over time; and(3) a process must be set up that ensures owners and operators get quicklyto the task of cleaning up all releases, although the completion of correctiveaction may take a long period of time at any one site. The proposal provided for separate but very similar corrective action processesfor UST systems that contain petroleum and those that contain hazardoussubstances. In the proposal, the Agency solicited comment on whether theproposed requirements should be integrated into one subpart. The proposalalso divided the regulatory requirements for corrective action into twostages: (1) Immediate abatement actions that all owners and operators musttake in response to a release; and (2) long-term investigation and remedialaction measures that may be taken on a site-specific basis to protect humanhealth and the environment. The Agency solicited public comment on theapproach taken to these immediate abatement (Stage I), and long-term remedialaction (Stage II) issues in the proposal. These and numerous other correctiveaction issues are discussed in more detail in the following section ofthis preamble that addresses the section-by-section analysis of the finalcorrective action rules (see section IV.F.). The following discussion brieflyhighlights the major decisions and influences (including public comment)that went into the development of the Agency's final approach to correctiveaction for UST systems storing regulated substances. a. <T3>Corrective Action for Regulated Substances. </T3>The proposal providedseparate corrective action processes for UST systems storing petroleumand those storing hazardous substances (proposed Subparts F and G). Thestated purposes of this approach were: (1) To avoid confusion over whichprocedures must be followed at a release site; and (2) to construct anapproach towards hazardous substances corrective action that was very similarto the one for petroleum, except that it was intended to move the ownersand operators more quickly to collect, array, and assess the informationneeded to determine the nature, extent, and hazard of the corrective actionrelease (52 FR 12682). The dividing line between Stage I and Stage II ofthe process was intended to occur earlier in the response to a hazardoussubstance release, thus following more closely the RCRA Subtitle C hazardouswaste tank approach to corrective action. This proposed approach was anattempt to provide a response process for hazardous substances that recognizedthe relatively greater hazards that could be posed by hazardous substancesreleases, and that ensured that there was consistency with the correctiveaction approach required for hazardous waste tanks. EPA solicited commentson whether the petroleum and hazardous substance requirements for correctiveaction should be merged in the final rule. In response to public comments received, and several other revisions madein the final corrective action rules, the Agency has decided to consolidatethe requirements for UST corrective action into Subpart F for all regulatedsubstances (both petroleum and hazardous substances) for the reasons discussedbelow. All of the comments received by EPA concerning the merging of thetwo proposed subparts were in favor of it, although they made differentsuggestions on how to accomplish this consolidation (discussed in moredetail later in the section-by-section analysis of this preamble). Although the preamble to the proposal described the Agency's intentionto foster quicker investigatory and cleanup actions at hazardous substancesrelease sites, as was pointed out by some commenters, the few differencesin the actual regulatory language between the two separate subparts wasnot likely to attain this end. In fact, most of the requirements withinthe two proposed subparts were the same. The most significant differenceswere that a free product investigation was not a required step for hazardoussubstance responses, and a more rapid (within 30 days) and detailed reportingof certain information was required by owners and operators with hazardoussubstance releases (see proposed andSection; 280.74(b)) than for those withpetroleum releases. Prompted by these public comments, additional reviewof these proposed differences has led the Agency to agree that they donot necessarily lead to faster corrective actions at hazardous substancerelease sites. Furthermore, even if this end was achieved somewhat forhazardous substance releases, the Agency does not believe it would protecthuman health and the environment to move less quickly towards the remedialactions required with petroleum releases. Thus, in the merger of the twosubparts in today's final rules, the Agency has developed a process thatensures the most rapid reporting, investigation, and corrective actionat all UST release sites that is believed to be attainable (the detailsof today's consolidation are discussed in more detail later in sectionIV.F. of today's preamble).Because the requirements of the two proposed subparts were largely thesame, EPA also believes that today's merger of them into one consolidatedSubpart F for all regulated substances avoids a significant source of potentialconfusion within the regulated community. Despite the slight proceduraldifferences between the two subparts, the Agency is now convinced thatthe work involved in investigating petroleum and hazardous substance releaseswill be very similar. Also, given that the similarities in the characteristicsof different petroleum products are expected to lead to more rapid andwidespread understanding of how to respond routinely to petroleum releases(mostly gasoline), the actual investigation, initial abatement of hazards,and the availability of corrective action technology for petroleum releasesmay result in more rapid and effective release responses at sites withpetroleum releases than those with a hazardous substance release. The Agency continues to believe that under certain conditions, hazardoussubstance releases can pose a greater hazard to human health and the environmentthan petroleum releases. However, the consolidated requirements in today'sfinal rules have been designed to allow the implementing agency to causethe owner and operator to move as rapidly as is necessary to identify andcontrol any such additional potential threats. For example, under the finalrules, the identification and recovery of free product now must be consideredat both petroleum and hazardous substance release sites. This requiredconsideration of free product recovery, however, does not hinder the progressof corrective action at sites with releases of hazardous substances becausethe presence and recovery of free product is already something that mustbe commonly considered at all release sites (whether petroleum or hazardoussubstances). The final rule allows enough flexibility to ensure that thistype of action is tailored, under the direction of the implementing agency,to site conditions and the type of substance released. b. Stage I: <T3>Investigation of Releases and Immediate Corrective Action. </T3>EPAproposed requirements for the first stage of the corrective action process(Stage 1) by establishing immediate steps that must be taken to abate imminenthealth and safety hazards whenever a release is confirmed. The basic approachassured that the following activities were undertaken by the owner andoperator at all sites with a confirmed release: (1) Immediate notificationof the implementing agency; (2) actions needed to stop further releases;(3) mitigation of safety hazards due to fire and explosion; (4) removalof contaminated soils; (5) investigation of the existence and extent offloating free product; and (6) initiation of the removal of free productand submittal of free product recovery plan unless directed to do otherwiseby the implementing agency. Numerous public comments on issues related to these proposed requirementsare discussed in more detail later in this preamble. In general, many commentersbelieved the proposal was unclear as to what exactly had to be done, andby whom, to comply with the requirements. EPA, in response to these commenters,has revised the language in the final rule to clarify which elements ofthe initial response actions are mandatory and which are discretionary.The mandatory requirements are intended to ensure three goals are accomplished:andbullet; To bring leaking UST sites under control with respect to immediatehealth and safety hazards; andbullet; To stabilize the site so that contamination will not worsen asinvestigation and potentially long-term remedial actions are considered;and andbullet; To be self-implementing in that these measures emphasize the responsibilityof the owner and operator to take immediate action without awaiting approvalof the implementing agency. All sites with releases of regulated substances must investigate the areaaround the UST system to be able to characterize the size and nature ofthe release (e.g., a small spill or a large, continuing slow release).The findings of this initial investigation must be reported to the implementingagency, which has the discretion to require a more extensive site characterizationbased on these initial findings. The proposal has also been revised tomake this more extensive examination of ground-water and soil contaminationmandatory when the initial investigation reveals that a significant releasehas occurred (e.g., free product floating on the ground water or saturatedsoils in the subsurface), even in the absence of direction from the implementingagency. Thus, today's final rule requires all releases that seriously threatenor impact ground water to be automatically investigated by the owner andoperator to characterize the extent of ground-water contamination and anysoil contamination remaining at the site. c. Stage II: <T3>Long-Term Corrective Action Options. </T3>EPA also proposed requirementsfor the second stage of the corrective action process (Stage II) addressinglong-term remediation of contaminated soils and ground water. The Agencysolicited public comment on three regulatory options for establishing long-termcleanup requirements: (1) National cleanup standards, with a variance provision;(2) site-specific standards to match the risk presented; and (3) a predeterminedclass approach. The proposal emphasized the second approach, with its site-specificcleanup targets based on (1) the data from the detailed site investigationof soil and ground-water contamination performed by the owner and operatorand (2) the site-specific risk present as determined by the implementingagency using exposure and risk assessment techniques. EPA received public comments for and against each of the three optionsfor establishing cleanup levels. The majority of commenters preferred theproposed site-specific approach as the best way to accommodate the diversityof UST releases nationwide. Those in favor of establishing national cleanupstandards in the regulations expressed the opinion that this would expeditecleanups and provide greater national consistency in cleanup results. Supportersof the class approach cited the wisdom of tailoring cleanup efforts toa predetermined assessment of risk based on prospective classificationstied to ground-water vulnerability. EPA has decided to retain the site-specificapproach in the final rules.For the same reasons that were cited in the preamble to the proposal (52FR 12680-12682) and supported by most commenters, EPA continues to believethat the site-specific approach is the most appropriate because it allowsimplementing agencies the necessary flexibility to address corrective actionbased on the unique circumstances of the site. It also enables state andlocal governments to build upon their own experiences when assessing theneed for and extent of corrective action. EPA is not convinced that a nationalstandards approach will result in more rapid and consistent levels of correctiveaction. No data were provided that demonstrate this position. In fact,the information available to the Agency about UST cleanup technologiesindicates that the level of actual cleanup achieved is much more dependenton the limitations associated with current corrective action equipmentand the problems posed by individual site conditions, than it is on thecleanup levels established in a corrective action plan (or by regulation).In selecting the site-specific approach, the Agency notes that it doesnot preclude the use of the other two approaches by implementing agencies.Some states already are using a statewide standards approach. The Agency continues to believe that the site-specific risk assessmentprocess can be streamlined to ensure that the corrective action neededat a site can be identified rapidly and initiated quickly. EPA maintainsthe position expressed in the proposal's preamble (52 FR 12681) that site-specificcleanup levels will have to account for potential exposure of the publicto contamination at the site. If a drinking water supply, public or private,is affected or threatened by the release, then the cleanup levels in thecorrective action plan should be established using health-based levelsas the target for cleanup of the release, unless an alternative sourceof drinking water can be provided to the potentially affected public. TheAgency is developing further guidance concerning the use of risk assessmentand exposure assessment techniques for releases at UST sites. These effortsare expected to further streamline the site-specific approach to regulationpromulgated today. (Further discussions of the site-specific approach tostandard setting and corrective action plans are provided later in thesection-by-section analysis in section IV.F. of today's preamble.) <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Analysis of Today's Rule </ITAG>A. Program Scope <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Applicability </ITAG>As described previously, this rule generally applies to all owners andoperators of UST systems containing regulated substances. Regulated substancesconsist of either petroleum or any substance defined in section 101(14)of CERCLA (but not including any substance regulated as a hazardous wasteunder Subtitle C). The following sections discuss the tank systems subjectto exclusions from today's requirements and the deferral of regulationfor other UST systems. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Regulatory Exclusions </ITAG>The regulatory exclusions in today's final rule are based on a number ofstatutory provisions and regulatory considerations. Section 9003(a) ofRCRA requires the Administrator to establish an UST program ``as may benecessary to protect human health and the environment.'' In addition, section9003(b) allows the administrator to consider such factors as tank sizeand quantity of substances stored when establishing necessary requirements.The Agency believes that this statutory language allows some flexibilityfor EPA to concentrate its resources on tanks that pose the greatest potentialenvironmental threat. Section 9001 defines the universe of the UST programand indicates that EPA should regulate tanks containing an ``accumulation''of regulated substances. Section 9001 also excludes tanks regulated underSubtitle C from the jurisdiction of Subtitle I. Finally, section 1006 ofRCRA generally requires integration of RCRA with the Federal Water PollutionControl Act; the Safe Drinking Water Act; the Marine Protection, Research,and Sanctuaries Act; and the Atomic Energy Act. Based on these provisions, the Agency is today excluding from regulationseveral types of tank systems. These exclusions will decrease the regulatoryburden on implementing agencies so they can focus their resources on typesand classes of tanks that pose a significant threat to human health orthe environment. Unlike statutory exclusions, regulatory exclusions maybe modified by the Agency in the future should new information show thatregulation of such an excluded tank type is necessary.Four classes of tanks are excluded from regulation in the final rule: USTsystems containing mixtures of hazardous waste and regulated substances;equipment and machinery that contain regulated substances for operationalpurposes; wastewater treatment tanks regulated under the Clean Water Act;and UST systems excluded via one of three <T3>de minimus </T3>exclusions. A specific regulatory exclusion for USTsystems containing mixtures of hazardous waste and regulated substanceswas included in the proposed rule (52 FR 12687). The preamble of the proposalalso discussed <T3>de minimus </T3>exclusions. The other two regulatory exclusions wereregulatory deferrals in the proposal. The rationale for these exclusionsis discussed below. a. <T3>Tanks Regulated Under Subtitle C of RCRA. </T3>Because USTs containinga mixture of hazardous wastes (regulated under Subtitle C of RCRA) andregulated substances (regulated under Subtitle I) are subject to dual jurisdictionfrom Subtitle C and Subtitle I, EPA is today excluding these tanks fromSubtitle I regulation. As evidenced by the exclusion of substances coveredunder Subtitle C within the statutory definition of ``regulated substance,''the Agency believes that this exemption is consistent with Congressionalintent not to have redundant requirements under these two programs. Becauseof the continued coverage of these tanks by Subtitle C, the exclusion ofthese tanks from Subtitle I regulations will not present a risk to humanhealth and the environment, and, thus, Subtitle I regulation is not ``necessaryto protect human health and the environment.'' Several commenters pointed out that in the proposed rule this exclusionapplied only to mixtures of hazardous wastes and hazardous substances.This wording would subject tanks that contain mixtures of hazardous wastesand petroleum to regulation under both Subtitle C and Subtitle I. The commentersrequested that the wording be changed so that all mixtures with hazardouswastes regulated under Subtitle C would be excluded from these regulations.The original wording in the proposal was based upon the statutory jurisdictionof the program. Under section 9001(2)(A), the exclusion of tanks regulatedunder Subtitle C pertains only to tanks containing hazardous substances,not to tanks containing petroleum. EPA, however, agrees with the commentersthat dual regulation of tanks containing hazardous wastes and petroleumis not necessary and has changed the wording of this exclusion appropriately.This exclusion now applies to all tanks subject to regulation under SubtitleC that contain mixtures of hazardous wastes and either petroleum or non-petroleumregulated substances. b. <T3>Equipment and Machinery That Contain Regulated Substances for OperationalPurposes. </T3>Equipment and machinery that contain regulated substancesfor operational purposes, such as hydraulic lift tanks and electrical equipment,are excluded from today's regulations. These specific tank categories weredeferred from regulation in the proposal, and the Agency requested commentson whether, and to what extent, these tanks should be subject to regulationunder the UST program. Several commenters responded to this request andgave several reasons why these tanks should not be regulated as USTs. Theircomments included three main points: The tanks are self-monitoring; thetanks pose a minimal risk to human health and the environment; and therehave been few leaks. Because these tanks contain regulated substances solely for operationalpurposes, the commenters argued that the loss of regulated substance wouldbe accompanied by faulty operation of the equipment or machinery and thusthe equipment is ``self-monitoring.'' Second, the threat to human healthand the environment was judged to be minimal because the tanks containsmall amounts of regulated substances. Also, the commenters said that thesedevices rarely leak. Data submitted for leaks from electrical equipment,for example, show a leak incidence much lower than that for other typesof tanks such as those at service stations. This category of tanks includes hydraulic lifts and electrical equipment.Although commenters did not suggest other specific types of tanks thatwould fall within this class, EPA believes that other tanks of this typewould also be included, provided that the tanks meet two major criteria:The equipment or machinery contains small amounts of regulated substancessolely for operational purposes; and a loss of regulated substance is accompaniedby faulty operation of the equipment or machinery, such that a loss offluid causes knowledge of the loss. In excluding this category of tanks, the Agency agrees with the commentersthat these types of tank systems pose a relatively low level of risk comparedto other types of storage tanks for the reasons given above. Moreover,the Agency recognizes that these tanks, although within Subtitle I jurisdiction,are not central to the Congressional concerns that created this program.Thus, regulation of these tank systems appears at this time to be unnecessaryunder section 9003(a). EPA also believes that this potentially overwhelming large universe wouldrequire considerable effort on the part of implementing agencies even forjust notification, with very little discernable environmental benefit.For example, the universe of hydraulic lift tanks alone has been estimatedat 350,000 to 600,000 lifts. These figures do not include elevator lifts.Regulation of these types of tanks would unnecessarily divert implementingagency resources from other, more serious health threats. Therefore, today'sfinal rule excludes such tanks. c. <T3>Wastewater Treatment Tanks Regulated Under the Clean Water Act. </T3>TheAgency is today excluding all wastewater treatment tanks, including anyoil-water separators, that are subject to regulation under either section402 or 307(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) (33 U.S.C. 1151 and following).These tanks, including tanks at most publicly owned treatment works andmany private treatment facilities, would otherwise be subject to dual regulation.Because these tanks are subject to regulation under the CWA, further regulationunder Subtitle I is unnecessary to protect human health and the environmentand would be inconsistent with section 1006(b) of RCRA. This exclusionis analogous to the ``wastewater treatment unit'' exclusion under the RCRASubtitle C program (see 40 CFR 260.10, 264.1, and 265.1). In addition, tanks that treat wastewater or storm water, but which arenot covered by the applicable sections of the CWA, are being deferred fromtoday's final regulations. Such tanks might include many oil-water separatorsfound at various facilities. Further discussion of these tanks can be foundunder the deferral section of this preamble. d. <T3>De Minimis Exclusions. </T3>Today's final rule has been modified toexclude the following tanks: (1) Those that have a capacity of less than110 gallons; (2) those holding a very low concentration of regulated substances;and (3) those that serve as emergency backup tanks, hold regulated substancesfor only a short period of time, and are expeditiously emptied after use.The statutory definition of tank includes all devices that ``contain anaccumulation of regulated substances.'' Although legislative history providesno guidance on the meaning of the phrase ``accumulation of regulated substances,''the Agency believes the statutory language provides some flexibility todefine the universe of regulated facilities in a manner that focuses regulatoryresources on the tanks posing substantial risk from storage of regulatedsubstances and, thereby, fosters development of a program that most effectivelyprotects human health and the environment. Thus, sections 9001 and 9003(a)authorize EPA to exclude from its regulations tanks containing <T3>de minimis </T3>amounts of regulated substances. EPA requested commentin the proposed rule concerning <T3>de minimis </T3>exclusion criteria.A number of comments addressed the issue of including a <T3>de minimis </T3>exclusion in the rule for tanks that hold a small quantityof regulated substances. The overwhelming majority of the commenters believedthat such an exclusion should be part of the final rule. Some commenterssuggested that a small-capacity exclusion would reduce the regulatory burdenon the implementing agencies and, thus, result in a more effective program.Some commenters believed that a small-capacity exclusion was justifiedbecause small quantities of regulated substances pose less of a healthrisk than do larger quantities. In deciding to include a regulatory exclusion for tanks that contain smallquantities of regulated substances in today's rule, the Agency had to balancethe benefits and drawbacks of such an exclusion. The Agency agrees withthe commenters who thought that without an exclusion such as this, theregulated universe could be overwhelmingly large. Such a large universewould require considerable efforts by the implementing authorities evenfor notification, diverting their attention away from other, more potentiallyenvironmentally hazardous classes of tanks. The Agency agrees that smalltanks pose less danger to the environment than larger tanks, generally,due to the smaller quantity of regulated substances available to leak.In certain cases, however, the mismanagement of even small quantities ofregulated substances could pose serious danger to human health and theenvironment. Nevertheless, the Agency has decided that the detriments ofattempting to regulate these small tanks greatly outweigh any potentialbenefits from regulation of this class of tank and has, therefore, adoptedthis exclusion. Several comments were received with suggested sizes for a <T3>de minimis </T3>cutoff. These sizes ranged from 100 gallons to 5,000gallons. State and local agencies with <T3>de minimis </T3>exclusions use cutoffs that range from 60 to 2,100gallons. Because it was apparent that there was no standard size for the<T3>de minimis </T3>exclusion, the Agency chose the size limit of 110 gallonscapacity. According to one commenter, this size is below the smallest petroleumproduct tank routinely mass produced (275 gallons), and a 110-gallon levelcoincides with the Department of Transportation definition for minimumportable tank for the transportation of hazardous materials. Tanks likelyto be exempted under this exclusion include many small sumps and otheratypical tanks. The Agency is also today excluding tanks that contain <T3>de minimis </T3>concentrations of regulated substances. Because ``anaccumulation of regulated substances'' could include within the regulateduniverse USTs holding regulated substances in <T3>any </T3>amount, no matter how small, the regulated universe couldinclude a vast number of tanks that contain regulated substances only insmall concentrations. These very small concentrations could occur accidentally(through contamination) or by design (for example, underground tanks storingfood that contains a preservative that is a regulated substance). The Agencyhas not included a specific percentage threshold as the <T3>de minimis </T3>cutoff because of the many difficulties with measuringtank contents for low concentrations. Instead, on a case-by-case basis,the implementing agencies will determine if tanks that hold very low concentrationsof regulated substances are excluded via the <T3>de minimis </T3>concentration rationale. Tanks that are likely to meetthis criteria include those that are used to treat storm water and municipalwastewater, tanks that store potable water that has been treated with chlorine,and in-ground swimming pools. EPA believes that such tanks pose a minimalthreat to human health and the environment, and the inclusion of such tanksin the regulated universe would impose an undue burden on the implementingagencies because of the potentially large numbers of such tanks. Othertypes of tanks with very low concentrations of regulated substances mayalso be excluded. The third <T3>de minimis </T3>exclusion included in today's rule pertains to tanksthat are emergency spill protection tanks or overflow tanks, and are emptiedexpeditiously following use. This exclusion is analogous to the exclusionfor emergency response treatment and containment under the RCRA SubtitleC program (see 40 CFR 264.1 and 265.1). Included in this category are manytypes of sumps and secondary barrier tanks. This exclusion does not specifya maximum time a tank may hold material, but applies only to tanks thatare rarely used and are emptied shortly after use. The purpose of thisexemption is to allow appropriate immediate response to emergency situations.These tanks are used for temporary storage of substances in response toa leak, spill, or other unplanned occurrences. Regulation of such tanksis unnecessary because they are rarely used and expeditiously emptied and,therefore, are unlikely to have any long-term leaks. Many of these tanksmay also be able to be visually inspected because they rarely hold regulatedsubstances. Several commenters expressed concern that the way the proposedrule was written, the Agency may have been requiring infinite layers ofsecondary containment. For example, in the proposal, an UST system wasdefined to include a secondary containment system, but there were referencesto requiring secondary containment for a hazardous substance UST system.Thus, it appeared that secondary containment was required to surround secondarycontainment. By including this exclusion in the final rule, the Agencybelieves that any potential confusion regarding the need for secondarybarriers (containment) for secondary barrier (containment) systems hasnow been eliminated. Sumps designed to store petroleum or hazardous substances during periodiccleaning or maintenance of machinery or equipment are not included in thisexclusion. An example of this type of sump is turbine oil sumps that areused during maintenance of electric power generation turbines. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Deferral of Regulations </ITAG>In the proposal preamble (52 FR 12687), EPA discussed its proposed deferralof requirements for the following categories of UST systems: wastewatertreatment tanks, sumps, systems containing used oil, systems containingradioactive waste, systems containing electrical equipment, undergroundbulk storage tanks, and hydraulic lift tanks. The Agency requested commentson whether the deferrals were appropriate for each category and, if not,what regulations would be necessary. In today's final rule, the Agency has revised the proposal in several ways.As a result of these revisions, tanks in some of these categories willfall within the scope of the regulatory exclusions described above, somewill be subject to full regulation, and some will continue to be deferredfrom regulation. Tanks that are deferred rather than excluded are subjectto interim UST requirements, but excluded tanks are not subject to anyregulatory requirements. These revisions are briefly summarized below:andbullet; Wastewater treatment tanks now fall under two parts of today'sfinal rule. Wastewater treatment tanks, including oil-water separators,that fall under the jurisdiction of section 402 or 307(b) of the CWA areexcluded from today's regulatory requirements (as discussed above in IV.A.2.).The remaining wastewater treatment tanks continue to be deferred from SubpartsB, C, D, E and G of today's regulations, but are subject to interim requirementsunder Subpart A and corrective action under Subpart F. andbullet; Many sumps are excluded from regulation under the CWA-regulatedwastewater treatment exclusion, and others via one or more of the <T3>de minimis </T3>exclusions; others may be excluded as part of the statutoryexclusion for storm-water and wastewater collection systems. Many of thosethat are not excluded continue to be deferred from Subparts B, C, D, Eand G under the ``field-constructed tank'' deferral. Such UST systems aresubject to the interim prohibition under Subpart A and corrective actionunder Subpart F. Sumps that are neither excluded nor deferred from regulationare subject to today's regulation. andbullet; Field-constructed tanks, which include many tanks classified asunderground bulk storage tanks in the proposal, are deferred from SubpartsB, C, D, E and G but are subject to interim requirements under SubpartA and corrective action under Subpart F. andbullet; UST systems that contain radioactive wastes and other radioactivematerials have been deferred from Subparts B, C, D, E and G but are subjectto interim requirements under Subpart A and corrective action under SubpartF. andbullet; UST systems containing electrical equipment and hydraulic lifttanks, which had been deferred in the proposal, are both examples of equipmentor machinery using regulated substances for operational purposes. As discussedabove in IV.A.2., both types of tanks have been excluded from regulationunder Subtitle I. andbullet; Tanks containing used oil are no longer deferred but are subjectto full regulation under today's final rule. Today's final rule also includes deferral of some subparts of the regulationsfor the following additional categories of tanks: andbullet; Airport hydrant fueling systems and tanks storing diesel fuelfor emergency power generation at plants regulated by the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission are deferred from the technical standards set forth in SubpartsB, C, D, E and G but are subject to interim requirements under SubpartA and corrective action under Subpart F.andbullet; UST systems that store fuel solely for use by emergency powergenerators are deferred from the release detection requirements under SubtitleD. All other regulatory requirements apply to these tanks. EPA's decisionmaking on these various tank types is discussed in more detailin the sections below. a. <T3>Wastewater Treatment Tanks. </T3>In the proposal, EPA deferred wastewatertreatment tanks from UST regulation in order to gather more informationon the need to regulate these tanks and the appropriate type of regulation.EPA included oil-water separators (which are considered treatment tanks)within the scope of wastewater treatment tanks. In the proposal preamble, EPA specifically requested comments on whetherwastewater treatment tanks should be regulated under Subtitle I (52 FR12687). Almost all comments submitted were opposed to regulating wastewatertreatment tanks under UST regulations. The commenters stated that wastewatertreatment tanks are process devices and flow-through process tanks, notstorage tanks; thus, they should not be regulated under the UST program.Several commenters also stated that wastewater treatment tanks containlarge volumes of water and only small amounts of oil or hazardous materialsand, thus, pose no major threat to human health or the environment. Itwas also stated that wastewater treatment tanks that are currently excludedby RCRA are, however, currently covered by the CWA. They should not, therefore,be regulated under UST regulations. In addition, several commenters pointedout that if wastewater treatment tanks were to be included in the finalrule, there is presently no practical method of performing a tightnesstest on these tanks because the tanks are typically open to the atmosphere.Inventory reconciliation is not feasible because the very high throughputwould require more accurate metering than is currently available. EPA does not agree with the commenters who argued that wastewater treatmenttanks are outside the scope of Subtitle I as ``flow-through process tanks''or part of a storm-water or wastewater collection system, which are excludedfrom the jurisdiction of this program under section 9001(1). Wastewatertreatment tanks are not part of a production process, nor are they partof a collection system. See section IV.A.2. for further discussion of thescope of the flow-through process tank and storm-water and wastewater collectionsystem exclusions. EPA does, however, agree with commenters that the universeof treatment tanks could add a large administrative burden that could reducethe ability of the implementing agencies to regulate more serious threatsto the environment. After review of all available information, EPA now believes that wastewatertreatment tanks that are currently covered by sections 402 and 307(b) ofthe CWA should be excluded from UST regulations as discussed in the previoussection. In addition, some of these treatment devices, such as those treatingmunicipal sewage, typically contain <T3>de minimis </T3>concentrations of regulated substances and are thereforeexcluded under today's rule. Wastewater treatment tanks not covered by the CWA or otherwise excludedwill continue to be deferred under these regulations. Oil-water separatorsand other similar treatment devices fall under the definition of ``wastewatertreatment tank'' under today's rule. The deferral for those wastewatertreatment tanks not regulated by the CWA reflects the Agency's uncertaintyregarding the nature of this tank population and the appropriateness ofsome of the UST regulations for these tanks. For example, some types ofleak detection (such as tightness testing) and inventory reconciliationwould not appear to apply to treatment tanks. b. <T3>Sumps. </T3>In the preamble of the proposal (52 FR 12687), the Agencyrequested that commenters submit information on the number, location, andsubstances stored in sumps; how sumps are protected to prevent releasesfrom occurring; leak history; and whether the proposed UST regulationswould be appropriate for sumps. Most of the commenters who responded believedthat regulations for sumps should continue to be deferred because sumpsare small, temporary storage facilities that are frequently visually monitoredand that contain mostly water and only small amounts of petroleum or hazardoussubstances. Also, commenters stated that regulation of sumps would posean unmanageable regulatory burden for the implementing agencies and wouldrequire an individualized approach for each location. Some commenters suggestedthat <T3>de minimis </T3>size, time, and throughput exclusions be developedto prevent sumps from becoming subject to the regulations. The only commenterswho supported regulation of sumps did not believe that Subtitle I was theappropriate regulatory authority. Although commenters did not submit data that would enable EPA to determinethe total number of sumps nationwide, the Agency realizes that the numberof sumps potentially subject to Subtitle I is very large and could posean unmanageable regulatory burden. In addition, the Agency agrees withthe commenters that many sumps are small, temporary storage facilitiesthat contain only small amounts of petroleum or hazardous substances. Noinformation was submitted concerning whether sumps pose a significant threatto human health or the environment. As discussed above, today's final rule contains <T3>de minimis </T3>size, time, and concentration exclusions that are expectedto apply to many sumps. Also, sumps that are part of a storm-water or wastewatercollection system are excluded by statute from UST regulations. These exclusionswill allow the implementing agencies to focus their resources on UST systemsthat are a more significant threat to the environment and human health.The Agency believes, however, that large sumps that contain significantquantities of regulated substances over a period of time do not warrantsuch exclusion, because they are indistinguishable from other regulatedtanks. Therefore, factory-built sumps are subject to all requirements undertoday's final rule if they are not subject to any other exclusion. Field-constructedtanks, including field-constructed sumps, are deferred until informationcan be obtained on what regulations (if any) are appropriate for thesesystems as discussed in the following section. Therefore, the final ruleno longer contains a deferral for sumps. c. <T3>Field-Constructed Tanks. </T3>In the proposal preamble, EPA specificallyrequested comments concerning the applicability of Subtitle I (52 FR 12688)to underground bulk storage tanks (UBSTs). In the proposal preamble, EPAconsidered UBSTs as those tanks whose total capacity was 20,000 gallonsor greater. Several commenters stated their belief that because UBSTs posea major environmental concern and are closely related to other USTs, theyshould be regulated under Subtitle I in the final rule. It was also statedby some commenters that secondary containment of UBSTs is feasible andother existing leak detection methods are applicable to UBSTs. On the otherhand, there were some commenters who opposed the inclusion of UBSTs inthe regulation stating that the differences between UBSTs and normal USTsare too great and that many leak detection and leak prevention methodsare not applicable to UBSTs. There were also requests by some commentersthat the definition of UBST be clarified and included not only in the preamblebut also in the final regulation. After reviewing the comments, EPA has modified the deferral of UBSTs toa deferral for tanks that are field-constructed. Although many bulk tanksare expected to be deferred because they are field-constructed, the capacityof these tanks no longer determines their regulatory status. Field-constructed tanks are usually constructed of steel or concrete, shapedlike flat vertical cylinders, and have a capacity of greater than 50,000gallons. In contrast, factory-constructed bulk tanks are typically long,horizontal cylinders and are less than 12 feet in diameter. Tanks thatare principally factory-built but are assembled in the field are consideredfactory-built tanks. For example, welding two halves of a factory-constructedtank together in the field does not qualify the tank as a field-constructedtank. The deferral of regulation for field-constructed tanks is largely basedon the fact that design and construction methods for field-constructedtanks are different from those for factory-built tanks. EPA has not hadsufficient time to develop appropriate regulations related to design andconstruction for such tanks. Comment was divided on the applicability of present leak detection andleak prevention methods to bulk tanks. Some commenters argued that existingleak detection methods are applicable to UBSTs, while others stated thatthe differences between UBSTs and normal USTs are too great to use mostpresently available leak detection and prevention methods for such tanks.EPA believes that the division of bulk tanks into field-constructed andfactory-built tanks simplifies this issue. EPA believes that because of the different design and construction methodsused for field-constructed tanks, as well as the very large size of somefield-constructed tanks, the majority of the leak detection methods presentlyavailable do not work for such tanks. Leak prevention methods may alsodiffer for such tanks. The deferral for these tanks is due in part to thisrestricted availability of appropriate leak detection methods.By contrast, EPA believes that currently available leak detection methodsare applicable to factory-built tanks. Factory-built tanks, even thosethat are very large, generally conform to standard design and constructionmethods that allow the use of widely available leak detection methods.EPA agrees with commenters that tanks that hold large amounts of regulatedsubstances do pose a relatively larger potential danger to human healthand the environment than other, smaller tanks. However, until regulationsare developed to govern design and construction of field-constructed tanks,they will be deferred. d. <T3>Systems Containing Radioactive Materials. </T3>At proposal, the Agencyrequested comment on the issue of whether tanks containing radioactivematerials, including high-level radioactive waste and tanks containingmixtures of low-level radioactive waste and other materials, should meetthe proposed standards or whether separate standards should be developed.No commenters supported regulation of these USTs under Subtitle I. Thecommenters stated that radioactive waste and materials tanks at nuclearfacilities are regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (10 CFR 50.34a)and that further regulation of these tanks under Subtitle I would be duplicativeand possibly inconsistent. One commenter noted that these tanks are typicallymade of stainless steel and have a capacity of approximately 1,000 gallons.The tanks are pressure tested before the nuclear facility is licensed tooperate and are retested every 10 years. In addition, they are constantlymonitored for loss of pressure and radiation leakage. Commenters also notedthat the current Department of Energy management program for tanks containinghigh-level radioactive waste is as stringent as, and in some cases exceeds,the proposed UST rule. Because tanks containing radioactive wastes and other radioactive materialsat nuclear facilities are regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,these tanks could be subject to overlapping jurisdiction under SubtitleI and the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 and following). TheAgency, however, lacks complete information on whether these regulationsfully cover all appropriate areas addressed under Subtitle I. The Agency,therefore, is deferring regulation of these tank systems until more informationcan be gathered. e. <T3>Systems Containing Electrical Equipment. </T3>Under the proposed definitionof ``tank,'' large numbers of utility units in urban and residential areas(e.g., underground transmission cables and vaulted transformers for largetrunk lines) could be subject to regulation. At the time of the proposal,the Agency deferred regulation of these structures based on its beliefthat inclusion of these structures in the UST program would be impracticaland unnecessary. EPA requested that commenters submit information on thenumber, location, and substances stored in these units; how they are protectedto prevent releases; leak history; and whether the proposed regulationswould be appropriate for these units. All of the commenters in this area were opposed to inclusion of electricalequipment structures in the UST program. The commenters stated that theseunits are not primarily used for storage and that the utilities industryalready takes many precautions to prevent releases. Dielectric fluids,typically naphthenic mineral oil and synthetic fluids such as polybuteneor alkylbenzene, are used in underground cable piping and vaulted transformersto prevent the cables and transformers from overheating. Underground cablepiping is cathodically protected and is coated to prevent corrosion. Thepiping is subjected to pressure tests both before and after insertion ofthe cable and addition of the dielectric fluid. Electronic monitors atthe utility's control center indicate potential releases of fluid (i.e.,when the required oil pressure cannot be supplied by the associated pumpingstation). In addition, transmission line routes are routinely inspectedto identify potential sources of piping damage, such as the misuse of constructionequipment. Information submitted by commenters showed that from 1978 to1985, utilities nationwide reported an average of less than 1 leak per100 circuit miles of cable. In 1985, there were 23 reported leaks involvinglow-pressure systems and 6 reported leaks involving high-pressure systems.Of the low pressure system leaks, only one occurred belowground. The Agency believes that there are already strong incentives for the utilitiesindustry to prevent releases from underground equipment because these leakscould result in system malfunctions and widespread power outages. The industryhas developed release response procedures for notification, containment,and cleanup in the event of a release. In addition, despite its widespreaduse, underground electrical equipment appears to pose a minimal threatto the environment because of the low leak incidence for such UST systems.Moreover, many of these systems also fall within the statutory exclusionfor storage tanks situated on or above the floor of underground areas,such as basements and cellars. Therefore, to allow the implementing agenciesto focus their limited resources on more significant potential threats,the Agency has decided to exclude underground electrical equipment fromthe final rule as equipment and machinery that contain regulated substancessolely for operational purposes. f. <T3>Hydraulic Lift Tanks. </T3>In the proposal preamble, EPA deferred theapplication of the proposed technical standards to hydraulic lift tanks;however, these tanks would have been subject to Subparts F and G of theproposed rule (i.e., corrective action). ``Hydraulic lift tanks'' are thosetanks used to store fluid used in hydraulic lifts at service stations andsimilar devices such as lubrication oil reservoirs for elevators. Afterreview of all available information, EPA has now decided that, like theelectrical equipment tanks discussed above, hydraulic lift tanks will beexcluded in the final rule as equipment or machinery that contain regulatedsubstances solely for operational purposes. In the proposal preamble, EPA specifically requested comments on whetherhydraulic lift tanks should be regulated, and if regulated, to what extent(52 FR 12689). In response, several commenters stated that hydraulic lifttanks should not be regulated under the final rule because they are notused for storage and many of them are almost completely aboveground. Itwas suggested by several other commenters that hydraulic lift tanks notbe regulated because they pose either minimal or no threat to human healthor the environment and are self-monitoring. If problems do arise, the liftscease to operate when they lose fluid. It was also mentioned by severalcommenters that due to the location of hydraulic lift tanks (e.g., underbuildings), the cost impact involved in bringing these tanks under regulationwould be substantial. Finally, several commenters stated that the inclusionof hydraulic lift tanks in the regulation would cause severe impacts onthe implementing agency; the number of hydraulic lifts has been estimatedat over 800,000. Several commenters suggested, however, that special standardsbe developed specifically for hydraulic lift tanks. It was also suggestedthat only those hydraulic lift tanks that exceed 100 gallons be regulatedunder the final rule. EPA deferred regulation of hydraulic lift tanks at proposal to allow timeto gather additional information on the subject. In the preamble to theproposal, however, EPA identified several reasons why, based on preliminaryinformation, the Agency felt that regulation of such tanks would be unnecessary.After reviewing all comments submitted, EPA believes that it is appropriateto exclude all hydraulic lift tanks from regulation. EPA agrees with thosecommenters who stated that hydraulic lift tanks pose a minimal threat tothe environment and are self-monitoring. The Agency is today excludingthese types of tanks as equipment that contains regulated substances solelyfor operational purposes (see section IV.A.2.b. above).g. <T3>Used Oil USTs. </T3>The Agency proposed to defer regulation of usedoil USTs. The Agency indicated, however, that it might apply the proposedtechnical standards to used oil USTs in the final rule following publiccomment on the appropriateness of the technical standards for used oilUSTs. EPA considered the many comments received on this issue and has decidedto include used oil USTs in the final regulation. Public comments receivedby EPA and proposed revisions to the final rule as they relate to the appropriatenessof the technical standards for used oil USTs are discussed below. In the preamble to the proposed regulations, EPA requested comments onthe following issues relating to used oil: andbullet; Are the petroleum UST requirements appropriate for recycled usedoil and/or used oil bound for disposal? andbullet; Do the minor constituents found in used oil (such as water andmetals) alter the appropriateness of the requirements? andbullet; Is it appropriate to have different standards for relatively smallertanks, such as those used by used oil generators and burners, than forlarger tanks, such as those used by used oil processors? In addition, EPA also requested comment on the impact of the proposed regulationson the recycling of used oil. In a supplemental <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice (52 FR 48638, December 23, 1987), EPArequested comment on the appropriateness of using alternative methods ofrelease detection for used oil USTs, to supplement those listed in andSection;280.41 of the proposed rule. The Agency specifically requested commentson the use of static inventory control as a method of release detectionfor smaller used oil USTs. This request was prompted by the Agency's beliefthat some of the release detection methods proposed in andSection; 280.41may not be practical or effective for used oil USTs due to the physicalcharacteristics of used oil. On the other hand, the Agency believes thatthe static inventory method of release detection may be very effectiveand practical for use with small used oil USTs. ``Static inventory control''has been renamed as ``manual tank gauging'' in the final rule and in therest of this preamble's discussion of this method of release detection.The Agency believes that the risks associated with releases from used oilUSTs may be different from those of other USTs, but the overall level ofrisk is similar to that of other petroleum products. Releases from usedoil USTs may be less likely to occur than from petroleum USTs, but thehealth risks posed may potentially be greater because of the possibilityof contaminants in the used oil. The appropriateness of further regulation,under RCRA Subtitle C, will be determined by results of studies currentlyin progress. At this time, the Agency has determined that used oil USTsshould be regulated under Subtitle I because there is evidence of leaksthat indicates a significant threat to human health and the environment.In reply to EPA's request for comments about the appropriateness of theproposed regulation for used oil USTs, public comment was divided. Severalcommenters stated that used oil USTs should be covered by Subtitle I regulationsbecause the risk to ground water was essentially the same as for otherpetroleum products, and that management of all underground tanks at a facilitythat had both used oil tanks and other Subtitle I regulated tanks (e.g.,a service station) would be facilitated by a single, inclusive regulation(Subtitle I). In contrast, some commenters stated that the risk from usedoil USTs was insignificant and, thus, used oil USTs should permanentlybe exempted from regulation. Others stated that used oil USTs should beregulated under RCRA Subtitle C because the hazardous constituents in usedoil make it more dangerous than other petroleum products. The Agency agrees with those commenters who noted that used oil presentsrisks similar to other petroleum products and that Subtitle I regulationsare appropriate. Today's final rule reflects this by applying the petroleumUST requirements to used oil USTs, with limited exceptions discussed below.Releases from both used oil USTs or other petroleum USTs can be prevented,or at least limited, by sound management practices. As a result, the Agencyhas decided to require used oil USTs to meet the same upgrading, operationand maintenance, corrosion protection, corrective action, and closure requirementsthat are applicable to other petroleum USTs. The Agency received comments requesting an exemption from Subtitle I regulationsfor small tanks. Recommended cutoff sizes ranged from 100 to 3,000 gallons.In addition, several commenters also requested regulatory exemptions forsmall vessels used to trap used oil, as well as tanks holding regulatedsubstances for short time periods. As discussed above, in today's finalrule EPA is exempting from the regulations USTs that are 110 gallons orless. Thus, small traps are excluded from regulation. With respect to tanksthat hold regulated substances for short periods of time, today s ruleincludes an exemption for emergency spill collection tanks. The regulationsdo, however, apply to any other used oil USTs, the majority of which arethe 500- and 550-gallon tanks often found at gasoline service stations.Most of these USTs are old and are believed to be a common source of releasesof used oil. USTs that contain used oil that is used as substitute forheating oil are excluded. The Agency received several comments noting particular characteristicsassociated with used oil or used oil USTs that make some of the proposedtechnical standards in Part 280 inappropriate for used oil USTs holdingless than 1,100 gallons. In response to these comments, today's final rulecontains different requirements for small used oil USTs in two areas: Releasedetection and overfill/spill protection. First, with respect to releasedetection, many commenters noted their support for manual tank gauging(formerly called ``static inventory control'') by itself as an alternativeleak detection method for used oil USTs. Today's final rule allows theuse of this alternative release detection method as the sole method ofrelease detection for any petroleum UST with a capacity of 550 gallonsor less. Manual tank gauging may be used in combination with periodic tanktightness testing on petroleum tanks with a capacity between 55 and 1,000gallons. (These provisions are discussed in more detail in section IV.D.of this preamble.)Today's final rule also provides an exemption from the rule's spill andoverfill protection controls for USTs that are filled in small increments.(This is also discussed in more detail later in this preamble under spilland overfill prevention for new USTs.) The Agency agrees with the commentersthat used oil USTs that are filled manually in small increments do notpose the same risk to human health and the environment from spills andoverfills as other USTs. The Agency received additional comments related to design standards andagrees with those who requested cathodic protection for new used oil tanks.In addition, EPA is requiring that owners and operators upgrade or replacetheir used oil USTs according to the time period of today's final rule(10 years). EPA disagrees, however, with the commenters who argued thatthese tanks should be subject to secondary containment. Because the physicaland chemical characteristics of used oil are similar to petroleum products,the release detection and corrective action technologies should be similarlyapplicable to used oil. Thus, the final rule subjects used oil USTs tothe release detection requirements applicable to petroleum UST systemsrather than secondary contaminant required for hazardous substance USTsystems. h. <T3>Airport Hydrant Fueling Systems. </T3>A number of commercial airportsand airports at Department of Defense bases use hydrant fueling systems.These systems generally consist of one or more bulk storage tanks thatmay be either below or aboveground and that are connected by undergroundpiping to various aircraft fueling locations on the airport. Hydrants,otherwise known as fuel dispensers, are connected to the pipe networksand dispense fuel into aircraft. These systems are, in some cases, verylarge in size and contain great volumes of fuel. Many airports have milesof piping, which is typically 8 to 24 inches in diameter, and the totalcapacity of the systems can be many millions of gallons. Through a brief investigation of these systems, the Agency believes thatsome of these systems do not meet the statutory definition of an UST system,and are thus outside of the jurisdiction of Subtitle I. Hydrant systemsthat have aboveground storage tanks are not regulated tank systems unless10 percent or more of the capacity of the system is in the belowgroundpipelines. However, hydrant systems with belowground storage tanks and those withaboveground storage tanks but whose pipelines account for 10 percent ormore of the system's capacity are within to Subtitle I jurisdiction asUST systems. The special problems posed by requiring hydrant systems tomeet many of the requirements in today's final rule have motivated theAgency to look further at these systems, and have led to today's deferralof regulations for these systems. The Agency continues to examine questions regarding the construction, operation,maintenance, and monitoring of hydrant systems. Preliminary informationindicates that hydrant systems typically have cathodic protection, andare monitored for leaks on a daily, monthly, and annual basis. Inventorymonitoring is often used, but the sensitivity of this technique is verylimited due to the large volume these systems typically handle. No singleleak test, however, appears to be an industry standard. Since proposal, the Agency has become aware of several leak incidents fromhydrant systems that resulted in environmental damage. Because of limitedinformation on this subject, however, the Agency is unclear about the extentof this problem. In addition, to the nature of these systems, especiallythe typically large amount of piping, certain requirements in today's rule(such as leak detection for piping systems) may not be feasible for hydrantsystems. For these reasons, the Agency is deferring regulation of SubpartsB, C, D, E and G for all airport hydrant systems, including the undergroundtank portions of those systems, to allow more time to gather information.i. <T3>Backup Diesel Tanks at Nuclear Facilities. </T3>Following publicationof the proposed regulations, a commenter raised the issue of the applicabilityof the UST regulations to tanks at nuclear power plants that store dieselfuel for use in emergency situations. According to the commenter, thesetanks are already extensively regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(NRC), and further regulation by EPA could result in an overly burdensomeprogram if the regulations were inconsistent. Not only would these nuclearfacilities be required to meet dual regulatory programs, but structuralchanges to the systems as a result of the UST regulations could resultin an amendment to the plant's license, according to a commenter. The commenteralso pointed out that any shutdown of the backup fuel system (e.g., forretrofitting) could result in the entire nuclear power plant being shutdown. The Agency is today deferring the requirements of Subparts B, C, D, E andG for these tanks pending completion of a review of the NRC regulations(10 CFR Part 50 Appendix A) governing these tanks to determine whetherfurther regulation is necessary to protect human health and the environmentor would be inconsistent with NRC regulations for proposes of section 1006.If this research indicates that the NRC regulations are not adequate orare not as complete as the UST regulations, EPA may require these tanksto be subject to Subtitle I regulations, or it may develop a separate setof standards applicable to this class of tank. j. <T3>UST Systems Associated with Emergency Generators. </T3>In today's rule,EPA is deferring Subpart D requirements for UST systems associated withemergency power generators. Such tanks are common in the telephone industryand the electric utility industry. These tanks often store diesel fuelwhich serves as a source of backup power in remote locations (for example,at telephone switching locations). This is a deferral of the release detectionrequirements only; owners and operators of these systems must comply withall other subparts of this rule. Several commenters argued that these tanks should not be regulated at allfor the following reasons: they are generally small in size (typicallyunder 500 gallons); most are less than 5 years old; they are often at unmannedstations in remote locations; they contain diesel fuel, which is less mobilethan gasoline due to its higher viscosity; and many are filled only annually.The Agency does not agree that these reasons merit an exclusion from theUST regulations. The requirement that these tanks be monitored each monthis unworkable, however, because they are often located in remote areasand are visited very infrequently. Therefore, EPA is deferring SubpartD requirements for these tanks to allow time to develop workable releasedetection requirements for these tank systems. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Definitions </ITAG>The following sections address many of the terms that are used in the statutorylanguage and elsewhere in the final regulations. Since proposal, many termshave been redefined or clarified as a result of comments. The followingsections contain the revised definitions, the rationale for the changes,and the Agency's interpretation of these terms. a. <T3>Definitions of Terms in the Statute. </T3><T3>(1) Underground Storage Tank. Underground storage tank </T3>is definedin the statute as any one or a combination of tanks (including <T3>underground pipes connected thereto</T3>) that is used to contain anaccumulation of <T3>regulated substances, </T3>and the volume of which (including the volumeof the underground pipes connected thereto) is 10 percent or more <T3>beneath the surface of the ground.</T3>Today's rule sets forth the following definitions for terms used in thestatutory definition of underground storage tank: <T3>(a) Tank </T3>is a stationary device designed to contain an accumulationof regulated substances and constructed of non-earthen materials (e.g.,concrete, steel, plastic) that provide structural support. Several commenters stated that the definition of tank in the proposed rulewas too broad, and included devices that do not store regulated substancesbut rather use, treat, collect, or capture regulated substances. By expandingthe scope of tank beyond just storage tanks, say the commenters, EPA departedfrom its Congressional mandate and created a program that is overly inclusiveand difficult to manage. The commenters also argued that the inclusionof hydraulic lift tanks, electrical equipment, oil-water separators, sumps,treatment tanks, and other devices not normally regarded as storage tankswould overwhelm the Agency's ability to adequately enforce the regulations.Also, the added burden of regulating these devices would be disproportionateto their potential environmental harm. Few of these devices have documentedleak histories, according to the commenters. Throughout the development of the UST regulations, where there has beenambiguity in the terms defining the jurisdiction of the Subtitle I program,it has been the Agency's policy to define the scope of the UST regulationsbroadly and interpret the exclusions relatively narrowly. By taking thisapproach, the Agency hoped to avoid prematurely eliminating from its jurisdictiontanks that may pose an environmental threat. This policy has afforded theAgency the opportunity to gather more information on the various classesof tanks in the potential regulated universe. EPA has retained the prerogativeto narrow the scope of the program by regulation rather than statutoryinterpretation, taking into account potential environmental and healthrisks, implementability, and administrative burden. The Agency decidedthat this approach would result in a program that provides maximum protectionto human health and the environment while taking into account the regulatoryburdens associated with the program. Further explanation of these regulatoryexclusions is found earlier in this preamble under IV.A.2. Regulatory Exclusions,many of which deal with precisely those tanks about which commenters expressedconcern. Accordingly, EPA disagrees with commenters who argued that EPA's definitionof ``tank'' results in an unauthorized expansion of its regulatory programunder Subtitle I. Although EPA acknowledges that this program includesonly ``storage'' tanks, Congress defined ``storage'' in section 9001 ofRCRA as ``containing an accumulation of regulated substances.'' EPA's interpretationof the Subtitle I jurisdiction to encompass any devices holding an accumulationof any regulated substances (unless subject to a statutory exclusion) isthus not inconsistent with the statute. Moreover, this definition is thesame as that which has been used in the Subtitle C tank program for years.<T3>(b) Underground pipes connected thereto </T3>means all undergroundpiping, including valves, elbows, joints, flanges, and flexible connectorsattached to a tank system through which regulated substances flow. Forthe purpose of determining how much piping is connected to any individualUST system, the piping that joins two UST systems should be allocated equallybetween the systems. Tanks that are simply manifolded together are consideredas one UST system. However, if an exempt tank is connected by piping toa regulated tank, half of the piping is allocated to each tank system.This allocation of connected piping is an attempt to reconcile two conflictingstatutory provisions: Section 9001(1) states that an UST system includesthe tank and all underground pipes connected thereto but also states thata statutorily excluded UST system also includes all of the piping connectedto it. As a result, half of the piping is allocated to the regulated tanksystem and half to the excluded tank system if two are connected. In the RCRA Subtitle C tank rules, the starting point of the ``connectedpiping'' is the point at which the contained substance is initially consideredto be a hazardous waste. It should be noted that the above terms as theyapply here, while similar, are different than the Subtitle C definition.<T3>(c) Regulated Substance. </T3>Today's definition of ``regulated substance''in the final rule codifies the statutory definitions of ``regulated substance''and ``petroleum'' and provides additional clarification concerning thecoverage of certain substances and mixtures of these substances under theregulations. (i) <T3>Overview. </T3>In the April 17 proposal, the Agency codified the statutorydefinition of regulated substance. Thus, ``regulated substance'' was definedto include: (1) Any substance listed under section 101(14) of CERCLA, exceptthose regulated as hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA; and (2) petroleum,including crude oil or any fraction of crude oil that is liquid at standardconditions of temperature and pressure. The term ``petroleum'' was alsoseparately defined as crude oil, crude oil fractions, and refined petroleumfractions including gasoline, kerosene, heating oils, and diesel fuels.The proposal addressed mixtures of petroleum and any hazardous substancewith a ``50 percent rule,'' and under which, for example, an UST systemcontaining a mixture that was 50 percent or more petroleum was proposedto be a ``petroleum UST system.'' In the Supplemental Notice of December 23, 1987, the Agency proposed furtherclarification of these definitions by requesting public comment on a specificlist of substances and blends that would be subject to the petroleum USTrequirements. This list was intended to be comparable to the list of CERCLAhazardous substances (not including hazardous wastes). Thus, an owner oroperator would have to comply with the UST regulations only if one or moreof the stored substances were on either of the two lists of regulated substances.The proposed list of petroleum substances would also be used to determine,for purposes of release detection requirements, if a substance would beregulated as a petroleum UST system. The few comments the Agency received about the proposed definition of regulatedsubstance asked for further clarification of the term petroleum. The commenters'concern was whether the release detection requirements for new hazardoussubstance USTs (i.e., secondary containment), or those for new petroleumUSTs, applied to particular substances. EPA also received numerous commentson the proposed list of petroleum substances contained in this SupplementalNotice. In general, most commenters expressed preference for this proposedlist because it was more specific and clarified which substances had tomeet the release detection requirements for petroleum USTs. However, someother commenters questioned this approach because of the difficulty inpreparing a complete list and the loss of flexibility such a specific listwould entail as the composition of petroleum products changed over time.Numerous commenters provided suggestions for adding or deleting specificsubstances from the list. In today's final rule, the proposed list of petroleum substances in theSupplemental Notice is not used, although the general categories from thelist have been included in the final definition of regulated substance.Thus, the definition of regulated substance retains the statutory languagethat was originially proposed, except that it has been revised to referencethe petroleum refining process and include a list of seven basic categoriesof petroleum or petroleum-based substances considered by EPA to be ``regulatedsubstances.'' This addition to the federal definition is intended to respondto those commenters who requested more clarity about the scope of petroleumsubstances included within Subtitle I jurisdiction. The final rule alsoincludes definitions for hazardous substances UST systems and petroleumUST systems for the purpose of clarifying, as requested by some commenters,which regulated substances are subject to the secondary containment requirementsfor new USTs storing hazardous substances and which are subject to therelease detection requirements for new USTs storing petroleum or petroleumproducts. (These terms and their use to discern how mixtures are treatedare discussed in section IV.A.4.b.)(ii) <T3>Revisions in the final rule and public comments on the proposal. </T3>Inthe final rule regulated substance is defined as: ``(a) Any substance definedin section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,and Liability Act of 1980 (but not including any substance regulated asa hazardous waste under Subtitle C), and (b) petroleum, including crudeoil or any fraction thereof that is liquid at standard conditions of temperatureand pressure (60 degrees Fahrenheit and 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute).The `regulated substance' includes but is not limited to petroleum andpetroleum-based substances comprised of a complex blend of hydrocarbonsderived from crude oil through processes of separation, conversion, upgrading,and finishing, such as motor fuels, jet fuels, distillate fuel oils, residualfuel oils, lubricants, petroleum solvents, and used oils.'' In summary,the proposal's codification of the statutory definition of ``regulatedsubstance'' has been retained in sections (a) and (b) of the final definition(see above). Also, the proposal's elaboration of the meaning of petroleumin a separate definition of the term has been deleted (see section (iii)below), but several general categories in that proposed definition havebeen listed in the final definition of regulated substance to respond tosome commenters' requests for clarification of the scope of the substancescovered by the regulations. The first part of today's final definition of regulated substance (section(a)) refers to the specific list of substances (both chemicals and discardedchemical products) that are defined by regulation under CERCLA (see 40CFR Part 302). The Subtitle I program covers all hazardous substances exceptthose that are hazardous wastes. Few comments were submitted concerningthis list or section (b) of the proposed definition (the statutory definitionof petroleum). The two questions raised in most public comments were (1)whether the storage of a particular substance was regulated under SubtitleI, and (2) what release detection was required for new UST systems storinga particular substance (see section (iii) below). EPA originally proposed to define petroleum as crude oil, any fractionsof crude oil and refined petroleum fractions, such as gasoline, kerosene,heating oils, and diesel fuels. In the Supplemental Notice to the proposal,EPA requested comment on the appropriateness of adding to the definitiona specific list of substances that was based on the fundamental petroleumrefinery process. Many commenters agreed with the proposed use of the crudeoil separation processes as the basis for determining which substancesshould be subject to petroleum UST standards. However, others believedthat basing the definition of petroleum strictly on the steps in the separationprocess was inappropriate. These commenters pointed out that this approachcould result in similar substances being regulated differently, such asunleaded motor gasoline being considered a petroleum substance and leadedmotor gasoline a hazardous substance because lead is added in steps subsequentto basic separation processes. Other commenters pointed out the difficultyin determining the exact point in the refinery process at which a substanceis considered petroleum and at which point it becomes a chemical productdistinct from petroleum. In the refinery process, separation involves two steps: atmospheric andvacuum distillation. Heat is applied to crude oil, which separates intoindividual fractions because of differences in boiling points or boilingranges. Some of these fractions can be used directly from a distillationtower; however, many of the products must go through further treatment.This treatment is known as conversion, which includes such processes ashydrocracking, catalytic cracking, coking, and alkylation. These processesare used to change the molecular weight and boiling ranges of the fractions.Upgrading is the process of improving the quality of the petroleum fractionby removing sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen. The heating involved with thisprocess adds stability and removes waxes, allowing lower pour points. Finishingdoes not mean distillation to pure chemical products, but is the finalstep before a petroleum product is sold at retail. An example of finishingis the addition of certain chemicals to motor gasoline. Additives may includeoctane enhancers, which either raise or lower octane ratings, dyes forproduct identification by color, and detergents that remove deposits fromengines. These additives may be listed hazardous substances. The complexityof this process, the variety of chemical products produced, and the varietyof chemical additives mixed with petroleum products in the refinery processhas led to some confusion about which substances are ``petroleum'' or ``hazardoussubstance'' under Subtitle I. To overcome this confusion and respond to comments received on the proposal,the final rule does not include a separate definition of petroleum. Instead,the final rule language for ``regulated substance'' has been amended toclarify what petroleum and petroleum-based substances, hazardous substances,and mixtures are within the regulated universe.The final definition of regulated substance has been revised to refer toproducts from the refinery process, and it lists seven general categoriesof petroleum and petroleum-based substances so that the breadth of thecoverage of the regulations is clear. Each of these general categoriesin fact consists of many specific individual products or substances. Bynot individually listing these different products and grades, EPA intendsthat any future adjustments in specific product composition (for example,changes made to respond to market demands) will not affect the product'sclassification as a ``regulated substance.'' These seven categories correspondto the major categories in the list of petroleum substances and mixturesproposed in the Supplemental Notice. Nearly all petroleum products in usetoday are included in the seven categories listed in the definition. Thegeneral reference in the definition to the products from the refining process(discussed above) will aid in identifying the remaining unlisted regulatedsubstances. Under this approach, EPA will not need to continually updatethe list (for example, motor gasolines is a category of regulated substancenow and in the future, although new blends of motor gasoline, such as ``mid-grade,''may be developed or new additives may be used). The Agency believes that this approach will make it easier to determinethe regulatory status of an individual substance or blend under SubtitleI and ease the implementation burdens on the UST owner and operator, andthe implementing agency. Any owner or operator trying to determine whethera tank system contains ``regulated substances'' and is subject to SubtitleI requirements must first determine if the substance belongs to one ofthe seven general categories of regulated petroleum substances. If not,then the owner or operator next must determine whether the stored materialis included within the production process and physical properties descriptionfor petroleum products. If not, then the owner or operator must finallydetermine whether the substance is listed as a hazardous substance undersection 101(14) of CERCLA (see 40 CFR Table 302.4), except for those listedas ``hazardous wastes'' under Subtitle C of RCRA. If the substance hasnot met one of these three definitions, then it is not a regulated substance.(iii) <T3>Petroleum. </T3>The proposed definition of petroleum has been deletedfrom the final rule. A separate definition of petroleum was not includedin the final rule because now no regulatory distinctions are based solelyon whether the stored substance is ``petroleum'' or a ``hazardous substance.''However, regulatory distinctions concerning the selection of release detectionequipment are based on whether a new tank system is a ``petroleum UST system''or a ``hazardous substance UST system.'' All other technical requirementsare the same for all UST systems storing regulated substances. In response to commenters' concerns about how to determine what type ofrelease detection is applicable to a new UST system, the final rules includedefinitions that distinguish between ``petroleum UST systems'' and ``hazardoussubstance UST systems.'' Owners and operators of new petroleum UST systemsmay utilize a variety of release detection methods because petroleum orpetroleum-based substance releases are more predictable in their fate andtransport underground, create relatively well-known exposure risks, andare subject to more widely available release detection and corrective actiontechnologies. For regulatory purposes, petroleum UST systems may storepetroleum or petroleum-based substances, petroleum and <T3>de minimis </T3>hazardous substance mixtures (e.g., used oil), or hazardoussubstances with properties similar to petroleum products. Thus, the typesof stored substances subject to the release detection requirements fornew petroleum UST systems are somewhat broader in scope than what constitutessimply ``petroleum.'' This is reflected in a revised definition of ``petroleumUST system,'' which includes a replacement of the proposal's 50-percentrule for petroleum-hazardous substance mixtures with a <T3>de minimis </T3>rule. (See the discussion in section IV.A.4.b. concerningthe definitions of ``hazardous substance UST system'' and ``petroleum USTsystem.'') The Agency will continue to use the statutory definition of ``petroleum''for purposes of the LUST Trust response program under section 9003(h).Except for the requirement that petroleum must be a liquid at standardconditions of temperature and pressure, the term has the same definitionas the term ``petroleum'' defined under CERCLA sections 101(14) and 101(33).The Agency interprets these terms to include the same substances, i.e.,crude oil and refined fractions of petroleum, including gasoline and dieselfuels. The term ``petroleum'' includes the inherent ``hazardous substance''constituents in crude or refined oil but does not include contaminantspresent in or mixed with the petroleum. Under section 9003(h), the Agencymay undertake or order corrective action with respect to a release of petroleumfrom an UST system. The response program, however, is not limited to USTsystems containing solely petroleum but, rather, requires only that therelease from the UST <T3>contain</T3> petroleum. Thus, petroleum-hazardous substance mixtureswould also be subject to the section 9003(h) corrective action authorities.This is consistent with Congressional statements concerning the jurisdictionof the section 9003(h) program. (See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 962, 99th Congress,2d. Sess., p. 228 (1986).) <T3>(d) </T3>A tank is 10 percent or more <T3>beneath the surface of the ground </T3>if its volume (including thevolume of its connected underground piping) is 10 percent or more beneaththe ground surface or otherwise covered with earthen materials. This definition reflects the intent of the UST regulations to govern undergroundtanks that could leak directly into the ground undetected. Thus, the followingtypes of tanks are included within UST jurisdiction: Tanks that are underground;in-ground open-top tanks; and tanks that are above grade but are coveredwith earthen materials (for example, to comply with fire codes). Tanksthat are above the ground surface and are covered with non-earthen materialsare not included within the scope of this definition. The phrase ``so that physical inspection is precluded'' has been removedfrom this definition since proposal. One commenter argued that this phrasecould be construed to bring under the jurisdiction of the UST program anytotally aboveground tank that is permanently covered or shielded from view(e.g., by insulation). EPA agrees with this commenter that such tanks,as long as their volume, including the volume of connected undergroundpiping, is not 10 percent or more beneath the surface of the ground, arenot the focus of this program and should not be subject to UST regulations.These tanks are not subject to the same corrosive forces as are undergroundtanks and may be more easily inspected visually than other belowgroundtanks. Other commenters referred to aboveground tanks that are enclosed in concretevaults and are surrounded by inert material such as sand or vermiculite.The commenters believed that these tanks should not be defined as USTs.Under the changes to this definition in today's rule, aboveground tankssurrounded by sand would be within the scope of these regulations, becausesand is an earthen material and has the potential to create corrosion.Vermiculite is not considered an earthen material and would not promotecorrosion, and, therefore, tanks that are covered by this material arenot considered USTs. The statute excludes nine types of tanks from the definition of undergroundstorage tank. Eight of these nine types of exclusions are described below.The ninth, on septic tanks, is not discussed because no changes have beenmade to the proposal and no comments were submitted to EPA on this exclusion.<T3>(2) Farm or Residential Motor Fuel Tank Exclusion. </T3>The first groupof tanks excluded by the statute is <T3>``farm or residential tanks </T3>of 1,100 gallons or less capacityused for storing <T3>motor fuel </T3>for <T3>noncommercial purposes.'' </T3>Following are definitions for the keyterms of this exemption.<T3>(a) </T3>A <T3>farm </T3>tank is a tank located on a tract of land devoted to theproduction of crops or raising of animals, including fish. To be exemptfrom UST jurisdiction, a farm tank must be located on the farm property.``Farm'' includes fish hatcheries, rangeland, and nurseries with growingoperations. ``Farm'' does not include laboratories where animals are raised, land usedto grow timber, and pesticide aviation operations. Moreover, this definitiondoes not include retail stores or garden centers where the product of nurseryfarms is marketed, but not produced. This definition, as promulgated, isunchanged from the proposal. One commenter argued that tanks at golf courses are essentially the sameas tanks at sod farms; both types are used to hold fuel in support of sodand turf development. For these reasons, the commenter contended, thesetanks deserve to be included under the farm exemption. The Agency doesnot agree that the similarities between sod farms and golf courses meritinclusion of tanks at golf courses within the farm tank exclusion. TheAgency does not believe the term ``farm'' under section 9001 of RCRA, reasonablyinterpreted, includes golf courses or other places dedicated primarilyto recreational, aesthetic, or other non-agricutural activities. <T3>(b) Motor Fuel </T3>in today's rule means petroleum or a petroleum-basedsubstance that is motor gasoline, aviation gasoline, No. 1 or No. 2 dieselfuel, or any grade of gasohol, and is typically used in the operation ofa motor engine. As originally proposed, motor fuel was defined as petroleum-based fuelused in the operation of an engine that propels a vehicle for transportationof people or cargo. In the general interpretation of this phrase, motorfuel was limited to motor gasoline and diesel fuel used in automobiles,trucks, and buses. Many commenters felt that gasohols should be added tothe list of motor fuels, because alcohol-type fuels are an alternativeenergy source encouraged by many states such as California. Commentersalso felt that the term motor fuel should not be restricted to vehiclesused for transportation purposes because some motors are stationary engines.The Agency agrees that the proposed definition was unnecessarily restrictive.The final rule lists five types of motor fuel that are typically used tooperate motor engines. Gasohols are included as motor fuels because EPAagrees with public comment that these are commonly used as and understoodto be motor fuels. The proposed language restricting ``motor fuel'' tofuels used in transportation has been deleted from the definition becausethe term ``motor fuel'' does not in itself describe a <T3>use </T3>of the fuel, but rather describes a <T3>type </T3>of fuel. The statutory exclusion already contains a ``use''limitation by restricting the exclusion to motor fuels stored for ``noncommercial''purposes. Accordingly, today's final rule defines motor fuel in terms of specifictypes of fuel. The definition lists typical uses to give descriptive, notrestrictive, information about these substances. The final rule thus includesfuels used in stationary motors. The structure of this definition parallelsthat of heating oils. <T3>(3) Heating Oil Tanks Exclusion. </T3>The second group of tanks excludedfrom UST jurisdiction by statute are tanks used for storing <T3>``heating oil </T3>for <T3>consumptive use on the premises where stored.'' </T3>Following aredefinitions for key terms of this exclusion: <T3>(a) Heating Oil </T3>means petroleum that is No. 1, No. 2, No. 4-light,No. 4-heavy, No. 5-light, No. 5-heavy and No. 6 technical grades of fueloil; other residual fuel oils (including Navy Special Fuel Oil and BunkerC); and other fuels when used as substitutes for one of these fuel oils.Heating oil is typically used in the operation of heating equipment, boilers,or furnaces. The proposed rule defined heating oil as either one of eight technicalgrades of fuel oil (No. 1; No. 2; No. 4-light; No. 4-heavy; No. 5-light;No. 5-heavy; No. 6; and residual) or fuel oil substitutes such as keroseneor diesel when used for heating purposes. This definition has been revisedin the final rule to clarify which technical grades of fuel oil the Agencybelieves are heating oil. In addition, the definition has been revisedin response to comments on the use of heating oil substitutes. The list of grades of fuel oils has been reworded because, since proposal,the Agency has discovered that ``residual'' is not a specific technicalgrade of fuel oil, but refers to several grades of fuel derived from certainoperations in the refinery process. Also, Navy Special Fuel Oil and BunkerC are included in the final definition as examples of residual fuels. Several commenters suggested changes to the definition to modify the applicabilityof the heating oil exclusion to tanks storing fuel oil substitutes. Severalcommenters stated that both No. 2 diesel fuel and kerosene should be includedas heating oil because their chemical makeup is similar to each other andNo. 2 fuel oil. Additional commenters thought that the exclusion shouldnot be limited to oil used for heating purposes. The Agency agrees thatthe heating limitation is inconsistent with the statutory language of theexclusion that limits ``use'' only by requiring ``consumptive'' use. Thefinal rule definition, therefore, includes heating as a typical use ofthe fuels but does not limit the exclusion to fuels so used. The exclusiondoes, however, limit the use of substitutes to those situations where thesubstitute is actually used in place of one of the technical grades offuel oil. For example, tanks that contain used oil at a typical retailgas station are not excluded unless the used oil is consumed on-site asa substitute for fuel oil (burned in an on-site space heater, for example).Tanks that store used oil awaiting recycling pickup are not heating oiltanks. Another example of a tank that is not a heating oil tank is onethat stores diesel fuel for an on-site motor generator. Even though dieselfuel is sometimes burned in boilers as a substitute for heating oil, itis the fuel of choice for internal combustion engines. It is, thus, nota substitute for one of the technical grades of heating oil in this situation.Thus, heating oil is defined in the final rule in terms of specific gradesof oil or their substitutes. A sentence has been added to the definitionlisting typical uses of heating oil. This list provides descriptive, notrestrictive, information about these substances and parallels the definitionof motor fuel. <T3>(b) Consumptive use </T3>means used on the premises. Accordingly, thisexclusion applies to tanks at residential, commercial and industrial facilitiesstoring heating oil that is used at the same site. The heating oil exclusiondoes not apply to the storage of heating oil for resale, marketing, ordistribution. In the preamble to the proposed rule, EPA stated that ``consumptive use''was not intended to be limited to only space heating purposes, and describedother uses of heating oil that would qualify for this exclusion. This definitionhas been modified since the proposed rule to clarify that tanks holdingheating oil for any on-site use, such as heating or to power a generator,are exempt from regulation. Several commenters supported this interpretation of consumptive use. Heatingoil used to produce steam, process heat, electricity, and emergency powerwere among the consumptive uses that the commenters thought should be includedin the heating oil exclusion. Today's definition clarifies that these usesare within the scope of this exclusion. Several commenters argued that tanks storing diesel fuel for use in emergencygenerators should be exempt as tanks storing heating oil. As explainedabove, no restrictions are being placed on the use of the heating oil underthis exclusion, except that it be used consumptively on-site.<T3>(c) On the premises where stored </T3>means tanks located on the sameproperty where the stored heating oil is used. Tanks are excluded as longas the oil is stored anywhere on the same property. ``On the premises''is not limited to the building where the heating oil is stored. Thus, centralizedheating units using heating oil that serve more than one building on thesame property would be excluded. In addition, several commenters provided suggestions that would resultin narrower interpretations of this exclusion by regulating one of thefollowing segments: All residential and commercial tanks; all commercialtanks; all tanks at commercial and government buildings; all residentialbuildings of six or more units; or all tanks above a certain size. TheAgency recognizes the concerns expressed by these comments but believesthat the statutory language prevents adoption of such suggestions. Underthe statute, the exclusion of heating oil tanks is not limited to certaincategories of heating oil tanks (e.g., only residential or only tanks lessthan 1,100 gallons). Congress did recognize, however, that heating oiltanks may require some regulation and required that EPA study this universeof exempt tanks and make recommendations concerning regulation (section9009). <T3>(4) Pipeline Facilities Exclusion. </T3>The fourth exclusion covers``any <T3>pipeline facility (including gathering lines) </T3>(1) regulated underthe Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (49 U.S.C. App. 1671, <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) regulated under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline SafetyAct of 1979 (49 U.S.C. App. 2001,<T3> et seq.</T3>), or (3) which is an intrastate pipeline facility regulatedunder state laws comparable to the provisions of the laws referred to above.<T3>``Pipeline facilities (including gathering lines)'' </T3>include newand existing pipe rights-of-way and any equipment, facilities, or buildingsused in the transportation of gas (or hazardous liquids, which includepetroleum and any other liquid designated by the Secretary of Transportation)or the treatment of gas or designated hazardous liquids during the courseof transportation. The definition of pipeline facilities was adapted from the definition ofthat term as used in the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (NGPSA)and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979. ``Pipeline facility''may also include any such intrastate facility as defined and regulatedunder state laws comparable to these two federal statutes. This definitionincludes sumps, drip tanks, skimmer pits, lubrication oil collection devices,and any other containers that are directly connected to regulated oil orgas pipelines or gas plants. This equipment would qualify as equipmentused in the transportation of gas or hazardous liquid or the treatmentof gas or hazardous liquids during the course of transportation. One commenter pointed out that the definition of pipeline facilities inthis rule differs from the definition which appears in the NGPSA. Thiscommenter believed the Agency was mandated by Congress to adopt the definitionfrom the NGPSA. The Agency intended that the definition that appears inthese regulations mean the same as that definition that appears in NGPSA;the word changes were only for abbreviation. The Agency has retained thewording from the proposed rule. <T3>(5) Surface Impoundments, Pits, Ponds and Lagoons Exclusion. </T3>Thefifth exclusion covers any <T3>``surface impoundment, pit, pond or lagoon.'' </T3>A surface impoundmentis defined as a natural topographic depression, man-made excavation, ordiked area formed primarily of earthen materials (although it may be linedwith man-made materials) that is not an injection well. Since the proposed regulations, this definition has been changed and nolonger stipulates that the surface impoundment be designed to hold an accumulationof regulated substances. This phrase created confusion among commentersand was considered unnecessary. <T3>(6) Storm-Water or Wastewater Collection Systems Exclusion. </T3>Thesixth exclusion covers a <T3>``storm-water or wastewater collection system.'' </T3>A storm-wateror wastewater collection system is defined as all piping, pumps, conduits,and any other equipment necessary to collect and transport the flow ofsurface water runoff resulting from precipitation, or domestic, commercial,and industrial waste water to and from detention areas or areas where treatmentis designated to occur. The collection of storm water and wastewater doesnot include treatment except where incidental to conveyance. This definition is substantially the same as the proposed definition, withone addition to clarify that treatment is not included as part of a collectionsystem. The Agency received several comments on the definition of a collectionsystem and also on the applicability of the UST regulations to wastewatertreatment tanks. In general, the commenters were critical of any attemptby the Agency to define collection system so that treatment tanks, includingoil-water separators, would be regulated. The various reasons and argumentsused by commenters are discussed below. Several commenters stated that treatment tanks are logically included aspart of the collection system, and that Congress intended to exclude thetanks from these regulations. The word ``system'' implies that everythingrelated to the collection of storm water and wastewater, including pipingand tanks, should be excluded, according to commenters. Two commenters stated that it is illogical to exclude the pipes and pumpsof a collection system but not the treatment tanks. The sole purpose ofthese tanks, one commenter pointed out, is to reduce the degree of contaminationof the water and lessen the threat of environmental harm. Another commenterstated that regulation of wastewater treatment tanks would penalize thosewho pretreat at the request of a POTW, and regulation may discourage on-sitetreatment. Both comments disagreed with any attempt to regulate these tanks.Several commenters argued that treatment tanks, and in particular oil-waterseparators, should be excluded because they are flow-through process tanks.Several commenters believe that treatment tanks are already regulated underother federal laws, including the Clean Water Act and the Safe DrinkingWater Act. Further regulation under Subtitle I would be unwarranted andunnecessary, according to the commenters. EPA does not agree with commenters who argued that a collection systemincludes tanks where treatment is designated to occur. Collection and treatmentare separate and distinct functions. The Agency continues to believe thatthe collection system includes all piping, pumps, and conduits that extendto and from areas where treatment is designated to occur. The Agency does not believe that it is illogical to regulate wastewatertreatment tanks, although their purpose is to lessen the concentrationof regulated substances in the water. Such tanks serve as receptacles forregulated substances, and may leak as any other tanks may leak, with adverseresults. To categorically exclude all such tanks from regulation may riskenvironmental damage. EPA also does not agree with commenters who argued that treatment tanks,particularly oil-water separators, should be classified as flow-throughprocess tanks and therefore excluded. Treatment tanks do not form partof a production process, so they cannot be classified as flow-through processtanks.EPA does agree, however, with the commenters who argued that some wastewatertreatment tanks are adequately regulated by other Federal regulations.After reviewing the comments, EPA has decided not to regulate any wastewatertreatment tanks that are part of a wastewater treatment facility that issubject to regulation under either section 402 or 307(b) of the Clean WaterAct. The primary reason for this decision is that, because such tanks arealready subject to regulation under the CWA, additional regulation underSubtitle I is unnecessary to protect human health and the environment.Other wastewater treatment tanks may be excluded because they contain only<T3>de minimis </T3>concentrations of regulated substances. Wastewatertreatment tanks that are not subject to regulation by the CWA sections402 or 307(b) and that contain greater than <T3>de minimis </T3>concentrations of regulated substances will continueto be deferred from regulation. This deferral reflects the Agency's uncertaintyregarding the nature of these tanks and the appropriateness of the USTregulations to wastewater treatment tanks. More discussion on wastewatertreatment tanks is provided under that heading in section IV.A.3. <T3>(7) Flow-Through Process Tank Exclusion. </T3>The seventh exclusioncovers any flow-through process tank. Under today's final rule, a flow-throughprocess tank is a tank that forms an integral part of a production processthrough which there is a steady, variable, recurring, or intermittent flowof materials during the operation of the process. Flow-through processtanks do not include tanks used for the storage of materials prior to theirintroduction to the process or for the storage of finished products orby-products from the production process. Today's definition differs from the proposed definition in several respects.This exclusion now applies to tanks that are a part of a production process,rather than to tanks that are part of an industrial or commercial process.It now applies not only to tanks with steady or uninterrupted flow, butalso to tanks with variable, recurring, or intermittent flow. The exclusionalso now applies to tanks that hold intermediates. The scope of the flow-through process tank exclusion has been one of themost difficult to define and most controversial interpretative issues,due to the lack of legislative guidance and a commonly understood technicalmeaning, as well as the potential for the exclusions, broadly interpreted,to encompass nearly all of the UST universe. Although the definition of the terms ``flow-through'' and ``process'' haveundergone several changes since EPA's first interpretation in the April1986 guidance, these changes have been intended to clarify the Agency'sinterpretation of the scope of the exclusion and not to fundamentally alterthat interpretation. EPA believes that this exclusion encompasses tanksthat are an integral part of a production process and through which materialsflow during the operation of that process. Application of leak detectionor other tank standards to such tanks would generally be difficult to implementand potentially disruptive to vital production processes. The changes tothis definition since the April 1986 guidance have resulted from commentson the April guidance, on the proposed definition, and on the SupplementalNotice. These comments are discussed below. The original definition of this term that appeared in the April 1986 guidancedocument defined flow-through process tank to include any tank that waspart of a ``manufacturing'' process that had ``steady or uninterruptedflow.'' The original definition did not refer to tanks that held intermediates.This definition was thought by many commenters to be too restrictive intwo respects: They stated that not only manufacturing tanks but also otherindustrial and commercial tanks should qualify; and that the requirementthat the flow be steady would mean many tanks that operate in a batch fashionoutside the scope of this exclusion. The Agency agreed to some degree with these early commenters and, thus,included in the 1987 proposal a different definition than the one thatappeared in the 1986 guidance. The proposed definition applied to ``industrialand commercial'' tanks, rather than to ``manufacturing'' tanks. The definitioncontinued to restrict this exclusion, however, to tanks with a ``steadyor uninterrupted'' flow of materials but added ``during the operation ofthe process'' in an attempt to accommodate commenters' concerns regardingbatch processes. The proposed definition also stipulated that tanks thatstored intermediates were not flow-through process tanks. In the proposal preamble, the Agency expressed concern over what typesof tanks would qualify as ``flow-through process tanks'' if the definitionwere expanded to include non-steady flow. Specifically, EPA was concernedthat tanks at gasoline stations, airports, rental car agencies, and othersuch ``commercial'' locations could be construed to be flow-through processtanks if the flow of materials was allowed to be recurring. Thus, suchan interpretation could exclude most tanks from the regulated UST universe.These concerns, in part, led to the issuance of a supplemental notice requestingcomments on clarifying ``process'' to mean ``production process'' ratherthan ``industrial and commercial process'' as proposed in April 1987. Several commenters addressed the issue of the types of facilities whereflow-through process tanks may be located, in response to requests forcomments in both the proposed rule and the supplemental notice. Commentsin response to the proposed definition showed general agreement with thechange (since the April guidance) to ``industrial and commercial'' from``manufacturing.'' One commenter stated that no qualifiers should be includedon the term ``process.'' Examples of non-manufacturing processes givenby one commenter included oil and gas production, gas processing, wastewatercollection and treatment, and recycling tanks. Other commenters suggestedthat hydraulic lifts, oil-water separators, and electrical equipment shouldbe flow-through process tanks. Several commenters supported the change proposed in the Supplemental Noticeto ``production process'' from an ``industrial or commercial process.''According to commenters, this change ``makes sense,'' ``is in accordancewith Congressional intent,'' and ``clarifies that storage tanks are notflow-through process tanks.'' Several commenters, however, argued thatthe change to ``production process'' would be a narrowing of the exclusionthat is not supported by Congressional intent. This change would also notbe easier to implement, according to one commenter. One commenter suggestedthat flow-through process tanks used in the distribution of electric powerwere an example of a flow-through process tank that is clearly ``industrialor commercial process,'' but is not necessarily ``production.'' Anothercommenter stated that ``production'' implies a tangible good is produced,and thus a ``production process'' is no different than a ``manufacturingprocess.'' Specifically, this commenter referred to tanks in the dry cleaningindustry, which would be outside the scope of this exemption if a tangiblegood was required to be produced. With respect to the interpretation of the term ``flow-through,'' severalcommenters believed that the requirement that the flow be steady or uninterrupted(during the operation of the process) was too restrictive, and would resultin the regulation of many tanks that the commenters believed qualify forthis exclusion. For example, these commenters pointed out that many tanksin a process stream are batch tanks, where the flow of materials is recurringor interrupted. Such tanks are common in the chemical industry. The commentersalso cited process tanks with variable flows, for which there is no flowsome or most of the time, as examples of the type of tank that should beincluded in this exclusion. The preamble to the proposed rule discussed allowing tanks that have aninterruption in steady flow due to periodic maintenance or emergency shutdownto remain within the scope of this exclusion. The proposal preamble alsostated that if a flow-through process tank regularly stores materials duringperiod of interruption, it is a storage tank and not a flow-through processtank. Several commenters stated that tanks that ``store'' substances underthese circumstances should still qualify for this exclusion because itmay not be possible to remove all the material from the tank, and thatthis requirement seemed to imply that these tanks must be completely emptywhen the process was not in operation. In the proposal preamble, the Agency also asked for comments on whether``integral to the process'' would include governmentally required wastewatertreatment tanks that are a necessary part of the industrial or commercialprocess. Several commenters stated that wastewater treatment tanks, includingoil-water separators, should be considered flow-through process tanks becausetreatment of wastes is a process and is an integral part of any facility.One commenter stated that oil-water separators should not be consideredflow-through process tanks because they are covered in UL 1316. The discussion of flow-through process in the proposal preamble statedthat tanks that store intermediates were not flow-through process tanks.Several commenters argued that tanks storing intermediates are a necessarypart of the process in order for the process to be conducted safely andto allow for an adequate supply of raw materials to be used in batch-operatedprocesses. They further stated that intermediate tanks store materialson a very temporary basis and consequently do not pose the same hazardsas a tank that is in use at all times.EPA also requested factual information, in particular process diagrams,indicating what tanks should be excluded as flow-through process tanks,given the nature of the specific process and function of the tank. Onecommenter provided the following examples: Holding tanks; feed tanks; mixingtanks; tanks that hold materials being cut in concentration; and othertanks in the process train. As discussed above, the definition of flow-through process tank as promulgatedtoday is different in several respects from the proposed definition. Themajor differences are: The substitution of the phrase ``production process''for ``industrial or commercial process''; the change to ``steady, variable,recurring, or intermittent'' flow from ``steady or uninterrupted'' flow;and that tanks storing intermediates are now included as flow-through processtanks. With respect to the interpretation of the term ``process,'' the Agencyagrees with those commenters who supported the change to ``production process''from ``industrial and commercial process,'' and is incorporating that phraseinto the definition of flow-through process tank. EPA does not agree withcommenters who argued that this wording is an unauthorized narrowing ofthe interpretation of this term. In response to the commenter who statedthat the word ``production'' implies ``making'' or ``manufacturing,'' andthat the phrase ``production process'' would then be interpreted as ``manufacturingprocess,'' the Agency does not intend to limit this exclusion only to manufacturingprocesses. Rather, any process at manufacturing, commercial, or industrialfacilities where a tangible good or service is produced or performed maybe considered a production process. Production processes include a widevariety of facilities and processes, including many at petroleum refineries,chemical manufacturing facilities, and automobile assembly plants. EPAdoes not agree, however, that ``process'' should be unqualified. Allowingthe interpretation of this term to be unrestricted could result in an unreasonableinterpretation of this exclusion, which, in effect, removes virtually alltanks from UST regulation since a tank related to<T3> any </T3>process through which there is a periodic flow of materialsdescribes most storage tanks. The Agency has changed its previous definition to allow steady, variable,recurring, or intermittent flow. Based on comments received on the proposedrule, the Agency realized that the revised definition did not effectivelyinclude batch process tanks, contrary to the Agency's intention, becausebatch processing can involve flows that are other than steady or uninterruptedduring the operation of the process. In addition, EPA limited ``flow-through''to steady or uninterrupted flow, rather than ``recurring'' flow to avoideliminating jurisdiction over tanks with periodic inflow and outflow, includingUST systems at gasoline filling stations. The Agency now believes, however,that by allowing variable or recurring flow, but limiting this exclusionto production processes, this concern is no longer relevant. Tanks thatdo form a part of a production process are often operated in a batch fashion,where inflow and outflow are periodic rather than steady or uninterrupted.EPA believes that the inclusion of such tanks is consistent with the intentof this exclusion, which is to preclude regulation of tanks that form anintegral part of a production process. Under the same rationale, EPA agrees with commenters that tanks that holdintermediates may be an integral part of a production process. Accordingly,tanks that store intermediates as part of a production process are flow-throughprocess tanks. Similarly, the Agency agrees with the commenter who suggestedthat holding tanks, pulse tanks, feed tanks, mixing tanks, tanks that holdmaterial being cut in concentration, and other tanks in the process streamare flow-through process tanks. The Agency does not agree, however, that wastewater treatment tanks, includingoil-water separators, are flow-through process tanks. These tanks do notform an integral part of a production process. Wastewater treatment tankstypically follow the production process, and in no way contribute to theproduction itself. Many of these treatment tanks, however, fall withinthe regulatory exclusion for tanks that are subject to CWA requirementsor are excluded because they contain <T3>de minimis </T3>concentrations of regulated substances; wastewatertreatment tanks that are not excluded are deferred from these regulations(see section IV.A.3.). For the same reasons, hydraulic lifts and electricalequipment, which commenters suggested should be defined as flow-throughprocess tanks, are not. Hydraulic lift tanks and electrical equipment donot form part of a production process. One commenter requested clarification on whether processes in service industries,specifically the dry cleaning industry, would qualify as ``production processes.''In the dry cleaning industry, the main ``product,'' the cleaning of garments,is really a service. As stated above, EPA does not intend to restrict thephrase ``production process'' solely to industries where a tangible goodis produced. Tanks that contain regulated substances that are integralto the dry cleaning process are eligible for consideration as flow-throughprocess tanks. The tanks in dry cleaning machines, however, store regulatedsubstances prior to their introduction to the cleaning process. Thus, thesetanks are not flow-through process tanks. <T3>(8) Liquid Traps or Gathering Lines Related to Oil or Gas Productionand Gathering Operations. </T3>The eighth exclusion covers <T3>``liquid traps </T3>or associated <T3>gathering lines </T3>directly related to oil or gas production andgathering operations.'' The liquid trap exclusion refers to sumps, wellcellars, and other traps used in association with oil and gas production,gathering, and extraction operations (including gas production plants),for the purpose of collecting oil, water and other liquids. Such liquidtraps may temporarily collect liquids for subsequent disposition or reinjectioninto a production or pipeline stream, or may collect and separate liquidsfrom a gas stream. This exclusion applies only to traps and gathering lines, and does notinclude other storage tanks at oil and gas production sites. Similarly,although liquid traps are often used in activities other than oil and gasproduction, the only liquid traps excluded from UST jurisdiction underthis provision are liquid traps used for the purpose of separating oiland gas liquids from water at oil and gas production facilities. Liquidtraps used in conjunction with landfill methane gas production facilitiesare within this exclusion and would not be subject to UST jurisdiction.Liquid traps such as grease and oil traps at gas stations, however, arenot within this exclusion. <T3>Gathering lines </T3>are defined as any pipeline, equipment, facility,or building used in the transportation of oil or gas during oil or gasproduction or gathering operations. Several commenters argued that EPA misinterpreted Congressional intentbecause the proposal preamble implied that this exclusion was limited tounused oil. The commenters suggested it should apply to both used and unusedoil at oil and gas production sites. The Agency agrees with these commentersbecause this exemption is aimed generally at collection traps and gatheringlines at oil and gas production facilities and does not distinguish betweenproduced oil, used oil, or unused oil at those facilities. Although many petroleum pipeline facilities are regulated under the HazardousLiquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, and thus excluded from Subtitle I jurisdiction,tanks associated with gathering lines in rural areas are statutorily exemptfrom Department of Transportation regulations. Tanks associated with ruraloil and gas pipelines, however, are exempted as ``gathering lines'' underthis exclusion. Thus, tanks associated with rural pipelines that are notexcluded from Subtitle I jurisdiction via the exclusion for pipeline facilitieswould be subject to this exclusion. <T3>(9) Underground Areas Exclusion. </T3>The ninth exclusion covers ``storagetanks situated in an underground area (such as a basement, cellar, mineworking, drift, shaft, or tunnel) if the storage tank is situated uponor above the surface of the floor.''This exclusion applies to ``underground rooms'' in which tanks are locatedon or above the floor surface. The purpose of this exclusion is to removefrom UST jurisdiction tanks that are technically underground but that alsoare, in a practical sense, no different from aboveground tanks. They aresituated so that, to the same extent as tanks aboveground, physical inspectionfor leaks is possible. Thus, the requirement to be able to physically inspectthe tank for leaks is consistent with the purpose of this exclusion. Tanks located in a below-grade structural vault, cellar, basement, mineor other underground room would be included in this exclusion if the tankssit upon or above the surface of the floor and there is sufficient spaceto enable physical inspection of the tank, but not necessarily the tankbottom. An underground tank that has a secondary containment system thatallows physical inspection of the tank would also qualify for this exclusion.b. <T3>Definition of Terms Used in the Regulations. </T3>In addition to thepreceding definitions of terms that clarify the statutory exclusions insection 9001 of Subtitle I, the Agency is setting forth the following definitionsof terms used in the rule. This section today contains several terms thatwere not defined in the proposed rule. These terms have been included todayin response to requests from commenters or to clarify other terms usedin today's rule. These terms include cathodic protection tester, dielectricmaterial, maintenance, pipe or piping, repair, and upgrading. Several termsthat appeared in the proposed rule do not appear in this section of thepreamble because they are no longer defined in the final rule. These termsare discussed (along with comment summaries and responses) in section IV.D.of today's preamble and include interstitial monitoring, inventory control,secondary barrier, and tank tightness testing. Also, liquid trap is nowdefined and discussed in the statutory exclusion section in IV.A.1. Finally, several terms have not changed, did not receive public commentssince proposal, and thus are not included here: Electrical equipment; operationallife; overfill release; positive sampling, test, or monitoring results;release detection; and underground release. Explanations of these termsare found in the preamble to the April 1987 proposal. <T3>(1) Aboveground Release. </T3>``Aboveground release'' means any releaseto the surface of the land or to surface water. This includes, but is notlimited to, releases from the aboveground portion of an underground storagetank system and aboveground releases associated with overfills and transferoperations as the regulated substance moves to or from an UST system. Two commenters asked if the applicability of this term is determined bywhere the material escapes the UST or where it is eventually found. Commentersstated that a release from below the ground may eventually migrate to thesurface, and a spill to the ground could infiltrate into the subsurface.The Agency has interpreted this term to apply to all leaks from the abovegroundportion of an UST, including spills and overfills. The source of a leak,rather than its ultimate destination, is the determinant in assigning aleak to this category. <T3>(2) Ancillary Equipment. </T3>``Ancillary equipment'' means any devicesincluding, but not limited to, such devices as piping, fittings, flanges,valves, and pumps, that are used to distribute, meter, or control the flowof petroleum or hazardous substances to and from an underground storagetank. This definition has not changed since the proposed rule. Some commentersasked if certain equipment, such as aboveground meters and pumps, was consideredto be ancillary equipment, and to what extent such equipment would be regulated.EPA has clarified the discussion of ancillary equipment in the sectionon release detection to address the commenters' concerns. <T3>(3) Belowground Release. </T3>``Belowground release'' means any releaseto the subsurface of the land and to ground water. This includes, but isnot limited to, releases from the belowground portions of an undergroundstorage tank system and belowground releases associated with overfillsand transfer operations as the regulated substance moves to or from anunderground storage tank.This definition is slightly different from the proposed rule, which containeddifferent definitions for this term in the preamble and the rule. EPA hasadopted the more general definition set forth in the proposal preamble.The definition in the final rule has also been clarified by substitutingthe term ``regulated substance'' for ``petroleum'' to include all regulatedUST systems. <T3>(4) Cathodic Protection. </T3>``Cathodic protection'' is a techniqueto prevent corrosion of a metal surface by making that surface the cathodeof an electrochemical cell. For example, a tank system can be cathodicallyprotected through the application of either galvanic anodes or impressedcurrent. The phrase ``for example'' has been added to this definition since theproposed rule to emphasize that cathodic protection may be provided byeither galvanic anodes or impressed current, but is not required to beone of the two. Any other technique that provides cathodic protection mayalso be used. <T3>(5) Cathodic Protection Tester. </T3>``Cathodic protection tester''means a person who can demonstrate an understanding of the principles andmeasurement of all common types of cathodic protection systems as appliedto buried or submerged metal piping and tank systems. This person musthave education and experience in the measurement of cathodic protectionof buried metal piping and tank systems. This definition was also addedto the final rule in response to comments on the qualifications necessaryfor corrosion protection test personnel and is discussed in more detailin section IV.C.2. of this preamble. <T3>(6) Compatible. </T3>``Compatible'' means the ability of two or moresubstances to maintain their respective physical properties upon contactwith one another for the design life of the tank system under conditionslikely to be encountered in the UST. One commenter suggested that the proposed definition, which based compatibilityupon whether substances could maintain physical and chemical properties``upon contact with one another for extended periods of time and undervaried environmental conditions (i.e., at different temperatures),'' wasambiguous due to the phrases ``extended periods of time'' and ``variedenvironmental conditions (i.e., at different temperatures).'' The Agencyagrees that these terms were vague and has replaced the phrase with ``forthe design life of the tank system under conditions likely to be encounteredin the UST.'' <T3>(7) Corrosion Expert. </T3>A ``corrosion expert'' is a person who,by reason of thorough knowledge of the physical sciences and the principlesof engineering and mathematics acquired by a professional education andrelated practical experience, is qualified to engage in the practice ofcorrosion control on buried or submerged metal piping systems and metaltanks. This person must be accredited as being qualified by the NationalAssociation of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) or be a registered professionalengineer who has certification or licensing that includes education andexperience in corrosion control of buried or submerged metal piping systemsand metal tanks. As proposed, this definition required NACE certification. One commenterpointed out that NACE provides accreditation, not certification of corrosionexpertise. NACE does in fact accredit and certify corrosion expertise.The final definition has been modified to take this into account. NACEalso has recently introduced a certification program for cathodic protectionspecialists and cathodic protection testers. Several commenters argued that the requirements for a corrosion expertwere unnecessarily strict, and that their use would exclude many qualifiedpeople from work on UST systems. Many people, the commenters argued, didnot have NACE certification or a professional engineering degree but werehighly qualified based on their experience. The requirements of the definition(specifically, that a corrosion expert be accredited by NACE or have othertypes of licensing or certification) are not expected by EPA to excludesuch qualified persons from work as corrosion experts unless they cannotsatisfy the tests for accreditation. Thus, they are intended to providesome type of assurance to tank owners and operators, as well as implementingagencies, that a corrosion expert actually has achieved a minimum degreeof expertise and experience needed to ensure corrosion is managed in away that prevents leaks from UST systems and hereby protects human healthand the environment. People who have attained the necessary qualificationsthrough experience should be able to easily become NACE accredited. <T3>(8) Dielectric Material. </T3>A ``dielectric material'' is one thatdoes not conduct direct electric current. Dielectric coatings are usedto electrically isolate UST systems from the surrounding soils. Dielectricbushings are used to electrically isolate portions of the UST system (i.e.,tank from piping). This definition was added to the final rule in responseto comments; see section IV.B.3.b. of today's preamble for further discussionof this issue. <T3>(9) Excavation Zone. </T3>``Excavation zone'' is defined as the volumecontaining the tank system and backfill material bounded by the groundsurface, walls, and floor of the pit and trenches into which the UST systemis placed at the time of installation. The Agency has changed this term in the final rule from excavation ``area''to excavation ``zone'' to indicate measurement in three dimensions. <T3>(10) Existing Tank System. </T3>``Existing tank system'' means a tanksystem used to contain an accumulation of regulated substance or for whichinstallation has commenced on or before the effective date of this regulation.Installation is considered to have commenced if: (1) The owner or operatorhas obtained all Federal, State, and local approvals or permits necessaryto begin physical construction of the site or installation of the tanksystem; and (2) if either: (a) A continuous on-site physical constructionor installation program has begun, or (b) the owner or operator has enteredinto contractual obligations_which cannot be canceled or modified withoutsubstantial loss_for physical construction at the site, or installationof the tank system, to be completed within a reasonable time. Existing tanks that are converted from tanks storing non-regulated substancesto tanks storing regulated substances after the effective date of the rulesare considered ``new tank systems'' and are required to meet new tank standards.One commenter stated that the language in the preamble to the proposedrule implied that UST systems that were permanently taken out of serviceor decommissioned before the effective date of the regulations are ``existingtank systems.'' Tanks that have been taken out of service would not meetthe definition of ``existing tank system'' if they contained no regulatedsubstances. However, the definition of ``existing tank system'' is onlyrelevant to the determination of when certain requirements must be met,not which requirements apply. Certain regulatory requirements apply toout-of-service tanks that were used in the past for the storage of regulatedsubstances. Subpart G (andSection; 280.70) addresses out-of-service tanks,and this issue is addressed in section IV.G. of this preamble.<T3>(11) Free Product. </T3>``Free product'' refers to a regulated substancethat is present as a non-aqueous-phase liquid (e.g., liquid not dissolvedin water). The proposal defined free product as ``regulated substance in the non-aqueousphase (e.g., liquid not dissolved in water) that is beneath the surfaceof the ground.'' One commenter suggested that this phrase should includea non-aqueous phase regulated substance that is on surface water. The Agencyagrees that this is free product and has modified the definition accordingly.Other commenters suggested that EPA clarify the definition to clearly excludevapors from this definition. The Agency agrees that vapors are not freeproduct and has added the term `liquid' to the definition. Another commentersuggested a lower thickness limit of one-eighth of an inch be used as acutoff; any layer of product with thickness lower than this should notbe considered free product. The Agency does not agree with this conceptbecause in some instances very thin layers may still be retrievable. Theregulations require that free product must be removed to the maximum extentpracticable as a part of the total site cleanup. Other commenters suggested that the definition be modified to include afield criteria for use in corrective action. The Agency has chosen to notinclude this type of criteria because determining the presence of freeproduct and the extent to which it can be removed depends on site conditionsand the technology employed. EPA believes that it is preferable to leavethis determination to the discretion of the implementing agency. This issueis discussed in more detail in section IV.F. of this preamble. <T3>(12) Hazardous Substance UST System. </T3>``Hazardous substance USTsystem'' means an UST system containing either (a) hazardous substancesdefined in section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (but not including any substanceregulated as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C) or (b) any mixture ofsuch substances and petroleum that is not regulated as a petroleum USTsystem. Thus, the final rule, in effect, defines a hazardous substanceUST system as any UST system storing regulated substances which is nota petroleum UST system. It is essentially a catchall for any UST systemfor which the effectiveness of petroleum release detection and correctiveaction technology is uncertain. By contrast, in the proposed rule, a hazardoussubstance tank system was defined as a system containing an accumulationof hazardous substances or a mixture of such substances and petroleum inwhich hazardous substances comprise greater than 50 percent of the weightor volume of the mixture. The change from the proposed to the final definitioneliminates the proposed 50-percent mixture rule for distinguishing tankssubject to the petroleum release detection requirements. Many commenters agreed with the Agency's proposal in the Supplemental Noticethat a substance not found on the petroleum list but listed under CERCLAshould be regulated as a hazardous substance. Other commenters felt thatif a hazardous substance was a constituent in petroleum, then that substanceshould be regulated like petroleum when it is stored in its pure form.Other commenters stated the converse argument: That because some hazardoussubstances are constituents in petroleum, then petroleum should be regulatedas a hazardous substance. The final rules distinguish petroleum and petroleum-based substances fromother hazardous substances or mixtures for the purposes of determiningwhich type of release detection requirements apply to new UST systems.UST systems storing petroleum, including its natural or refinery-added``hazardous substance'' constituents (and stored materials with petroleum-likecharacteristics), are allowed to use a wide range of release detectionmethods in today's rule because petroleum has chemical and physical propertiesthat make it highly detectable and amenable to a wide array of availablecorrective action technologies. A hazardous substance in its pure form,however, does not necessarily retain the same characteristics when it isa constituent in petroleum. Thus, the storage of such hazardous substancesin new UST systems is governed by the release detection requirements fornon-petroleum regulated substances, i.e., secondary containment. In thefinal rule, the determination of which type of release detection requirementis appropriate at an UST storing a regulated substance is not based onthe Agency's interpretation of the definition of ``petroleum'' or ``hazardoussubstance.'' (For further discussions of the differences between petroleumand hazardous substance USTs and their associated release detection requirements,see also section IV.D.2. on hazardous substance release detection, andsection III.C.3. on alternative approaches to hazardous substance UST systems.)In the proposed rule, an UST system was regulated as either a petroleumor hazardous substance UST system based on whether ``petroleum'' or ``hazardoussubstances'' were stored in the system. The problem of how to regulatea mixture of petroleum and hazardous substance was addressed in the proposeddefinitions of hazardous substance UST and petroleum UST by the ``50-percentrule.'' A mixture of regulated substances was subject to either the petroleumUST system requirements or hazardous substance UST system requirementsdepending on which of these substances comprised more than 50 percent ofthe mixture. At proposal, the Agency thought this was a straightforwardway to decide which release detection requirements for new UST systemswere applicable to a mixture or blend of petroleum and hazardous substances.After proposal, however, the Agency became concerned that this approachwould prove to be unworkable because of the difficulty of measuring constituentconcentrations and the uncertainty of how to address constituents of petroleumthat are also hazardous substances. In addition, there is not a singlepercentage value that is applicable to all mixtures and blends for determiningwhen the substance will no longer be reliably detected by one of the releasedetection technologies allowed under the rule for petroleum USTs, and thereis a wide variation in the degree of ``hazardousness'' among the many substanceslisted in section 101(14) of CERCLA. For these reasons, in the Supplemental Notice, the Agency considered replacingthe 50-percent rule with a specific list of all substances and blends ofregulated substances that would be regulated under petroleum UST requirements.Any other blend or mixture of regulated substances would be subject tohazardous substance UST requirements. Many commenters supported the proposed50-percent rule because it was clear and because it would be difficultto list all petroleum substances. Others supported the 50-percent ruleapproach but recommended alternative percent values ranging from 1 percentto 50 percent. Many commenters, particularly state agencies, supportedthe idea of a list because it would lessen the need for determining howto regulate a particular stored mixture, and thereby decrease the burdenon the implementing agencies. It was also believed to give the owner andoperator clear guidelines in determining the status of blends and, therefore,which release detection method to use. These commenters said that any percentagemethod would be cumbersome and difficult to enforce because it would bedifficult to measure concentrations in the UST system. After consideration of all of these comments, EPA concluded that neithera percentage rule nor a comprehensive list of petroleum or petroleum-basedsubstances is a practical solution to the problem of how to determine whichblends and mixtures of regulated substances must meet the release detectionstandards for new UST systems storing hazardous substances. (See the discussionconcerning ``regulated substance'' in section IV.A.4.a. earlier in thispreamble for the reasons why the Agency rejected the proposed comprehensivelist approach.) The main drawback to the percent approach is the variabilityof a meaningful value. For example, 5-percent pesticide mixed in oil or5-percent pentachlorophenol mixed in mineral spirits for application purposesshould be stored in USTs with secondary containment and interstitial monitoringbecause of the high toxicity of these substances and the unavailabilityof highly effective corrective action technologies and release detection.In contrast, a hazardous substance such as methanol that is highly flammableas a pure product can be blended in relatively high proportions with motorgasoline and not change the flammable nature of the motor gasoline. Itcan be safely stored in a protected single-walled tank because releasedetection and corrective action technology are available for the petroleum-methanolmixture; and these methods are the same or very similar to those used forpetroleum products. Thus, the appropriate percentage value to use in determiningthe release detection requirements that must be used at a new UST storinga mixture of regulated substances should be determined by the implementingagency based on a consideration of the following factors: The availabilityof reliable and sensitive release detection, the availability of effectivecorrective action technologies, and the inherent toxicity of the substancestored. The final rule, therefore, does not contain a ``50-percent rule'' to determinehow mixtures of petroleum and hazardous substances should be regulated.Rather, the final rule lists specific substances subject to the petroleumUST system requirements and uses a <T3>de minimis </T3>standard to determine when other mixtures of petroleumand hazardous substances are subject to petroleum UST system standards.A ``petroleum UST system'' is, thus, one which contains petroleum or petroleumand <T3>de minimis </T3>amounts of other regulated substances. Any other USTsystem is a hazardous substance UST system and must be provided with secondarycontainment or obtain a variance. The <T3>de minimis </T3>amount of hazardous substance mixed with a petroleumproduct is that amount in which the additional hazardous substance doesnot alter the detectability, effectiveness of corrective action, or toxicityof the petroleum to any significant degree.<T3>(13) Hydraulic Lift Tank. </T3>``Hydraulic lift tank'' means a tankholding hydraulic fluid for a closed-loop mechanical system that uses compressedair or hydraulic fluid to operate lifts, elevators, and other similar devices.One commenter stated that the definition of this term in the proposal didnot include elevator lifts. In response, the Agency changed this definitionto include lifts that operate by compressed air or hydraulic fluid. Thischange properly includes all elevator lifts within the hydraulic lift definition.<T3>(14) Implementing Agency. </T3>``Implementing agency'' means EPA, or,in the case of a state with a program approved under section 9004 (or pursuantto a memorandum of agreement with EPA), the designated state or local agencyresponsible for carrying out an approved UST program. As the definition states, section 9004 empowers the Agency to approve astate program to operate in lieu of the federal program. The state agencyresponsible for carrying out an approved program is the lead implementingagency for the UST program. A state may decide to work through designatedlocal agencies to carry out the approved program. It is important to notethat the local or state agency responsible for the enforcement of the USTregulations, particularly once the state program is approved, is expectedto be an owner and operator's first contact in any situation involvinga leaking UST system. The state and local agencies could then contact EPAif necessary. <T3>(15) Maintenance. </T3>``Maintenance'' is the normal operational upkeepto prevent an UST from releasing product. This definition has been addedsince proposal in response to requests by several commenters for clarificationof this term. The comments and the use of this term are discussed furtherin section IV.C.2. of this preamble. <T3>(16) New Tank System. </T3>``New tank system'' means a tank systemthat will be used to contain an accumulation of regulated substance andfor which installation has commenced after the effective date of this regulation.Existing tanks that are converted after the effective date of this regulationfrom tanks storing non-regulated substances to tanks storing regulatedsubstances are considered new UST systems and are required to meet newtank standards. <T3>(17) Petroleum UST System. </T3>``Petroleum UST system'' means an USTsystem containing petroleum or mixtures of petroleum with <T3>de minimis </T3>quantities of other regulated substances. Such systemsinclude those containing motor fuels, distillate fuel oils, residual fueloils, lubricants, petroleum solvents, or used oils. In the proposed rule, a petroleum UST system was defined as a system thatcontained an accumulation of petroleum or a mixture of regulated substancesand petroleum in which petroleum comprised greater than 50 percent of theweight or volume of the mixture. In the Supplemental Notice, the Agencyproposed the development of a list of petroleum or petroleum-based substancessubject to the petroleum UST system requirements. Based on public comment,however, the Agency has decided that it would be unworkable, time consuming,and largely unnecessary to specifically identify all possible petroleumproducts, petroleum-based substances, and mixtures of these substanceswith hazardous substances that should be subject to petroleum UST standards.The definition for petroleum UST systems has been revised in two ways inthe final regulation. The 50-percent rule for mixtures has been deletedand replaced with a limitation of non-petroleum regulated substances to<T3>de minimis </T3>levels. Use of this approach is intended to betterdetermine if an UST system qualifies for the new petroleum UST releasedetection methods (see also definition of hazardous substance UST system).In addition, a list consisting of seven general categories of substanceshas been added to the petroleum UST system definition to more clearly identifythe major types of petroleum and petroleum-based substances that may bestored in new protected single-walled tanks with release detection ratherthan only in UST systems that meet the secondary containment requirements.These categories are not substances that necessarily must be defined aspetroleum under CERCLA, but instead are substances for which the Agencyhas determined single-walled tanks with cathodic protection and monthlyrelease detection are adequate to protect human health and the environment.Other mixtures of regulated substances (for example, petroleum productsmixed with non-indigenous hazardous substances or contaminated petroleumproducts) will have to be considered on a case-by-case basis by the implementingagency, using the <T3>de minimis </T3>rule. The EPA anticipates that few blends and mixtureswill present interpretation difficulties. See part (12) of this sectionfor an explanation of the application of the <T3>de minimis </T3>rule. <T3>(18) Pipe or Piping. </T3>A ``pipe'' or ``piping'' is any hollow cylinderor tubular conduit that is constructed of non-earthen materials. This definitionhas been added since the proposed rule at the suggestion of a commenter(see sections IV.B.1. and IV.C.5. of this preamble for further discussion).<T3>(19) Repair. </T3>``Repair'' means to restore a tank or UST systemcomponent that has caused a release of product from the UST system.This term has been added since proposal in response to public commentsrequesting additional clarification concerning the differences betweenrepair, upgrading and maintenance. Refer to section IV.C.5. of today'spreamble for further discussion of this issue. <T3>(20) SARA. </T3>``SARA'' means the Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct of 1986. <T3>(21) Sump. </T3>This term has been deleted from the final rule. Several commenters stated that this definition was ambiguous due to theinclusion of the term ``temporarily.'' They suggested it be removed orthat an actual time be substituted. The Agency agrees and has eliminatedthe definition from the final rule. This definition is no longer neededbecause the final rule no longer contains any requirements or provisionsspecific to sumps. <T3>(22) Upgrade. </T3>An ``upgrade'' is the addition or retrofit of someportion of an UST systems, such as cathodic protection, lining, and spilland overfill controls, to improve the ability of the UST to prevent therelease of product in accordance with andSection; 280.21. Although this term was not defined in the proposal, it has been added atthe recommendation of commenters. Further discussion of upgrading is presentedin section IV.B.3. of today's preamble. <T3>(23) UST System or Tank System. </T3>``UST system'' or ``tank system''means an underground storage tank, connected underground piping, undergroundancillary equipment, and containment system, if any. This definition hasbeen changed to include within the UST system only underground ancillaryequipment. Two commenters suggested that the phrase ``underground piping'' be definedto exclude any non-wetted piping such as vent lines. EPA does not agreewith the commenters. Because such ``non-wetted'' piping can contain regulatedsubstances, particularly when the tank is overfilled, EPA believes thatcertain requirements in this rule are applicable to this type of piping.Clarification has been added in today's rule regarding which requirementsare applicable to ``non-wetted'' piping. <T3>(24) Wastewater Treatment Tank. </T3>``Wastewater treatment tank''means a tank that is designed to receive and treat an influent wastewaterthrough physical, chemical, or biological methods. This definition has been changed since the proposal so that it no longerincludes only tanks regulated under the Clean Water Act. This term nowrefers to any tanks that are designed to treat wastewater. Of these, onlysome are regulated under the CWA. This change was required due to the differentregulations for CWA-regulated and non-CWA-regulated wastewater treatmenttanks. B. UST Systems: Design, Construction, Installation, and Notification The following sections present major issues raised by public comments andnew information gathered since proposal concerning the design, construction,installation, and notification of UST systems. Also, these sections discusschanges in the final rule based on these public comments and this new information.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Design and Construction Requirements (andSection; 280.20) </ITAG>As discussed in the preamble to the April 17 proposal (52 FR 12695), EPAconcluded that national design and construction requirements are neededfor new UST systems, especially with regard to corrosion protection. Indiscussing general approaches to design and construction standards, EPAconcluded that industry codes of practice adequately address proper design.EPA invited comments on the methods that should be used to recognize developmentof future codes of practice that meet the intent of the requirements ofthe proposed rule concerning the design, construction, and protection fromcorrosion of UST systems. Many comments were received by EPA on this issue.Many commenters suggested that EPA set detailed design standards in thefinal rule. Some new or alternate methods for tank design, fabrication,or protection techniques were suggested. For example, a few commenterssuggested that concrete tanks should be more explicitly allowed. One suggestedadding unbonded polyethylene wrap as an option for corrosion protection.EPA still believes, however, that the general approach taken at proposalof relying on industry codes of practice, rather than specifying detailedregulatory standards, is more appropriate because this approach allowsnew and effective technologies to be developed and put into use. In today's final rule, EPA simply requires that all new tanks be designedand manufactured according to standards of a nationally recognized organizationor an independent testing laboratory. These requirements also allow theuse of concrete or stainless steel tanks if the implementing agency determinesthat the design, construction method, and corrosion protection system wouldprevent the release of any stored regulated substances in a manner thatis no less protective of human health and environment than tanks allowedby the requirements of andSection; 280.20(a) (1)-(4). Specific design andconstruction issues are discussed in detail below.a. <T3>Tank Requirements (andSection; 280.20(a)). </T3><T3>(1) Fabrication. </T3>As discussed in the preamble to the April 17proposal (52 FR 12696), EPA proposed to require one of three fabricationtechniques for tanks: Fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP), coated and cathodicallyprotected steel, and steel-fiberglass-reinforced plastic composite. Theallowed fabrication techniques were chosen to provide protection of buriedstructures from galvanic corrosion by using either a cathodic protectionsystem or noncorrodible materials. Although comments were submitted suggestingflaws in each of the UST types listed in the proposal, the data submittedindicate excellent performance of all these protected tanks. Recent studiessponsored by EPA have yet to identify a documented case of failure by corrosionof these protected, ``new generation'' tanks having in-service ages ofup to 30 years. Therefore, today's rule is unchanged with respect to thesenew tank fabrication requirements. Information obtained by the Agency since proposal on performance of eachof the three fabrication techniques specifically allowed in the final ruleis briefly summarized below. Additional discussion is presented earlierin the Causes of UST Releases section of today's preamble. <T3>FRP Tanks. </T3>Nearly 200,000 FRP tanks have been installed nationwide,with some as old as 22 years old. There were some failures of these tankswhen first introduced; however, modification of installation practicesand tank design has reduced the annual failure rate to less than 0.05 percent.If the tank fails, failure usually occurs soon after installation and isdue to improper installation. <T3>Coated and Cathodically Protected Tanks. </T3>Approximately 100,000of these tanks have been installed at UST sites. Though some of the tanksare over 20 years old, the majority have been installed within the last5 years. There have been very few failures of these systems to date. Noneof the failures have resulted in a warranty claim. The few failures thatdid occur were due either to improper installation practices or to notfollowing monitoring procedures correctly. Cathodic protection technologyhas been widely applied to pipelines and other buried metal structuresfor over 30 years. A dramatic reduction in failures has resulted from theuse of cathodic protection on pipelines. <T3>Composite Tanks. </T3>This tank type is not as popular in this countryas the other types of protected tanks, but has been widely used in Europe.Approximately 65,000 composite tanks have been installed in the U.S. andhave been in use for about 25 years without a single reported corrosion-relatedfailure. The current manufacturing standards for these tanks are much morestringent than they were in the past. Even though there is not as muchhistorical performance data on composite tanks as there is for FRP or coatedand cathodically protected tanks, EPA has confidence in their future performancebecause of the fault-free performance of the older tanks of this type andthe more stringent manufacturing standards that are now in use. <T3>(2) Corrosion Protection_Corrosion Experts. </T3>EPA proposed in andSection;280.20(a) that field-installed cathodic protection systems should be designedby an independent corrosion expert. The Agency requested comments on themerits of this approach, and several comments were received by EPA on thisissue. Most of the comments strongly opposed the requirement of an ``independent''corrosion expert because they felt that this requirement would place anunnecessary financial burden on owners. In addition, they pointed out thatthe term ``independent'' should not be required because very few independentcorrosion experts are available. Some suggested that the term ``independent''should be replaced with ``certified'' or ``qualified.'' Others suggestedthe use of ``in-house'' expert because an ``in-house'' corrosion expertwould have better working knowledge of the systems to be protected, conditionof use, and the surrounding environmental condition. Although no clear evidence was submitted to indicate that corrosion protectionsystems that are designed by independent experts would perform better orworse than systems designed by non-independent experts, information obtainedfrom public comments indicates that relatively few independent corrosionexperts are available to fulfill the large demand for system designs. Inthe final rule, EPA has, therefore, deleted the requirement that the corrosionexpert must be independent. Thus, the use of in-house personnel is acceptableprovided that they meet the definition of ``corrosion expert.'' <T3>Composite Tanks. </T3>In the preamble to the proposal (52 FR 12698),EPA invited comments, standards, and documented performance data for FRP-steelcomposite tanks (also called ``clad'' tanks). Several comments were receivedby EPA on the issue of whether or not cathodic protection is needed forcomposite tanks. EPA believes that cathodic protection for this type of tank is not neededbecause the exterior of the steel tank is bonded to a thick fiberglassshell that has inherent corrosion resistance properties. EPA was unableto identify one case where this type of tank has failed due to corrosionand also noted that one major manufacturer of this type of tank recentlybegan to offer lifetime guarantees from failure for its tanks. Thus, inthe final rule, EPA has retained the provision that, as long as these tanksare designed and manufactured according to a recognized national standardof practice, FRP-steel composite tanks do not require cathodic protection.At proposal, industry codes for composite tanks were still in draft form.Commenters suggested that composite tanks should be excluded from the finalrule until UL 1746 is final. EPA disagrees with this comment because manufacturersare now being approved under this standard in its draft form. Moreover,EPA has amended the rule to reference a new industry consensus design standard,ACT-100, ``for the fabrication of FRP clad or composite underground storagetanks'' submitted by a commenter. Accordingly, EPA has concluded that itis unwarranted to delay allowing the use of composite tanks given theiroutstanding performance to date and the availability of the ACT-100 designstandard and the draft UL 1746 performance standard.<T3>No 12,000 ohm/cm Exclusion. </T3>As discussed in the preamble to theApril 17, 1987, proposal (52 FR 12698), EPA had proposed dropping the 12,000ohm/cm exclusion for underground tanks contained in the Interim Prohibition(see section 9003(g)(2) of RCRA). As stated in the proposal, this measurementalone does not adequately define a soil's propensity to corrode. Soil resistivityvaries with depth and moisture content, and corrosivity has been demonstratedin soil with a 30,000 ohm/cm reading. Many comments were received by EPA on this issue. Some requested that EPAretain the 12,000 ohm/cm exclusion in the final rule. Others agreed withthe proposed approach stating there is no technical basis to establisha single number by which the corrosivity of all soils can be measured.EPA continues to believe that use of a single resistivity variable is inadequateto measure the propensity to corrode. Therefore, EPA has decided not toinclude the 12,000 ohm/cm exclusion in the final rule. Some commenters suggested that there are situations where the surroundingsoils are not corrosive and requested that a mechanism for relief fromthe corrosion protection requirements be provided for those situations;for example, a soil that is uniform and very dry (low moisture content),where the ground-water table continuously stays several feet below thebottom of the UST installation, and the area above the installation ispaved to prevent percolation of rainfall and runoff. EPA agrees with thesecommenters and is including andSection; 281.20(a)(4), which allows an exemptionfor metal tanks from the requirement that all UST systems be corrosionprotected provided that a corrosion expert determines that the site isnot corrosive enough to cause a release during the tank's operating life.In addition, owners and operators must retain records of this determinationfor the operational life of the tank. These records should include evidenceof the corrosion expert's qualifications and the results of the site assessment.<T3>Alternative Designs. </T3>In the proposed rule (andSection; 280.20(a)(4)),other tank designs are allowed if the implementing agency determines themto be no less protective of human health and the environment. In responseto the proposal, commenters requested approval for several types of tanksincluding those constructed of concrete, stainless steel, and steel encasedin polyethylene. Several other commenters reported to the Agency otherpotentially useful designs such as nylon tanks. As a result of these comments, EPA sought information on several of thesealternative designs and continues to believe that, with certain materialsof construction and under certain site-specific soil conditions, alternativesystems can be designed that will adequately protect human health and theenvironment. In addition, EPA is aware of new design techniques being researchedthat appear promising but are not commercially available. The Agency doesnot desire to restrict or eliminate emerging technologies and recognizesthe numerous site-specific factors that may allow for the use of alternativedesigns. Therefore, today's rule continues to provide that the implementingagency may approve alternatives that are no less protective of human healthand the environment than the specified designs. The Agency has not, however, added any of these alternative designs tothe designs specifically allowed by the regulation because there is notenough documented history about the performance of these systems or industryconsensus codes governing their fabrication and use. One system, for example,consists of a steel tank surrounded by a thick, high-density polyethylene``jacket.'' The ``jacket'' is intended to provide both corrosion protectionand secondary containment. It has been reported to EPA that over 1,000of these tanks have been installed. Some local and state implementing agencieshave been approving this design. Sometimes, specific monitoring or demonstrationshave been required to ensure that the design provides protection equalto that provided by the other types of protected tanks. It has also beenreported that several manufacturers of this type of tank have begun theprocess of working with independent testing laboratories toward developingtesting and evaluation methods for steel tanks encased in noncorrodiblesecondary containment structures. This process may take several years tocomplete however. The Agency does not wish to unduly restrict the use ofthis type of product in the interim and recognizes that the manufacturersneed to have continued product sales to be able to fund the needed developmentand testing of these evaluation methods. Thus, EPA views the type of approvalallowed under andSection; 280.20(a)(4) as essential to the continued developmentof such new tank systems. For example, the long-term performance of a systemis difficult to establish in the absence of allowing actual installationsin the field. Accordingly, the final rule preserves the proposal's allowanceof the use of alternative new designs as long as they are approved by implementingagencies to adequately protect human health and the environment. Implementing agency approval of alternative new tank designs, or specialdesigns for specific sites, will only be provided if the UST system isdetermined to be no less protective of human health and the environmentthan the other types of tanks already listed in today's rule. Accordingly,an alternative design must meet the two basic criteria that all of theother methods meet: (1) It must be designed and constructed to preventreleases due to structural failure for the operating life of the system,and (2) it must be designed to prevent releases due to corrosion for itsoperating life. For example, the ``jacketed'' tanks described earlier obviouslymeet the structural criteria because each inner steel tank is built tothe U.L. 58 standard. These types of tanks are also designed to preventreleases due to corrosion because the secondary containment jacket isolatesthe steel tank from the surrounding soil. However, in the absence of anexisting consensus code applicable to the jacket, or a long-term performancerecord, it is difficult to determine if releases due to corrosion willbe prevented for the tanks' operating life. Thus, the implementing agencycould allow the use of this type of tank if a national consensus code iseventually developed for the jacket or this outer jacket is determinedto be free of holes at least as frequently as cathodically protected tanksare checked (after installation and every 3 years thereafter). The integrityof this outer jacket can be ensured in several ways, including severalmethods of interstitial monitoring or the periodic performance of a tankstructure-to-soil potential measurement by a cathodic protection tester.b. <T3>Piping Requirements (andSection; 280.20(b)). </T3>The proposed rule (52FR 12698) required the same corrosion protection for piping systems asused for the underground storage tank itself. Two types of protection systemswere allowed: fiberglass piping, or coated and cathodically protected steelpiping. The same as for the tanks, provisions for approval of alternativepiping methods were also proposed. Today's rule remains largely as proposed,although the requirement for an ``independent corrosion expert'' has beenrevised to delete the requirement for independence, and an option for approvalof alternative designs by a corrosion expert has been added. These issuesare discussed below. In addition, the extent of corrosion protection ofcomponents and possible alternate materials of construction were highlightedas issues in the proposal for public comment and are discussed in detailbelow. <T3>(1) Independent Corrosion Expert. </T3>EPA proposed in andSection; 280.20(b)that steel piping coated and cathodically protected with a field-installedcathodic protection system must be designed by an independent corrosionexpert. The Agency requested comments on the merits of this approach. Severalcomments were received by EPA regarding the need for an independent corrosionexpert concerning the protection of steel tanks. (See section IV.B.1.a.(2).for a discussion of this issue.) In response to these comments, EPA hasremoved the requirement that the corrosion expert must be independent.<T3>(2) Corrosion Protection of Tank System Components. </T3>The Agencyinvited comments on which tank components, if any, should be cathodicallyprotected and, if cathodic protection is not required, what form of corrosionprotection is appropriate. Several comments were received by EPA on thisissue. Some suggested that EPA should require cathodic protection on FRP-steelcomposite tanks as well as any steel fittings on FRP tanks. Some suggestedthat all metallic components of the UST system, including metallic connectors,swing joints, flexible connectors, and riser connections should be coatedor cathodically protected. Other commenters suggested that cathodic protectionon steel fittings on FRP tanks is unnecessary and that components likebung hole plugs and pump housings do not need cathodic protection. EPA agrees with the commenters who stated that cathodic protection of tankfittings is not needed because these components are located at the topof the tank and rarely contact the stored product. Section 280.20(a) ofthe final rule has been modified to restrict the applicability of the corrosionprotection requirements to ``any portion underground that routinely containsproduct.'' EPA's causes of release study indicates that the operational piping portionof UST systems is twice as likely as the tank portion to be the sourceof the release. Piping failures are caused equally by poor workmanshipand corrosion. Threaded metal areas made active by threading have a highpropensity to corrode if not coated and cathodically protected. Today'srule specifically requires the corrosion protection of operational undergroundpiping and components that are in contact with the soil and convey productto or from the tank (e.g., flexible connectors, swing joints, pipe fittings,and impact valves), whether in metallic or FRP piping runs. Nonoperationalcomponents, such as vent and vapor recovery lines, on the other hand, neednot have corrosion protection because these components should never containfree liquid product, particularly under today's requirements for overfillprevention (see andSection; 280.30). Metallic components, such as swing joints,do not need cathodic protection if they are placed in pump housings andare not in contact with the ground. The Agency also invited suggestions on the use of pipes other than FRPand corrosion-protected steel pipe. One commenter suggested use of coppertubing. Today s rule allows copper tubing under two circumstances. First,copper piping would be allowed if a corrosion expert determines that thesite is not corrosive enough to result in a release during the operationallife of the piping. Second, copper piping would be allowed if the designand construction methods and corrosion protection are determined by theimplementing agency to prevent the release of any stored substances ina manner no less protective of human health and the environment than therequirements in andSection; 280.20(b) (1), (2) and (3). c. <T3>Spill and Overfill Control (andSection; 280.20(c)). </T3>Design and constructionrequirements for new UST systems include spill and overfill equipment requirements.These additional requirements are discussed below in section IV.C.1., ``Spilland Overfill Control.'' d. <T3>Other Issues. (1) Internal Corrosion. </T3>In the preamble to the April17 proposal (52 FR 12699), EPA solicited comments on whether internal corrosioncould become a major source of failure. EPA requested comments based onthe industry's field experiences with internal corrosion protection systemsin terms of design, installation, efficacy of performance, and problemsfound. EPA also requested information on the need for internal corrosionprotection and whether it should be required, particularly for all newsteel UST systems. The Agency has received several comments on this issue. Many expressedthe opinion that internal corrosion is one of the causes of tank leaks.Some suggested mandating internal tank lining to reduce or to eliminateinternal corrosion and thereby prevent leaks. Some suggested that EPA requirethe use of striker plates below fill and gauge fittings. A few suggestedrequiring the use of soft-tipped inventory dipsticks. Some commenters tookthe position that internal corrosion is not a problem and should not beregulated. EPA agrees with the commenters who argued that tank lining will reducethe incidence of failures resulting from internal corrosion. The Agencyis not, however, mandating the requirement of tank lining on new tanksbecause it has concluded that striker plates, now required under the consensuscodes, solve the problem. At present, evidence is limited concerning thepotential of internal corrosion to cause newly constructed tanks to fail.Estimates of the incidence of internal corrosion-induced tank failuresrange from 5 to 60 percent of the total steel tank population. Severaltank lining companies submitted data that indicate internal corrosion isa significant cause of release. By contrast, internal corrosion was notfound to be a significant cause of release in an EPA-sponsored study ofover 400 tank closures carefully investigated by Suffolk County, New York,health department officials. The results of this study and other informationlead the Agency to believe that the incidence of steel tank failures dueto internal corrosion is probably less than 10 percent of the total tankuniverse, that it occurs most often in smaller tanks, and that it takesplace later in the operational life of these tank systems. The few casesof internal corrosion holes that were witnessed in this study appearedto be generally located at the bottom of the tank fill pipe opening andoften could have been prevented if striker plates had been used. Thesefindings are corroborated by numerous tank manufacturers who submittedcomments on the proposal, citing their collective experiences that internalcorrosion is not a problem on tanks equipped with striker plates. Manyof them suggested that the use of striker plates below the fill and gaugefittings will protect the primary location where internal corrosion occasionallybreaks through.EPA agrees with the commenters who believe that striker plates can largelyeliminate the internal corrosion problem. The final rule, however, doesin effect, require the use of striker plates because they are standardon new steel tanks and included in the referenced codes of practice developedby nationally recognized associations or independent testing laboratories.The Agency agrees with commenters who suggested that the use of soft-tippeddipsticks will also reduce internal corrosion. The final rule does not,however, include this alternative because it is not needed with strikerplates now standard on all tanks. <T3>(2) Manways. </T3>The Agency requested comments and information aboutthe required use of manways on top of new tanks and whether traditional``bunghole'' systems of tank entry would result in a significant reductionin releases. Several comments were received by EPA on this issue. Commenterswere divided on the requirements of manways. Some of them felt that manwaysdo not reduce the number of leaks, but may instead add another potentialsource of release. Some felt that the requirement of manways is necessarybecause a number of costly release investigations can be avoided by manualinspection from inside a tank. A few commenters supported manways but feltthat their use should not be mandated. EPA agrees with the commenters who recommended manways as a sound practicebut believed they should not be required in the final rule. Although manwaysfacilitate the manual inspection of the interior of a tank, other formsof release detection make internal inspections and, thus, the use of manwaysunnecessary (see discussion in section IV.B.2.g.(2). concerning internalinspections and release detection). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Installation (andSection;andSection; 280.20 (d) and (e)) </ITAG>a. <T3>Overview. </T3>As was discussed in the preamble to the April 17 proposal(52 FR 12700-12702), improper installation is often a cause of releasefrom various components of the UST system. The public comments on the originalproposal and on the Supplemental Notice (December 23, 1987) have reinforcedthe belief that proper installation is critical to preventing releasesfrom the UST system. The new causes of release information obtained bythe Agency since proposal (which is discussed in section II.F.2. of thispreamble) indicates that improper installation is one of the major causesof underground storage tank and piping failures. Additionally, the majorityof industry experts felt that improper installation causes many of thepiping failures. Though the reported failure rates of FRP and protected-steeltanks are very low, failures that have occurred are usually related toimproper installation. Some of the installation practices that have been identified as leadingto UST system releases include: Non-homogeneous backfill, which is oftencited as causing localized corrosion of unprotected steel tank system components;improper selection and placement of backfill, which leads to structuralfailure in FRP tanks; loose fitting in the bungs and vent lines, whichleak when the tank is overfilled; and improper layout, fabrication, andinstallation (backfill placement and inadequate cover) of the deliverypiping, which can lead to loose or broken pipe and fittings. The proposed rule addressed these installation problems in andSection; 280.20(c) and (d). Section 280.20(c) listed the specific requirements for conductinga proper installation. Section 280.20(d) required owners and operatorsto indicate on the notification form how proper installation was ensured.The comments and revisions for the final rule on both of these sectionsare discussed in more detail below. b. <T3>Installation Practices. </T3>EPA proposed in andSection; 280.20(c) thatall tanks and piping be installed in accordance with the manufacturer'sinstructions and nine specific requirements that were based on the majorinstallation steps outlined in two industry codes: Petroleum EquipmentInstitute RP100-86 and American Petroleum Institute 1615. The Agency requestedcomment on this approach, in particular the use of a final system test,after backfill is placed around the storage system but before it is placedinto operation, to ensure proper installation. Comments were received that supported the proposed approach. Many commenters,however, suggested refinements or exceptions to several of the nine specificrequirements. In addition, the industry consensus codes from which thenine requirements were derived have been revised and reissued since theproposal. These two codes are now in substantial agreement, and their recommendedpractices are reported to be widely used by installers. One of the reasonsthat the Agency included the nine specific installation provisions in theproposal was to emphasize certain important basic points already set forthin the national consensus codes. EPA now believes that the recently revised codes addressing proper installationpractices are even closer in representing a national consensus and provideappropriate guidance for proper installation. The nine specific requirementshave, therefore, been deleted from the final rule as unnecessary and arereplaced with a more general performance standard (in andSection; 280.20(d) and (e)) that simply requires that owners and operators ensure thatthe UST systems are installed in accordance with nationally accepted codesof practice and the manufacturers' instructions (if any). An example of an installation practice that requires the considerationof both the national consensus codes and the manufacturer's instructionsis the joining of FRP piping to metallic components. The consensus codesprovide general guidance concerning where and how to make such joints,but the two major FRP piping manufacturers provide specific instructionsconcerning the details of fabricating this type of joint. c. <T3>Ensuring Proper Installation. </T3>EPA proposed in andSection; 280.20(d)that owners and operators indicate from a list of methods on the proposednotification form which method they used to ensure proper installation.Also, proposed andSection; 280.20(d) required that owners and operators obtainthe installer's signature certifying which method was used to ensure properinstallation. EPA requested comment on the advisability of requiring ownersand operators to use one or more of these methods and the relative meritsof each method. In general, all comments supported EPA's contention that requirements forensuring proper installation are warranted. Each approach that EPA hadidentified to ensure proper installation was favored by at least one commenter.No data were submitted to EPA in response to the proposal that showed anyof these methods to be unworkable, ineffective, or preferred over all theothers. Therefore, all but one of them have been retained in today's finalrule, and they have been renumbered as andSection; 280.20(e). The one method that has been deleted from the final rule was the testingfor leaks during and after installation. This method was deleted becauseall national consensus codes for installation require such testing duringand after installation and thus this testing is part of proper installationunder andSection; 280.20(d), and not an optional method of certificationas required under andSection; 280.20(e). Other methods of ensuring proper installation were suggested by commenters.The first suggestion was to certify owners. Although the certificationof owners could improve installation practices, the Agency is concernedthat the implementation of an education and testing program of this magnitudewould be very difficult to accomplish and not likely to be very effective,because owners do not usually install their own tanks. Some commenterssuggested that EPA develop a national installer certification program.EPA believes, however, that implementing such a program at the nationallevel, particularly given the large number of installers necessary, wouldbe unworkable and would delay implementation of this rule. Also, the factthat proper installation can be effectively ensured by a variety of approachesmakes a national program for certification of installers unnecessary. EPAbelieves that state and local governments are in a much better positionto develop such programs as they deem necessary. Some commenters suggested requiring certification of installers by a professionalorganization. EPA is not aware, however, of any professional associationthat is in a position currently to certify the large number of installersexpected to be needed in the following years and, therefore, has not requiredsuch certification in the final rule. Section 280.20(e) of the final rule requires owners and operators to indicateon the notification form which method for ensuring proper installationwas used. Although EPA believes that the use of one or more of the methodsallowed (i.e., manufacturer or implementing agency certification of theinstaller; inspection of the installation by a professional engineer orthe implemental agency; completion of manufacturer's installation checklist;or another method as approved by the implementing agency) will improveinstallation practices, today's allowance of a variety of methods willgive owners, operators, and implementing agencies flexibility to choosethe most appropriate methods.EPA has also retained the requirement in the final rule that owners andoperators obtain the installer's certification that the installation wasproperly performed. Thus, andSection; 280.22(f) of the final NotificationRequirements requires owners and operators to have the installer certifyon the notification form that the UST system was installed in accordancewith the performance standards of andSection; 280.20(d). A signature blockis provided on the notification form for the installer. EPA intends thatowners and operators will obtain the signature of the person primarilyresponsible for the installation of the tank and piping system. In caseswhere the owner functions as the general contractor, hiring several partiesto conduct the tank and piping installation, then the owner could be consideredthe installer. In the proposal preamble, comments were requested on the advisability ofrequiring a site plan and, if it were required, what level of detail wasnecessary. Most commenters favored the requirement for a site plan butdiffered on the level of detail required for the plan. Some commentersfavored a simple sketch and others favored an engineering drawing thatwould locate the tanks and the piping, indicate the sizes and routing ofthe piping, and indicate the location of structures on the site. Informationobtained from the ``Causes of Release Study'' (see section II.F.2. of today'spreamble) indicates that site plans are prepared voluntarily by most majorcorporations and are required in some jurisdictions when applying for buildingpermits. The Agency has determined that it will not make site plans a required recordbecause it is not necessary to ensure compliance with the technical requirementspromulgated today. A site plan is, however, a useful tool for owners andoperators. The Agency notes that site plans are recommended in recent updatesof national codes addressed to the installation of new UST systems. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Upgrading of Existing Systems (andSection; 280.21) </ITAG>EPA proposed in andSection; 280.21(a) that, within 10 years after the effectivedate of the final rule, all existing UST systems comply with the requirementsfor new UST systems under andSection; 280.20 and have a field-installed cathodicprotection system designed by an independent corrosion expert. If theserequirements could not be met, these UST systems would have to be closed.The Agency requested comments on these proposed requirements and the needfor upgrading UST systems to prevent releases (see 52 FR 12702-12705).a. <T3>Mandatory Upgrading Schedule. (1) Overview. </T3>EPA concluded in theproposal (52 FR 12702-12704) that the universe of 1.4 to 2 million existingUST systems presents a significant threat to the public health and environmentfrom product releases due to spills, overfills, and corrosion of unprotectedsteel tank systems. Presently, the majority of existing UST systems arenot equipped with any of the release prevention or detection features thatwere proposed. The Agency also concluded that if these existing systemswere retrofitted with safeguards proposed for new UST systems, a significantnumber of product releases could be prevented or minimized. EPA proposed two different schedules for implementing UST system upgrades:One for installation of release prevention (corrosion protection and spill/overfillcontrols), and another for release detection. andbullet; Corrosion protection (which would consist of cathodic protectionfor bare steel tanks, for example), and spill and overfill controls wereproposed to be installed at all existing UST systems within 10 years (see52 FR 12774 and 12779). andbullet; Release detection at unprotected and protected existing UST systemswas proposed to be phased in at 3 and 5 years, respectively, with monthlyrelease detection monitoring proposed for all UST systems after 10 years.andbullet; UST systems that could not implement a reliable and effectiverelease detection method, or that did not meet upgrade requirements forcorrosion protection and spill and overfill controls, within the requiredtime frames proposed were to be replaced (to meet new tank standards) orpermanently closed. The proposed implementation schedule for release detection has been changedin the final rule to require existing UST systems to phase in release detectionbased on age over the first 5 years after the rule's effective date. (Furtherdiscussion about the Agency's rationale for changing this proposed requirementis presented in section IV.D.3. of today's preamble.) In today's finalrule, the Agency has retained the proposed requirement that all substandardexisting UST systems be closed, replaced, or retrofitted with corrosionprotection and spill and overfill control equipment within 10 years afterthe rule's effective date. The final requirements concerning the upgradeof corrosion protection and spill and overfill controls (indicating publiccomments on this issue) are discussed below. The schedule issues are discussedfirst, followed by the upgrading methods. <T3>(2) Approaches to Today's Rule. </T3>During development of the proposedrule, the Agency considered several approaches and requirements for schedulingupgrade and replacement of existing substandard UST systems, including:rapid upgrade and replacement (e.g., within 3 to 5 years), gradual upgradeand replacement (within 6 to 12 years), and no required upgrade and replacementof existing UST systems. EPA selected the gradual approach, proposing thatall existing UST systems storing regulated substances be required to eitherupgrade to new tank standards within 10 years (through retrofitting orreplacement) or be permanently closed. Many commenters, including several segments of the UST service industry,supported the 10-year upgrade period, believing that this is a reasonabletime frame to allow their industry to respond to the large universe ofexisting tanks that will need to be upgraded, replaced, or closed. As discussedin the preamble to the proposal (52 FR 12704), one important advantageof this approach is that it appears to complement current industry trendstowards upgrading or replacing voluntarily, while setting a clear targetdate by which all upgrades and replacements must be completed. This approachprovides flexibility to implementing agencies by allowing them to choosefrom numerous alternative phase-in approaches (e.g., based on tank age,tank type, or environmental vulnerability of the site) the most appropriateand applicable method to achieve an orderly transition in meeting the 10-yearcompliance deadline. In summary, both EPA and many commenters believe thatthe proposed 10-year compliance period will provide time that is adequateto implement the required improvements at the 1.4 to 2 million UST systemsnationwide. Other commenters stated that the 10-year mandatory upgrade period is tooambitious and should be relaxed (or lengthened) for those owners and operatorswith multiple tanks, with financial limitations, or in states where upgrade/replacementprograms have already been implemented. EPA continues to remain unconvinced,however, that extending the proposed compliance period will significantlylessen the burden on multiple tank owners or on owners and operators withlimited financial resources because if bare steel tanks are allowed tocontinue operation after 10 years, many will eventually leak and requirecorrective action that is much more burdensome than upgrading. EPA alsoexpects that most UST owners and operators will make the decision to upgradeor replace existing UST systems within 10 years anyway (see 52 FR 12671).For example, many owners and operators will choose to conduct their upgradesprior to implementation of release detection (within the first 5 years)because it is more cost effective and practical to implement all requiredupgrades at a site at the same time, <T3>before </T3>the tank system leaks.Many owners and operators are currently upgrading or replacing their existingUST systems in response to pressures other than Federal regulatory requirements(for example, voluntary upgrading programs, insurance and liability concerns,and State and local upgrading requirements). For this reason, some commenterssuggested that the 10-year mandatory upgrade requirement is unnecessaryand should be deleted from the regulations. The Agency agrees that thesepositive upgrading and replacement trends will probably continue over thenext several years, even without a regulatory requirement. EPA is concerned,however, that reliance only on these voluntary activities, without theadded incentive of a regulatory deadline, will result in a significantnumber of UST systems not being upgraded or replaced over the next 10 years.EPA has concluded that this is a situation that would not protect humanhealth and the environment nationwide. Some commenters supported a phase-in period that is more rapid than theproposed 10 years because the longer it takes to upgrade, the more releasesto the environment that will occur, posing additional risk to the publichealth and environment. More than half of all existing UST systems areover 10 years old and constructed of unprotected, bare steel without anyspill and overfill prevention equipment. EPA's information on causes ofrelease (see earlier discussion on causes of release) confirms that thesetank systems are the most likely to have releases due to corrosion, pipingfailures, and spills and overfills. Therefore, the Agency recognizes thata more rapid upgrade schedule will, at least theoretically, prevent a significantnumber of release incidences that may occur at existing substandard USTsystems. Other information obtained by the Agency during development of the proposal(see 52 FR 12704), however, indicated that not even the most aggressiveState, local, or industry UST programs have required upgrading or replacementin as short a timeframe as 3 to 5 years because it is universally acceptedas unimplementable given the nature and size of the regulated community.The Agency believes that a mandatory, rapid upgrading approach could notbe successfully implemented because a large portion of the regulated communityconsists of small businesses that, if faced with a shorter deadline, wouldcontinue their substandard operations resulting in widespread noncompliance.Thus, while a shorter upgrade period appears theoretically advantageousin terms of the environmental and health risks avoided, EPA has concludedthat it is unlikely to genuinely achieve more protection of the publichealth and environment than the proposed approach because it is unimplementableby significant portions of this regulated community. Many commenters (those supporting the proposed 10-year mandatory upgradeperiod, as well as the other approaches) recommended that UST system upgradesand replacements be phased in using a staggered approach over the upgradingperiod. They believe that this would lessen the burden on the UST serviceindustry by preventing numerous owners from waiting until the end of the10-year compliance period to complete their upgrades or replacements. Tankage was the factor most frequently suggested as the basis for phase-inof UST system upgrades because of the belief that older UST systems havethe greatest probability of leaking due to corrosion. Others suggestedthat the corrosive nature of a site, the presence or absence of corrosionprotection, or the environmental vulnerability of an area should be usedas the basis for determining the upgrade schedule. Given the enormous size of the existing UST system universe and the practicalimplementation difficulties that owners and operators face as they upgradenecessary improvements to prevent future releases, EPA agrees that theimplementation of the upgrade/replacement requirements should be phasedin. The Agency decided, however, not to require the phase-in of UST systemupgrades or replacements based on tank age or any other factor in the finalrule for several reasons. First, EPA believes that numerous UST systemswill be upgraded or closed over the next 10 years even in the absence ofany Federal deadline in the regulations. Upgrading programs are alreadywell underway in numerous companies, and more are expected to begin nationwidein response to these regulations. As discussed earlier in the backgroundsection of this preamble, numerous system closures will also occur becauseof this new regulatory program. Thus, EPA has concluded that only a portionof the existing UST system owners and operators are likely to wait untilthe end of 10-year compliance period to complete their upgrades or replacements.Second, upgrading or replacement represents a significant undertaking forUST system owners and operators and the Agency has identified many appropriatefactors (including, for example, tank age, site location, and other business-relatedreasons) already being successfully used by owners and operators to schedulereplacements/upgrades. In an attempt to stimulate scheduled actions andcompany programs in this area, the Agency does not want to artificiallyrestrict them to phase-in programs based on age. Third, the Agency hasconcluded that a simple deadline provides a clear national goal, and thatthis is all that is necessary to prompt the required upgrading/replacementactions over the 10-year period. Finally, today's approach of a 10-yeardeadline provides implementing agencies with the freedom to decide whetherState or local UST programs should have a scheduled phase-in period and,if so, the methods they will use to do it. Finally, some commenters recommended that EPA provide variance proceduresin the final rule that would enable the avoidance (or delay) of implementationof the upgrading requirements for owners and operators who show reasonableprogress in upgrading, for those lacking financial resources to upgrade,for protected tanks installed prior to final rule promulgation, and forStates where UST upgrade programs have already been implemented. The useof such variances in the final rule was rejected, however, because theAgency believes that where upgrading has been allowed to be phased in over10 years, there is no justification for further delay in bringing substandardsystems into compliance with requirements necessary to ensure protectionof human health and the environment.b. <T3>Tank Upgrading Methods for Corrosion Protection (andSection; 280.21(b)).</T3>Today's final rule allows three methods of tank upgrading for corrosionprotection, as suggested by a number of commenters. EPA believes that eachof the upgrading methods described below has been demonstrated to be protectiveof human health and the environment. <T3>(1) Interior Lining.</T3> The first of the options for upgrading atank is to internally line the tank in accordance with the tank repairprovisions of andSection; 280.33. To use this technique as the sole methodfor meeting the corrosion protection upgrade, the tank must be internallyinspected after 10 years and every 5 years thereafter. The inspection mustbe conducted in accordance with a code of practice developed by a nationallyrecognized association or independent testing lab to ensure that the linedtank is performing adequately. Interior lining used as the sole methodfor corrosion protection is not regarded as a permanent upgrade, but isadequate if it continues to meet original lining design specificationsas determined by periodic inspections. If the lined tank does not meetthe original design specifications, it no longer meets the upgrading requirementsand, if it cannot be repaired in accordance with industry codes, it issubject to the unprotected tank requirements and must be replaced after1998. Numerous comments were received suggesting that the use of internal tanklining of existing UST systems should be more clearly allowed as an upgradeoption. Data submitted by the commenters and data developed by EPA sinceproposal indicate that lined tanks rarely cause releases to the environment,even in the absence of external corrosion protection measures. Tank lininghas been reported by lining companies as already having been used to repairor prevent releases in over 300,000 heating oil tanks and over 70,000 motorfuel tanks during the last 25 years. Last year, an EPA-sponsored studyof UST programs outside the U.S. revealed that internal lining of tankshas been in wide use in Europe and Canada for the past decade. At leastone major insurer of USTs in the U.S. requires that unprotected steel tanksover 15 years of age be lined as a preventive measure for internal corrosion.Several experienced tank operators commented that if steel tanks are properlylined their life can be extended for at least 10 years with leak-free performance.They noted significant economic and operational advantages to lining aloneas an upgrade (e.g., it avoids the need to reinstall the tank and can bedone relatively quickly), and they suggested that EPA allow tank liningas an upgrade option. EPA now believes that either tank lining alone ortank lining combined with external cathodic protection is a reliable upgrademeasure. Accordingly, the final rule has been revised to more clearly indicatethat these are acceptable upgrade options under specific guidelines andrequirements. EPA also agrees with commenters that internal corrosion is a potentialproblem for tanks in the future but does not believe enough evidence isavailable to suggest that requiring tank lining for all steel tanks iswarranted at this time. Although commenters submitted data that demonstratedthe existence of internal corrosion, there were conflicting views as toits frequency and causes and the severity of its effects. Some commentersstated that all tanks more than 15 years old should be lined because ofthe potential for failures due to internal corrosion. Other commentersstated that modern fuels and tank management practices have virtually eliminatedinternal corrosion.As previously addressed in the discussion of internal corrosion under thenew tank standards (section IV.B.1.d.), EPA believes that most internalcorrosion incidents have been due to dip-sticking tanks without strikerplates. Now that striker plates are standard equipment on tanks, the problemof internal corrosion for newer tanks has been substantially resolved.In the final rules, tanks over 10 years of age must be either internallyinspected or lined to meet the upgrade requirements. If internal corrosionis occurring, the internal inspection will detect it. The lining codesrequire the installation of striker plates. Although EPA will continueto study this potential problem in the coming years, the final rule doesnot require internal corrosion protection practices beyond what is nowcontained in industry codes. <T3>(2) Cathodic Protection.</T3> A second option for upgrading a tankis cathodic protection. Section 280.21(b)(2) describes requirements forupgrading an existing UST by cathodic protection. The cathodic protectionsystem must meet the requirements for new tank systems, except that thetank and piping do not need to have an external dielectric coating. Thesecathodic protection requirements for existing USTs were included in theproposal and were supported by the commenters. Several commenters, however,expressed concern that not all existing USTs are sound enough to be upgraded.Concern was expressed over allowing cathodic protection retrofits on oldtanks that could have one of the following: Plugged corrosion holes (seenew causes of release information in section II.F.2. of this preamble);severe external pitting corrosion that leaves a lower margin of safetyin the event that the cathodic protection system fails; and internal corrosion.The Agency agrees with these commenters that only sound tanks should beupgraded with cathodic protection and is including inspection and testingrequirements for upgraded tanks in the final rule. Review of industry standardsfor internal inspection to assess the need for repair of USTs has convincedEPA that tanks can be safely upgraded if these industry standards are followed.There are three ways to ensure that tanks are safely and correctly upgradedwith cathodic protection. First, tank tightness testing may be used tojudge the structural integrity of newer tanks that are upgraded with cathodicprotection, because EPA has concluded that newer tanks are much less likelyto have corrosion holes than older tanks. This option for tank tightnesstesting may be used only on tanks under 10 years of age. EPA concludedin ``Causes of Release from UST Systems'' that corrosion breakthrough isunlikely in unprotected tanks under 10 years of age. For example, in onestudy less than 2 percent of tanks tested which were under 11 years ofage were found to be leaking. Tightness testing will, therefore, adequatelyidentify the few younger tanks that may be currently leaking or have corrosionholes. However, the younger tanks must be tightness tested<T3> twice. </T3>The first  tightness test must be performed before theinstallation of cathodic protection to ensure that the tank is not currentlyleaking. The second tightness test must be performed between 3 and 6 monthsafter the initiation of cathodic protection to ensure that the cathodicprotection has not opened any holes that were previously plugged with corrosionproducts. Information obtained from EPA-sponsored expert panels and publiccomments indicated that corrosion holes often do not leak because the corrosionbyproducts plug the holes. This information also indicated that cathodicprotection can cause these ``rust plugs'' to loosen and begin leaking soonafter the protection is applied. Although EPA does not have data on howoften this loosening occurs, this phenomenon appears to have occurred ina few cases when cathodic protection was applied to gas pipelines. EPAbelieves that performing a second tank tightness test 3 to 6 months aftercathodic protection is applied will usually detect this type of leak beforesignificant releases occur. A second way to ensure this type of upgrading is successful is to use monthlymonitoring. Like the tightness testing option, this method may be usedonly on tanks under 10 years of age. EPA believes that very few tanks under10 years of age will leak after cathodic protection has been installed.The Agency believes, however, that some method of assessment is neededto protect human health and the environment in the unlikely event thatan unsound tank is retrofitted with cathodic protection. As discussed insection III.D. of this preamble, monthly release detection provides highlyreliable indications of tank integrity. A third method applies to older tanks. For tanks 10 years of age and older,these two methods above (either a pair of tank tightness tests or monthlyrelease detection monitoring) are inadequate to ensure structural soundnessbefore the cathodic protection system is installed. These older tanks mustinstead be internally inspected and assessed. As described above, unprotectedtanks often corrode through but do not leak because the corrosion product,backfill, and interior sludge seal the hole. EPA concluded in ``Causesof Release from UST Systems'' that about 50 percent of the corrosion holesin tanks are plugged and do not leak. The study also showed that approximately7 percent of the tanks of 12 to 15 years of age leaked. EPA has concludedfrom these data that as many as 7 percent of existing USTs are corrodedthrough, but not leaking. Many more existing tanks may be heavily corrodedand not suitable for cathodic protection alone as an upgrading measure.EPA understands that several firms that offer cathodic protection upgradeservices use other methods to ensure that the tank is structurally soundbefore this upgrade option is recommended. These procedures appear to varysomewhat from firm to firm. One component of the approach commonly involvesa statistical analysis of the likelihood of the tank having corrosion holesbased upon the characteristics of the site soils and the age of the tank.The database for this analysis varies, but usually contains large numbersof tank failures from Canada and the United States. This approach appears to have merit, but it is not included explicitlyin the final rule because its effectiveness was not fully demonstrated.The Agency was unable to evaluate its effectiveness for two reasons. First,EPA does not have long-term performance data for a large number of tanksthat have been assessed in this way prior to upgrading. Second, these practicesvary from firm to firm and are not established in an industry consensuscode. Such options for assessment may be used, however, where they havebeen determined by the implementing agency to prevent releases in a mannerthat is no less protective of human health and the environment than internalinspection or tightness testing.EPA proposed that the cathodic protection system for upgraded tanks bedesigned by an independent corrosion expert. Commenters opposed to therequirement that the corrosion expert be independent were concerned thatthis was precluding the use of in-house personnel. The issue of independenceis discussed earlier in this preamble in relation to the design of field-installedcathodic protection systems for new tank systems (section IV.B.1.). EPAagrees with these commenters that companies should be able to use theirown qualified or trained employees. Accordingly, EPA has dropped the requirementthat the corrosion expert be ``independent.'' Commenters also suggested that, because the proposed rule required thata corrosion expert design the retrofit cathodic protection system, thefinal rule should not dictate a particular cathodic protection system design.EPA agrees with these commenters and has decided not to require a specificretrofit cathodic protection method in the final rule provided that a corrosionexpert determines the appropriate method based on the conditions at thesite. <T3>(3) Cathodic Protection and Internal Lining.</T3> A third option isto both line and cathodically protect the tank. The lining is intendedto provide protection from internal corrosion; the cathodic protectionprevents exterior corrosion. Because internal corrosion rarely occurs abovethe bottom third of the tank, a full lining may not be required if an internalinspection shows a sound tank exterior. The cathodic protection systemmust meet the same requirements as the new tank cathodic protection systemexcept for dielectric coatings. The lining must be installed in accordancewith the requirements of andSection; 280.33. c. <T3>Upgrading Piping (andSection; 280.21(c)).</T3> Upgrading of an UST systemrequires upgrading the system's piping as well. Metal piping must be upgradedin accordance with the requirements for new piping, except that a dielectriccoating is not required if the existing piping is not upgraded by replacement.Pipe lining is a developing technology that may eventually become a viableoption for upgrading some types of steel pipes; however, the technologyrequires more development and testing to prove its effectiveness for useon small-diameter pipes and thus is not an option for upgrading in thefinal rule. d. <T3>Tank Upgrading Methods for Spill and Overfill Control (andSection; 280.21(d)).</T3>To prevent spills and overfills associated with product transfer to theUST system, all existing UST systems must comply with the requirementsfor new UST system spill and overfill prevention equipment, as specifiedin andSection; 280.20(c). These additional requirements are discussed belowin section IV.C.1.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Notification (andSection; 280.22) </ITAG>Section 280.22 of the proposed rule included notification requirementsfor new and existing UST systems. These requirements are substantiallythe same in today's final rule. Sections 280.22 (a), (b), and (g) havebeen deleted because their effective dates have passed. Section VII ofthe notification form (certification of compliance) has been revised toreflect changed language in the installation, release detection, and corrosionprotection requirements. The five tank columns on this section of the notificationform have been deleted to simplify the form. EPA believes that the sameinstallation assurance, release detection, corrosion protection and financialresponsibility measures will usually be used at all of the new tank systemsat any one location. Any sites where different measures are used for eachtank can be certified with copies of this form. C. General Operating Requirements <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Spill and Overfill Prevention and Control (andSection;andSection; 280.20and 280.30) </ITAG>a.<T3> Introduction.</T3> The surface spills and overfills that occur atUST systems are usually the result of human error, not equipment failure.There are two major types of surface releases: (1) Spilling, which resultsfrom improper dispensing practices such as disconnecting the delivery hosefrom the tank's fill pipe before the hose has drained completely, and (2)overfilling, which occurs when the tank liquid level exceeds tank capacityand product escapes through tank bung holes, vent lines, or fill ports.Spills and overfills occur on a relatively frequent basis; however, theyare usually not reported because they are typically small in volume_lessthan 25 gallons_and can be easily contained and cleaned up. Basically, the proposal required owners and operators to follow proceduresand provide equipment to prevent these releases or to immediately containand clean them up. In the proposed rule, proper transfer procedures hadto be followed during all deliveries. For new UST systems, the Agency proposedthe installation of alarms in conjunction with liquid level sensors, automaticshutoff devices that halt further delivery of product into the UST at apredetermined level, or the installation of catchment basins to containoverfills or spills (e.g., product left in delivery hoses at the time ofdisconnect). EPA also proposed requiring the immediate installation ofspill and overfill equipment on any UST system that used external leakdetection devices. Existing UST systems not using external leak detectiondevices were allowed up to 10 years to come into compliance with the proposedrequirements for spill and overfill equipment. In the Agency's study of the causes of releases from UST systems completedsince proposal, many people contacted and interviewed in the field rankedspills and overfills as the most frequent cause of release rather thanthe distant third identified in the preamble to the proposal (52 FR 12667).For example, spills and overfills are reported in Dade County, Florida,to be the leading cause of release from UST systems. Experienced installationcontractors reported that they repeatedly and frequently observe variousindicators of spill and overfill problems, such as discolored soil aboveand around the tank and the dissolving of the tank's bituminous coatingbelow the drop tube connection to the tank fill opening. Field observationsalso implicated nonoperational components such as bung hole plugs and ventlines as a frequent cause of release in overfills. In addition, most experiencedhands in the field felt that spills and overfills were two separate problemsthat must be addressed separately. Based upon public comments and new findings on causes of product release,the Agency has made several changes in today's final rule for spills andoverfills: The rule has been reorganized to address apparent confusionvoiced by commenters concerning the presentation of requirements for newand existing USTs; an exemption from equipment requirements is providedfor UST systems filled with small volume delivery of no more than 25 gallons;and the physical presence of an attendant is not required during the fillingof the UST system as long as the transfer operation is otherwise monitoredby mechanical or electronic means. Although EPA recognizes that the ownerand operator may, through private agreement, ensure that ultimate responsibilityfor the exercise of proper delivery techniques is borne by the transportcarrier, the final rule still holds the owner and operator responsiblefor preventing damages to human health and the environment due to spillsbecause the Agency does not have jurisdiction over transport carriers.The specific spill and overfill equipment requirements of the final ruleare discussed below. These requirements apply to all new UST systems asof the effective date of this rulemaking, and existing UST systems mustmeet the requirements within 10 years of that effective date (see sectionIV.C.1.e. below). In addition, general operating procedures for spill andoverfill control are applicable to both new and existing UST systems asof the effective date of the rule (see section IV.C.1.f. below). b.<T3> Spill Prevention (andSection; 280.20(c)(1)(i)).</T3> The Agency hasconcluded that repeated spills can frequently cause significant environmentaldamage. Although most surface spills are small in volume, because theyare often repeated they can eventually contaminate soil and ground water.Thus, the final rule requires use of spill prevention equipment (such asa small catchment basin around the fill port) at all new and existing USTsystems. Catchment basins are the most prevalent form of spill preventionused today. The proposed rule specified that when catchment basins were used they wouldbe large enough to contain the volume of the hose. In response, severalcommenters objected to EPA relying on this larger sized catchment basintechnology because of concerns about the potential fire or explosion hazardresulting from the buildup of petroleum fumes in the catchment basin area,the cracking of catchment basins due to freezing of accumulated water,or the potential that these containment devices would provide the delivererwith a false sense of security that would prompt carelessness during delivery.However, no commenters provided any data to EPA that indicated the occurrenceof any fires or explosions due to vaporization of product in a basin, regardlessof its size. In any event, EPA believes that compliance with the propertransfer procedures required in andSection; 280.30(a) will prevent fuel fromfrequently collecting in the basins, and normal maintenance suggested bythe equipment manufacturer will prevent water from accumulating and freezing.Several commenters said that small spill catchment basins are preferredin many circumstances. They also said that if overfill prevention equipmentis also used, the problem of emptying a full transfer hose should rarelybe encountered. Overfill prevention devices currently available in theUnited States either allow the transfer hose to drain at a very slow rateinto the tank or can be manually overridden to empty the hose contentsinto the tank. As a consequence, today's final rule deletes the proposedsize specification for spill catchment basins, thus leaving the determinationof the appropriate volume to the discretion of the owner and operator.The design or size of the catchment basin (combined with the type of overfillprevention equipment also being required today) should be of sufficientsize to contain spills and prevent releases to the environment. For example,if the catchment basin has a means for releasing its contents into thetank or another containment structure in order to provide more room inthe catchment basin, a smaller volume catchment basin (e.g., the standard5-gallon size) should be adequate equipment for preventing spills. Catchmentbasins without any means for drainage and requiring manual unloading mayneed to be of larger volume. For those concerned that the use of catchment basins of any size or typemay present a safety hazard, EPA allows use of alternative devices to preventspills if they are approved by the implementing agency as preventing spillsin a manner that is no less stringent in protecting human health and theenvironment. For example, a device that would prevent release from thetransfer hose when detached from the fill pipe, such as a dry disconnectcoupling, could satisfy this requirement. This provision is intended toprovide flexibility in a rapidly developing technological area that willallow continued development of new and improved spill prevention equipment.c. <T3>Overfill Prevention (andSection; 280.20(c)(1)(ii)).</T3> Agency datashow that overfill prevention is also very important, not just for theprevention of large overfills released from the top of vent or fill lines,but also overfills that slowly leak out from the fittings at the top ofthe overfilled tank, such as the bung connections. In today's final rule,therefore, all new UST systems are also required to use overfill preventionequipment. All new UST systems must be equipped with overfill protection by installingone or more of the following: andbullet; A device that will alert the transfer operator when the tank isno more than 90 percent full by restricting the flow into the tank or triggeringa high-level alarm; andbullet; A device that will automatically shut off flow into the tank whenthe tank is no more than 95 percent full; or andbullet; An equivalent device approved by the implementing agency.These alternatives are essentially the same as those presented in the proposedrule except for the clarification that flow restrictors (i.e., ball floatvalves) are also allowed. Although not specifically mentioned in the proposedrule, several commenters felt that flow restrictors were adequate for spilland overfill prevention and are the most widely used method at present.Flow restrictors do not shut off inflow completely but instead significantlyreduce the rate at which product enters the tank. The transporter can tellwhen the flow is reduced and stop delivery. Some commenters emphasizedthat many USTs are already using flow restrictors successfully. Upon reviewof these devices, the Agency has concluded that the flow restrictors areprotective of human health and the environment, particularly if they arecoupled with the requirement of andSection; 280.30 that all transfers beclosely monitored. The final rule allows the use of flow restrictors foroverfill prevention. EPA is concerned, however, that this type of overfill prevention may jeopardizethe integrity of the tank if a pressurized product delivery system is used.Pressurized transfer of up to 30 psi is sometimes used with heavier fuels.Most tanks can safely withstand pressures of only 5 psi, and flow restrictorsmay allow a much higher pressure to develop during pressurized delivery,causing tanks to rupture. The Agency has no information to indicate thatsuch failures are common. Almost all of the UST systems addressed in today'srule are not filled by pressurized delivery. The delivery hose connectionfor this type of delivery usually includes a back-pressure sensor thatautomatically disconnects the hose if pressure develops in the tank. EPA has decided that if an owner and operator uses either a high-levelalarm or a flow restrictor, the devices must be activated at 90 percentof tank capacity. In the proposal, the high-level alarms were requiredto be activated at 95 percent of tank capacity. EPA has decided on thestricter standard for both of these devices because neither device is atotal shutoff device. Also, both devices are subject to the operator'sresponse to terminate the transfer. Automatic shutoff devices do not require operator action to prevent overfills.Automatic shutoff devices prevent overfilling by automatically shuttingoff flow at the fill pipe before the tank fills up to the top. Alreadyin widespread use in Europe, this approach is designed to completely eliminateoverfills due to human error. The Agency believes this is the simplesttype of overfill device for new and existing UST systems installing overfillprevention equipment. Inexpensive shutoff devices that are easy to installhave recently become available to the U.S. market, with the potential foradditional innovative technology to enter the market soon. Those who wishto use an overfill prevention device other than those mentioned in therule may satisfy the overfill prevention requirement with use of alternativedevices approved by the implementing agency as being no less stringentin protecting human health and the environment. d. <T3>Exemptions (andSection; 280.20(c)(2)).</T3> Several commenters pointedout that infrequently filled UST systems pose less risk of releases fromspilling and overfilling than systems filled on a more regular basis and,therefore, should be exempt from spill and overfill prevention equipmentrequirements. Other commenters suggested that UST systems filled manuallyin small increments, such as most used oil tanks, pose significantly lessrisk than those receiving large-volume deliveries. The Agency is continuing to require spill and overfill prevention equipmenton infrequently filled tanks in the final rule. Though a tank may be filledonly occasionally, it is the potential size of overfills that concernsEPA. Although infrequent filling reduces the likelihood of a spill or anoverfill release somewhat, it does not guarantee that a spill or an overfillthat does occur would be of small quantity. In addition, EPA feels thatin the future, as today's requirements are implemented, carriers of productmay become accustomed to (and dependent on) devices such as high-levelalarms or shutoff devices and would, therefore, be less attentive duringproduct delivery due to reliance on prevention equipment to indicate completionof the delivery. Finally, the implementing agency would often be unableto determine the actual filling frequency for purposes of determining whethera particular UST system should be exempt from spill and overfill requirements,creating compliance monitoring difficulties. Consequently, the Agency hasretained the required use of spill and overfill prevention equipment forinfrequently filled tanks. The final rule does not, however, require new UST systems filled throughtransfers of no more than 25 gallons to use spill or overfill preventionequipment (andSection; 280.20). The 25-gallon limit was selected becausethe Agency understands it is a common industry practice at automotive servicecenters to use containers up to this volume for handling used oil priorto putting it into the UST. EPA has concluded that the likelihood of overfillingthe tank is small because the volume of the transfer is much smaller thanthe volume of the tank. In addition, the maximum size of the spill or overfillthat could occur from a 25 gallon transfer is 25 gallons. This quantityis easier to contain and clean up than the maximum size spill or overfillthat could occur from a transfer of several thousand gallons. EPA has concludedthat proper operating practices and procedures (required under andSection;280.30), such as checking the available tank volume before each transfer,will adequately protect human health and the environment. e. <T3>Compliance Schedule for Initial Spill and Overfill Equipment (andSection;andSection;280.20 and 280.21).</T3> In the proposal, the schedule for compliance requireduse of spill and overfill prevention equipment at the time of installationof all new UST systems. All existing UST systems must be upgraded within10 years of the effective date of the final regulations. EPA has retainedthis 10-year requirement as an adequate period of time to retrofit existingUST systems. EPA has deleted the proposed requirement to partially phase in the useof spill and overfill equipment whenever any external method of detectionis installed at an existing tank. Some commenters expressed confusion aboutwhen such equipment would have to be retrofitted to tanks that alreadyhave installed external monitoring methods. EPA agrees that mandating thisphase-in approach does present such implementation problems and unnecessarilyhinders owner and operator flexibility in selecting their own schedulefor compliance within the 10-year deadline. This proposed approach couldunduly discourage the use of external methods of detection. Furthermore,research completed by EPA after proposal (and made available for publiccomment on March 31, 1988) has convinced the Agency that spills and overfillsdo not pose insurmountable problems to the use of external methods of detectionthat require the immediate retrofit of spill and overfill equipment. As suggested by commenters, EPA considered requiring retrofitting spilland overfill prevention devices earlier, for example, at the time of installationof all release detection equipment or during a scheduled general systemupgrade. The Agency decided against such earlier deadlines primarily dueto the implementation difficulties this would pose. EPA believes that thelimited population of installers precludes the rapid installation of spilland overfill controls at all of the UST sites nationwide. Although EPAhas decided to retain the 10-year time period, the Agency expects thatmany tank owners and operators will retrofit these devices in less than10 years even though it is not mandatory to do so. In many cases, retrofitof spill and overfill equipment at the time of release detection retrofitor of corrosion protection upgrading will be more cost effective. Finally,the less stringent release detection requirements that are allowed in today'sfinal rules for fully upgraded tanks will actually provide an incentiveto initiate earlier retrofitting to meet spill and overfill preventionrequirements. The discussion of release detection requirements for upgradedtanks is provided in section V.D. of today's preamble. f. <T3>General Operating Procedures for Spill and Overfill Control (andSection;280.30).</T3> In addition to installation of release prevention equipment,the Agency has retained in the final rule the general operating proceduresfor both new and existing UST systems that were proposed to prevent spillsand overfills. Proposed andSection; 280.30(a) stated that the owner and operator must ensurethat releases do not occur and must be physically present to observe thetransfer of product. Many commenters suggested that the driver of the deliveryvehicle should be held responsible for any releases during delivery, andthat having someone physically present who represents the owner and operatorduring all deliveries is impractical and costly. Although EPA agrees thatresponsible carriers are the primary agents in the field to prevent spillsand overfills, for the purpose of complying with today's requirements,the UST system owner and operator is responsible for preventing spillsand overfills. The Agency must take this approach because it has no legalauthority to regulate transporters under Subtitle I. Thus, regardless ofwhether the owner and operator decides to share (by contract) responsibilityfor the monitoring of the transfer with the carrier, under today's finalregulations the owner and operator will continue to be responsible in theevent that there is a release during delivery. See section IV.E.2.d. ofthe preamble and andSection; 280.53 of the final rule for the requirementsof owners and operators in the event of a spill or overfill.The proposed rule required that a person be physically present at all timesduring the transfer of product to be able to respond quickly to a spillor overfill (proposed andSection; 280.30). Some commenters suggested, however,that many UST systems are in large tank farms where it would not be feasibleor economical (especially during multiple filling operations) to have someonepresent at each tank during the time it was being filled. In response tothese suggestions, EPA is changing this requirement in the final rule tosimply require that all deliveries be monitored constantly. This changeallows for a person at the site (but not necessarily at the transfer point)to monitor a transfer using remote sensing equipment that can prevent aspill or an overfill from occurring. This change will continue to meetthe intent of the proposed requirement, that delivery be monitored, andwill also accommodate operations encountered at large tank farms whereit is difficult for a person to be at every tank. Many of these installationshave central monitoring stations where all the tanks can be supervisedthrough remote control monitoring and shutoff equipment. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Operation and Maintenance of Corrosion Protection (andSection; 280.31)</ITAG>As discussed in the preamble to the April 17 proposal (52 FR 12666-12667),corrosion was found to be one of the common causes of release in existingunderground tank and piping systems that are unprotected from corrosion.The consensus of experts in the field contacted by EPA indicates that theinstallation and proper operation and maintenance of corrosion protectionsystems can significantly reduce the incidence or volume of release dueto corrosion. Officials in Ontario, Canada, Denmark, and Sweden have citedthe success of such corrosion protection programs initiated in their respectivecountries during the early to mid-1970s. The proposed rule addressed operationand maintenance of corrosion protection systems in andSection; 280.31 (seepreamble discussion in 52 FR 12707). a. <T3>Extent of Corrosion Protection (andSection; 280.31(a)). </T3>EPA proposedin andSection; 280.31(a) that all corrosion protection systems must be operatedand maintained to continuously provide corrosion protection to buried metalcomponents of the UST system. Public comments on proposed andSection; 280.31supported the necessity of routine maintenance of the corrosion protectionsystems by qualified field personnel. The Agency also invited comments on which components, if any, should becathodically protected; whether there are noncorrodible metal alternativesfor that component; and what form of corrosion protection is appropriateif cathodic protection is not required (52 FR 12707). Many comments werereceived in this area. In summary, some commenters suggested that all corrosion-protectedmetal components of UST systems, including swing joints, flexible connectors,and riser connections, should be monitored regularly. Other commenterssuggested that some components, such as bung plugs and the pump housing,do not need cathodic protection and maintenance. (As discussed in moredetail earlier in this preamble in the section on new piping design andconstruction requirements (section IV.B.1.b.(2).) In the final rule, EPArequires protection of delivery piping and that portion of the tank routinelystoring regulated substances. Requirements for spill and overfill equipmentand practices will prevent releases from the top of the tank and vent piping.EPA agrees with commenters who found it unnecessary to require protectionfor portions of the system that would not regularly contain product orare not in contact with the soil, even if situated underground. Bung plugsare inserted into unused openings at the top of a tank and are not subjectto releases except in the event of overfills. Delivery piping is definedas that portion of the UST system piping through which product is introducedinto the tank or delivered from the tank. Cathodic protection is not requiredfor the fill pipes of tanks that have a drop tube because the drop tubeis the part of the tank that routinely contains product. The drop tubeis not in contact with the soil and thus does not require cathodic protection.Vent piping is not used for delivery of product and presents a minimumrisk for release to the environment. In fact, vent piping would be a potentialrelease source only in the event of overfill conditions. The release potentialfrom bung plugs and vent piping will be eliminated or substantially reducedby the requirements for overfill prevention equipment required in andSection;280.30 of today's rule and, therefore, the Agency has not required theircathodic protection in today's rule. Pump housings, when contained in the equipment manway at the top of a tank,do not come in contact with the soil and thus do not require cathodic protection.Other pump housings are often isolated from the soil by being submersedin the product in the tank or situated in the dispenser housing above gradeand, therefore, do not require cathodic protection. Only those pump housingsthat are in contact with the ground and potentially contain product requirecathodic protection. b. <T3>Qualifications for Corrosion Personnel (andSection; 280.31(b)). </T3>EPAproposed in andSection; 280.31(b) that all cathodic protection systems beinspected and designed by an ``independent'' corrosion expert. Most ofthe comments received by EPA in this area strongly opposed the requirementof an ``independent'' corrosion expert. EPA agrees that the proposed requirementfor the independence of the expert is not needed and has deleted this termfrom the final rule. (See section IV.B.1.a.(2) above for a discussion ofthis issue.) Other commenters pointed out that the maintenance, operation, and inspectionof an installed cathodic protection system could be performed by peoplewho have much less training than a corrosion expert. EPA agrees with thesecomments, recognizing that most of these inspections are now being conductedby trained specialists. Thus, EPA has replaced the term ``independent corrosionexpert'' with ``qualified cathodic protection tester'' in the final rule.Cathodic protection testers must be able to demonstrate education and experiencein the measurement of cathodic protection of buried or submerged metalpiping systems and metal tanks. A definition to this effect has been addedto the final rule. The National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE)has developed an examination that can be used to ensure that cathodic protectiontesters are qualified. c. <T3>Inspection Schedule (andSection;andSection; 280.31 (b) and (c)). </T3>EPAproposed a minimum inspection schedule for cathodic protection systemsin andSection; 280.31(b). For field-installed cathodic protection systems,the proposal required that the system be tested within 6 months of installationand at least annually thereafter. For factory-installed cathodic protectionsystems, it was proposed that each system should be tested within 6 monthsof installation and at least every 5 years thereafter. For all impressedcurrent systems, the proposed requirement was inspection and/or testingas appropriate, and at least annually. The Agency invited comments on theadvantages and disadvantages of allowing less frequent inspections/testingsfor those tanks that are equipped with premanufactured corrosion protection(52 FR 12707). Several comments were received in these areas. Some commenters felt thatthe proposed testing requirements for field installation were excessiveand that there is no technical reason to differentiate between field- andfactory-installed systems. After consultation with groups of industry expertsduring the public comment period, EPA now agrees with the commenters whorecommended that all cathodic protection systems should be tested at thesame frequency and the Agency is now requiring in the final rule that allcathodic protection systems be tested within 6 months of installation andat least every 3 years thereafter. These intervals are sufficient to detectany damage or failure of the system and to take remedial action in timeto prevent structural failures due to corrosion. EPA understands that thistime interval is consistent with sound practice as is now recommended inthe recently revised NACE code and by major tank manufacturers.EPA proposed in andSection; 280.31(c) that all UST systems with impressedcurrent cathodic protection systems must be inspected every 60 days toensure that the equipment is running properly. This equipment inspectionis required in addition to the testing of the cathodic protection. EPAhas received many comments on this section. Several commenters supportedthe proposed approach, with some further suggesting that impressed currentsystems must be inspected six times a year with intervals not exceeding75 days. Some commenters suggested monthly inspection of all systems whileothers suggested immediate testing after installation for all impressedcurrent systems and annually thereafter. No commenters stated that periodictesting of an impressed current system should not be required. EPA agrees with the commenters who said that inspection at 60-day intervalsis protective of human health and the environment because loss of powerto the anodes for 60 days is very unlikely to result in corrosion failure.Thus, the proposed inspection approach has been retained in the final rule.This inspection is conducted to simply ensure that the equipment is runningproperly and is relatively straightforward for most impressed current systems.Most of these systems include a light on the control panel that indicatesproper operation. No special training is required to perform this inspection.d. <T3>Recordkeeping (andSection; 280.31(d)). </T3>EPA proposed in andSection;280.31(d) that records documenting the proper operation of corrosion protectionsystems must be maintained. EPA requested comments on this proposed requirement,and none were received. The Agency has made slight changes in the wordingof this requirement to make the intent of the final requirement clear.This minor change does not change the substance of the proposed requirement.The records that are maintained must provide the results of testing fromthe last two service checks required in andSection; 280.31(b) (which mustbe performed by a corrosion protection tester) and the last three inspectionsrequired under andSection; 280.31(c) (which can be performed by the ownerand operator). EPA believes that this record will provide sufficient informationto demonstrate that the proper operation and maintenance of the cathodicprotection system is being carried out. e. <T3>General Performance Standards for Testing. </T3>Section 280.31(e) alsoproposed three criteria to be used while testing cathodic protection systems.EPA received several comments regarding this approach, with most of themsuggesting that EPA should include all of the five criteria as definedin NACE RP-02-85. Based on the suggestions of these commenters, EPA nowbelieves that industry codes, such as NACE RP-02-85 and API's ``Guide forInspection of Refinery Equipment,'' developed by nationally recognizedassociations provide clearer and more complete guidance about the use ofthese criteria to determine the adequacy of cathodic protection. Thesecriteria are also better explained in technical documents such as theseindustry codes. In addition, these criteria are subject to continued reviewand can be revised to reflect new measurement techniques that result fromincreased understanding of corrosion phenomena. Accordingly, andSection; 280.31(e) has been deleted, and there is no explicitlisting of the three criteria from the proposed rule. The proposed criteriahave been replaced with a more general performance standard (in andSection;280.31(b)) that requires the service checks be performed in accordancewith a nationally accepted code of practice. This approach accommodatesthe concerns of the commenters who recommended that all five of the NACEcriteria should be allowed to be considered. At the same time, this approachencourages the application of the proper standard because these nationalcodes are presented within the context of significant technical guidanceas to the proper use of each criteria. Thus, in the final rule, ownersand operators are being held to the use of at least these criteria as recommendedin these national codes. f. <T3>Notification Requirement. </T3>EPA proposed in andSection; 280.31(f)that owners and operators of new UST systems must certify compliance withthe corrosion protection requirements on the notification form submittedpursuant to andSection; 280.22. No comments were received by EPA on thisrequirement. In the final rule, this section has been moved for clarityto andSection; 280.22(e), which identifies notification requirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Inspection and Maintenance of the Tank System (andSection; 280.31)</ITAG>In the preamble to the proposed regulation, the Agency discussed threealternatives for the required maintenance and inspection of the tank system(52 FR 12707). EPA proposed requirements for the maintenance and inspectionof corrosion protection systems and requested comments and informationon the need for broader requirements. Two alternatives were described thataddressed the maintenance and inspection of the entire site or other tanksystem equipment in addition to the corrosion protection system. a. <T3>Site or System Inspections. </T3>Many comments were received by EPAon these alternative inspection requirements. Some commenters felt thatinspection of the entire site or of the tank system is of little practicalbenefit and unnecessary because such an inspection alternative would beduplicative of the leak detection requirements. One commenter suggestedconducting inspections of the entire UST site. EPA agrees with commenters who stated that site inspection is duplicativeof leak detection. Institution of release detection systems should provideeffective warning of releases from most of the components of the tank system,thereby eliminating the need to require the general inspections. Also,the majority of USTs are completely underground and inaccessible to inspection,rendering total system inspection impractical.b. <T3>Inspections for Tank Deflection. </T3>Small distortions of the tankdiameter are expected at the installation of USTs, and the tanks are designedwith an allowance to withstand them. Improper backfill or failure to installfoundation anchors (or failure of the anchoring system) can lead, however,to excessive distortion resulting in rupture of the tank. One way to verifythis distortion is by measuring tank deflection (variation from true diameter).EPA had requested comments on periodic tank deflection measurements forsteel or FRP tanks as a means of preventing tank failures. Many commentswere received by EPA on this inspection method. Some requested EPA to mandateperiodic deflection monitoring for FRP tanks in the final rule. Othersstated the view that FRP tanks do not require periodic deflection monitoringbecause virtually all deflection ceases after the first year. Some alsorecommended vertical diameter measurements for all new tanks to verifyinitial installation results. The Agency disagrees with commenters who suggested periodic tank deflectionmonitoring for FRP tanks. The low incidence of failure in FRP tanks (lessthan 0.5 percent), which has been declining substantially over the last10 years, argues against the need for periodic deflection measurements.The Agency has, therefore, chosen not to mandate periodic deflection measurementin the final rule. The Agency believes that excessive deflection in FRPtanks is usually due to improper installation and occurs soon after theinstallation is complete. Deflection measurements during and immediatelyfollowing installation are required by the tank manufacturers for purposesof warranty validation. EPA believes that these are sufficient for theprotection of human health and the environment. In addition, investigators conducting a study of deflection monitoringof FRP tanks in Suffolk County (New York) have reported to EPA that thedeflection measurement is often difficult to obtain unless special provisionsare made for taking this measurement when the tank is installed. Specialtools and training are required to prevent damage to the fill pipe tankseal (53 FR 10403) when obtaining access to the tank for conducting thetest. c. <T3>Monitoring Corrosion Protection at Composite Tanks. </T3>The Agencyhad also requested comments on requiring corrosion protection inspectionsfor composite tanks. Some commenters stated that composite tanks shouldbe monitored to ensure the integrity of the FRP coating, using the samecriteria used for the cathodic protection inspections. Others felt thatinspections of composite tanks are unnecessary after installation. TheAgency disagrees with the commenters who recommended that composite tanksbe periodically monitored to ensure the integrity of the FRP coating. Ithas been reported to EPA that most composite tanks pass when tested throughthe measurement of electrical continuity between some structure of thetank and the soil; however, the tanks that have ``failed'' this test showedno evidence of external corrosion once they were excavated and inspected.This is a point of continuing controversy within the National Associationof Corrosion Engineers. Based on the superior performance of compositetanks to date (no documented failures due to external corrosion), EPA hasdecided not to mandate the corrosion protection monitoring of compositetanks in the final rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Compatibility (andSection; 280.32) </ITAG>In the proposed rule, EPA set forth a general performance standard requiringowners and operators to use an UST system made of or lined with materialscompatible with its stored substances. Incompatibility could result inthe structural deterioration of the containment vessel or piping and causereleases into the environment (see 52 FR 12708-12710). Because EPA hasfound no significant evidence that incompatibility is a cause of releasefrom USTs, the final rule contains no additional requirements and thusremains the same as proposed. a. <T3>Compatibility of FRP Tanks with Alcohol-Blended Fuels. </T3>Since theproposal appeared, EPA sought additional information on problems reportedlycaused by incompatibility of FRP tanks and alcohol-blended fuels. Thissearch included conversations with several groups very familiar with thesefuels and the FRP tank industry. In all of the information reviewed, onlyone release case was suspected to be caused by incompatibility problems.In addition, EPA has been unable to find any demonstrated incompatibilityproblem with 10-percent alcohol-blended fuels and FRP tank systems. There are two types of FRP tanks. The standard FRP tank is compatible withup to 10-percent alcohol-blended fuels. The second type of FRP tank ismanufactured with a special resin that ensures compatibility with blendedfuels containing greater than 10-percent alcohol. Although the higher percentagealcohol-blended fuels (11 to 100 percent) might, over long periods of time(at least theoretically), pose compatibility problems in standard FRP tanks,the actual threat posed is believed to be very small for two reasons. First,the current and projected use of oxygenated fuels shows a trend that willincrease the use of 10-percent alcohol-blended fuels but that will notincrease the percentage of alcohol in the fuels. Second, information providedto the Agency indicates that numerous facets of industry (tank manufacturers,tank owners, and distributors) are very aware of and concerned with alcohol-blendedfuels and FRP tank and piping compatibility problems. Industry practiceis for the tank owner or operator to contact the manufacturer when a differentproduct is to be stored, thus allowing the manufacturer to check its recordsconcerning the compatibility of the stored substance and existing tanksystem. Numerous tanks have been relined with different resins that arecompatible with the new fuels. EPA has added a note to the performancestandard which refers to industry codes that can be used as guidance tohelp owners and operators with alcohol-blended fuels satisfy the compatibilityrequirement. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Repairs (andSection; 280.33) </ITAG>In andSection; 280.33 of the proposed rule, EPA proposed conditions underwhich repairs to an UST would be allowed. As discussed in the preambleto the proposal (52 FR 12710-12711), numerous state UST programs alreadyaddress this topic in their regulations. Eight state programs refer toindustry guidelines that should be followed in making repairs. Since proposal,EPA has continued to investigate the subject of UST system repairs. Numerouscommenters on the proposal addressed this subject. It is obvious from theresponse received and other work undertaken by the Agency that there isa great deal of interest and ongoing activity in the field of UST managementconcerned with UST system repairs (including the development of new codesand practices). As discussed below, today's final rule incorporates severalchanges to the proposed requirements concerning UST repairs, includingthe deletion of, revision of, and addition to several of the conditionsin the proposal. a. <T3>Repair and Lining (andSection; 280.33(a)). </T3>Under andSection; 280.33(a),EPA proposed to allow the repair and lining of a tank if four requirementswere met: (1) A vacuum test was conducted, (2) the lining material wascompatible with the regulated substance stored, (3) the tank was inspectedinternally and ultrasonically tested, and (4) the tank had not been repairedor relined previously. Today's final rule revises some of these proposedrequirements as discussed below. In andSection; 280.33(a)(1), EPA proposed requiring that a vacuum test beconducted on repaired tanks. This requirement was intended to ensure soundrepairs (52 FR 12711). The vacuum test is no longer required for reasonsthat are discussed in more detail in subsection d. below. In andSection; 280.33(a)(2), EPA proposed requiring that the lining materialapplied to the interior of the tank be compatible with the regulated substancestored. All commenters agreed that this provision was necessary and pointedout that it is one that is already being followed in current industry practice.The specific requirement has, therefore, been deleted but the lining materialis still required in the final rule to be compatible with the regulatedsubstance stored in the tank because this concern is incorporated intoall current codes and practices and one of these must be followed underthe final rule. In andSection; 280.33(a)(3), EPA proposed internal inspection and ultrasonictesting of a tank to determine that it was structurally sound. Under today'sfinal rule, the tank must still be internally inspected and determinedto be structurally sound, but the ultrasonic test is no longer required.EPA received comments concerning the methods to test a tank to ensure thatit is still structurally sound. These comments indicated that alternativetests were available to determine the structural integrity of the tank.National codes, including API 1631 and NLPA 631, provide alternative methods.Currently available data submitted and developed independently by EPA concerningfield performance of tank lining indicate that if these codes are followed,the lined tanks will perform very well (see the discussion of interiorlining under the upgrading section presented earlier in this preamble).EPA has learned that Underwriters Laboratories is currently developinga performance test (Subject 1856); however, it is still in the draft stageat this time. Consequently, today's final rule reflects the conclusionthat it is not necessary to require a specific test to ensure structuralsoundness. Thus, EPA has substituted a performance requirement in andSection;280.33(d)(1) of the final rule that the internal inspection be conductedin accordance with codes of practice developed by a nationally recognizedassociation or independent testing laboratory.For purposes of assisting implementation of this general requirement, thefinal rule includes the note that the lining and repair procedures describedin API 1631 and NLPA 631 may be used to comply with andSection; 280.33(a).These codes describe test protocols for inspecting tanks to determine thestructural soundness. The use of the ball peen hammer test is described,as well as the use of ultrasound. The codes include criteria for minimumallowable remaining thickness and maximum number of perforations per unitarea in determining the condition of the tank. The codes also specify teststo ensure that the repair or lining has been performed correctly. EPA intendsby this approach to allow other applicable national codes (such as UL 1856)developed in the future to be used in meeting this requirement. In andSection; 280.33(a)(4), EPA proposed limiting UST repair to only tanksthat had not been previously repaired. In other words, a tank could berepaired only once so as to avoid continued repair of an UST that was fundamentallyunsound (52 FR 12711). Some of the commenters suggested that, under thisapproach, EPA needed to resolve definitional questions concerning whatconstitutes a repair versus simple preventive maintenance. They expressedconcern that the proposed one-time repair provision might preclude theuse of preventive maintenance that would otherwise prevent leaks. Othercommenters opposed this requirement, stating that structurally sound tankscould be repaired repeatedly; they also provided extensive data showingthat repaired tanks had an excellent performance record. Other commentersopposed allowing any repairs to tanks that had leaked. After study of the comments, review of the submitted performance data onrepaired tanks, and further study of the codes, EPA agrees that restrictingrepair to a single time is unnecessary. The submitted record of repairedtanks was found to be very good and numerous EPA contacts with tank liningusers and regulators have generally confirmed the accuracy of this performancerecord. Therefore, EPA has concluded that the tank repair codes alreadyin existence (and in use for years) provide adequate standards and guidelinesfor determining if a particular tank qualifies for repair. Consequently,EPA has not included the one-time only repair requirement in the finalrule and will allow tanks to be repaired more than once provided that theymeet the standards for repairability in the applicable codes and that therepair is completed in compliance with these standards. If a tank has leakedproduct, however, the requirements for corrective action must be met andwill sometimes require removal of the tank in order to complete the appropriatecleanup measures even if it is determined to be structurally sound andrepairable. b. <T3>Cathodic Protection (andSection; 280.33(e)). </T3>In andSection; 280.33(b),EPA proposed that all steel tanks with corrosion holes that are subsequentlyrepaired be retrofitted with a cathodic protection system that is designedby an independent corrosion expert and operated and maintained in accordancewith andSection; 280.31. Again, comments were received objecting to the requirementof the use of an ``independent'' corrosion expert on the grounds that manycompanies employ corrosion experts and that requiring an independent expertwould be unnecessary and burdensome. As discussed earlier in this preamblein section IV.B.1.a., EPA is dropping the requirement for an ``independent''corrosion expert in the final rule. Comments were also received indicating that the addition of a cathodicprotection system to a tank that was repaired by lining was not necessaryand represented a significant additional expense. In view of the excellentperformance record to date with relined tanks, EPA agrees with this pointto some extent. Accordingly, in the final rule, EPA will allow lining aloneas an upgrade alternative for corrosion protection provided that it isdone within the confines of one of the national codes. In other words,a tank that is determined to be structurally sound under the criteria inthe codes may be upgraded by lining alone for a 10-year period. The interiorof the tank must be reinspected at the end of the 10-year period followingthe lining. If this inspection shows the tank is still sound, again inconformance with the existing codes, the upgrade can be extended for usefor another 5 years. Thus, in the final rule, lining alone (without cathodicprotection) provides an allowable upgrade for corrosion protection fora 10-year period. This period may be extended in 5-year increments by inspectingthe tank according to the codes and demonstrating that the tank is stillsound and that the lining can prevent releases for another 5 years. c. <T3>Authorized Repair for FRP Tanks (andSection; 280.33(b)). </T3>In andSection;280.33(c), EPA proposed that repairs to FRP tanks be made only by the manufacturer'sauthorized representatives. Many comments were received opposing this proposedrequirement. Commenters argued that qualified in-house personnel should be allowed toperform repairs and that such a restriction would limit the opportunityfor private enterprise and small businesses to enter into the FRP repairindustry. They also expressed concerns that restricting repairs to themanufacturer's authorized representatives would increase the cost to theowners and operators. Finally, they believed that such a restriction couldresult in insufficient repair capability and cause delays in repair, particularlyin less populated and more remote regions. Several comments were also received that supported the proposed requirementsstating that long-term repair of FRP tanks requires the use of proper repairmaterials and techniques. Commenters in favor of this position argued thatonly the manufacturer has the requisite knowledge of the appropriate materialsand methods to repair the specific composition of FRP used in its tanks.They pointed out that these manufacturers have already established authorizedrepresentatives trained in the proper methods and supplied with the quality-assuredand correct materials. They also suggested that, because the manufacturerbears continuance of product liability, only the manufacturer's authorizedrepresentatives should be allowed to repair FRP tanks. After carefully considering the arguments on both sides, EPA has decidedto change the proposed requirement to allow not only the manufacturer'sauthorized representatives to repair FRP tanks but to also allow qualifiedin-house personnel to conduct repairs if a code of practice developed bya nationally recognized organization or independent testing laboratoryis followed. Information presented by commenters convinced the Agency that there areother qualified and competent individuals who could provide reliable andproper repair services for FRP UST systems. Though there are no currentlyestablished industry standard codes for repair of FRP tanks, at least onenationally recognized organization is presently developing such a code.Therefore, the Agency believes it would be imprudent to restrict repairservices to only manufacturer's authorized representatives. The Agencyalso believes that allowing repairs to be conducted by other qualifiedin-house personnel in accordance with an industry code of practice willhelp ensure that there are adequate repair personnel available to providecompetent repair services in a timely manner. d. <T3>Vacuum Test. </T3>In andSection; 280.33(d), EPA proposed requiring thata vacuum test (at 5.3 in. Hg) be performed on the tank following repair.Section 280.33(f) proposed the added requirement of having a tank tightnesstest performed within one year following the repair of a tank. Commentswere received on the technical details of these tests and on whether theywere really needed to determine that the repaired tank was sound and wouldnot release product to the environment. Several commenters questioned thetechnical adequacy and appropriateness of the use of a vacuum test, objectingto this requirement as possibly damaging some types of tanks.As a result of the technical information supplied by these commenters,EPA agrees that release detection (see andSection; 280.43 (d)-(h) of thefinal rule), and quality control inspections performed according to establishedindustry standards, should provide sufficient ensurance that the repairor lining of the tank was performed correctly, and thus, a vacuum testis not necessary. The current good performance of repaired tanks, mostof which were not vacuum tested, points to the validity of these comments.In addition, EPA agrees that the test could be harmful in some cases. Consequently,the Agency has dropped the requirement of a vacuum test from the finalrule. EPA has also decided that the proposed requirement for a tank tightnesstest within one year following repair is not always necessary because itduplicates the industry practice of internally inspecting lined tanks andthe release detection requirements that apply to the repaired tank. Thegood performance record of repaired tanks makes such an additional requirementunnecessary. e. <T3>Pipes and Fittings (andSection; 280.33(c)). </T3>In andSection; 280.33(e)of the proposal, EPA required replacement of pipes and fittings from whicha release had occurred due to corrosion. The proposal did allow the tighteningof loose fittings and joints for purposes of repairs. Comments were receivedindicating that FRP piping could be satisfactorily repaired and that sometypes of valves could also be repaired adequately without replacement.EPA believes that replacement of metal pipe sections and fittings thatreleased product because of corrosion or other damage is still necessarybut, in response to the issues raised by several commenters, will allowrepairs of FRP piping in the final rule. The final rule does not prohibitrepairs of metal valves provided that these can be done in a manner thatprovides sufficient protection against releases. To ensure that these allowablerepairs are carried out according to sound practice, EPA requires thatall of the repaired sections be tested and shown to be tight so that theywill not have a release after they are put back into service. f. <T3>Recordkeeping (andSection; 280.33(f)). </T3>In andSection; 280.33(g) ofthe proposal, EPA required owners and operators of a repaired tank to maintainrecords, including signed certification, capable of demonstrating compliancewith the requirements of this section. Comments were received suggesting that a log should be required for eachtank which would document installation, repairs and maintenance, products,tests, and results. EPA agrees that such a log would be a useful meansfor owners and operators to document their compliance with UST managementrequirements and would encourage it. EPA believes, however, that specificallyrequiring a log as opposed to other methods of recordkeeping is unnecessary.The final rule retains the general requirement that owners and operatorsmaintain records demonstrating compliance with this section for the operatinglife of the UST system. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Reporting and Recordkeeping (andSection; 280.34) </ITAG>a. <T3>Introduction. </T3>In the preamble to the proposal (52 FR 12711), theAgency identified the importance of the retention by the UST system ownerand operator of key records of operation on site, and reporting of significantevents to the implementing agency. Because routine reporting would createan overwhelming burden for the implementing agency due to the size of thelarge regulated universe, records will often be the only way for implementingagencies to determine that certain important regulatory actions actuallytook place. Such recordkeeping also prompts the owner and operator to carryout regularly scheduled actions that are necessary to protect human healthand the environment. Reporting of significant developments (such as leaksand large overfills) provides information to implementing agencies earlyenough for them to ensure effective action is taken by owners and operatorsto correct the problem. In general, the proposal consisted of simple butessential recordkeeping and reporting requirements: Recordkeeping thatis sufficient to ensure each owner and operator can demonstrate the recentcompliance status of the facility; and reporting that allows for earlyinvolvement of the implementing agency should an UST system failure needto be corrected. The proposal required owners and operators to report three significantevents to the implementing agency: (1) New UST system installation; (2)final closure; and (3) a suspected release from an UST system and any subsequentactions needed to contain, correct, and clean up a release. An UST systemowner and operator who experiences no problems in the operation of theUST system would only have minimal reporting requirements, imposed at theinstallation and closure of the facility. Only in the event of system failureand a confirmed release would the reporting requirements substantiallyincrease, and the level of this increase would be directly related to thesignificance of the threat posed to the environment. Recordkeeping wasproposed that would demonstrate the use of requisite prevention and monitoringequipment as well as the facility's recent compliance status, as displayedthrough recent release detection, maintenance, and testing results. Public comments on the proposal generally supported the Agency's proposedapproach to recordkeeping and reporting although some concerns were raisedabout the scattered placement of these requirements throughout the rule.Some commenters stated that this format made it difficult for them to findand made it confusing to determine all of the owner and operator's recordkeepingand reporting responsibilities. In response to this concern, the finalrule includes in one section of the rule (andSection; 280.34) a referenceor directory to all of the reporting and recordkeeping requirements foundelsewhere in the rule. Other commenters suggested that additional and, in some cases, more completerecords be required in the final rule. As explained below, however, today'srecordkeeping and reporting requirements have remained essentially thesame as were proposed. A few minor recordkeeping requirements have beenadded, and a few additional pieces of information must be reported duringcorrective actions to assist the implementing agency's assessment of therelease problem. These few changes to specific recordkeeping and reportingrequirements are discussed elsewhere in today's preamble as part of themore detailed analysis of the final rule's technical requirements for closure;release detection; tank system repair, operation and maintenance; and correctiveaction. b. <T3>Summary of Final Approach. </T3>EPA received widespread support forthe general notion that at least some recordkeeping and reporting is essentialto ensure owners and operators adhere to the technical standards beingpromulgated today. EPA did not receive any information or comments to persuadeit that a significant departure from the proposed approach was necessaryor appropriate. Thus, the final rule essentially retains the proposed approach.As discussed in the preamble to the proposal (52 FR 12712), recordkeepingis necessary to ensure compliance with the technical standards for releasedetection, closure, operation and maintenance of corrosion protection systems,and UST system repair. The Agency, as well as many commenters, believes,however, that demonstration of compliance of all requirements over thetotal operating life of the facility is impractical and unnecessary toprotect human health and the environment. Today's approach is predicatedon the intent to impose the minimum burden on the regulated community whileat the same time ensuring that all owners and operators will be able todemonstrate at the request of the implementing agency whether their USTsystem is being managed in a manner that will protect human health andthe environment. For example, the time frames for record retention wereestablished to enable a demonstration of recent facility compliance statusprior to an on-site visit. EPA is convinced that today's final recordkeepingrequirements are essential and serve both the implementing agency's andregulated community's mutual interest. Many owners and operators may decideto keep more detailed records than are required or retain records for longerthan today's minimum time frames. State and local governments may wantto require additional recordkeeping. Today's final reporting and notification requirements are also intendedto foster the self-implementation that underlies today's final technicalstandards. Under today's reporting requirements, an owner and operatordo not have any reporting obligations over the entire service life of thefacility beyond the initial notification at installation and the finalnotification of permanent closure unless a suspected release in the environmenthas occurred. Given the enormous size of this regulated community, theAgency has concluded that it is impractical and unnecessary to overburdenimplementing agencies with periodic or routine reports from UST facilitiesthat are operated properly and have no adverse environmental impacts. TheAgency expects that most UST systems will rapidly improve and move intothis category during the coming 10-year upgrade period. Reporting of releases and corrective actions taken is explicitly requiredunder section 9003(c) of RCRA. Although EPA expects numerous releases willbe identified within this large regulated community, the Agency has concludedthat reporting them to the implementing agency is a necessary first stepto ensure protection of human health and the environment. Today's finalapproach to the reporting of releases and corrective action is based onthe simple assumption that the more serious a release and its impacts are,the greater the necessity for interaction with (and reporting to) the implementingagency. The implementing agency is expected to ensure that the public interestis represented during cleanup decisionmaking and actual corrective actionactivities. The greater the threat to human health and the environment,the more reporting and governmental oversight that is needed. Public comment on recordkeeping was generally favorable. Some commenters,however, objected to the differentiation between on-site and off-site recordmaintenance and availability. Under the proposal, records kept off-sitehad to be available within 24 hours while on-site records had to be immediatelyavailable. Other commenters objected to the requirement for providing off-siterecords within 24 hours, noting that sometimes important records are retainedat corporate headquarters far removed from the UST sites. EPA agrees thatthere should be no real distinction for availability of records and thatthe 24-hour allowance may seem inequitable to those who must maintain recordsthat are immediately available on-site. However, the provision in the finalrule remains unchanged. Records retained at the site must be availableimmediately because EPA has concluded that there is no reason that theyshould not be except that they are not present or up-to-date when requested.When records are maintained at a business office off-site, they must belocated at a readily available site and provided upon request (andSection;280.32(c)). This change to require off-site records to be provided ``uponrequest'' responds to those commenters who pointed out that the proposed24-hour limit was often impossible to achieve when records are stored atoff-site locations. This change is also made to provide some discretionto the on-site inspector who can talk to the owner and operator and determinewhere the records are stored off-site and decide whether they should bemade available for inspection. If the records are easily accessible, theinspector may request that they be made immediately available. This changealso responds to the commenter who believed there should be the same timeallowed for providing records stored either on- or off-site because off-siterecords must be provided within the time frame requested by the implementingagency. EPA believes that, under most circumstances, copies of the originals shouldbe maintained on-site. If copies are not maintained at the sites, the ownerand operator will have to take on the added burden of providing the implementingagency with these copies in an expedited fashion when they are requested.Also, the Agency has determined that it will not make site plans a requiredrecord because it is not necessary to ensure compliance with the technicalrequirements promulgated today. A site plan is, however, a useful toolfor owners and operators. The Agency notes that site plans are recommendedin recent updates of national codes addressed to the installation of newUST systems. Finally, as noted above, in response to commenters' confusion over thevarious recordkeeping and reporting requirements in the proposal, the finalrule has been revised to include a directory in andSection; 280.34 that isintended to simply summarize and identify the recordkeeping and reportingrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="54">This new section is intended to eliminate the confusion identifiedby several commenters when trying to locate their recordkeeping and reportingresponsibilities in the proposal. Each item of reporting and recordkeepingis identified and listed, including a reference to the section of the finalrule in which full details may be found. Requirements with respect to thegeneral availability and maintenance of records are presented along withthis directory section and have not changed since proposal, except forthe slight extension of the allowable period for making off-site recordsavailable to the inspector (see discussion above). </ITAG>D. Release DetectionThis section of today's preamble provides a summary of the Agency's finalapproach to release detection, the proposed rule, and the major changesfrom the proposal. A section-by-section analysis of the final rule (IV.D.2.)discusses in detail the final release detection requirements, includinghighlights of major public comments received. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Overview </ITAG>a. <T3>General Approach to Release Detection.</T3> As described earlier inthis preamble, today's requirements that new and existing UST systems beproperly installed, protected from corrosion, and equipped with spill andoverfill protection will dramatically reduce UST system releases. Releasedetection is an essential backup measure to prevention, particularly forunprotected steel UST systems (prior to upgrading or replacement) and pressurizedpiping because they are more prone to releases. A variety of release detectionmethods have been successfully applied to USTs. These methods can be groupedinto six general categories: tightness or precision tests, tank gaugingsystems, inventory control methods, ground-water monitoring, vapor monitoring,and interstitial monitoring. Each was discussed in the preamble to theproposal (52 FR 12714). State and local programs have chosen to rely ondifferent combinations of these methods. They all appear to be successfullydetecting releases when properly applied. To maintain flexibility in theselection of release detection methods, both for the implementing agenciesand for the owners and operators, the proposal allowed the selection ofrelease detection to be tailored to the characteristics of each site and,therefore, avoided unnecessary disruption of successful state and localprograms. The most important features of the proposed and final rules aresummarized in the sections below. b. <T3>Highlights of the Proposed Rule.</T3> In the proposed rule, the releasedetection strategy relied on the use of either monthly detection methodsor a combination of tightness testing (performed semiannually to every5 years) and monthly inventory control. Frequent testing dramatically increasesthe probability of detecting a release and reduces the length of time arelease can go undetected. A 30-day frequency was selected as a practicalmonitoring frequency that was sufficient to protect human health and theenvironment. The proposed rule required only one release detection methodat each UST site, because frequent use of one monitoring method was sufficientto discover releases before they could cause significant damage to theenvironment. Current industry practices generally do not include frequent release detectionand most releases that are discovered are detected through impacts on thesurrounding community or large inventory losses. Consequently, substantialtime and effort will be required to reach the goal of monthly monitoringfor all UST systems. The proposal phased in detection requirements over5 years to allow the leak detection industry time to expand and to moreevenly schedule the demand for detection equipment. The proposed rule alsoallowed less frequent use of tank testing (every 3 or 5 years when combinedwith monthly inventory controls) during the first 10 years of the program.The goal of the proposed approach was the installation of release detectionas quickly as possible on the tanks most likely to leak. To ensure flexibility, all proven methods of release detection were allowedin the proposed rule. In the absence of adequate data, the proposed ruledid not set one performance standard for all release detection methods.Instead, each method was required to meet performance and design standardsspecific to that method. These standards were based on the experience ofstate programs that indicated these methods were effective under the specifiedconditions.c. <T3>Major Changes in the Final Rule.</T3> Although the overall releasedetection strategy has not changed from the proposal, specific requirementson how and when release detection must be conducted have changed. The fourmost significant revisions to the proposed regulations include: andbullet; More frequent monitoring of existing unprotected tanks duringthe 10-year upgrade period; andbullet; Less frequent monitoring of new and upgraded tanks until age 10;andbullet; Gradual phase-in of release detection based on tank age; and andbullet; More stringent requirements for pressurized piping.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">These changes, discussed generally in section III.B. of today's preamble,are presented in detail in the appropriate parts of the section-by-sectionanalysis below. Additional revisions made to the release detection requirementsare also discussed in the section-by-section analysis. In addition, three important organizational changes were made in responseto commenters' concerns. First, in the proposed rule, the requirementsfor hazardous substance USTs were in a subsection of the petroleum USTrequirements, and several commenters noted that they had difficulty findingand understanding the requirements for these systems. In response to thisconcern, the release detection requirements for petroleum and hazardoussubstance USTs have been separated in the final rule and placed in andSection;andSection;280.41 and 280.42, respectively. Second, tanks and associated piping were treated in the proposed rule asa single unit. Each method of release detection applied to the tank wasrequired also to detect leaks from piping. In another section of the proposedrule, there were additional release detection requirements that could onlybe applied to the piping. Commenters noted that this structure limitedflexibility in meeting the release detection requirements by forcing thesame method to be used for tanks and piping. They noted that the same methodmay not work for both tanks and piping and several viable detection methodsfor piping were excluded. In addition, the information on causes of releaseindicates that piping is generally a greater release threat than tanks.Thus, today's final rule treats piping separately from and with equal importanceto the tank. The release detection methods for tanks and piping have beenseparated in the final rule into andSection;andSection; 280.43 and 280.44,respectively. Third, in the final rule, the release detection requirements for each typeof UST system, including allowed methods and required frequencies of testing,have been consolidated into two brief sections (andSection;andSection; 280.41and 280.42). The detailed performance standards for each method of detectionare now contained in andSection;andSection; 280.43 and 280.44. The section-by-sectionanalysis of the preamble parallels this structure so that all discussionof the phase-in schedule, the methods and combinations of methods allowedfor each type of system, and frequencies of testing are discussed first(sections IV.D.2. a-c.). Discussion of research and public comments onthe technical details of each detection method for tanks and piping isreserved for later sections (IV.D.2. d-e.). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section-by-Section Analysis </ITAG>a. <T3>General Requirements (andSection; 280.40)._ (1) Use of One Release DetectionMethod.</T3> In the proposed rule, a single release detection method couldbe used to meet the requirement to detect releases from both the tank andconnected piping. As discussed in more detail in the preamble to the proposedrule (52 FR 12718-12719), the use of redundant methods of release detectionwas not required at each UST site because the Agency was not convincedthat the required use of these ``backup'' methods would provide significantenvironmental gains in comparison to the adverse impacts on program implementation.Some commenters opposed allowing only one method of release detection primarilybecause they believe all the methods are unreliable and insufficientlydeveloped, particularly external methods. Other commenters, however, agreedwith EPA's position on this issue and cited their own satisfactory experiencewith the various methods. The final rule continues to allow the use of a single properly installedand operated release detection method for tanks when testing is performedmonthly. When less frequent monitoring is used it must be backed up byuse of monthly inventory control. Owners and operators remain free to usemultiple methods if they desire, and state and local programs can requireredundant systems. EPA decided against requiring multiple methods because frequent use ofa single detection method, when combined with the prevention measures containedin other sections of the rule, is sufficient to protect human health andthe environment. The performance standards, design criteria, and limitationson the methods contained in the rule are intended to ensure that the optimumperformance of each release detection method is achieved. Repeating thetest monthly dramatically reduces the possibility of failing to detecta leak. Each test serves as a separate check of the integrity of the USTsystem. Field reports confirm the success of single methods in detectingreleases from UST systems. For example, Dade County, Florida, has detectedover 350 releases using ground-water monitoring wells. EPA's research onthe best ways to use some of the different release detection methods isdirected towards improving the field performance of various types of methods.For tanks and suction piping systems, one detection method, combined withprevention efforts, should virtually eliminate undetected releases. The Agency chose not to rely on one method of detection for pressurizedpiping, however. Even with good efforts at prevention, these systems maystill result in significant releases. Consequently, the final rule requiresexisting and new pressurized lines to use both automatic line leak detectorsand another leak detection method (either monthly monitoring or annualline tightness tests).<T3>(2) Scope of Release Detection (andSection; 280.40(a)(1)).</T3> The proposedrule provided a general requirement that the release detection method be``capable of detecting a release from any portion of the UST system.''The purpose of this requirement was to ensure detection of both tank andpiping leaks. A few commenters objected to the general nature of the wordingof the requirement because it includes some portions of the UST systemsuch as vent lines, fill pipes, and bungs on the top of the tank that donot normally contain regulated substances. Some tank tightness test methodsdo not test the top of the tank and, thus, do not detect the presence ofholes in the vents and bungs. These portions of the tank only leak whenthe tank is overfilled. EPA shares the concern of commenters that a strict interpretation of thewording in the proposed requirement could result in some release detectionmethods, particularly non-overfill tightness tests, not being allowed becausethey cannot detect releases from portions of the UST system that do notnormally leak. The final rule's wording that the methods must be able todetect a release from ``any portion of the tank and the connected undergroundpiping that routinely contains product'' is intended to make clear thattank tightness test methods that do not overfill the tank can be used,as long as they meet the other applicable performance standards and anotheracceptable method is used to test or monitor the piping. Furthermore, releases from the top of the tank or vents occur during overfills,which are not a normal operating condition. Prevention of overfills isaddressed in andSection; 280.20(c), andSection; 280.21(d), and andSection; 280.30,which together require that all new and upgraded tanks have overfill preventionequipment and spill catchment devices and that proper filling proceduresbe followed to prevent these ``nonoperational'' releases. These requirementsare intended to prevent these types of releases; thus, EPA does not believemethods of release detection must be used that will detect them. The additional information on causes of release that EPA has collectedsince the proposal (see section II.F. of this preamble) reinforces thefact that piping is a major source of releases. Therefore, the final rulecontinues to require that the methods of release detection that are usedmust be capable (either singly or in combination) of detecting a releasefrom both the tank vessel and the piping that conveys product. <T3>(3) Installation, Operation, Calibration, and Maintenance (andSection;280.40(a)(2)).</T3> To ensure that the release detection method will reliablydetect releases once in place, the proposed rule required installation,calibration, operation, and maintenance according to manufacturers' specifications.At proposal, the Agency decided against requiring certification of installersand servicers of release detection equipment because these programs arenot currently developed and there are other effective approaches for ensuringproper installation (52 FR 12719). As discussed below, commenters statedthat the rule should require certification of installers and servicersof release detection equipment. After consideration of these comments,EPA continues to believe that such a requirement would hinder rapid installationand flexibility in designing effective ways to regulate installers. Today'sfinal rule will remain as proposed for the reasons discussed below. The UST release detection field is a new and proliferating area of technology,and, because of this, some commenters suggested that a certification programshould be required for installers and operators of release detection equipmentto ensure high quality work and to assist owners and operators in selectingqualified personnel. Certification by EPA or state agencies was suggested.Other commenters felt that a state or Federal certification program wouldlimit the number of installers, would increase the cost of release detectionprovided by those installers who were already certified, and would delaywidespread application of release detection methods. Some of these commenterssuggested alternatives to state or Federal installer certification. By including the performance standard in the proposed rule, EPA acknowledgedthat ensuring proper installation and operation of equipment is important.Although a certification program is a viable approach to achieving thisgoal, EPA disagrees with commenters who felt that state or Federal certificationis the only way to ensure quality installations. Existing state programsthat lack certification programs have been effective at discovering releases.As commenters noted, there are numerous possible approaches to ensure properinstallation. Mandating certification would unnecessarily restrict statesfrom designing alternative effective ways to regulate installers. EPA agrees with commenters that the time required to conduct a certificationprogram would seriously hinder rapid implementation of release detection.Installing leak detection quickly on existing tanks, which are primarilyunprotected steel, will be of significant environmental benefit, even inthe absence of certification. For these reasons, no additional requirementshave been included in the final rule to ensure release detection installationand operation. <T3>(4) Meeting the Performance Standards (andSection; 280.40(a)(3)).</T3>In the proposal's preamble (52 FR 12714-12718), the Agency described threepossible approaches to ensure the quality of release detection equipmentused to meet the regulations. EPA solicited comments on a general performancestandard, certification of methods, and a method-specific performance standard.The Agency proposed the method-specific approach because it offered thegreatest flexibility and facilitated rapid program implementation. Commentersgenerally agreed with the advantages and disadvantages ascribed to eachapproach, and many concluded that the method-specific approach is the bestpossible at present. The final rule thus retains method-specific standardsby requiring each method used meet the standards in andSection; 280.43 orandSection; 280.44.Commenters generally agreed with both the explanation and the conclusionin the proposal preamble concerning the use of method-specific releasedetection standards. Many commenters believe that the method-specific approachwould be the most realistic approach given our current knowledge and thatit would allow the widest range of choices among effective technologies.Some commenters, however, believed a general standard should be formulatedbased on the standard specified for tank tightness testing (0.1 gallonper hour). Because the method-specific standard would allow varying performancestandards, these commenters felt that many owners would simply select thecheapest, least effective method. Other commenters recommended a certificationapproach, feeling that consistency was less important than ensuring thatthe regulated community knew exactly what devices met the standards. The preamble to the proposal contained an extensive discussion of the meritsof each of the three approaches to regulating release detection. One approachconsidered by the Agency was to specify a general standard for the leakrate or quantity which must be detected by a method and not specify individualmethods or restrictions on their use. This approach was viewed as providingthe most consistent level of performance and the one that best challengedmanufacturers to develop defensible performance claims for their equipment.This approach is not used in the final rule for two reasons. First, theAgency does not have sufficient information to relate leak rates to thequantity of product detected by external methods under all possible siteconditions. Second, eliminating the specific methods in the rule wouldslow program implementation by forcing owners and operators to wait fordetailed, extensive performance information before conducting release detection.The final rule, however, incorporates the flexibility of a general performancestandard by allowing, in addition to specific methods, any method whichcan detect a 0.2 gallon per hour leak rate with a probability of detectionof 0.95 and a probability of false alarm of 0.05 within a month. For adiscussion of this addition, see section IV.D.2.a.4. of today's preamble.A certification approach applied at the federal level would provide theregulated community with the clearest direction concerning which releasedetection equipment was acceptable. This approach is not used in the finalrule because it would slow program implementation and reduce the choicesavailable to owners and operators over the next several years. Further,it was not viewed as necessary because comparable performance informationfor each method can be generated by private efforts without federal involvement.Research results and data submitted by commenters after the proposal havereinforced the Agency's belief that all of the methods that were proposedare effective release detection techniques if used within the context ofcertain constraints (discussed in the section on individual methods). EPAbelieves that offering a broad selection of methods will make it easierfor owners and operators to comply with the regulation. Also, a broad selectionis consistent with the encouragement of existing industry trends and stateprograms, which have utilized a variety of release technologies and whichhave been proven effective at discovering leaks. Information gathered byEPA suggests, but does not conclusively prove, that all of the methodsincluded in the rule can detect at least a 0.2 gallon per hour releasewithin 30 days when used in accordance with the restrictions on that method.The Agency believes that all methods will eventually be able to prove theyreliably detect 0.2 gallon per hour releases and has included that as astandard for approving new methods. This standard is discussed in sectionIV.D.2.a.4. Allowing a range of methods with specific standards does notmean the cheapest, least effective method will be selected, because costand effectiveness are not necessarily related. For instance, under somesite conditions (e.g., ground water within the excavation zone), manualground-water sampling may be the cheapest method and will reliably detectreleases substantially smaller than 0.2 gallon per hour. <T3>(5) Delay in Detection Probabilities (andSection; 280.40(a)(3)).</T3>As discussed in the proposal preamble (52 FR 12719), a complete releasedetection performance standard includes not only the leak rate or quantitythat a method must detect, but also the probabilities of detection (PD)and false alarm (PFA). In the proposed regulations, complete standardsof this type were included for in-tank detection methods in the sectionon specific methods. Research results and commenters' concerns have causedthe Agency to make several important changes in the final rule. The probabilitieshave been moved to the general requirements section (andSection; 280.40(a)(3))and changed slightly, and the effective date has been delayed for two years.These changes are discussed below. The proposal preamble emphasized the statistical nature of detecting leaksand the large number of variables that add to the uncertainty in declaringa leak. The probability of detecting a leak is dependent on its size. Allmethods are more likely to discover large leaks than small ones. With regardto detecting the smallest leaks, the Agency recognized that good methodsproperly operated may mistakenly declare a leak when none exists (falsealarm) or fail to discover some leaks (missed detection). Consequently,the standards for tank tightness testing and automatic in-tank monitoringincluded the requirement that methods detect a specified leak rate witha PD of 0.99 and a PFA of 0.01. The Agency remains convinced that specifyingprobabilities in this manner better defines the performance standards andshould help owners and operators make informed choices about leak detection.The final rule retains the PD and PFA as part of the leak detection performancestandard. The probabilities have been removed from the standards for specificmethods and placed in the general requirements section. This change expandsthe coverage of the probabilities to include automatic line leak detectorsand interstitial monitors as well as tank and line tightness tests andautomatic in-tank monitors. The Agency made this change to clarify thatall leak rates or quantities specified as part of a method-specific standardin andSection; 280.43 or andSection; 280.44 must be detected with the samelevel of reliability. The proposed rule set the PD at 0.99 and the PFA at 0.01. In the finalrule, the PD has been changed to 0.95, and the PFA has been changed to0.05. The Agency made this change for several reasons. First, the Agency is not convinced that the 0.99/0.01 specification wasa realistic standard given the wide range of variables affecting leak detectionresults. EPA's study of tank testing methods has attempted to determineperformance at this level of precision and only 2 methods of the 25 studiedcould meet the standard. No study of this sort has been undertaken forthe other methods covered by the probabilities in the final rule. Further,EPA does not plan to conduct studies similar to the one for tank tightnesstesting for other leak detection methods. Rather, the Agency intends thatmanufacturers should evaluate their methods to prove they meet the standardin the rule. Thus, the change in the final rule will encourage manufacturersto undertake this research. EPA is developing procedures for testing releasedetection equipment in a common way to help manufacturers in evaluatingtheir equipment. EPA chose the 0.95/0.05 specification in the final rulebecause it is a level of performance attained by a modified commercialtank test method in the National Motor Fuel Survey. In addition, severalcommenters felt that a probability of detection of 0.95 was more realisticand was adequate to protect human health and the environment. Because the final rule requires frequent-to-continuous monitoring, thechange in probabilities will have little environmental impact. For example,a test which detects 0.1 gallon per hour leaks 95 percent of the time inone test will discover 99.9 percent of 0.1 gallon per hour leaks in 3 consecutivetests. Further, tests that meet this standard are virtually certain todetect leaks larger than this threshold and will detect a significant numberof leaks below the threshold. Under either standard, large leaks will becaught immediately and small leaks will be discovered before they causeenvironmental damage.The final change in this section of the final rule is a delay in the effectivedate of the probabilities. As discussed above, few methods have been provento meet the complete standard specified in the proposed rule. However,preliminary results from the EPA's tank testing study (Notice of Availability;53 FR 10403) indicate that several methods could meet the standard withsimple changes in procedures and equipment. The Agency also wanted to allowtime for manufacturers of automatic tank gauging systems, automatic lineleak detectors, and interstitial monitors to prove that their systems meetthe complete standard. The Agency believes manufacturers can make the necessarychanges to their methods and evaluate their performance in 2 years. Untilthe probabilities become effective, methods need only detect the leak rateor quantity specified for that method in andSection; 280.43 and andSection;280.44. Methods installed or conducted during this 2-year phase-in willnot need to be performed again or replaced after the probabilities becomeeffective, but all methods used after that period of time will have toachieve the probability standard. <T3>(6) Reporting of Positive Monitoring Results (andSection; 280.40(b)).</T3>The proposed rule contained a provision in Subpart E that the ownerand operator must report all suspected releases indicated by the resultsof release detection monitoring. Perhaps because this release detectionreporting requirement was in a different subpart from the release detectiontechnical requirements, commenters stated that it was unclear when a suspectedrelease needed to be reported. To clarify and strengthen the requirementto report all suspected releases, a provision has been added to SubpartD (andSection; 280.40(b)) in the final rule explicitly stating that any indicationby the release detection method that a release has occurred must be reportedin accordance with reporting procedures described in Subpart E. It is intended that all release detection equipment be operated at leastat the level of sensitivity indicated in the performance standard. Forexample, 2 years after the effective date of the rule, the tightness testthreshold (i.e., test result that indicates a suspected release) shouldbe set to detect 0.1 gallon per hour leak rates with a PD of 95 percentand a PFA of 5 percent; this threshold value may differ for various tightnesstesting devices. Manufacturers of the release detection equipment mustdetermine what this threshold value must be to meet the performance standardand inform operators of their equipment. Until the manufacturer sets sucha threshold, tank test operators should continue to use the current 0.05gallon per hour threshold. For most tank testing methods, this will approximatethe threshold level for detecting 0.1 gallon per hour leaks. The ownerand operator would report a suspected release when a test result exceeds0.05 gallon per hour or the threshold value provided by the manufacturerin accordance with andSection; 280.50. It is important to note that the performance standards such as 0.2 gallonper hour or \1/8\ inch of product on top of the ground water are deviceperformance standards set to exclude less effective equipment. The standardsare not allowable contamination levels. Owners and operators are stillresponsible for correcting leaks and cleaning up any product released tothe environment. It is in their interest to use the most effective releasedetection equipment and operate it so the device detects releases as quicklyas possible to avoid potentially costly corrective action. <T3>(7) Phase-in of Release Detection (andSection; 280.40(c)). </T3>The proposedrule required a 3- or 5-year phase-in of release detection, with the shorterphase-in period applied to USTs without protection from corrosion and thelonger phase-in to those USTs with corrosion protection. These phase-inperiods were based, in part, on the experiences of several state and localUST programs in initiating release detection under a phase-in schedulethat was typically 3 to 5 years (52 FR 12677, 12703-12704). This phase-inwas proposed to ensure that tanks with the greater risk of leaking (thoseunprotected from corrosion) had release detection installed first. As discussedin the proposal preamble, the total phase-in period covers 5 years to allowenough time for the release detection industry to respond to the demand,owners and operators of existing tanks to plan their needs, and implementingagencies to develop their programs. The proposed rule also required closureof existing USTs that could not meet the phase-in schedule. Commenters recommended a variety of phase-in periods and generally recommendedage as the most appropriate basis for the phase-in. Therefore, andSection;280.40(c) of the final rule phases in the implementation of release detectionover 1 to 5 years based on the age of the system (oldest tanks first).Requiring the oldest tanks to phase in release detection sooner, within1 year, ensures that those UST systems most likely to leak are addressedfirst. The final rule also retains the proposed requirement of closureof any USTs that cannot meet the release detection requirements by thephase-in date. A significant addition to the final rule is the requirementthat existing systems with pressurized piping must retrofit line leak detectorswithin 2 years. Comments received regarding the phase-in of release detectionare discussed in more detail below. Commenters recommended a range of time periods from 3 to 10 years for completingthe phase-in of release detection. Commenters supporting a longer periodbelieved that the proposed phase-in periods would overburden the releasedetection industry, resulting in poor quality installations and late compliance,and cause economic hardship to owners and operators. Those commenters recommendingshorter phase-in periods believed that a tighter schedule would preventsignificant environmental damage. The Agency has decided in the final ruleto retain the overall 5-year phase-in time period for the same reasonsoutlined in the proposal preamble (52 FR 12677, 12703, and 12704). Basedon experience at the state and local level, EPA does not believe releasedetection can be installed and conducted at over 700,000 UST sites nationwidein less than 5 years. Not only will it be difficult to do in less than5 years, but some of the release detection systems installed on a moreexpeditious timetable could be lower quality as a result. As discussedabove, however, the greatest release potential will be during this interimperiod. Thus, lengthening the phase-in period would result in unacceptablygreater environmental damage. Moreover, even accepting commenters' concernsabout economic burdens, lengthening the phase-in would not provide a resolutionbecause retrofitting would still be necessary ultimately and would be coupledwith greater corrective action costs brought on by the delay in detection.For these reasons, today's final rule retains the 5-year phase-in period.During the 5-year phase-in period, it is important to direct release detectionefforts at the existing UST systems most likely to leak. Many commentersrecommended achieving this goal by phasing in release detection based onthe age of the UST system. They pointed out that this approach also hasthe advantage of stabilizing the demand for release detection, resultingin less burden for both the release detection industry and the owners andoperators. It also has the advantage of addressing first the tanks thatare most likely to leak. Several commenters pointed out their concernsthat if the phase-in is not sequenced in its implementation, the regulatedcommunity will collectively wait until the last minute, and unavoidablefurther delays will ensue. A few commenters opposed an age-based schedulebecause it was too simplistic or ignored other important factors.The Agency agrees with commenters suggesting a release detection phase-inschedule based on age. Although age is not the only factor in determiningwhen a tank will leak, it is an important factor that is readily understoodand determined and, therefore, easy to implement. This approach is alreadybeing used successfully in several state and local programs. The approachin the final rule is not a radical departure from the proposed phase-inschedule. The causes-of-release study indicates that most existing protectedUSTs are less than 10 years old. Under both the proposed and final phase-inschedules, these tanks must phase in release detection within 5 years afterpromulgation. EPA believes that the main impact of the revised schedulewill be to spread out the phase-in of release detection on unprotectedUSTs, which represent over 75 percent of UST systems, over years 1 through4 rather than require it all at year 3, resulting in fewer implementationbottlenecks. Some commenters recommended a class approach (sensitive areas first) tophasing in release detection. Although the concept of retrofitting releasedetection in vulnerable areas first is appealing, EPA does not believeit is possible to identify sensitive classes in any meaningful way at theFederal level (see section III.C. of this preamble). States can chooseto phase in release detection based on a class approach without losingthe ability to receive state program approval (see andSection; 281.33) ifthey complete a phase-in of release detection at all existing tanks within5 years and pressurized piping in 2 years. EPA's information on the causes of release clearly indicates that pressurizedpiping represents a major source of uncontrolled releases. None of therequirements for existing systems in the proposed rule addressed the threatof catastrophic releases from pressurized piping. Consequently, in thesupplemental notice (52 FR 48638), the Agency requested comment on theidea of requiring existing systems to retrofit line leak detectors on pressurizedpiping. Commenters generally felt that it was appropriate to require sucha retrofit and recommended a variety of phase-in schedules. EPA agreeswith commenters who recommended a short phase-in schedule because thispiping is a significant environmental hazard, retrofitting line leak detectorsis relatively easy and inexpensive, the devices are highly effective (seesection IV.D.2.e.1. of the preamble), and many systems are already equippedwith the devices. Consequently, the final rule requires that existing pressurizedpiping meet the same standards as new piping 2 years after the effectivedate of the rule (see section IV.D.2.b.2. of the preamble for piping requirements).<T3>(8) Closure if Release Detection Is Not Installed (280.40(d)). </T3>Inthe proposed rule, EPA required closure of an existing UST system if amethod of release detection was not installed by the end of the specifiedphase-in period. Most existing USTs are not protected from corrosion and,thus, are likely to corrode and eventually leak. The selected phase-inschedule discussed above is considered the maximum time that these systemsshould be allowed to operate without release detection. Therefore, thefinal rule continues to require that UST systems be closed if release detectioncannot be retrofitted or applied by the phase-in date. One commenter noted that the closure procedures of the proposed rule requireda site assessment of the excavation zone before closure, the results ofwhich might delay closure beyond the allowable time frame. Although theAgency recognizes that closure can be a time-consuming process, it shouldnot require any more time than the selection and installation of releasedetection equipment. The final rule requires that, by the phase-in date,the owner must remove the tank or fill it with inert material and completethe site assessment. Should a release be discovered, responding to thefindings of the site assessment is part of corrective action and need notbe completed by the phase-in deadline. Owners and operators are expectedto plan ahead to ensure that they complete installation of release detectionor the closure procedures by the specified date. This will allow the implementingagency to ensure compliance with both requirements with a single inspection.For these reasons, EPA has retained in the final rule the provision tocomplete closure by the end of the phase-in period. <T3>(9) Other Changes. </T3>One of the general requirements in the proposedrule required a site assessment prior to the installation of any externalleak detection system to ensure compliance with the performance standardsfor the particular method used. To clarify that the site assessment isintended to include only an analysis of selected factors within or beneaththe excavation zone, the general requirement has been deleted, and theonly assessment requirements are contained in andSection; 280.43 (e)(6) and(f)(7) of the final rule. These changes are discussed below. The importance of a site assessment in correctly selecting and applyingan external method was discussed in the proposal preamble (52 FR 12720-12722).Although numerous factors were listed in the proposal preamble concerninga site assessment, EPA stressed that the assessment should, at a minimum,ensure compliance with the method-specific restrictions in the proposedrule. EPA requested comment on the proposal to include these or other sitevariables in the assessment requirement. Some commenters stated their beliefthat a complete site assessment is too extensive a technique to be requiredfor demonstrating the performance of external release detection and doesnot provide much useful information because conditions at the site changeconstantly. Most commenters, however, agreed that a site assessment isappropriate before installation of external release detection systems.In fact, these commenters wanted to extend this provision by requiringsite assessments for all release detection methods, thereby requiring aquick national survey of all UST site conditions. Others suggested at leastrequiring a site assessment periodically at all USTs. The Agency continues to believe that site assessment of the excavationzone is necessary to ensure the reliability of external methods. The Agencyalso agrees with comments stating that the site assessment requires nomore information beyond checking a site for compliance with the restrictionson the methods. Conditions in and below the excavation zone must be knownbefore an external method is selected or installed because inappropriateexcavation conditions can render some external methods ineffective. Internalmethods are not typically affected by site conditions, and those methodsthat are affected (e.g., water table level can affect tightness tests)can account for these conditions without performing a site assessment.The major factors determining the effectiveness of ground-water and vapormonitoring were included in the method-specific performance requirementsin the proposed rule, and, for most sites, an adequate assessment willrequire evaluation of only those factors. The Agency decided against requiring a more extensive, more frequent, ora more widely applied site assessment because of the unnecessary burdenit would place on implementing agencies and the possible delays in releasedetection compliance it would cause. The Agency believes that the greatestbenefit for existing systems, short of upgrade or replacement, will beobtained by conducting release detection as quickly as possible. The siteassessment for certain external methods is retained in the final rule inandSection; 280.43 (e)(6) and (f)(7) because EPA believes it is importantto ensure that these methods work properly. The site assessment is notintended to be a general search for contamination at the site. Any contaminationfound, however, must be reported, and the owner and operator must complywith the corrective action requirements of Subpart F. A more detailed searchfor contamination is required when tanks close under Subpart G.b. <T3>Requirements for Petroleum UST Systems (andSection; 280.41). (1) Requirementsfor Petroleum Tanks (andSection; 280.41(a))_(a) Overview. </T3>The proposedrule offered a variety of release detection methods for petroleum UST systems.New or existing UST systems could perform accurate monthly monitoring usingautomatic tank gauges, vapor monitors, ground-water monitors, interstitialmonitors, or other methods approved by the implementing agency. The proposalallowed two exceptions to the monthly monitoring requirement. First, whencombined with monthly inventory control, tank tightness tests could beperformed semiannually at new UST systems. The proposal allowed semiannualtightness testing and inventory reconciliation for new tanks because thecombination was believed to be as accurate as monthly monitoring. Second,when combined with monthly inventory control, tank tightness tests couldbe performed less frequently at existing USTs during the 10-year upgradeperiod (every 3 years for bare steel systems or every 5 years for protectedtanks). Less infrequent tank tests for existing USTs were permitted duringthe phase-in period because the Agency believed the release detection industrylacked the capacity to perform monthly monitoring at all existing tanksin 3 to 5 years. The use of monthly monitoring methods has been retained as an option forall petroleum UST systems in the final rule. The final rule also containstwo exceptions for tightness testing similar to those in the proposal.An overview of the release detection requirements is presented in Figure4. During the 10-year upgrade period at existing tanks that are not adequatelyprotected from corrosion and lack spill and overfill equipment, the rulenow requires either (1) annual tank tests and monthly inventory controls,or (2) monthly monitoring. Tanks that meet the standards for new or upgradedtanks are required either (1) to conduct tank tests every 5 years combinedwith monthly inventory controls for a 10-year period following the dateof installation or upgrade or until 1998, whichever is later, or (2) toconduct monthly monitoring. Also, in both cases, by the end of the 10-yearperiod, these USTs must be using an approved monthly monitoring method. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus(s) 283 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C  </ITAG><T3>(b) Monthly monitoring. </T3>In the proposal preamble, EPA discusseda variety of possible release detection strategies ranging from continuousmonitoring to an infrequent ``check'' of the tank system (52 FR 12676-12677).``Frequent-to-continuous'' detection methods were proposed by the Agencybecause more frequent sampling improves the chances of finding leaks andlimits the length of time over which leaks can progress unchecked. As aresult, the proposal required tanks to be monitored at least monthly unlessthe owner or operator chose an option that included less frequent tanktightness testing in combination with monthly inventory control. (Monthlyinventory control does not by itself meet the requirements for ``monthly''monitoring and must be combined with periodic tightness testing.) Commenters were divided over whether monthly monitoring provides adequateenvironmental protection and whether it was unduly burdensome. EPA continuesto believe that the monthly monitoring frequency offers effective environmentalprotection. Moreover, checking the release detection equipment once a monthis not difficult or expensive, according to several commenters and Agencyresearch. More frequent monitoring would necessitate the use of continuousmonitors, which are not needed at all sites and which may be less effectiveat some sites. Thus, the final rule (andSection; 280.41(a)) requires monthlymonitoring as a baseline for all new and existing petroleum UST systems.<T3>(c) Tank Tightness Testing and Inventory Control (andSection; 280.41(a)(2)).</T3>In the preamble to the proposal, EPA noted practical problems withconducting monthly monitoring at all existing tanks over the proposed phase-inperiod. These methods have not been practiced on a mass scale in the past,and the Agency expressed the concern that the industry did not have sufficientcapacity to capably install monthly monitoring at 1.4 million USTs in 5years. Because tank tightness testing and inventory control are commonlyused as effective release detection methods not requiring the installationof permanent equipment, EPA allowed these methods as options for existingUSTs during the 10-year phase-in period for upgrading (see section IV.D.2.b.1).The large number of existing systems to be tested and the limited industrycapacity caused the Agency to propose less frequent tank testing for existingsystems than for new systems: every 3 years at unprotected existing systemsand every 5 years at protected existing systems. The proposed frequencieswere selected in recognition of the differing probability of releases atunprotected and protected UST systems. For new tanks, the proposal allowedmonthly inventory control combined with semiannual tightness testing becausethe combination was believed to be as effective as monthly monitoring usingthe other approved methods. Many commenters were concerned about the use of tank tightness testingand inventory control as an alternative to the monthly monitoring requirements.Commenters particularly questioned the appropriateness of more frequentmonitoring being proposed for new tanks than for existing unprotected tanks.Although there was a variety of opinions on what the proper frequencieswere, commenters uniformly felt that new tanks were less likely to leakand should be monitored less often than existing tanks. The new informationpresented in the ``Causes of Release Study'' corroborates these concernsthat the most serious environmental threat is posed by older, unprotectedsteel tanks (see section II.F. of the preamble). Available evidence demonstratesthat new or upgraded tanks are extremely unlikely to leak over their normaloperational lifetimes especially within 10 years of installation or upgrade.EPA solicited comments on this issue and this new information in the supplementalnotice published December 23, 1987 (52 FR 48641-48642). Most commentersagreed with the Agency's conclusions on these matters, which are reflectedin the final rule.The Agency continues to believe that monthly monitoring cannot be installedon all UST systems within 5 years and that allowing tightness testing combinedwith inventory control will ensure that release detection can be providedto all existing USTs as soon as possible. During the phase-in period, EPAbelieves that priority should be given to requiring application of availablerelease detection resources to older bare steel systems. Accordingly, inandSection; 280.41(a)(2), the final rule requires that if owners and operatorsof existing unprotected UST systems choose tightness testing, it must beperformed yearly rather than every 3 years as proposed. Existing protectedsystems (with spill and overfill prevention equipment) are required tobe tested every 5 years during the 10-year upgrading period, the same asproposed. Because extremely few new or upgraded tanks are expected to leakduring the first 10 years of their operational life, under the final rule(andSection; 280.41(a)(1)), these tanks may also conduct tightness testingevery 5 years. This approach has the advantage of encouraging upgrade orreplacement of unprotected tanks before the end of the phase-in period,resulting in improved environmental protection. At the end of the 10-yearupgrading period or at the end of the 10-year operational life of new orupgraded systems, these tanks must be equipped with a monthly monitoringmethod. The proposed rule required tank tightness testing to be combined with inventorycontrol (or another method of equivalent performance) for several reasons.Frequent tank tightness testing is not practical because it requires extensivepreparation, including a shutdown of operations. It is, however, a sensitivemethod that provides very accurate results. Manual inventory control isless sensitive but can provide nearly continuous (daily) release detectionthat can reliably detect larger releases. The rule proposed the combinationof the two techniques to compensate for each component's disadvantages.Several commenters on the proposed rule viewed the combination of techniquesas redundant and stated that each method is adequate on its own. Othercommenters agreed that, separately, each of these techniques would be aninadequate release detection method. The Agency evaluated different approaches to tank tightness testing andinventory control since the proposal (Notice of Availability; 53 FR 10403).The results of the studies, which are discussed in more detail in the preamblesection on these methods, confirm that monthly inventory control is effectiveat reliably detecting larger leaks (about 1 gallon per hour) and that tanktesting can reliably detect much smaller leaks (0.1 gallon per hour). Thisresearch and information submitted by commenters convinced EPA to retainthe combination of infrequent tank testing and monthly inventory controlin the final rule as an exception to monthly monitoring in certain situations.The proposed semiannual tightness testing and inventory control for newUSTs has been deleted from the final rule, because the Agency does notbelieve that the combination is as effective as the other monitoring methods.The Agency continues to believe that monthly monitoring is necessary toprotect human health and the environment; less frequent monitoring is allowedonly as an interim measure. Currently, conducting monthly tank tightnesstesting is not a practical or economical method. Tank testing methods maybe developed in the future, however, that can be performed on a monthlybasis to detect leaks of 0.2 gallon per hour. The final rule allows theuse of this method without inventory control once the method is provento meet the performance standard in the section on other methods (andSection;280.43(h)). <T3>(d) Manual Tank Gauging (andSection; 280.41(a)(3)). </T3>In additionto the other release detection methods in the proposed rule, the finalrule also includes manual tank gauging. The Agency requested comment onthe use of this method in the supplement to the proposed rule (52 FR 48641),citing a study submitted by a commenter on the proposal showing that thismethod was effective for used oil tanks. EPA conducted an analysis of thisstudy (Notice of Availability; 53 FR 10403) and found that weekly tankgauging can detect 0.2 gallon per hour leaks with a PD of 95 percent anda PFA of 5 percent for tanks smaller than 550 gallons. Because it provides the same level of protection as other monthly monitoringmethods, the final rule allows use of this method for any tank with nominalcapacity of 550 gallons or less. Detailed discussion of research and commentson the inclusion of this method is provided in Section IV.D.2.d.(2). oftoday's preamble. <T3>(2) Requirements for Petroleum Piping (andSection; 280.41(b))._(a) Overview.</T3>The proposed regulation required that each release detection methodchosen for the tank also detect releases from the piping. In addition,new pressurized piping was required to have equipment capable of detectingand shutting off a release of at least 2 gallons per hour unless the pipinghad continuous or interstitial monitoring. Suction piping that meets certainminimum design specifications was exempt from these release detection requirements.Commenters agreed that pressurized piping was allowable but that additionalrelease detection requirements were necessary. Some commenters had reservationsabout automatic shutoff devices and flow restrictors and recommended backuprelease detection or double-walled piping. New information acquired bythe Agency since proposal on causes of release indicates that pressurizedpiping, along with spills and overfills, is the major source of releases,particularly large-volume catastrophic releases (see section II.F. of thispreamble). Because of this new information, the Agency requested additionalcomment on release detection issues related to underground piping in thesupplemental <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice published December 23, 1987 (52 FR 48641-48642).The final rule has been revised to reflect the importance of preventingand rapidly detecting piping releases by including additional release detectionrequirements for pressurized piping and further encouraging the use ofsuction systems. Figure 5 summarizes the requirements for petroleum piping.Pressurized piping must have a release detection device that monitors theline at least hourly and automatically shuts off or restricts product flowor sounds an alarm when there is an indication of a leak. The owner andoperator must also conduct either monthly monitoring or an annual linetightness test. The monthly monitoring may include vapor monitoring, ground-watermonitoring, interstitial monitoring, or other methods that meet the performancestandard or are approved by the implementing agency. The performance standardsfor the piping release detection methods are contained in a separate sectionof the rule (andSection; 280.44) and are discussed in section IV.D.2.e. below.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus(s) 291 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C  </ITAG>The Agency notes that one release detection method can be used as the solemethod if it can meet both the hourly release detection requirement andthe annual or monthly release detection requirements. For example, double-walledpiping with continuous interstitial monitoring that meets the performancestandard continues to be an acceptable option for pressurized piping andwould not require shutoffs, restrictors, or tightness tests. The systemmust be equipped, however, with an alarm that will indicate when a releaseinto the interstitial space has begun. Suction piping systems meeting the ``no leak'' criteria described belowin subsection (c) continue to be exempt from release detection. Other suctionsystems must operate with monthly release detection or a line tightnesstest every 3 years. <T3>(b) Requirements for Pressurized Piping (andSection; 280.41(b)(1)). </T3>Asdiscussed in the proposal preamble (52 FR 12743-12745), the Agency wasconcerned that pressurized piping, which uses a pump in the tank to forceproduct through the line to the dispenser, could result in large volumesof product being quickly released to the environment through a hole orcrack. In contrast, suction piping appears to be intrinsically much saferbecause product is transferred at less than atmospheric pressure by a pumpnear the dispenser drawing product from the tank by suction, and failureswill result in air or ground water flowing into the pipe rather than productbeing released during operation. The Agency considered not allowing pressurizedpiping at new installations but its widespread use, the availability ofrelease detection technology (see discussion below), and some of the operationallimitations of suction piping persuaded EPA to include it in the proposedrule.Commenters agreed with EPA's position that pressurized piping could resultin large-volume releases in the absence of release detection but felt thatpressurized piping with release detection should be allowed in the finalrule. They noted that pressurized piping is widely used, economical, efficient,dependable, and not susceptible to vapor lock. Commenters also noted thatsuction piping is more expensive to operate and requires longer times todispense product and that its use is restricted by elevation above sealevel, height differences between storage and delivery, flow rate, temperature,and length of horizontal piping. The Agency has continued to allow theuse of both suction and pressurized piping in the final rule subject tothe requirements discussed below. andbullet; <T3>Immediate Detection of Large Leaks (andSection; 280.41(b)(1)(i)). </T3>At proposal, data received from state agencies indicated that piping wasinvolved in 20 to 35 percent of all releases. Pressurized piping was alsoidentified as the most common petroleum dispensing system at new installations.Documented cases raised the possibility of sudden large releases from thesesystems. These factors led the Agency to conclude that additional releasedetection was required for pressurized piping so that large-volume releasescould be stopped as quickly as possible. The monthly monitoring frequencyrequired for the tank was considered inadequate given the potential environmentaldamage due to a release from pressurized piping. At proposal, piping pressuresensing methods were commercially available that manufacturers claimedcould detect and shut off a release of at least 2 gal/hr from pressurizedpiping. Although the performance of these devices had not been evaluated,the magnitude of the problem and the availability of control technologycaused the Agency to require shutoff devices in the proposed rule. Theproposal preamble requested information on the field performance of pressurizedpiping release detectors (52 FR 12744). A variety of approaches are available to rapidly detect large leaks inpressurized lines. Two main types of continuous in-line release detectiondevices are commercially available for pressurized piping: Flow restrictorsand flow shutoff devices. Both devices react to pressure behavior in theline. A flow restrictor monitors the increase in line pressure after thedispenser is turned on. If there is a leak in the line preventing the linefrom reaching operating pressure, the restrictor allows a limited flowof product through the line to the dispenser, and thereby signals a leakto the operator. An automatic shutoff device monitors pressure changesduring periods when the dispenser is off. If the line pressure drops enoughto indicate a leak, the pump turbine is shut off, and no product can bedispensed. In addition to in-line detectors, continuous interstitial, vaporor ground-water monitors may also give rapid reliable warning when a leakoccurs. Commenters generally agreed with the need for pressurized piping releasedetection that was conducted more frequently than monthly. Many felt thatonly flow restrictors should be required because they are widely availableand have proven performance. Based on information from UST installers andon causes-of-release data, flow restrictors operating at a 3 gallon perhour detection limit will eliminate 80 to 95 percent of the volume of releasesoccurring from piping. These devices have been in use for years and canbe immediately installed at a large number of existing or new UST installations.The Agency recognizes that other methods of frequent piping detection canachieve the same level of performance as flow restrictors, however. Theproposed rule allowed interstitial monitoring or continuous ground-wateror vapor monitoring instead of automatic shutoff devices but did not includea performance standard for these methods. Research conducted since theproposal (Notice of Availability; 53 FR 10403) shows that under certaincircumstances ground-water monitoring will not allow immediate detectionof a release. To ensure an equivalent minimum level of protection againstcatastrophic pressurized piping releases, the final rule includes the requirementthat all pressurized piping have automatic line leak detectors that providewarning of 3 gallon per hour releases within an hour. EPA expects thatthis requirement can be met using flow restrictors, automatic shutoff devices,continuous interstitial monitors, and some continuous vapor monitors. Continuousground-water monitoring may also meet this requirement under certain siteconditions (e.g., shallow water table). EPA expects that some of thesedevices will be sufficiently sensitive to meet the additional monitoringrequirements discussed below. If a device meets both standards, no additionalmonitoring is required. A detailed discussion of the performance of thesesystems is contained in section IV.D.2.c. of today's preamble. andbullet; <T3>Additional Monitoring for Smaller Leaks (andSection; 280.41(b)(1)(ii)).</T3>Commenters suggested the use of inventory control or line tightness testingin conjunction with flow restrictors, shutoff devices, or continuous monitors.The new causes-of-release information acquired since proposal shows evenmore strongly that piping is a major source of leaks from UST systems.Because of the importance of controlling pressurized piping releases, EPAagrees that additional release detection beyond the immediate detectiondiscussed above is necessary. Flow restrictors may not detect small releases,so additional monitoring is necessary to detect these releases. Therefore,the final rule has been revised to require an annual line tightness testor monthly monitoring using one of the accepted methods for tank monitoring.Line tightness testing is more sensitive than the other methods (see sectionIV.D.2.e. below) and so can be conducted less frequently for equivalentprotection. Further, because of the problems cited by commenters with thereliability of flow restrictors and the ability of operators to overridethem, the final rule also requires that the operation of the line leakdetector be checked annually in accordance with manufacturer's requirements.This system of checks will limit the likelihood that pressurized pipingwill release large volumes suddenly. This approach, coupled with requirementsfor corrosion protection and careful installation and testing of piping(which will significantly lower the incidence of piping releases over time),will protect human health and the environment. andbullet; <T3>Secondary Containment for Piping. </T3>Some commenters recommended that secondary containment with interstitialmonitoring be required for all pressurized lines. The Agency feels, however,that the release detection options described above for single-walled pipesare protective of human health and the environment and that the additionalstringency gained by double-walled pipes does not need to be required.EPA also notes that secondarily contained piping is a relatively new technologythat would require significant new training of installers to ``de-bug''the applications of this technology for widespread use. In any event, themonthly or annual tests will detect the small slow leaks from piping whilethe shutoffs or restrictors will detect the large releases. EPA agreesthat secondary containment for piping is environmentally protective, andowners and operators may choose to install continuous interstitial monitorswhich meet the above standards. <T3>(c) Requirements for Suction Piping (andSection; 280.41(b)(2)). </T3>Inthe proposed rule, all release detection requirements were waived for suctionpiping that meets six design and operating standards concerning pressure,slope, run of the piping system, and use of properly located check valves.This piping design, common in Europe, ensures that little, if any, productwill be released if a break in the line occurs. The Agency also felt thatthis exemption would encourage the use of suction piping over pressurizedpiping wherever possible, which is desirable because suction systems areless likely to leak than pressurized systems. Suction systems which donot meet the criteria for exemption were required to be monitored in thesame manner as the tank, because the Agency believed small, continuingreleases were possible from these systems. Changes in the requirementsfor both exempt and non-exempt systems are discussed below. andbullet; <T3>Design Criteria Revised. </T3>The proposed rule contained design criteria for exempt suction systemsconcerning the number and placement of check valves and the slope of thepiping because small releases can occur in an improperly designed or installedsystem. Two of these criteria have been deleted and one criterion has beenadded in the final rule. First, commenters noted that the 2-percent slopemandated in the proposed rule is difficult to meet using current designpractices, and the API and PEI codes of practice recommend a 2-percentslope. Commenters also noted that a 2-percent slope decreases the maximumdistance between the tank and the pump, thus limiting station design. Inthe final rule, therefore, the specific value for the slope has been eliminated,and only the general requirement has been retained that the slope be suchthat product will drain back into the tank when suction is released. Second, the proposed rule also required that suction systems have onlyone check valve as close to the pump as possible and not have a foot valve.These criteria overlap, however, and the foot valve restriction has beendeleted from the final rule. This change does not weaken the final rulebecause the requirement for only one check valve near the pump will preventa large volume of product being held in the portion of the pipe from whicha leak could occur.Finally, today's rule contains an additional provision that exempt suctionsystems must have a means of verifying compliance with the design requirements.In the preamble to the proposal, the Agency noted that suction systemsin West Germany are equipped with a means of ensuring that the contentsof the line are under less than atmospheric pressure (52 FR 12745). Thisserves to ensure that if a hole in the line develops the liquid drainsback into the tank and is not released to the environment. Although theAgency received no comments directly related to this issue, commentersdid note that service contractors frequently correct operational problemswith suction systems by adding additional check valves to the line. Aninspector could not easily discover this alteration and the system couldbegin to leak. Consequently, the Agency decided to require that exemptsuction systems be equipped with a means for an inspector to readily determinethat the system continues to meet the design requirements. andbullet; <T3>Non-Exempt Suction Systems </T3>Under the proposed rule, American-design suction systems, which commonlyhave a check valve near the tank or at piping unions, were required tohave release detection conducted as frequently as for the tank. Commenterson the proposal noted that eliminating check valves at piping unions ornear the tank is not practical in some applications and requested thatthese systems also be exempt from release detection requirements. The causesof release information acquired by EPA clearly indicates that both typesof suction piping are dramatically less likely to have large leaks thanpressurized systems. Based on this information, EPA requested comment onthe use of less frequent testing (every 1 or 3 years) for suction systemsin the supplement to the proposed rules (52 FR 48642). Commenters disagreedon an acceptable testing frequency but generally agreed that all formsof suction line pose a limited environmental threat. EPA agrees with commenterswho noted that non-exempt suction systems can have small continuing releasesunder some conditions and, therefore, should not be exempt from detectionrequirements. Because the leaks from these systems are limited and willusually be signaled by operating problems, EPA believes that a 3-year frequency,in conjunction with required prevention measures, is protective of humanhealth and the environment. The reduced frequency of testing for thesesystems should further encourage the use of suction systems over pressurizedsystems, even for applications where the exempt design requirements areimpractical. These incentives add to the environmental protection providedby the piping release detection standards. c. <T3>Requirements for Hazardous Substance UST Systems (andSection; 280.42).</T3>The proposed rule required the use of secondary barriers with interstitialmonitoring at all new or upgraded UST systems storing hazardous substances,unless the owner and operator: (1) Demonstrated that an alternative methodof release detection would accurately and reliably detect a release ofthe hazardous substance from the UST system and (2) obtained approval touse another method from the implementing agency. Also, in the proposal,owners and operators of existing hazardous substance USTs were allowedduring the 10-year upgrade period to use any of the methods of detectionallowed for petroleum USTs, if the performance requirements for that methodcould be met. At the end of the proposed 10-year upgrade period, ownersand operators would have to upgrade or replace this release detection withsecondary containment and interstitial monitoring unless a variance wasapproved. After consideration of numerous public comments submitted on these issuesand additional research, EPA continues to believe that release detectionand corrective action technologies are not as readily understood or widelyused for the broad range of hazardous substances as they are for petroleum.EPA believes that secondary containment continues to be the most effectivedemonstrated method of release detection for new UST systems containinghazardous substances. Thus, EPA has retained the proposed approach in thefinal rule but has revised (1) the performance standards for the secondarycontainment and (2) the procedures for receiving a variance. In the finalrule, in applying for variance, owners and operators of new or upgradedUST systems must provide (in addition to the demonstration of the effectivenessof a release detection method) information about applicable correctiveaction technologies, the inherent health risks, the chemical and physicalproperties of the stored substance, and any relevant characteristics ofthe particular UST site that would impact a future clean-up. These factorswill be used by the implementing agency to guide its decision on whetherto allow the alternate release detection method for the hazardous substance.<T3>(1) Release Detection Requirements (andSection; 280.42(a) and (b)).</T3>Commenters took a variety of positions regarding the necessity of secondarycontainment for hazardous substance USTs. Many felt that the approach inthe proposal was appropriate while others thought that specific chemicals,or all regulated substances, should be treated in a manner similar to petroleum.Many of these arguments centered on the similarities or differences betweencertain hazardous substances and components of petroleum. Commenters alsodisagreed about the most effective form of secondary containment, somefavoring double-walled tanks, and others advocating excavation liners.Commenters generally were opposed to allowing soils as an excavation linerdue to the difficulty of ensuring that the soils were properly treatedand compacted. The final rule has retained the proposed secondary containment requirementfor new and upgraded hazardous substance UST systems with some significantrevisions. The final secondary containment requirement is based on bothtechnical and implementation considerations. From the technical perspective,secondary containment is believed desirable because it ensures that allhazardous substance USTs will be provided with effective detection methods,and, if a leak occurs from the primary containment structure into the interstitialspace, corrective action will be simplified because it is very unlikelyto impact the surrounding environment. As discussed in later sections oftoday's preamble, EPA has extensive information on the performance of variousrelease detection methods and corrective action technologies already beingapplied to petroleum tanks. (The Agency allowed single-walled tanks andrelease detection for storage of petroleum substances because of the detectabilityof these substances and the belief that small releases could be cleanedup relatively easily.) Information about the performance of release detectionand corrective action methods for hazardous substances, however, is notas readily available. Most importantly, there is very limited field experiencewith detection methods for hazardous substance tanks. This is made moresignificant by the fact that numerous hazardous substances are more toxicthan petroleum and are less likely than petroleum to be detected by smellor taste. It is also important to note that, when replacing these hazardoussubstance tanks, industry has generally chosen to put them aboveground,in vaults, or in double-walled tanks. This lack of information and experiencewith effective single-walled tank strategies for hazardous substance USTshas caused the Agency to conclude that secondary containment is the mosttechnically prudent approach to protecting human health and the environment.In today's final rule, the Agency has given important consideration toboth technical and implementation concerns. From an implementation standpoint,the secondary containment requirement is considered feasible by EPA becausethere are significantly fewer hazardous substance systems subject to regulationthan there are petroleum tanks. In addition, secondary containment apprearsto be consistent with existing industry practices and state regulationsfor storage of these substances. As noted in the preamble to the proposal,state and local programs have adopted a variety of requirements for hazardoussubstance USTs that tend to emphasize secondary containment. In addition,these regulatory programs are generally not as widespread or well establishedas petroleum tank programs, which makes adoption of the secondary containmentstandard less disruptive to ongoing implementation. Although EPA recognizesthat some hazardous substances can be both detected and cleaned up as easilyas petroleum, there are many chemicals that cannot, and specific criteriafor distinguishing them for UST release detection purposes are difficultto establish, especially in a rule to be applied nationwide. Commentersdid not provide any workable approaches on new information upon which EPAcould develop such criteria. Owners and operators are eligible for a varianceif they can demonstrate that effective detection and cleanup technologiesexist for the specific hazardous substances being stored (see the nextsection of the preamble). The specific requirements for secondary containment of hazardous substanceUST systems have been revised based on public comment and new information.Many commenters assumed that the proposal's alternative for secondary containmentwith interstitial monitoring required full secondary containment that wouldprevent the release of chemicals to the environment even in the event ofa catastrophic tank failure. The proposal, however, was intended only toensure detection of releases and not necessarily to contain them. For example,it allowed both excavation zone liners and double-walled tanks that didnot have 360anddegrees; coverage of the inner wall. Based on commenters'concerns and the preceding discussion, the final rule requires for newor upgraded UST systems storing hazardous substances that the outer barrierbe capable of containing a release until it is detected and cleaned up.The effect of this requirement is to require both double-walled tanks andliners to completely surround the inner tank and be checked for releasesas frequently as necessary to prevent the release of hazardous substancesto the environment should a leak occur. This monitoring would, at a minimum,need to be conducted at least monthly. In the final rule, the Agency has taken an approach that is based on theone followed for hazardous waste tanks under Subtitle C of RCRA (40 CFRParts 264, 265; Subpart J). It is the Agency's belief that many of thehazardous substances covered in today's rule have properties that are verysimilar to those of hazardous waste. Consequently, both rules require thata leak at any time during the operational life of the facility will becontained until it is detected and removed from the containment system.Because there are significantly more hazardous substance UST systems thanhazardous waste tank systems, and because Subtitle I UST systems are notpart of a permitting program, the Agency has retained the performance-orientedapproach that was proposed. (It is the same general approach used for petroleumtanks.) This performance-oriented monitoring approach is intended to provideenough flexibility to control the greater number and variety of hazardoussubstance tanks, without the use of permits, while at the same time providingthe same level of protection as provided by the tank requirements underSubtitle C of RCRA. <T3>(2) Variance to Release Detection (andSection; 280.42(b)).</T3> As statedin the proposal preamble, EPA recognizes that secondary barriers with interstitialmonitoring may not be necessary for all hazardous substance UST systemsbecause there may be alternate release detection methods that, based onthe tank system characteristics, location, and the nature of the substancestored (52 FR 12741), adequately protect human health and the environment.The Agency, therefore, proposed to allow the use of other release detectionmethods if the owner or operator demonstrated that an alternate methodreliably detects the release of the hazardous substance from the UST systemand obtains the approval of the implementing agency (see proposed andSection;280.41(b)). A number of commenters supported the variance provision, while others opposedallowing a variance in any situation. The Agency has concluded that therisks posed by the use of an alternate method will be minimized by requiringthe owner and operator to apply for a variance, and by stipulating thatan alternate release detection method can be substituted only if it isas reliable as those used for petroleum and petroleum-based substances,and all performance criteria for the release detection method are satisfiedat the site. In addition, information about available corrective actiontechnologies, and the inherent health risks and chemical properties ofthe substance stored, will also need to be provided by the owner and operatorto the implementing agency for review. These other factors may overridethe detectability criteria. For example, if a given vapor monitoring devicedetects a hazardous substance with better sensitivity, accuracy, and responsetime than it detects petroleum, and if all the other criteria for the operationof the method are met at the site, then the owner and operator is eligibleto apply for a variance from the secondary barrier requirement. However,the implementing agency will approve the alternate method only after consideringthe additional information about the characteristics of the substance storedand the availability of corrective action methods for that substance ifa release occurs at the site. Thus, although an effective and accuratevapor monitoring method is available, the implementing agency may decidenot to approve the variance request if the UST is located near a drinkingwater well or there is no corrective action technology that can be appliedto remove the release before this resource is adversely impacted. For existing hazardous substance USTs, the Agency allows the use of alternaterelease detection for up to 10 years, at which time owners and operatorsmust have applied for and received a variance and must have upgraded theexisting system to new tank standards. Although the application for a variancecan be made any time within the 10-year upgrade period for existing USTs,the owner and operator must meet the appropriate performance standardsin andSection;andSection; 280.43 and 280.44 for an alternate release detectionmethod at all times during the 10-year interim period. <T3>(a) Application Process. </T3>In the preamble to the proposal, theAgency requested comments on procedures that could be used by owners andoperators to apply for a variance (52 FR 12743). Commenters provided anumber of suggestions on how the variance application process could beimplemented. These suggestions included a variance application proceduresimilar to the one promulgated in the final rules for hazardous waste tanks(40 CFR Parts 264 and 265), a ``nationwide'' variance application procedurefor single companies storing similar products in tank systems located inseveral states, or a joint petitioning procedure for different companiesin the same state that have similar characteristics of tanks, substances,and release detection methods.The Agency evaluated all the suggested application procedures and decidedto defer the specific implementation details to the implementing agencies.Numerous factors, such as differences among the traditional proceduresalready followed by implementing agencies, variability of site conditions,and the number and configuration of tanks at each site, suggest that administrativedetails for dealing with this variation should be left to the specificagency reviewing the request. The Agency plans to develop information abouta number of variance application options that can be used by the implementingagencies in designing a variance process in their jurisdiction. The finalrule contains only the baseline requirements that the owner and operatormust satisfy in order to use a substitute method of detection at new orupgraded hazardous substances USTs; these requirements are to: (1) Demonstratethe detectability of the substance using the alternative release detectionmethod; (2) provide data about the corrective action technology that willclean up a release within the constraints of the UST site characteristicsand the inherent chemical, physical and health-risk properties of the substance;and (3) obtain variance approval before the installation and operationof the alternate release detection method. <T3>(b) Evaluation Criteria. </T3>In response to EPA's requests for publiccomment on the type of information and criteria that could be used by theimplementing agencies to grant variances (52 FR 12742), commenters recommendedthat EPA develop a list of hazardous substances that would qualify forvariances on a class basis. They also recommended that EPA develop a listof hazardous substances that are petroleum-like substances as well as identifyphysical properties for hazardous substances that could be considered forvariances. No commenters provided a workable set of criteria for doingthis, however. Significant new information was not provided by commentersconcerning the characteristics of hazardous substances. The Agency proposedto compile a similar list of the specific petroleum substances but rejectedthis approach in the final rule. (See section IV.A.4. for a discussionof the definition of ``petroleum'' and ``petroleum UST systems.'') Afterconsidering the different evaluation criteria in a variance program, theAgency decided that a specific set of national evaluation criteria is notworkable given the diversity of the chemical properties of the hazardoussubstances, the USTs in which they are stored, and the variability of sitecharacteristics. The Agency believes that specific variance program implementationdetails (for example, the use of ``class'' variances) are best left tothe implementing agencies. The Agency does, however, intend to assist theimplementing agencies in their variance program development by providingalternative procedures for simplifying the application and approval processand by providing more information about the general criteria that mustbe satisifed at a minimum nationally in each variance application. <T3>(c) Specific Changes to the Rule. </T3>The final variance requirementsonly differ in minor ways from those in the proposed rule. The requirementto notify the implementing agency of the intent to conduct a demonstrationfor a variance has been removed. Instead, owners and operators will berequired ``to demonstrate that an alternate method can detect a release''before it is used at a new or upgraded UST system. Thus, prior notificationis simply an item of administrative convenience that can be required byimplementing agencies at their discretion. The final requirements makeclear that it is advantageous for the owner and operator to apply as earlyas possible, because an alternative method cannot be used to meet the newor upgraded hazardous substance UST system release detection requirementswithout approval of a variance by the implementing agency. In the final rule, owners and operators are also required to submit tothe implementing agency information about the availability of correctiveaction technologies that could be used should there be a release of thestored hazardous substance at that site, including a consideration of anyunusual health risks that are posed by a release of the stored substance.The Agency believes that this additional type of information is neededby the implementing agency to be able to evaluate variance applications.This change is in response to those commenters who believed that the proposedapproach was not stringent enough and could result in adverse impacts tohuman health and the environment. Also, these new criteria provide thefurther clarification of evaluation criteria that was suggested as neededby other commenters. EPA believes these general criteria will more adequately(than the proposed approach) ensure that only variances will be appliedfor that, if approved, will protect human health and the environment. d. <T3>Methods of Release Detection for Tanks (andSection; 280.43).</T3> Theproposed rule presented in one section the release detection options thataddressed the complete UST system (both tanks and piping). It also specifiedin one section the methods that need to be combined, the frequency of testing,and the applicable performance standards. The final rule has been reorganizedin response to several commenters who stated that this format was unclearand that it was confusing in the way it combined tank and piping detectionmethods and petroleum and hazardous substance requirements. All of thegeneral requirements, such as combinations and testing frequencies, arenow contained in andSection; 280.41 for petroleum and andSection; 280.42 forhazardous substances. Any substantive changes in these areas are discussedin previous sections of the preamble (IV.D.2. b. and c.). The final rulein andSection; 280.43 now simply lists the methods that can be used for detectingleaks in tanks and the conditions under which they can be used to meetthe requirements of andSection; 280.41 and andSection; 280.42. The methodsapplicable to underground piping are listed seperately in andSection; 280.44and are discussed in a later section of this preamble (IV.D.2.e.) <T3>(1) Inventory Control (andSection; 280.43(a)).</T3> The proposed ruleallowed the use of monthly inventory control in combination with periodictank tightness testing as a method of release detection. Although listedas a separate method in the final rule, inventory controls still must becombined with another method of detection (see section IV.D.2.b.1. above).The Agency acknowledged that inventory control is affected by many variablesbut maintained that the technique is effective when correctly performedby trained personnel. The proposed rule contained weekly and monthly performancestandards and procedural requirements to optimize the effectiveness ofinventory control. Commenters generally felt that the performance standards and the procedureswere too stringent, and that the method was unreliable because the variableswere essentially uncontrollable. EPA's research since proposal demonstratesthat the proposed rule would in fact result in an unacceptable rate offalse alarms; consequently, the final rule has been revised to eliminatethe proposed weekly performance standard and to change the monthly performancestandard to 1 percent of monthly product throughput plus 130 gallons. Inaddition, the proposed requirement that only tanks partially within theground water perform a monthly test for water within the tank has beenexpanded to apply to all tanks. Also, the proposed limitation on the accuracyof the dispensing meter has been revised to make it consistent with localweights and measures standards. These changes are discussed in more detailbelow. <T3>(a) Performance Standard. </T3>EPA proposed that inventory controlbe conducted to detect a release of at least 5 percent of flow-throughon a weekly basis and 0.5 percent of flow-through on a monthly basis; thelatter standard was based on an API recommended practice. The Agency wasconcerned that having only a monthly inventory control requirement wouldlead to large releases occurring for a month before detection. Therefore,the proposal included a weekly loss standard that was intended to provideearly warning of major losses. Several commenters stated that the proposed 5 percent weekly and 0.5 percentmonthly flow-through requirements were too stringent and too difficultto achieve, particularly the weekly requirement. They also felt that theweekly requirement would result in many false alarms, thus unnecessarilyburdening owners and operators and the implementing agencies. They suggestedthat detection of such small leaks from tanks with low flow-through ofproduct was difficult, that the temperature influences on volume were toogreat to obtain accurate data, and that the technology was not sufficientlydeveloped to detect small releases and, at the same time, ensure againstfalse alarms. Other commenters supported the monthly flow-through requirement.In response to commenters' concerns, the Agency has since proposal evaluatedseveral approaches to inventory control to determine the minimum leak ratethat could be reliably detected. The evaluation considered basing inventoryleak determinations on the percent of throughput, percent of throughputplus a constant volume, or number of days exceeding a given loss. A database of actual inventory records consisting of over 20,000 measurementsat nearly 600 tanks nationwide was used in a computer simulation of leakrates. The study indicated that the proposed monthly standard would resultin a large number of false alarms (approximately 30 percent on a monthlybasis). The most sensitive of these inventory control methods would detecta loss of about 1 gallon per hour at a PD of 95 percent and a PFA of 5percent. This investigation revealed that using sophisticated statisticalinventory control or pooling the inventory data for several months wouldimprove the sensitivity of all the methods. Notice of this study was publishedfor comment in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 10403). A commenter submitted a studythat confirmed the high false alarm rate of the monthly standard and indicatedthat the weekly requirement also had an unacceptably high false alarm rate(over 50 percent).In response to these comments and the studies discussed above, EPA hasmodified the final rule. The Agency acknowledges that other methods candetect smaller releases, but the final rule allows inventory control combinedwith tank testing for use during the phase-in period or with new, protectedtanks because of its general effectiveness, low implementation costs, andease of application. As discussed above, however, the proposed 5 percentweekly detection rate produces an unacceptably high false alarm rate, asdoes the proposed 0.5 percent monthly standard. Consequently, the requirementfor weekly inventory control has been omitted from the final rule and themonthly requirement has been changed to 1.0 percent of flow-through plus130 gallons, which has a false alarm rate of about 5 percent. The Agencybelieves that owners and operators will take inventory results more seriouslywhen the number of false alarms are reduced. EPA has further concludedthat inventory control offers a practical and effective means of detectingreleases only when combined with tank testing or automatic tank gauging.In addition to the performance standard, the proposed rule contained sixrestrictions that had to be followed when conducting inventory control.The restrictions that received the most comment involved measurement accuracy(to \1/8\ inch), the accuracy of the dispensing meters, and the requirementto measure water only when some portion of the tank is below ground water.These restrictions are discussed below. <T3>(b) Dipstick Measurement Accuracy. </T3>At proposal, the Agency believedthat reading dipsticks to the nearest \1/8\ inch could be performed andthat reading to this level would reduce major errors involved with themeasurement of the stored product's height (52 FR 12727). A number of commentersfelt that many factors interfere with precise dipstick measurements, and,therefore, it is not reasonable to require accurate measurements for animprecise method. Commenters also felt that the \1/8\ inch requirementwas inconsistent with existing conversion tables, which are usually markedin whole inches. Other commenters suggested reasons why dipstick methodsof measurement were inappropriate. The EPA-sponsored research discussedin the previous section indicates that increased stick-reading accuracydown to and including \1/8\-inch does improve the performance of inventorycontrol. The Agency also has concluded that existing dipsticks marked to1 inch can be successfully read to the nearest \1/8\ inch to improve accuracy,or that conversion tables can be modified. <T3>(c) Dispensing Meter Accuracy. </T3>Accurate metering is essentialto inventory control. Therefore, based on the National Conference on Weightsand Measures Standard, the Agency proposed that dispensing should be meteredto within 5 cubic inches for every 5 gallons of product withdrawn, evenif it meant that certain owners and operators would have to install orcalibrate dispensing meters. Several commenters preferred the requirementto be 6 cubic inches per 5 gallons, in accordance with the National Bureauof Standards (NBS) Handbook andplusmin;44, or that it be the same as thelocal weights and measures standards. EPA agrees with commenters that localweights and measures calibration standards will be adequate to ensure accurateinventory reconciliation where these standards are applicable. At dispensingmeters that are not covered by local weights and measures standards, thenationally recognized NBS standard is appropriate. The final rule has beenrevised accordingly to allow both calibration standards. <T3>(d) Monthly Water Check. </T3>The proposal required the measurementof any water in the tank at least monthly if any portion of the tank iswithin the water table. Water in a tank could result from ground-waterintrusion, indicating that there is a hole in the tank. One commenter suggestedmore frequent measurement of water under all situations rather than onlyin those cases where the tank is partially within the water table. TheAgency agrees that water could enter the tank even when the water tableis deep (e.g., when rain water temporarily collects in the excavation pit).The presence of water in a tank can indicate a hole in the tank, whetherthe water comes from ground water or rain water. The provision now requiresthe water measurement monthly at all tanks conducting inventory control.The monthly frequency was retained because it agrees with the frequencyof other release detection methods, which was selected as the frequencythat is protective of human health and the environment. The measurementof water in the tank is a simple procedure routinely conducted by manyoperators already, so this requirement should not significantly increasethe operator's burden. <T3>(2) Manual Tank Gauging (andSection; 280.43(b)).</T3> In the supplementto the proposed rule (52 FR 48635), EPA requested comments on the use ofstatic inventory control (or manual tank gauging) as a release detectiontechnique for used oil (or other types of) UST systems. Commenters generallysupported the use of this detection method, although they differed widelyon what tanks should be allowed to use this method, how long the test shouldbe, and how frequently it should be performed. Research submitted by onecommenter, and EPA's own analysis, indicates that this method is as effectiveas inventory control at smaller tanks (below 2,000 gallons) and can reliablydetect leaks of 0.2 gallon per hour for tanks of 550 gallons or smaller.Consequently, final rule allows its use as the sole release detection methodfor tanks 550 gallons or less in capacity. Also, manual tank gauging canbe used in the final rule for tanks of 551 to 2,000 gallons as a substitutefor the inventory control part of the method (that combines monthly inventorycontrol with periodic tank tightness testing). Manual tank gauging cannotbe used to meet the release detection requirements at tanks larger than2,000 gallons. Commenters were divided over the applicability and effectiveness of manualtank gauging. Some commenters recommended that manual tank gauging be approvedbecause it is effective and inexpensive and because used oil poses lessenvironmental risk than other regulated substances. They also noted thatthe lack of piping and small deliveries at these tanks made releases lesslikely. Some commenters opposed the use of manual tank gauging becausethey believed the method is not sensitive enough and includes too muchroom for human error. These commenters also frequently recommended requiringsecondary containment for used oil because it contains hazardous constituentsand no other detection methods are as effective. As discussed earlier in today's preamble (section IV.A.3.g.), the Agencybelieves that used oil does not differ substantially from petroleum productsand should be regulated in the same manner. Consequently, today's finalrule requires that these tanks conduct accurate monthly monitoring usingthe methods applicable to other petroleum tanks. The Agency requested commentsin the supplement to the proposed rule on the possibility of includingmanual tank gauging as a monitoring alternative; specifically, for usedoil tanks or other types of tanks. Commenters recommended a wide rangeof specific requirements. Suggested frequencies ranged from daily to every5 years and suggested test lengths ranged from 6 hours to 72 hours or longer.Some commenters recommended this test should apply to other regulated substances,especially products similar to used oil. Commenters disagreed on the appropriatesize limit for tanks allowed to use this method. In order to determine more precisely the performance of this method, EPAanalyzed a report submitted by a commenter. EPA's evaluation (Notice ofAvailability; 53 FR 10403) indicates that for tanks smaller than 550 gallons,manual tank gauging can detect 0.2 gallon per hour leaks with a PD of 0.95and a PFA of 0.05 when performed in accordance with today's rule. For tanksbetween 550 gallons and 2,000 gallons the method achieves the performanceof inventory control. For those tanks, the method is capable of detectingleaks of 1 gallon per hour or less with a PD of 95 percent and a PFA of5 percent, even under extreme temperature conditions. Based on commenters'suggestions and these study results, the final rule includes manual tankgauging as an allowed leak detection method. In today's rule, only tanksof 550 gallons or smaller may use this as the sole method of release detection.Larger tanks (551-2,000 gallons) may use it in place of the inventory controlpart of the release detection method that combines inventory control withperiodic tank tightness testing.According to the Agency's evaluation, the performance described above canbe achieved if the following limitations are met: The test period is atleast 36 hours, depth measurements are taken twice and averaged, and thedepth is read to the nearest one-eighth of an inch. These criteria havebeen included in today's final rule. <T3>(3) Tank Tightness Testing (andSection; 280.43(c)).</T3> The proposedrule allowed periodic tightness testing in conjunction with monthly inventorycontrol as a release detection method for all tanks. While acknowledgingthe uncertain performance of tank testing, the Agency believed that itwas a demonstrated and effective method that would be available to meetthe large demand for release detection following promulgation. To maximizethe performance of tank tightness tests, the proposed rule included a performancestandard of 0.1 gallon per hour at a PD of 99 percent and a PFA of 1 percent.Commenters disagreed about whether tightness testing should be includedin the rule and what level of performance it should be required to meet.Additional evaluation by EPA indicates that, although few methods can nowmeet the proposed standard, several methods could make a few changes toequipment and protocol and meet the proposed standards. For these reasons,the final rule retains the proposed tank testing standard of 0.1 gallonper hour. <T3>(a) Performance Standard. </T3>At proposal, EPA recognized that manyfactors such as temperature changes, tank end deflection, and vapor pocketsaffect the accuracy of tank tightness tests (52 FR 12724-12725). To limitthe allowable methods to those that most effectively compensate for theseproblems, the Agency included a performance standard in the proposed rule.The level of this standard was selected based on the results of the nationalsurvey of underground motor fuel storage tanks and the experience of tightnesstesting practitioners; little evidence was available to support the NFPA329 criterion of 0.05 gallon per hour. The proposed standard of 0.1 gallonper hour at a PD of 99 percent and a PFA of 1 percent was believed to bethe maximum performance achievable on the typical sizes of tanks in use.A high PD was included to adequately protect human health and the environment,and a low PFA was included to prevent a heavy burden on owners and operatorsand the implementing agencies that is caused by investigating a large numberof false alarms. In the proposal preamble, EPA acknowledged that there was insufficientinformation on the performance of available tank tightness tests, particularlytheir ability to meet the NFPA 329 standard of 0.05 gallons per hour withthe proposed probabilities of detection and false alarm. It was furtherstated that the Agency was beginning an investigation to acquire this data(52 FR 12724-12725). Since that time, EPA's research laboratory at Edison,New Jersey, has evaluated 25 tank tightness testing methods representinga wide range of approaches. During each evaluation, blind tests were conductedby company operators, the data were evaluated by EPA, and computer modelswere used to simulate leak rates and probabilities and compare them tothe operational data. The results of these evaluations indicate that, whilemost of these currently available methods of tank tightness testing arecapable of detecting leaks of 0.1 gallon per hour, only a few could presentlydetect this leak rate at the specified probabilities. Even with the oftentimessimple equipment and procedural changes that are necessary to achieve theneeded level of improved performance, some methods probably would not beable to meet the proposed PD and PFA. Notice of the results of this studywas published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 31, 1988 (53 FR 10403). Some commenters felt that tightness testing is too unreliable to be anallowable release detection method, at least without further evaluation.Several commenters stated that the proposed standard was too stringentto be met with existing technology, particularly for larger tanks. Othersrecommended a more stringent standard for the release rate, usually citingthe NFPA 329 criterion of 0.05 gallon per hour as the way to spur developmentof the technology. One commenter suggested that the performance standardshould become more stringent over time as the methods develop. The proposedstandard was supported by some commenters. Based on the Agency's evaluation of tank tightness test methods and theconcerns raised by these commenters, the final performance standard hasbeen revised. Many of the methods evaluated by EPA at its Edison, New Jerseylaboratory were able to detect a release of 0.1 gallon per hour so thisvalue was retained in the final rule. The detection probabilities associatedwith the standard have been moved to the general requirements section (andare discussed earlier in this preamble in section IV.D.2.a.). During thetwo years before these probabilities are effective, the Agency believesadditional standards are needed. Thus, the final rule language has beenchanged to include the requirement that tank test methods must accountfor the effects of thermal expansion or contraction of the product, vaporpockets, tank deformation, evaporation or condensation, and the locationof the water table. These variables have been identified as important inEPA research (Notice of Availability; 53 FR 10403) and in the NFPA 329recommended practice. The Agency's evaluation indicates that many tightness test methods canmeet the final performance standard with relatively minor procedural orequipment changes. Such changes, however, have not been developed and institutedby the manufacturers of many of the different devices, tried in the field,or evaluated in laboratory conditions. In addition, manufacturers havenot described their performance in terms of probability of detection andprobability of false alarm in the past. There will be a large demand fortightness testing for release detection and confirmation following promulgationof the final rule. Tightness testing is the most widely available releasedetection method and the method that is likely to be used by many UST ownersand operators over the next 5 to 10 years. EPA was concerned that, if fewor none of the tightness test methods could meet the performance standard,there would be insufficient industry capacity to meet demand for releasedetection. For these reasons, the final rule has been revised to delaythe effective date of the probabilities of detection and false alarm (seediscussion of this delay in section IV.D.2.a.5. above). The Agency decided to give manufacturers 2 years in which to develop andput into operation the necessary procedural and equipment changes or todevelop new methods that meet the entire performance standard. Such a delaywas recommended by some commenters and will ensure that necessary equipmentand procedural changes can be made by method manufacturers. As discussedpreviously in the preamble, the Agency believes significant environmentalbenefit can be obtained by conducting release detection quickly. The delayin performance standards should allow more wide spread and rapid testingof tanks.<T3>(b) Relationship of the Final Performance Standard to NFPA 329. </T3>Asnoted above, some commenters felt that the proposed performance standardof 0.1 gallon per hour at a PD of 99 percent and a PFA of 1 percent wastoo lenient and was a relaxation of the standard currently followed bythe industry, which is 0.05 gallon per hour recommended in NFPA 329. However,the Agency has concluded that the final performance standard is not lessstringent than NFPA 329. First, the standard in the final rule still requirestesters to declare a leak at a threshold value of 0.05 gallon per hour(see section IV.D.2.a.4. above). Second, the NFPA guideline specifies adetectable leak rate but does not specify the probability with which thisleak rate must be detected. Most existing volumetric methods will detect0.05 gallon per hour leaks at least a portion of the time. A relativelypoor method that detects a leak of 0.1 gallon per hour with a PD of 50percent and a PFA of 1 percent could still claim to meet the NFPA criterionbecause the probability of detecting a leak is not specified. Direct comparisonto the Agency's performance standard shows that the NFPA 329 criterionwould allow more leaks to go undetected and also cause more false alarms.EPA's final performance standard intended to eliminate the use of poortightness test methods, ensure that more leaks are detected, and causefewer false alarms. Thus, it provides for better protection of human healthand the environment while ensuring unnecessary or counterproductive burdenson owners, operators, and implementing agencies are minimized. <T3>(c) Large Tanks. </T3>In the preamble to the proposed rule, EPA statedits doubts that the performance standard was attainable for large tanks(52 FR 12725). Some commenters agreed and some disagreed. Research at EPA'sEdison facility suggests that the 0.1 gallon per hour standard cannot bemet for large tanks using current test methods. Rather than allowing lessstringent test methods for large tanks, which would create the potentialfor ignoring large releases, EPA believes that owners and operators oflarge tanks will have to select other release detection methods besidestank tightness testing unless improved or new methods are developed thatallow the standard to be met for the larger tanks. (See section IV.A.3.of this preamble on bulk underground storage tanks.) <T3>(4) Automatic Tank Gauging Systems (andSection; 280.43(d)). </T3>Automatictank gauging systems (ATGS) were included in the proposed rule as one ofthe options for release detection (although the name of this option asproposed was ``automatic monitoring of product level and inventory control'').These monitors generally have two modes of operation: Leak detection mode(product level monitoring) and inventory control mode. The proposed rulerequired that the leak detection mode be used at a minimum once a monthand meet a performance standard of 0.2 gallon per hour with a PD of 99percent and a PFA of 1 percent and that the automatic inventory controlbe conducted to meet the performance requirements for manual inventorycontrol. Some commenters stated their belief that ATGS are unreliable,unproven, and too costly. Other commenters felt that the proposed performancestandards were too stringent. Many commenters favored the use of ATGS butsuggested changes to the requirements in the proposed rule. As discussedbelow, the Agency has retained ATGS in andSection; 280.43(d) of the finalrule. The proposed leak rate standard has been retained but the probabilitieshave been revised and their effective date delayed 2 years. The proposedrequirement that the tank be 80 percent full at the time of the test hasbeen deleted. These changes and comments are discussed in more detail below.<T3>(a) Performance Standard. </T3>At proposal, the Agency recognized therewere limited performance data on ATGS, and that there was still significantopportunity for human error. However, ATGS were a relatively commonly usedrelease detection method with the potential to be very sensitive in detectingleaks, and EPA wanted to include as many effective release detection optionsas possible in the rule to provide flexibility (52 FR 12736-12737). Tolimit the allowable ATGS to those that effectively control the possiblesources of error, the proposed rule included a performance standard of0.2 gallon per hour with a PD of 99 percent and a PFA of 1 percent. The0.2 gallon per hour value was based on the equipment manufacturers' claims.This performance standard was intended to challenge manufacturers to provethat their systems could meet the standard.Some commenters felt that ATGS were unproven and unreliable as a releasedetection method primarily because of their sophisticated electronic components.Other commenters felt that the PD was too stringent, while others agreedwith this part of the proposed performance standard. A commenter provideda study conducted over several months at an operating service station equippedwith several ATGS. One of the devices already clearly achieved the proposedperformance standard. This study confirmed the Agency's conclusion thatATGS can be effective in field situations; thus, this release detectionmethod has been retained in the final rule. EPA's own research and the results of the field evaluation of ATGS demonstratethat 0.2 gallon per hour leaks can be reliably detected by several of thedifficult types of available devices, and the proposed leak rate of 0.2gallon per hour has been retained in the final rule, but the PD has beenchanged to 95 percent and the PFA to 5 percent. In addition, the finalrule schedules the PD and the PFA standards to take effect 2 years afterthe effective date of today's rules (see discussion of this delay in sectionIV.D.2.a.5. above). Any owner or operator installing an ATGS in the intervening2 years will not have to replace it after 2 years, unless it does not meetthe performance standard. EPA's review of the systems now available indicatesthat they should be able to meet the standards with only minor adjustments.Some commenters felt that the Agency should set a detectable leak ratefor ATGS of 0.1 gallon per hour rather than the 0.2 gallon per hour requirementin the proposed rule. EPA, however, does not agree because current equipmentas presently used cannot meet such a standard, and the suggested approachwould effectively eliminate ATGS as a release detection method. Furthermore,since the product level test is conducted monthly, the performance of thismethod can statistically equal or exceed the sensitivity achieved by periodictank testing, even though the monthly performance standard is less stringent.The Agency intends to keep as many effective methods available to the ownersand operators so that they will have flexibility in selecting a releasedetection method that best suits their needs. <T3>(b) 80-Percent-Full Requirement. </T3>The proposed rule required thatthe tank be 80 percent full during the monthly test. This requirement wasintended to ensure that a large portion of the tank's surface was checkedfor releases (52 FR 12737). Many commenters opposed this requirement because it would be difficultfor tanks with low monthly flow-through to implement, and it would alsobe an impediment to businesses with UST systems that are in use continuously.New information now indicates that this limit on conducting the test isunwarranted. Information from experienced UST field personnel, a studyin Suffolk County, NY, and comments received by EPA demonstrate that mostcorrosion holes occur in the sides and bottom of tanks, not the top, sothere is little need to always test the top of the tank for releases. In the absence of a specific requirement, release detection tests conductedevery 30 days are expected to include tests over the range of levels towhich the tank is typically filled, so those areas of the tank routinelyin contact with product will be tested. The inventory control requirementwill also ensure that releases from the top of the tank are detected ifthey occur. Also, many owners and operators do not keep their tanks 80percent full during normal operation; if tanks are rarely filled abovea certain point, testing above that point is simply unnecessary. Also,the overfill prevention requirements in andSection; 280.20 and andSection;280.30 of today's rule will prevent product from reaching the very topof the tank. Therefore, the Agency has deleted this requirement from today'sfinal rule. Although testing at 80 percent of capacity is no longer required, the testingprocedure should be conducted when the tank is near its highest level andthe testing should be conducted after waiting a sufficient time after thedelivery of the product. This waiting period is necessary because, afterproduct is added to the tank, it takes time for the product to mix andachieve the nearly static condition necessary to conduct meaningful productlevel monitoring (52 FR 12725). EPA anticipates that this waiting periodwill become a part of the manufacturer's recommended procedures as theyattempt to meet today's standard concerning detection probabilities. <T3>(c) Combination with Inventory Control. </T3>In combination with ATGS,the proposed rule required inventory control that meets the same performancestandards required for manual inventory control. Inventory control wasrequired in addition to product level monitoring because it was believedthat product level monitoring was not as accurate as tank tightness testingor external methods and, therefore, a backup release detection method wasneeded. This requirement is not burdensome because ATGS routinely collectthe information needed to conduct inventory control. No comments were receivedon this issue. Therefore, inventory control is still required in conjunctionwith ATGS in the final rule. Some of the performance standards for inventorycontrol have been revised in today's final rule and are discussed in sectionIV.D.2.d.1. above. <T3>(d) Effectiveness with Piping. </T3>A commenter was concerned aboutthe effectiveness of ATGS in detecting releases from piping. EPA agreesthat, in the leak detect mode, this method will not detect piping leaks,and the inventory mode will detect piping leaks but not with sufficientsensitivity to detect small leaks. The causes-of-release information collectedby EPA since the proposal (see section II.F. of this preamble) indicatesthat piping is a major source of releases. Therefore, the final rule hasadded several requirements for piping (see section IV.D.2.b.2. of thispreamble). The owners and operators of UST systems using ATGS as a releasedetection method for the tank will have to select an additional means ofrelease detection for the piping, such as line tightness testing. <T3>(5) Vapor Monitoring (andSection; 280.43(e)). </T3>The proposed ruleallowed the use of vapor monitoring in the excavation zone as a methodof release detection as long as certain conditions and limitations weremet that maximize performance. The information available to the Agencyat the time of proposal indicated that vapor monitoring was, under optimumconditions, a sensitive and reliable release detection method. Researchconducted by the Agency since the proposal, as well as information submittedby commenters, has confirmed that vapor monitoring is capable of detectingextremely small leaks (0.003 gallon per hour) under certain conditions.Some of the proposed conditions concerning the use of this method, however,now appear unnecessary. In summary, the final rule includes vapor monitoring,omits the 500-ppm background restriction, and allows monitoring for selectivecomponents of the stored regulated substance, including tracers mixed inthe substance. <T3>(a) Effectiveness of Method. </T3>Some commenters expressed concernthat vapor monitoring was not developed enough to be relied upon as a solemethod of release detection. The Agency solicited comments and additionaldata on the effectiveness of vapor monitoring in the proposal preamble(52 FR 12728). EPA included it as a method of release detection in theproposal because existing data indicated that it should be an extremelysensitive monitoring tool and it has already been used successfully insome state and local UST programs. The Agency has received no researchresults or data from commenters that would cause it to alter its earlierconclusions. In fact, several commenters submitted detailed field and experimentaldata verifying the effectiveness of vapor monitoring. A theoretical computermodeling study done by EPA confirms these results (Notice of Availability;53 FR 10403). Although there are still not enough data to specify a morecomplete performance standard for this method (in terms of probabilityof detection, false alarm, and leak rate), the Agency believes this methodwill provide effective release detection, and has retained it as an optionin the final rule, as long as it meets the limitations discussed below.In response to concerns raised by some commenters, the Agency wishes tonote that in the final rule, a vapor monitoring well does not necessarilymean a typical ground-water well. Instead, a vapor monitoring well meansany sampling point from which vapors are collected and brought to the monitorby any means. <T3>(b) Background Concentration. </T3>In the proposed rule, EPA limitedthe use of vapor monitoring to those areas with less than 500-ppm backgroundconcentration of total organic hydrocarbons in the soil gas of the excavationzone. Many commenters felt that the 500-ppm restriction was too stringent,stating that natural background concentrations of methane, for example,are higher than 500-ppm in some areas of the country. Other commenterswanted a restriction based on site-by-site evaluations. The 500-ppm backgroundlevel was originally set as an attempt to recognize that background effectscan interfere with effective vapor monitoring (52 FR 12729-12731). Commentersdescribed research and field experience, however, that indicate vapor monitoringshould work well at several thousand ppm levels in the soil gas if a volatilesubstance (such as gasoline) is being stored in the tank. In addition,EPA research has shown that at many sites having no recorded release fromthe UST system, the total background concentration exceeds the 500-ppmlevel. This type of background level is probably due to an accumulationof spills and overfills. To avoid precluding the use of vapor monitoring at many sites where itis potentially applicable, no specific numerical restrictions on backgroundlevels is included in today's final rule. Instead, there is now a moregeneral performance requirement that the background concentration mustnot interfere with the ability of the method used to detect releases. Forexample, at a site with too high a background level (e.g., over 10,000ppm for gasoline), leaks may not produce a detectable concentration increaseover background. Determining if the background levels are too high dependson the resolution of the sensor, the volatility of the product being monitored,and other site conditions. <T3>(c) Measurable Component. </T3>Several commenters expressed concernthat the proposal did not allow monitoring for specific components of thestored substance and, instead, appeared to be focusing only on total organichydrocarbons as the detection criterion. EPA's research indicates thatmonitoring for specific components or tracer compounds may be very advantageousunder certain site conditions because it eliminates some of the difficultieswith background interference levels and false alarms. For example, sensorsthat detect only the lightest components of gasoline (e.g., butanes andpentanes) may suffer fewer problems with high background levels becausethese constituents vaporize so rapidly that the potentially confoundingeffects of past spills at the site are minimized. Monitoring for these components might also allow spills to be more easilydistinguished from equipment leaks, because the level of the light chemicalcomponents would return to background levels more quickly if it was suddenlyelevated due to an episodic event like a spill. Similarly, if a carefullyselected tracer compound that is not already present at the site is placedin the tank, background interference problems can be eliminated. Some ofthe advantages of tracer methods were also discussed in the proposal preamble(52 FR 12730). For the above reasons, EPA believes that effective vapor monitoring systemscan be designed to monitor for specific components, tracer compounds, ortotal organic hydrocarbons. Consequently, the Agency explicitly allowsthese additional methods in andSection; 280.43(e) of the final rule. <T3>(d) Sensitivity of the Vapor Monitor. </T3>The proposed rule statedthat the threshold of the vapor monitor must be preset specifically forthe type of regulated substance stored in the UST. This requirement wasincluded in an attempt to increase the sensitivity of the monitor to detectreleases in areas with background hydrocarbon levels. Since proposal, however,changes have been made to the vapor monitoring requirements based on publiccomment and new EPA analysis that make this requirement unnecessary oreven undesirable. Tracer compounds may now be used for vapor monitoring,so specificity of the monitor to the regulated substance is undesirable.The EPA-sponsored computer modeling that was conducted on vapor monitoringperformance indicated that, in some circumstances, a monitor would be moreeffective if it monitored for a single component of the stored substancethan the complete stored substance because it would be able to differentiatemore distinctly between a leak of that component and existing backgroundhydrocarbon levels. Again, specificity of the monitor to the complete regulatedsubstance would be undesirable. The final rule now simply requires thatthe monitor be capable of detecting a significant increase above backgroundof the regulated substance, a component or components of the substance,or a tracer compound. This change will allow the use of existing sensitivemonitors such as those measuring BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) or ``totalhydrocarbons'' because they can detect components of many regulated substances.<T3>(6) Ground-Water Monitoring (andSection; 280.43(f)). </T3>The proposedrule allowed the use of monitoring for free product on top of the ground-watertable to determine the presence of a release from an UST system. Many commentersagreed with this approach to release detection but wanted EPA to ease someof the limitations placed on the use of the method. The final rule stillallows monitoring on top of the water table for free product but with severalchanges: Well placement is no longer limited to the excavation zone; thewell screen must be designed to prevent clogging and intercept the watertable at both high and low ground-water conditions; and the well must besealed from the ground to the top of the filter pack. <T3>(a) Effectiveness. </T3>In the proposal the Agency recognized thatthere are several concerns about the use of ground-water monitoring, primarilythe fact that the resource being protected (i.e., ground water) is themedium in which the release is detected. The Agency included this releasedetection method in the proposed rule, however, because this method hasbeen demonstrated to successfully detect small petroleum releases and itis currently in widespread use in several state UST programs, such as thatin Florida. EPA proposed limiting ground-water monitoring only to floatingfree product because its presence can be detected more quickly and reliablyfollowing a release than can dissolved product. The proposed rule alsocontained several limitations on well design, well placement, and equipmentperformance that together were intended to limit the use of this methodto those conditions under which rapid detection could be ensured. Most commenters supported ground-water monitoring as a release detectionmethod in common use that has successfully detected leaks. One commenterexpressed reservations about the method, saying that released product canmigrate away from monitoring wells around an UST system and claimed someproblems with Florida's program. EPA continues to acknowledge that themethod is not completely risk-free and also believes that it provides alevel of protection equivalent to the other allowed release detection methods.In addition, not allowing ground-water monitoring in the rule would forcestates like Florida that depend primarily on ground-water monitoring tocompletely revamp their programs, thus disrupting established and effectiveprograms, delaying implementation, and unnecessarily increasing expendituresbecause of the replacement of all the existing wells with other equipment.Therefore, in consideration of the limitations discussed below, EPA hasretained ground-water monitoring as an option in the final rule. <T3>(b) Limitations. </T3>The limits on well placement in the proposalrestricted this method to areas with the water table 20 feet or less belowthe surface and with soils having a hydraulic conductivity of at least0.01 cm/sec. Also, the wells had to be placed within the excavation zone.These restrictions were intended to ensure rapid detection by minimizingthe distance that a release must move between the UST and the monitoringpoint and minimizing the time taken to move that distance. Ground-watermonitoring was also limited to use with products that are immiscible inwater and lighter than water so the product can be detected by the monitors.andbullet; <T3>Depth to Ground Water. </T3>Many commenters believed that the proposed 20-foot maximum depth-to-ground-waterrestriction was too stringent and requested that this maximum value beincreased or even deleted entirely from the final rule. Others agreed withthe proposed rule. The Agency still believes, however, that increasingthe allowable maximum depth would increase the volume of the release thatcould occur before detection. Detection of releases is also slower andless certain with deeper wells because subsurface geology can inadvertantlydirect product away from the monitoring wells, even if they are locatedclose to the UST system. EPA research conducted since the proposal suggeststhat 20 feet is the maximum depth to ground water that will permit detectionin 30 days when the hydraulic conductivity is 0.01 cm/sec (Notice of Availability;53 FR 10403). Also, once a release is detected by a deeper well, correctiveaction will be more difficult and costly because more product has beenreleased. Therefore, EPA has retained in the final rule the 20-foot depth-to-ground-waterrestriction when ground-water monitoring is used as the sole release detectionmethod. If this method is used as a supplemental device to another approvedform of leak detection or as a release investigation method, EPA encouragesthe use of these wells at greater depths or in less permeable soils.andbullet; <T3>Placement of Monitoring Wells.</T3> Commenters also objected to the proposed requirement that the monitoringwells intercept the excavation zone. One commenter noted that this requirementcould result in existing tanks being punctured during drilling of the well.Another commenter said such a requirement violates some existing statelaws intended to prevent contamination. The Agency shares this concernas one expressed by numerous regulators in the field. Apparently, not allowners and operators of existing USTs know the orientation and dimensionsof their UST system, not all well drillers have the equipment to find theexact location of their UST, and errors in well installation can occureven when the placement of the UST is known. Although a slight increase in the allowable distance between the UST andthe well may result in slightly larger releases before detection, EPA decidedthat this was preferable to the catastrophic release that would occur ifa tank were punctured. Today's final rule has been revised to require thatthe monitoring wells or devices be placed within the excavation zone oras close to the excavation zone as is technically feasible. This changealso applies to new tanks although placing the wells in the excavationzone should rarely be technically infeasible. The soil hydraulic conductivity limitation is retained in the final ruleand will have to be met whether the well is placed outside or inside theexcavation zone. Thus, the revision on well placement is not a major changebecause wells are allowed outside the excavation zone only when the wellis in close proximity to the UST system, the soil is very porous, and releasedproduct can move quickly to the well. If the soil outside the excavationzone cannot meet the conductivity requirement, the well must be placedinside the zone. andbullet; <T3>Immiscible in Water.</T3> The proposed rule required that the regulated substance be immiscible inwater and have a specific gravity less than one in order to use ground-watermonitoring. These requirements were needed to ensure that released productwould float on top of the water table, where it could be detected by themonitors. The Agency has retained these requirements in the final rulebut notes that ground-water monitoring is intended for use with gasolineand other substances that are, in fact, slightly soluble in water. Thus,the immiscibility requirement does not exclude substances which are infact slightly soluble. The slight solubility will not interfere with rapiddetection because most of the product is still floating on top of the watertable where the monitor can sense it. For example, gasoline has been successfullydetected by ground-water monitoring in state programs such as Florida's.<T3>(c) Design Specifications. </T3>In the proposed rule, EPA did not includeany design specifications for the monitoring wells and networks becausesite conditions vary widely throughout the U.S., and the Agency wantedto allow the implementing agencies and owners and operators as much flexibilityas possible in designing the wells and monitoring network to fit the site.Commenters suggested that the rule should contain more specific requirementsand restrictions. EPA continues to believe that tailoring the wells andthe network to the specific conditions will result in better release detection,so few specific requirements can (or should) be included at the nationallevel. In addition, most states, such as Florida, that are relying on ground-watermonitoring as the preferred release detection method have already includeddetailed design specifications in their UST programs. However, upon further review of the proposed limitations and capabilitieson ground-water monitoring and the experience using this method in Florida,and other areas, the Agency did decide that three well-design criteriashould be added to the final rule to prevent common problems. First, ifthe top of the water table is above or below the screened interval of thewell, then the free product floating on top of the water table will notbe able to enter the well and be detected by the monitor. For this reason,today's final rule requires that the monitoring well screen must allowentry of regulated substance into the well under both high and low ground-waterconditions. Second, the final rule requires that screening be designedto prevent migration of soil or filter pack into the well, which wouldclog the screen and prevent product from entering and being detected. Thethird criterion added to the final rule is the requirement that the wellsbe sealed from the surface to the top of the filter pack, which will preventpossible contamination by hydrocarbons washed from the surface by rainwater that might cause a false alarm or mask a future release. <T3>(d) Sensitivity of Monitor. </T3>The last limitation included in theproposed rule to ensure rapid detection using ground-water monitoring wasa performance standard requiring that the monitoring equipment be capableof detecting the presence of at least one-eighth of an inch of free producton top of the ground water. This value was selected because it is the maximumperformance that manufacturers continue to claim can be achieved by existingautomated monitoring equipment. This requirement was intended to applyboth to automated and manual monitoring techniques. Some commenters wantedto make the standard more stringent by reducing the criterion of one-eighthof an inch of free product in the well to one-sixteenth of an inch or byreplacing it with nonquantitative terms such as detection by ``sheen''or by human sight or smell. The commenters felt that the Agency did notgive enough justification for selecting the \1/8\-inch value and that itis essentially defining the volume of an acceptable release. The Agency reiterates that the \1/8\-inch requirement was selected as theperformance standard because it is the sensitivity of existing automatedequipment, not because it is an acceptable release. A preliminary EPA analysisindicates that several commercial devices can detect \1/8\ inch of producton top of a water table (Notice of Availability; 53 FR 10403). To set aperformance standard that is more stringent than can be met by existingtechnology would eliminate use of this method, which has proven effectivein several local UST programs. The Agency considered allowing only manualmethods of collecting and analyzing ground-water samples, which may bemore sensitive than automated monitors; however, manual methods are verysubjective and can only be conducted intermittently, whereas automatedmethods can be continuous and are less subjective. Therefore, today's finalrule retains the \1/8\-inch performance standard, and both manual and automatedmonitoring are acceptable. <T3>(7) Interstitial Monitoring (andSection; 280.43(g)). </T3>Interceptionbarriers and interstitial monitoring were two methods of release detectionallowed in the proposed rule. Because they are two distinct methods usedto detect releases, they were treated separately. These methods and therequirements that were proposed for them were discussed in detail in thepreamble to the proposed rule (52 FR 12735-12739). Commenters were in favorof allowing these methods but suggested changes to some of the requirements.In response to comments on several technical issues raised in the proposalconcerning both methods, EPA has changed some of the technical requirements.Based on these comments, the final rule has consolidated the requirementsfor both methods into one section, eliminated the use of soil/clay liners,and added a requirement to prevent interference with effective cathodicprotection. Section 280.41 of the proposed rule allowed monitoring between an UST andtwo types of impermeable barriers as two separate release detection methods.The first method, proposed in andSection; 280.41(f), allowed monitoring forliquids in the unsaturated zone between an UST and an interception barrierimmediately below it. Interception barriers are basically partial excavationzone liners: they are located immediately below the UST and come only partof the way up the sides of the excavation pit. The second method, proposedin andSection; 280.41(h), allowed interstitial monitoring between an USTand a secondary barrier that surrounds the entire UST system. These barriersare not the partial, catch basin-type of barriers allowed under the firstmethod. These barriers are either integral to the tank system design itself(e.g., double-walled tanks or pipes) or they are located within the USTexcavation area along the bottom and sides of the pit and present a barrierbetween all parts of the UST system and the environment (e.g., flexiblemembrane pit liners). Using either of the above barrier-type methods, the interstitial spacebetween the tanks and the barrier can be monitored by a variety of devicesdesigned to detect a variety of changes in operating conditions (e.g.,pressure changes with double-walled tanks or presence of liquid or gaseousproduct in the interstitial space between the barrier and the UST system).Because improper design can make these systems ineffective, the proposedrule included a number of design criteria to ensure effectiveness as arelease detection method. <T3>(a) Consolidation of Sections. </T3>The proposed rule included a setof general performance standards and design limitations for each methodto ensure effective detection of released product. The requirements forthe two methods were essentially the same. Despite their similarity, theywere included separately in the proposed rule to make it clear that theyare two distinct proposed methods and that both are acceptable means ofdetecting releases. These two methods were not intended to prevent releases,but were intended to contain releases long enough to direct the regulatedsubstance to a monitor for detection; EPA intended that release preventionbe covered in the UST design and installation sections of the rule (52FR 12735-12739).Today's final rule has been reorganized so that the performance requirementsfor both of these methods are discussed in a single section (andSection;280.43(g)). The Agency has decided to eliminate the separate and duplicativesections in the proposed rule on interception barriers and interstitialmonitoring because this appeared to be a source of confusion to some commenters.This is only an organizational change, not a deletion of a possible releasedetection method, and does not change the substantive intent of the proposal.The consolidated design and performance limitations for both methods remainas proposed with the exception of the changes noted below. <T3>(b) Performance Standard. </T3>The proposed rule required that theinterstitial monitor between an UST and a secondary barrier be capableof detecting any release from the UST into the interstitial area. One commenterobjected to this wording because it requires that the interstitial monitorwould be capable of detecting <T3>any </T3>release, no matter how small. The Agency disagrees with thecommenter and believes that interstitial monitors should be capable ofdetecting a release into the interstitial area. The available data on monitorperformance indicates that they are very sensitive and will, in fact, beable to detect the type and size of release that is likely to occur froma secondarily contained UST system. Ideally, EPA agrees with the commenterthat a performance standard should be included in the rule to define thesensitivity of interstitial monitors. The data are insufficient, however,to determine a performance standard. Secondary containment with interstitialmonitoring is a very sensitive release detection method and is believedto provide maximum protection of human health and the environment, andthe Agency did not want to eliminate it from the rule for lack of a specificperformance standard. Therefore, the final rule continues to require thatinterstitial monitors be capable of detecting a leak from any portion ofthe tank that routinely contains product. <T3>(c) Soil/Clay Liners. </T3>The Agency solicited comments on the performanceof barriers for purposes of UST release detection (52 FR 12736, 12739).The subject the Agency received the most comment on was the question ofthe use of soil/clay liners. Some commenters approved of the use of soil/clayliners but suggested that these liners needed more stringent limitations.Other commenters recommended that these liners not be allowed in the finalrule because they are not impermeable to all gasoline constituents. Recentlycompleted studies by EPA's Office of Solid Waste on the effectiveness ofsoil/clay liners compared to synthetic liners (Notice of Availability,53 FR 10403), as well as information submitted by commenters on the proposal,have caused the Agency to delete this proposed technical option from today'sfinal rule. This means that barriers constructed from native soils or artificiallytreated soils (for example, bentonite-sealed soils) are excluded from useunder the revised performance requirements for barriers. In general, soil/claybarriers are not being allowed because there is enough evidence about theinadequate performance of these materials as reliable barriers to questiontheir reliability for release detection purposes. <T3>(d) Interference with Cathodic Protection. </T3>Several other commentersnoted that barriers that completely line the excavation might interferewith the cathodic protection system. For example, flexible membrane barriersare usually non-conductive and could electrically isolate the anodes fromthe tank system, preventing the flow of protective current. The Agencyagrees that this could be a problem although no failures of this type havebeen reported. A general requirement has, therefore, been added to therule, stipulating that barriers must not interfere with cathodic protection(andSection; 280.43(g)). EPA believes this can be met in most cases simplyby ensuring that the components of the protection system are placed insidethe barrier system. <T3>(e) Compatibility of Liner with Product. </T3>The proposed rule containeda requirement that the secondary barrier be compatible with the regulatedsubstance to prevent the product from eroding the integrity of the linerover time, causing holes and possible releases to the environment (52 FR12735, 12736, 12739). The Agency agrees with commenters who noted thata small amount of liner deterioration is inevitable. Accordingly, the wordingof the proposed compatibility performance requirement in andSection; 280.43(g)has been changed to indicate that some deterioration is permissible aslong as it does not prevent the detection of a release. This requirementwas revised to ensure that a basic level of compatibility is achieved andto make the owners and operators responsible for ensuring barrier materials(e.g., flexible membrane liners) are compatible with the product stored(see also andSection; 280.32). <T3>(8) Other Methods of Release Detection (andSection; 280.43(h)). </T3>Asdiscussed in the preamble to the proposal (52 FR 12739-12740), EPA hasidentified over 250 commercially available release detection devices. TheAgency continues to believe that methods of detection other than the sevengeneral methods listed in the rule may also be able to successfully detectreleases under certain circumstances. Thus, the proposed rule allowed theuse of other methods of release detection if they were approved by theimplementing agency as no less stringent than one of the other methodslisted in the rule. Commenters generally preferred that any mechanism forapproval of a new method be at the federal level (discussed in more detailbelow). The final rule, however, retains the approval mechanism as proposedbut provides an additional mechanism for allowance of other methods. Anew method may be used if it can detect a release of 0.2 gallon per houror 150 gallons within a month with a PD of 95 percent and a PFA of 5 percent.The Agency felt that adding the second alternative mechanism, one whichis self-implementing, will provide consistency among methods, offer additionalflexibility for owners and operators to choose new or improved technologiesof equivalent protection to those specifically allowed in the rule, andspur innovation. <T3>(a) Other Methods Approved by Implementing Agencies. </T3>The specificmethods EPA proposed have demonstrated effectiveness in the field and arealready in extensive use. An important purpose for including these methodswas to make it clear that their use was allowed for meeting the proposedrelease detection requirements and under what conditions they could beused. The Agency intends to continue to develop and provide informationhelpful to the implementing agencies in evaluating new methods. EPA willalso continue to foster identification and development of new methods.Although the Agency wants to allow new methods, it was also concerned that,to protect human health and the environment, they be limited to the methodsthat are at least as stringent as the methods proposed. Therefore, theproposed rule included a mechanism to allow the use of a new release detectionmethod if the owner or operator could demonstrate to the implementing agencythat the method could detect releases before they migrated beyond the excavationzone as effectively as one of the methods already in the rule. Generally, commenters agreed with the need for allowing new methods butmost felt it should be a federal approval process conducted by EPA, notby the implementing agency as proposed. The commenters were opposed todelegating approval authority to the implementing agencies because thelengthy and repeated (for each state or local agency) approvals would discouragemethod development and because state and local officials do not have theknowledge to make these evaluations. All of the commenters felt that theapproval mechanism would be more efficient at the federal level, whereapproval could be granted one time, rather than 50 times, by means of anapproved list or a revised regulation. As stated in the proposal, the Agency wants to foster innovation and developmentof new release detection methods and to allow them to be implemented quickly(52 FR 12739). Therefore, the Agency is concerned that the developmentand publication of a federal list of approved methods or a revised regulation,as suggested by some commenters, would take too long. The Agency coulddecide, at some future time, to revise the final regulation to add newgeneral methods. The Agency is convinced, however, that allowing approvalby the implementing agency, including those at the state and local level,will enable a new method to be used more quickly because the implementingagencies would not have to wait for a Federal approval before a methodcould be implemented. In addition, the precedent set when a new methodpasses an evaluation in one implementing agency should facilitate succeedingreviews by other agencies. Implementing agencies are developing UST programs quickly, and the Agency'sprimary concern is to meet their needs as rapidly as possible. The Agency'sresearch on release detection methods will provide important informationto state and local agencies for use in their decisions on which releasedetection methods to allow. The Agency will continue to encourage privatesector evaluation of new release detection methods and the exchange ofthis information with the implementing agencies. In addition, as discussedbelow, the Agency is providing another, self-implementing alternative foruse of methods not explicitly included in the rule. In addition to the reasons given above, a Federal approval listing processor a revised regulation would not ease some of the problems that commentersforesee with delegating approval to the implementing agencies. EPA's inclusionof methods in the final rule, or its subsequent endorsement of a new method,does not automatically make the method acceptable in a state because statesor local governments may, under their own authority, impose release detectionrequirements more stringent than EPA's. Each state can review each methodand decide whether or not to allow it. In fact, a number of state and localagencies are already implementing their own UST programs, and some of theseprograms have more restricted lists of approved methods than the federalrule. Thus, the final rule retains the proposed option of approval of othermethods by implementing agencies.The standard for implementing agency approval has been changed in the finalrule to make it consistent with other changes in the rule. The revisedground-water monitoring standard no longer requires that the monitoringwells pass through the excavation zone. As discussed in section IV.D.2.d.6.above, the Agency did not believe that this requirement was necessary toprotect human health and the environment. The revised method can no longerdetect a release before it migrates beyond the excavation zone, makingthe standard for implementing agency approval meaningless. To retain theconsistency between this section and the method requirements, the standardfor comparing new and existing methods in the final rule has been revised.The standard now specifies that methods approved by the implementing agencymust be as effective as one of the other methods allowed in the rule. Methodsare considered to be equivalently protective if they can detect a smallrelease as quickly and reliably as other methods included in the rule.This change is consistent with changes in andSection; 280.42(b)(5)(i) (seesection IV.D.2.c.2. of the preamble). <T3>(b) Other Methods That Meet a Performance Standard. </T3>The Agencyincluded in the final rule a second mechanism by which a new release detectionmethod can become approved. A new method may be used to meet the releasedetection requirements if it can be demonstrated to detect a leak rateof 0.2 gallon per hour or 150 gallons within a month with a PD of 95 percentand a PFA of 5 percent. This performance standard for alternative releasedetection methods contains two equivalent leak rates, and the owner oroperator may demonstrate compliance with either format. Although externalmonitoring methods are capable of detecting very small releases, it ismore difficult to demonstrate that they meet a small hourly release ratethan a larger, though equivalent, volume. The Agency was concerned that,if only the 0.2 gallon per hour release rate was included in this performancestandard, manufacturers of new and effective external monitoring equipmentor experimental methods would be discouraged from developing the methodsor would be unable to demonstrate compliance to the statisfaction of theimplementing agency. As discussed previously, EPA wishes to encourage developmentof new release detection methods. Unlike the performance standards for the specific allowable release detectionmethods, the PD and PFA values for the performance standard for new alternativemethods are effective immediately. As discussed above in section IV.D.2.a.5.,compliance with the probabilities applicable to all methods is delayedfor two years. This delay was included in the final rule to allow manufacturerstime to modify existing methods, which are already in wide use, and developthe required documentation of performance while still providing the immediaterelease detection needs required in the rule. These allowable methods wereidentified in the rule because they are widely used and expected to workwell, often without significant improvements. New alternative methods,however, should be developed from the beginning to meet the most stringentperformance requirements. In addition, the Agency was concerned that onlyrequiring a leak detection capability of 0.2 gallon per hour could be interpretedto allow imprecise methods such as inventory control to be used alone forthe first 2 years of the program. Methods such as ATGS can already operatealmost to the required probabilities of detection and false alarm, whereasinventory control cannot come close to these levels, and to allow its usealone even for 2 years would be harmful to human health and the environment.The evidence gathered by EPA from laboratory evaluations and field experienceindicates that the methods specifically proposed (except inventory control)should be able to meet this performance standard now or in the near future(see discussions above for each method). As new methods use this mechanismto become approved, this will ensure consistency of performance among newmethods. The net effect of including this alternative in the final ruleis to move closer to the general performance standard for all methods considereddesirable by many commenters (see discussion in section IV.D.2.a.4. above).The addition of this alternative will have the effect desired by commentersand EPA of spurring innovation and development of new technology for releasedetection because there is now a specific and measurable goal for manufacturersto work towards. In particular, this approach will provide flexibilityto develop new release detection methods for unusual UST systems such asbulk tanks, for which current methods are inappropriate or expensive. Thisapproval mechanism will have the additional advantage of allowing a newmethod proven to meet the standard to be used without any approvals instates which allow this approval mechanism. This approach also clarifies what minimium equivalent performance mustbe demonstrated to the implementing agency under the other approval procedurefor new methods (see preceding section). EPA did not, however, want tomake this performance standard the only means by which a new method couldbecome approved because it may not be possible to easily determine a leakrate for some methods within the next few years, particularly externalones. Such methods can still be very effective at detecting releases andthe Agency wants to encourage the development of sensitive methods. Ifmethod developers can demonstrate to the implementing agencies the sensitivityof their methods in ways other than leak rates, then they should be ableto do so. For these reasons, the performance standard approach to approvingnew methods is included in the final rule in addition to, not in placeof, the proposed mechanism requiring review by the implementing agency.e. <T3>Methods of Release Detection for Piping (andSection; 280.44).</T3> Thegeneral release detection requirements for pressure and suction lines arediscussed in section IV.D.2.b.2. of this preamble. This section discussesthe performance standards for those required release detection methods.One commenter noted that piping and tank release detection methods shouldbe separated because not all tank methods apply to piping and vice versa.A separate section addressing piping release detection methods has beenadded to the final rule to address these concerns. Separating the methodsfor tanks and piping allows owners and operators greater flexibility indesigning a system. For example, at a station with extensive piping, installingflow restrictors and conducting an annual tightness test for the pipingand using vapor monitoring for the tanks may better protect the environmentand cost less than installing vapor monitoring for both the tanks and piping.The proposed rule required either continuous monitoring devices or automaticshutoff devices on all pressurized lines as well as a line tightness testin conjunction with scheduled tank tightness tests. The proposed rule establisheda leak rate for the automatic shutoff device and indirectly required linetests to meet the tank test standard (0.1 gallon per hour with a PD of99 percent and a PFA of 1 percent) but set no other performance standards.The Agency requested comment regarding the field performance of pressurizedpiping release detection methods (52 FR 12744). Commenters noted that additionalperformance parameters should be provided in the rule, such as detectionlimits and line operating characteristics. The Agency agrees and has accordinglyadded further specifications to the piping release detection methods allowedin the final rule to ensure that they meet these minimum performance standards.Thus, probabilities of detection and false alarm have been added for theautomatic line leak detectors and line tightness tests; and (for reasonsexplained earlier) the effective date of these probabilities is delayedfor 2 years. Because leak rates depend on the pressure in the line, theAgency agreed with commenters suggesting that the minimum performance standardsfor line leak detectors, which operate by detecting changes in line pressure,should be specified in terms of the line operating pressure. Each of thepiping release detection methods is discussed below. <T3>(1) Automatic Line Leak Detector (andSection; 280.44(a)).</T3> The proposedrule required that the automatic shutoff device be capable of detectingand shutting off a release of at least 2 gallons per hour. This value wasselected based on manufacturers' claims. Most commenters felt that theperformance standard suggested in the supplemental notice (52 FR 48638)of 0.1 gallon per hour with a PD of 99 percent and a PFA of 1 percent wastoo stringent, and that 2 gallons per hour was below the detection levelof flow restrictors. The performance standard in the final rule for automatic piping releasedetection methods (including flow restrictors, shutoff devices, and interstitialor external monitors) has been set at 3 gallons per hour at 10 psi witha PD of 95 percent and a PFA of 5 percent. The 3 gallons per hour valueand the probabilities were selected based on a study conducted by EPA'sOffice of Research and Development of the behavior of pressurized lines,an evaluation performed and submitted by a commenter, and manufacturers'written claims. The value of 10 psi was also selected because it is thepressure at which a typical line leak detector operates. A manufacturercan test a device at any convenient operating pressure and mathematicallyconvert the results to 10 psi to determine if the device meets the performancestandard. As discussed elsewhere in today's preamble (section IV.D.2.a.5.),the effective date of the PD and PFA is delayed for 2 years following promulgation.The final rule also requires that an automatic line leak detector be capableof checking for releases hourly and either restrict or shut off flow ofproduct or be equipped with an audible or visual alarm. The Agency intendsthe term automatic line leak detector to include a wide variety of devicesthat meet the standard including automatic shutoff devices, automatic flowrestrictors, continuous interstitial monitors, continuous vapor monitors,or continuous ground-water monitors. The hourly detection frequency wasselected because pressurized lines can release large volumes of productquickly, so very frequent monitoring is necessary during operation to protecthuman health and the environment. The equipment currently on the marketeither operates continuously or conducts a test each time the pump is turnedon to dispense product, provided several minutes have elapsed since theprevious dispensing, so meeting this requirement should not be difficult.The Agency believes the operators must be alerted immediately to the presenceof leaks in pressurized lines. To do this, a clear indication such as flowrestriction or shutoff or an alarm is considered necessary. The final rule also contains the requirement that all automatic line leakdetectors be checked annually according to manufacturer's requirements.This requirement was added in response to commenters' concern that lineleak detectors can malfunction or be overridden by unwise operators. Thepossible burden of an annual maintenance check is outweighed by the importanceof detecting and stopping pressurized releases. <T3>(2) Line Tightness Test (andSection; 280.44(b)).</T3> The line tightnesstest that is required in the final rule annually for pressurized pipingand every 3 years for American-style suction systems is part of the tightnesstest option that was proposed for the entire UST system. Work conductedat EPA's test laboratory in Edison, NJ, has demonstrated that line tightnesstest methods should be able to meet a performance standard of 0.1 gallonper hour with a PD of 95 percent and a PFA of 5 percent with, perhaps,some minor modifications in procedure and equipment (see section IV.D.2.b.2.).Therefore, this performance standard has been adopted in the final rule.As discussed above and in section IV.D.2.a.5., application of the performancestandard for line tightness testing has been delayed for 2 years. As discussed above, the performance standards for line release detectionmust be stated in terms of the line operating pressure. The value of 1.5times the operating pressure was selected for the line tightness test becausemost operators are currently performing tightness tests at this pressure,it is the procedure recommended by NFPA 329 for hydrostatic testing, andit covers the range of line operating pressures, including suction lines.It should be noted that, for safety reasons, all line tightness tests shouldbe performed at positive pressure, not a vacuum, even for suction lines.For example, most suction lines operate at 3 to 5 psi negative pressure;therefore, tightness tests should be conducted at about 7 psi positivepressure. <T3>(3) Applicable Tank Methods (andSection; 280.44(c)).</T3> In the proposedrule, six categories of tank release detection were allowed to meet themonitoring requirement for the ``UST system,'' which included the associatedunderground piping. As discussed in section IV.D.1.a. above, the finalrule now separates the release detection methods for tanks and piping becausenot all tank release detection methods can be used for piping and viceversa. As noted by commenters, some of the tank monitoring methods arein fact applicable to piping, such as vapor monitoring, groundwater monitoring,and interstitial monitoring, and the Agency wanted to include their useas an option for piping release detection. Therefore, the final rule allowsmonthly monitoring with one of the applicable tank monitoring methods ifit is capable of detecting a release from the portion of the undergroundpiping routinely containing product and meets the restrictions applicableto the use of those methods. This is one of the options for the monthlyrelease detection requirement, in addition to the automatic line leak detectorrequirement. f. <T3>Recordkeeping (andSection; 280.45).</T3> The proposed rule required thatall UST system owners and operators maintain records on the release detectionsystems required in the rule. The requirement to keep records of performanceclaims, test results, and equipment maintenance was included because ofthe importance of each of these activities in the successful detectionof releases and in demonstrating compliance to the implementing agency.Commenters generally felt that the requirements were too burdensome andwould be particularly difficult to achieve if the testing was done by aservice company. The main areas of concern were the requirement to keepperformance claims and the components of an adequate performance claim.Today's final rule retains the recordkeeping requirements as proposed withtwo revisions. First, only release detection equipment permanently locatedon-site must have written documentation of calibration, maintenance, andrepair on file. Second, manufacturers' schedules of calibration and maintenancefor release detection equipment must be retained for 5 years from the dateof installation. The Agency required in the proposed rule that all UST system owners andoperators maintain three types of records demonstrating compliance withthe applicable release detection requirements: documentation of methodperformance monitoring results; and general operation, maintenance, andrepair. It was felt that these records demonstrate that certain past eventsimportant to effective release detection using that method actually tookplace and could be used by implementing agencies to determine compliance(52 FR 12747). In general, commenters felt that the proposed recordkeepingrequirements as a whole were too burdensome. The Agency believes, however,that the requirements are not particularly burdensome because many of therecords will be supplied by manufacturers, sales personnel, or servicepeople; not much paperwork is involved and the required records would generallybe kept on file anyway; and paperwork will be added infrequently. In general,some records are needed to remind the owners and operators when maintenanceis scheduled and to help them keep the equipment under warranty. Finally,properly maintained records are necessary to allow later analysis of thetank systems by either the owners and operators or the implementing agencyin the event of a release investigation or system closure. Each of theindividual requirements receiving comment or revised in the final ruleis discussed below. The requirement to maintain manufacturers' performance claims and justificationsfor 5 years was intended to encourage manufacturers to evaluate their equipmentand develop documentation of the proof of performance and to cause ownersand operators to review this information while selecting an appropriaterelease detection method. Many commenters expressed confusion over whatthese performance claims would be and were concerned that the owners andoperators were being required to substantiate the claims. It was not theintent of the proposed or final rule to require the owners and operatorsto provide the proof of performance claims, only for them to ask for andacquire information from the manufacturer. In order to compete and successfullymarket equipment, the manufacturer will have to develop convincing documentationdemonstrating that the release detection method meets the minimum performancerequirements. As discussed in the proposal preamble (52 FR 12719), there are severaltypes of information that the manufacturer should include in this documentationand that the owners and operators should look for. The final rule doesnot require any specific information, however. EPA recognizes that thelevel of detail will vary by type of method and that, over time, manufacturerswill develop standardized claims that will help guide the owners and operators.This requirement will place owners and operators in the position of havingto review the claims and select a system that will meet regulatory requirements.Thus, owners and operators are responsible for achieving the goal of effectiverelease detection and demonstrating to the implementing agency that theowners and operators have made an effort to comply with the regulation.For these reasons, this section of the final rule will remain unchangedfrom the proposal.The proposed rule required that all records of calibration, maintenance,and repair be maintained by all owners and operators for at least one year.These are important procedures for the proper functioning of release detectionequipment, particularly automated systems, and must be available for inspectionto demonstrate that the system is working as well as it can. One commenternoted that the recordkeeping requirements would be difficult to meet forowners and operators who hire release detection services to do the monitoring.EPA agrees with this, and today's final rule states that this requirementapplies only to owners and operators of equipment permanently located on-site.Owners and operators who hire release detection services need not retainthe servicing records of their contractors. Owners and operators, however,must ensure that the service is performed well and according to specificationsand will be responsible for the cleanup of any undetected releases. Another addition to today's final rule that was not in the proposed ruleis the requirement that any schedule of required calibration and maintenanceprovided by the release detection equipment manufacturer must be retainedfor 5 years from the date of installation. This information should be providedby most manufacturers in the same brochures as performance claims; thus,this new requirement should not result in much additional paperwork. Thisrequirement was added as a clarification to the final rule to remind ownersand operators of the importance of maintaining these data. With this requirement,implementing agencies can verify that required maintenance and calibrationwere performed. Also, if ownership of a site is transferred, the new owneror operator will be able to understand and ensure that the proper scheduleis maintained. g. <T3>Other Release Detection Issues._ (1) Release Detection Variances forLow-Risk Sites.</T3> In the Supplemental Notice (52 FR 48641), EPA notedthat protected tanks in some areas of the country may not require frequent-to-continuousrelease detection. EPA requested comments on whether, within these lesssensitive areas, variances should be allowed for protected tanks to conductinternal inspections or less frequent monitoring. EPA requested commenton the appropriateness of these alternative release detection approachesand under what conditions they might be used. There was little agreementamong commenters on either issue, and no specific recommendations on howlow-risk areas could be defined or identified at the federal level. Thefinal rule does not include a release detection variance for low-risk areasbecause of the difficulty in operationally defining and implementing avariance procedure which adequately protects human health and the environment.Commenters who supported the use of the variance felt that it would improveenvironmental protection by focusing resources on UST systems in higherrisk areas. Commenters opposed to the variance noted that leaks can poseenvironmental problems even in low-risk areas. Their experience suggestedthat impermeable formations may actually have hidden fractures that allowproduct to reach deep ground water and necessitating expensive cleanupefforts. They further suggested that, under any circumstance, product leaksmay pose an explosion hazard. These commenters also noted the difficultyof managing a variance process. The Agency agrees with commenters who noted significant problems with avariance procedure. No commenters were able to suggest a manageable varianceprocedure given the size of the UST universe. As noted earlier in the preamble,defining sensitive or low-risk areas at the Federal level is problematic(see section III. of today's preamble). Because the Agency could not developreasonable criteria for granting variances on a case-by-case or prospectivebasis, no release detection variance is included in the final rule. Consequently,less protective detection options such as infrequent monitoring for protectedtanks over 10 years of age will not be permitted in any areas regardlessof risk. <T3>(2) Internal Inspection as an Alternative to Release Detection.</T3>The Agency also considered the use of internal inspections as a substitutefor release detection. EPA solicited comment in the December 23, 1987,supplement to the proposal on the use of internal inspections at low riskUST sites. The Agency received many comments both for and against thisoption. In general, supporters of internal inspections believe that thiswould provide important information on the internal and external corrosionand the structural integrity of tanks. Some commenters specifically recommendedallowing internal inspection as a release detection alternative at low-risksites (e.g., sites that are not in vulnerable ground-water supply areasor in close proximity to surface waters and residential areas) while otherssupported its use at all UST sites. Schedules for conducting internal inspections,such as at periodic intervals (e.g., every 3 to 5 years; or ever 10 to15 years) or based on tank age, were recommended by several commenters.Reasons given by commenters not supporting this option included: (1) Notall tanks are constructed with manways, (2) internal inspections are timeconsuming and would be cost effective only for larger (bulk) tanks, (3)internal inspections do not provide sufficient information on tank integrity,and (4) inspections are a safety risk to the inspector. The Agency does not have sufficient data on the performance of tanks subjectto internal inspection programs that would allow it to determine that suchan approach without release detection would be protective of human healthand the environment. The Agency is aware that internal inspections arewidely used by owners and operators of bulk tanks for evaluating tank integrity.Based on insufficient information on the use of internal inspections withall USTs and the lack of industry consensus codes, however, the Agencyhas decided not to include this as a release detection alternative in thefinal rule. E. Release Reporting, Investigation and Confirmation <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Overview </ITAG>Because UST systems are hidden from direct observation, suspected releasesmust be investigated to identify, or confirm, that an UST system is thesource of a release. Monitoring results and other indicators in the environmentare the only suggestions of a release. In general, corrective action cannotbe started until the UST system and UST site are investigated and a releaseis confirmed. The proposed rule required that all suspected releases be reported to theimplementing agency (see proposed andSection; 280.50). Suspected releasesincluded: positive monitoring results from testing, monitoring and sampling,unusual operating conditions, and the discovery of regulated substancesin the environment. All suspected releases had to be immediately investigated,unless the owner and operator elected to proceed directly to correctiveaction. As discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule (52 FR 12747-12751),the development and implementation of criteria and procedures to determinethe appropriate circumstances to initiate, conduct and conclude the confirmationprocess can be technically complex. This situation is further affectedby the fact that owners and operators are typically reluctant to beginwhat they consider to be the costly process of confirmation. Although thistesting is inexpensive relative to corrective action costs, owners andoperators typically want to avoid all unnecessary costs. The Agency's proposedrelease reporting and confirmation requirements were established in thebelief that nearly all suspected releases must be investigated before conductingeven more elaborate and costly abatement procedures. The first step wasto quickly establish if the UST system is actually leaking. Prompt reportingof suspected releases also was proposed so that responsible authoritiescould take action to ensure that investigations are timely, properly designedand performed, and protective of human health and the environment.The Agency proposed several alternative procedures for investigating suspectedreleases including: Different combinations of tank and line tightness testing,inventory reconciliation review, testing of secondary containment, checkingequipment operation, soil coring and analysis, and other methods specifiedby an implementing agency. Numerous comments were received in responseto the proposed requirements. Most commenters took issue with the proposal'sattempt to provide specific direction and guidance and suggested that evenmore details were needed to successfully implement this approach. For example,several commenters questioned how soil sampling results were to be interpretedand when the soil coring analysis and investigations could be acceptedas definitive. In addition, commenters pointed out that the actual stepsin confirmation are determined on a site-by-site basis. Other commenterswere concerned with the discretion provided the implementing agencies indirecting owners and operators in the investigation of off-site impacts.As discussed elsewhere in today's preamble, EPA has received very encouraginginformation about the general efficacy of tank tightness testing. Also,it has become clear from comments and information received that tank tightnesstesting is the most prevalent technique now in use to determine if a suspectsystem is in fact leaking. Thus, tightness testing is a key confirmatorystep in the final rule required of all owners and operators, unless theychoose to immediately conduct an initial site investigation instead. The fact that the overwhelming majority of release investigations are presentlyconducted using either a tightness test (as suggested by several commenters)or a small-scale site investigation has influenced the final rule as presentedtoday. Accordingly, the five proposed investigation alternatives have beenreplaced with the requirement to use these two prevalent methods. Alternativemethods that are no less stringent and are approved by the implementingagency are still allowed. Today's rule has been revised to more clearlyestablish the end point for investigation and confirmation procedures.These procedures end when a successful tightness test is obtained or whenthe data from environmental testing do not significantly exceed backgroundlevels. (However, these investigations may resume if additional evidenceto the contrary is presented or is discovered.) <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section-by-Section Analysis </ITAG><T3>a. Reporting Requirements (andSection; 280.50).</T3> The proposal (andSection;280.50) required owners and operators to report to the implementing agencywithin 24 hours any monitoring results from any release detection methodsspecified in Subpart D that indicated that a release may have occurred.Also, the observation of any unusual operating conditions at the UST systemthat could be indicative of a release, as well as any indication of thepresence of released substances in the environment surrounding the UST,had to be reported. The proposed requirement for the implementing agencyto be informed early in the confirmation process was believed necessaryso that the implementing agency would be assured that proper investigationprocedures were used. Commenters generally responded that it is not necessaryto report all suspected releases. They identified situations in which obviousfalse alarms would have to be reported, and conditions that would be disruptiveto the operation of the facility. They pointed out that the large numberof what would prove to be unnecessary reports could overwhelm the implementingagency. The Agency acknowledges that some of the situations brought to its attentioncould indeed result in a significant number of false (or unnecessary) reports.For example, the erratic behavior of dispensing equipment may warrant furtherinvestigation before reporting because this behavior can be caused by morethan just a leak in the line. Accordingly, the final regulation has beenrevised to allow owners or operators to verify the proper operation oftheir equipment before reporting a suspected release. If the faulty equipmentis immediately repaired or replaced and further inspection fails to confirmthe initial result, the incident does not need to be reported. In the caseof inventory control, the rule now allows a second month of data to becollected to verify the possibility of a release before reporting. Thisdoes not mean that all inventory discrepancies must be confirmed by a secondmonth's data. Under some conditions, it may be necessary for owners andoperators to immediately report an inventory discrepancy. What level constitutesa suspected loss depends on the size of the tank, monthly throughput, andother operating practices. The appropriate action level must be workedout in advance of using this method. Other situations such as the physical presence of the regulated substanceor unusual concentrations of vapor still require immediate reporting. (Therequirement for reporting soil concentrations of 100 parts per millionor more has been removed because specific national action levels cannotbe established for each affected medium; a more reportable condition iswhether new contamination was found based on a change from earlier conditionsat this site, rather than arbitrary numerical standards and levels.) Failureto determine that an operational problem is caused by faulty equipmentwill also require reporting. In addition, as in the proposal, the Agencyrequires the owners and operators to report off-site conditions that mightindicate a release has occurred and that are brought to their attentionby a third party. This is intended to expedite the process of quick identificationof release incidents by giving the general public additional avenues toreport their observations. <T3>b. Investigations Due to Off-Site Impacts (280.51).</T3> Under theproposed rule, the owner and operator had to investigate suspected releasesthat were indicated by off-site impacts and as required by the implementingagency. The unintended interpretation of this requirement was that theimplementing agency could direct the owner and operator to conduct off-siteinvestigations in response to the discovery of off-site impacts. Commentersstrongly objected to this proposed requirement because they felt that itwas improper to conduct investigations on property not under their controland because of the apparent wide discretion given the implementing agencyin deciding what confirmation steps are needed in an off-site investigation.The final rule includes revised language that restates the requirementso it is clear that owners and operators must investigate their own USTsystem and site when requested by the implementing agency and based onthe discovery of off-site impacts. The potential for environmental damageis too great to allow the source of a release to go unidentified and unchecked.Limiting the investigation to the on-site UST system should minimize problemssuggested by commenters associated with the investigation of releases onproperty owned by other parties. The Agency did not intend that ownersand operators, under these regulations, must conduct investigations onproperty belonging to others. In the final rule, the investigation hasbeen limited to the determination of whether the owner and operator's USTsystem is the source of the off-site impact. If regulated substances havebeen released from an owner and operator's system, as determined by anon-site investigation and confirmation, then they will be responsible forany necessary corrective action, whether on- or off-site. <T3>c. Release Investigation Procedures (andSection; 280.52 (a) and (b)).</T3>As discussed in the proposal preamble (52 FR 12748-12751), the Agency consideredthree approaches to release confirmation: detailed, step-by-step procedures;confirmation directed completely by the implementing agency; and a basic,but not detailed, set of requirements. The first approach was rejectedbecause it is not feasible to identify and address all possible types ofreleases and site conditions in the regulation. The second approach wasrejected because implementation of release investigation would be delayeduntil implementing agencies had the time and resources to determine theappropriate methods for each individual site and because owners and operatorswould generally delay action until their responsibilities were determinedby the implementing agency. Thus, the Agency selected the third approachas providing sufficient guidance as well as flexibility. To implement this approach, the proposed rule provided five specific proceduresfor release investigation. Any one procedure could be used depending onthe preference of the owner and operator and the way in which a suspectedrelease was identified. These procedures were: (1) Performing a site investigationunder the direction of the implementing agency; (2) checking the interstitialarea of a secondary containment system; (3) in the case of a failed tightnesstest, checking inventory records, retesting of each portion of the system,and analyzing soil samples; (4) in the case of an inventory discrepancy,performing tightness tests and analyzing soil samples; and (5) performingany other investigation procedure that is no less stringent than thoseabove if approved by the implementing agency. This selection of releaseinvestigation procedures was intended to address all possible situationsand allow investigation to begin quickly even in the absence of guidancefrom the implementing agency (although such an interaction was consideredmost desirable). Most commenters disagreed with the proposed approach, particularly thedegree of authority given to the implementing agencies. Some of these commentersrequested more specific guidance on investigation procedures, particularlywhat to do given certain findings and when to end an investigation. Thespecific investigation technique receiving the most comment was the soilcoring requirement. Commenters felt it was an expensive and difficult process,the results of which are not definitive in confirming a release as thereare many sources of soil hydrocarbons other than a current release. Theproposed rule was also unclear about what actions should be taken basedon the results of soil sampling. This requirement was proposed to be combinedwith the tightness test because it was believed that tightness tests mightnot be determinative and could not detect very small releases. This requirementwas deleted in the final rule because it is now apparent (see discussionbelow) that tightness testing is a reasonably sensitive and reliable method.Soil sampling and analysis may still be part of the site investigationsprocess as discussed in section (3). below. <T3>(1) Timing of Release Investigation and Confirmation.</T3> The Agencyrequired in the proposal that all suspected releases be investigated withinseven days of initial reporting. Commenters were equally divided on whetherthis period was too long or too short. The Agency recognizes that thereare some situations, such as the presence of product in the environment,where an immediate response to a suspected release is required. In othercases, such as when relatively small inventory discrepancies appear, greatertime intervals may be allowed. The rule has been changed to recognize this:a second month of data collection is allowed for inventory control confirmation;seven days are allowed for testing of the tightness of tanks and lines;and 24 hours are allowed for checking the operation of monitoring and dispensingequipment.<T3>(2) Tightness Test (280.52(a)). </T3>Since proposal, the results ofthree studies have influenced the Agency's thinking on effective releaseinvestigation procedures. The evaluation of 25 tightness test methods atthe EPA Office of Research and Development's laboratory at Edison, NewJersey (53 FR 10403) indicates that current equipment, operated with someprocedural modifications, should be able to detect leaks as small as 0.10gal/hr (see section IV.D. of this preamble for further discussion of tightnesstesting and these results). In California, a state with a large UST populationand an active UST program (and in numerous other state and local programs),tightness testing is often the preferred approach to release investigation.The new information on the causes of release from UST systems (discussedearlier in this preamble) demonstrates that the most common sources ofreleases are pressurized piping and loose fittings and bungs on top ofthe tank, which only leak during tank overfill. The easiest way to detectreleases from piping is a line tightness test, and the overfill-type oftank tightness test will identify bad fittings on top of the tank. Forall of these reasons, the Agency has concluded that tightness testing isa much more effective method of release investigation than was known atproposal, is often the most logical test with which to investigate a suspectedrelease, and is currently the most practiced confirmation tool nationwide.Based on the above conclusion that tightness testing is the most effectivefirst step in release confirmation, the Agency revised the final rule toensure that the appropriateness of this method is highlighted. Consequently,the sections of the proposed rule presenting the several alternative investigationprocedures have been deleted from the final rule. (In doing this, EPA agreeswith several commenters that some of these procedures were incomplete andunnecessary on a site-specific basis.) In their place are two alternativeinvestigation steps, the first of which is to conduct tightness tests todetermine the integrity of the tank and piping. If the test results indicatethere is a leak from a portion of the UST system that routinely containsproduct, the owner and operator must stop the leak and begin correctiveaction (releases from other portions of the UST system are addressed inreporting and cleanup of spills and overfills in andSection; 280.53). Ifthe tightness test indicates that the UST system is not leaking and thereis not evidence of environmental contamination, the final rule does notrequire further actions of the owner and operator. However, if evidenceof environmental contamination is still present and unexplained, the secondalternative investigation step must take place. The second step requiresconducting an initial site investigation (see section (3) below). This revised approach is intended to provide clearer guidance and definitiveend points as was requested by several commenters. In addition, tightnesstesting is a familiar technique for many owners and operators and is themost readily available and inexpensive investigation procedure. Therefore,by emphasizing its use as the primary release investigation procedure,many owners and operators will more likely begin investigation quicklyon their own without waiting for the implementing agency to direct them.This capability of quick response, plus the sensitivity of tightness testingand its ability to pinpoint all sources of a leak, will minimize the potentialdamage to human health and the environment from a suspected release. Moreover,tightness testing is frequently the first step in corrective action todetermine what must be done to stop a release. Thus, making it a part ofrelease investigation will be cost effective for owners, operators, andimplementing agencies. <T3>(3) Site Check (andSection; 280.52(b)). </T3>The proposed rule (andSection;280.51(a)(1)) allowed owners or operators to investigate suspected releasesby conducting an initial site investigation of the UST site under the directionof the implementing agency. The final rule retains this option as the secondstep in the release confirmation process. The site assessment requirementsin the original proposal, however, have been significantly modified toprovide owners and operators greater flexibility in consideration of differentsite conditions. The requirements have also been modified to be more consistentwith the assessment activities required under the closure and correctiveaction provisions of the final rule. The initial site assessment allowed under the proposed release confirmationprovisions was intended to be similar to the investigation performed underthe closure and corrective action provisions. The objective of each ofthese assessments is to measure for the presence of released regulatedsubstances and provide a preliminary indication of the need for and scopeof further corrective action activities. They are not intended to definethe full extent or location of soils contaminated by a release.Despite this similarity in purpose, however, the proposed rule specifieddifferent sampling methods and assessment techniques. As a result, a numberof commenters expressed confusion concerning the nature and scope of theassessment and requested more specific guidance on investigative procedures.Therefore, to clarify the rule's objectives and ensure that the resultsobtained from each type of assessment are comparable, similar site checkrequirements have been incorporated into the release confirmation, closure,and corrective action subparts of the final rule. The site investigation allowed under the proposed rule had to be conductedunder the direction of the implementing agency. As noted above, a numberof comments criticized the degree of authority given to the implementingagency under these provisions. EPA agrees that the proposal did not giveowners and operators adequate guidance for determining the objectives andgoals of the site investigation. This could have resulted in wide variationsin the nature and scope of the site assessments conducted under the proposaland in inconsistencies in the resulting data and their interpretation.The proposal also could have inadvertently required the implementing agenciesto commit significant resources to the management of site assessments giventhe large number of assessments, projected to be conducted over the next5 to 10 years. Therefore, the final rule allows the owner and operatorto plan, select methods, and conduct the initial site check. These changes,however, do not diminish or restrict in any way the authority of the implementingagency to participate in the planning and performance of site investigationactivities of the owner and operator. These changes will allow the implementingagency to determine the scope of their involvement in the site investigationprogram and, at the same time, avoid unnecessary and potentially costlydelays in the implementation of each assessment by the owner and operator.The final rule does not require the owner and operator to use a particulartype of measurement method or assessment technique. A number of commentersquestioned the applicability and effectiveness of the investigative proceduresdiscussed in the proposed rule, and suggested other methods that may beequally effective in various site-specific situations. EPA agrees thata given sampling method or measurement technique may not provide representativeresults for all types of regulated substances and site conditions. Forexample, soil gas sampling may not be appropriate where the regulated substancecontains compounds that are non-volatile or where the local geology andhydrology significantly restrict the movement of the volatilized organicspecies. To address this problem, the final rule requires the owner and operatorto measure for the presence of regulated substances in the area where contaminationis most likely to be present. Any factors that may affect the identificationof the source or presence of contamination must be considered in orderto ensure that the assessment will provide accurate and reliable results.The rule specifies the factors deemed to be the most important in selectingthe measurement method and in conducting the initial site check. Measurements must be taken in the area surrounding the UST system wherecontamination is most likely to be present. Samples may be collected fromany depth as long as they are taken where contamination is most likelyto have migrated or accumulated given the specific characteristics of thesite and the regulated substance. Most regulated substances will tend tomigrate down and, as a result, the Agency believes that samples taken atdepths below the UST system's suspect components will generally satisfythe requirements of this subsection. The contaminants in some regulatedsubstances, however, may float on the water table or dissolve in the groundwater. Consequently, the nature of the regulated substance and the depthto ground water around the UST system are important factors to be consideredwhen developing an assessment plan. The owner and operator may also find it necessary to conduct the initialcheck in an area that extends outside of the excavation zone of the USTsystem. Although the Agency believes that sampling in the excavation zonewill generally provide the most accurate information about the presenceand source of contamination at an UST site, it may not be possible to identifythe precise location of the excavation zone or gain reasonable access tothe areas adjacent to the tank and piping due to interfering structures.In addition, samples taken from the excavation zone will not give any informationconcerning the extent of contamination. Where contamination poses an imminentthreat to human health and the environment on adjacent property, it maybe more appropriate to take samples at or near the site's property linethat is ajacent to the off-site point of impact. For example, seepage ofliquid or vapors into occupied residences or into drinking water suppliesmay necessitate sampling at the adjoining property line so that correctiveaction activities can be expedited. In such cases, the mitigation of contaminationin the soil or ground water around the building or well may be more importantthan first identifying the cause of the contamination, particularly wherethere are several possible sources of suspected releases. The specific factors identified in the final rule were selected to ensurethat representative assessment information is obtained during release confirmation.Consideration of these factors by the owner or operator is deemed by EPAto be the minimum requirements for adequately evaluating the area surroundingthe tank. They are not intended to be exhaustive nor should they be givenequal weight at all sites. The importance of each of the factors must beevaluated carefully in view of the regulated substances suspected of beingpresent and the specific conditions at the site. d. <T3>Reporting and Cleanup of Spills and Overfills (andSection; 280.53). </T3>Inthe proposal, the Agency specified that spills and overfills which resultedin the release of a regulated substance meeting or exceeding the reportablequantity (RQ) under CERCLA (40 CFR Part 302), or spills and overfills ofpetroleum exceeding 25 gallons or causing a sheen on surface water, mustbe reported to the implementing agency within 24 hours. The proposed approachhas been maintained in the final rule. In the preamble to the proposed regulation, the Agency requested commentson the appropriateness of the reporting cutoff of 25 gallons for abovegroundreleases of petroleum to land and surface water. Commenters were dividedon this issue. Many supported the 25-gallon cutoff while some requestedthat it be raised to much higher levels and a few requested that it belowered. The Agency has retained the proposed reporting levels while allowingindividual state and local implementing agencies the ability to selectother amounts under certain conditions. In all cases, the spill or overfillmust be immediately contained and cleaned up, and, if it is not, then itmust be reported to the implementing agency. The point at which a reportmust be submitted to the implementing agency is an administrative convenience,and the Agency intends to leave some discretion to the states on this area.The Agency believes that spills often occur at many of the facilities inthis regulated community. In fact, knowledgeable members of the regulatedcommunity have reported to EPA that spills and overfills are the secondmost common source of release to the environment. This conclusion is basedin part on observations made during tank removal of obviously contaminatedsoil around areas of the tank where spills might be expected to occur.This soil contamination can be caused by emptying fill hoses onto the groundafter delivery, either by accident when the hose is disconnected from thetank or on purpose when the tank is inadvertently overfilled and the hosecannot be drained into the tank. Although any one incident may or may notresult in a significant threat at a particular site, the Agency has concludedthat the repeated occurrence of these releases over time does representa serious threat to human health and the environment. The concern about spills reporting is that spills appear to occur veryfrequently, although generally in small quantities. The requirement toreport all spills, regardless of their size, could cause the implementingagency to be overwhelmed with reports of numerous small spills that donot represent a significant threat to human health and the environment.The Agency believes very little threat is posed by smaller spills if theyare contained and immediately cleaned up, including contaminated surfacesoils. The installation of catchment basins required in Subpart B in thefinal rule should reduce the number of releases to the environment, thecost of cleanup for owners and operators and the number of incidents wherereporting is necessary.The Agency has retained the proposed RQ approach to indicate to the ownerand operator when reporting is necessary. For petroleum, this approachrequires reporting of aboveground releases to land in excess of 25 gallons,and of aboveground releases to water if the result is an oil sheen on thewater, in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 110. The rationalefor this was provided in the preamble to the proposal. The Agency alsorecognizes that, in some cases, it may not be possible to immediately cleanup a spill of less than 25 gallons. When this occurs, the owner and operatoris required to report the spill to the implementing agency. A spill or overfill resulting in the release of a hazardous substance tothe environment must be reported if the volume equals or exceeds its RQas defined under CERCLA (40 CFR Part 302). The RQ for a particular hazardoussubstance may result in a volume that is less than 25 gallons. The Agencyfeels it is necessary to place tighter controls on hazardous substancesbecause of their generally greater threat to human health and the environment.An additional discussion of this issue is provided in section VI.A. ofthis preamble. The release of a hazardous substance equal to or in excessof its RQ must also be reported to the National Response Center immediately(rather than within 24 hours) under sections 102 and 103 of CERCLA andto appropriate state and local emergency response authorities under TitleIII of SARA. The requirements of today's rule do not change the responsibilitiesof owners and operators to meet the requirements of these other EPA rules.Thus, in the case of a spill or overfill of a regulated hazardous substancefrom an UST, the owner and operator is subject to two reporting requirements.The impact of additional reporting, however, is minimal because the goalof The National Response Center is essentially to inform local implementingagencies. This will already have been done when the owner or operator fulfillsthe requirements in today's rules. Although reporting triggers have been established for aboveground releases,this does not relieve the owner and operator of the responsibility to undertakeall other appropriate elements of the corrective action process under SubpartF for any aboveground release, regardless if it is more or less than thereportable quantity. F. Release Response and Corrective Action for UST Systems Containing RegulatedSubstances <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background </ITAG>Release response and corrective action for UST systems include activitiesto investigate, report, abate, and remedy releases of regulated substancesinto the environment. To ensure that necessary steps are taken to protecthuman health and the environment at all sites discovered to have a release,EPA proposed steps that all owners and operators must take quickly to identifyand reduce any immediate health and safety threats posed by releases. Inaddition, proposed requirements mandated the investigation and ameliorationof the long-term threats to human health and the environment posed by releasesthat have migrated beyond the UST system to contaminate surrounding soiland ground water. Long-term actions would begin after an implementing agencydetermined that additional corrective action was needed to protect humanhealth and the environment. This determination was to be made on the basisof data gathered and submitted by the owner and operator and a site-specificexposure assessment performed by the implementing agency. Finally, theproposal distinguished between releases of petroleum and hazardous substancesby establishing separate corrective action requirements for them in differentsections of the proposed regulations (Subpart F for petroleum and SubpartG for hazardous substances). Today's final rule builds upon this proposed approach, but also reflectsseveral important changes that respond to concerns raised by commenterson the proposal: andbullet; The Agency has consolidated the proposed requirements for petroleumand hazardous substances into one section of the final rule in SubpartF. This consolidation deletes the extensive duplication of requirementsin the proposal caused by separating them into two sections. andbullet; The proposed basic framework and most of the proposed requirementsfor the initial abatement steps required at all release sites are retainedin the final rule. Changes have been made, however, to some of the proposedrequirements in response to public comments. These changes are intendedto clarify the owner's and operator's responsibilities for identifyingand addressing the initial health and safety threats posed by releases.andbullet; The final rule retains the proposed requirements for long-termcorrective actions, which follow a site-specific approach for establishingclean-up target levels. This section of the rule has been amended, however,to clarify that the owner and operator may proceed, under certain conditions,with corrective action before a corrective action plan has been approvedby the implementing agency. andbullet; In response to concerns raised by several commenters, EPA hasrevised several of the proposed requirements to clarify the responsibilitiesof owners and operators. Some changes clarify when owners and operatorsmust initiate specific corrective action steps, such as detailed soil andground-water investigations, particularly in the absence of clear directionfrom the implementing agency. Other changes more clearly identify whatowners or operators must do to carry out their responsibilities in suchareas as the initial site investigation, detailed investigations for soiland ground-water contamination, and free-product removal.andbullet; The final rule clarifies the requirements concerning the publicparticipation process for corrective action. The final rule emphasizesthe need to ensure public access (primarily through existing state procedures)to information pertaining to specific corrective actions. In the preamble to the proposed UST corrective action rule, EPA requestedcomments on several corrective action issues: The general scope of theproposed requirements; how explicitly these requirements should be detailedin the rule; whether the proposed minimum site investigation requirementswere appropriate; and the desirability of the proposed site-specific approachto setting cleanup goals for UST sites. EPA also requested comment on thedefinition of free product, the adequacy of existing state administrativeauthority for public participation in corrective action, and correctiveaction requirements for tanks containing a mixture of regulated substances(see 52 FR 12678-12683 and 12751-12757). EPA received comments on all theseissues, as well as on other issues not raised specifically by the Agencyin the proposal. Although many commenters believed that the proposed corrective action regulationswere essentially sound, EPA received a wide array of responses on key issues.For example, although several commenters disagreed with the Agency's proposedrequirements for site-specific cleanup standards, others supported thisapproach. Several general concerns were repeatedly raised by numerous commentersas they commented on specific proposed requirements: What must be doneand by whom, how much discretion should be granted to the implementingagency to change specific requirements, and what minimum objectives mustbe met during the various steps in the corrective action process. As notedpreviously, these general concerns have prompted EPA to make several changesin the final rule, and clarifications appear below in the following twosubsections of today's preamble. General concerns raised by commenters are briefly discussed and respondedto in the next subsection of this preamble (section IV.F.2.): andbullet; Site-specific approach to corrective action; andbullet; Discretion for implementing agencies; andbullet; Clarification of owner and operator responsibilities; and andbullet; Consolidation of requirements for petroleum and hazardous substances.Following the discussions of these issues, section IV.F.3. provides a section-by-sectionanalysis that more specifically addresses the changes made to the proposedrequirements in the development of today's final corrective action rule,and the highlights of the public response that prompted these revisions.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Major Issues Influencing the Final Rule </ITAG>a. <T3>Site-Specific Approach to Corrective Action. </T3>In the proposed rule,EPA selected a site-specific approach for setting cleanup target levelsfor long-term corrective actions. These cleanup levels would be keyed todata obtained from a detailed site investigation of soil and ground-watercontamination by the owner and operator, and from a site-specific exposureassessment conducted by the implementing agency. As discussed in the preambleto the proposal (52 FR 12680-12682), EPA believed this approach would allowimplementing agencies the necessary flexibility to develop their own programsor implement existing programs. Given the size of the regulated communityand the diversity of UST environmental settings, EPA concluded that thesite-specific approach was the most effective framework for enabling implementingagencies to assess the extent of necessary corrective action in individualcases. The final rule retains EPA's selection of the proposed site-specific approachfor UST corrective action requirements. A central element of this site-specificapproach is the establishment of site-specific cleanup standards that adequatelyprotect human health and the environment. In the preamble to the proposedrule (52 FR 12678-12683), EPA asked for comments on whether the long-termcleanup requirements of the UST corrective action rule should be established:(a) On the basis of national cleanup standards, with a variance provision;(b) to reflect ground-water classification schemes where national standardswould apply in some settings, and site-specific cleanup levels in others;or (c) as site-specific standards as proposed. EPA received comments that supported each of these options, with suggestionson how to implement the preferred option. Most commenters who supportedestablishing national cleanup standards believed that standards expeditecleanups and provide greater consistency in cleanup goals. They did notprovide EPA with information, however, that showed that the use of nationalcleanup standards would substantially hasten the UST corrective actionprocess or relieve administrative burdens. In addition, EPA is not convincedthat the use of a single cleanup standard for UST cleanups will achievegreater consistency in the protection of human health and the environmentthan a site-by-site exposure assessment approach. At the present time,the Agency's assessment of UST corrective action shows that cleanup resultsare generally limited by the available technology and particular site conditionsrather than by a cleanup standard. EPA also believes that the site-specificexposure assessments for UST releases required in today's final rule canbe streamlined so that they will not delay corrective action, as some ofthese commenters feared. The Agency intends to work with implementing agenciesto develop methods to streamline site-specific exposure assessments withoutdiminishing protection of human health and the environment. Some commenters supported the use of a ground-water classification systemfor UST corrective action decisions. As discussed earlier in today's preamble,however, EPA has concluded that developing a classification system at thefederal level is extremely difficult and unworkable. EPA leaves to thediscretion of implementing agencies the choice of whether to establishor incorporate existing ground-water classification systems to assist intheir UST corrective action decisions. The Agency notes that the requiredinvestigations at UST sites and a site-by-site approach for UST correctiveaction will likely incorporate many of the same factors used in establishinga ground-water classification system. In developing today's final rule, EPA noted that the majority of commenterspreferred the proposed site-specific approach. The primary reasons citedwere that this approach best accommodates the diversity of UST releasesituations and also reduces, in the aggregate, the cost of compliance.EPA notes, however, that its decision to promulgate a site-specific approachto long-term UST corrective action does not preclude states from establishingcleanup standards in their own UST corrective action programs. The Agencyrecognizes that some states already have elected to develop and use statewidecleanup standards, sometimes in conjunction with site-specific exposureassessments as part of a variance procedure. b. <T3>Discretion for Implementing Agencies. </T3>The proposed correctiveaction rule afforded UST implementing agencies considerable discretionand flexibility in developing their own UST corrective action process.For example, EPA proposed language_such as ``unless directed to do otherwiseby the implementing agency'' and ``or as directed by the implementing agency''_toindicate that these agencies could add their own requirements or instructan owner and operator to bypass certain requirements on a case-by-casebasis. EPA felt that the diversity of UST settings and release situationsrequired the implementing agency to have flexibility in tailoring manyaspects of the corrective action response so that different releases couldbe cleaned up effectively and efficiently. EPA received comments regarding the appropriate level of discretion providedto the implementing agencies. Some commenters warned that vague rule languagecould lead to arbitrary requests by the implementing agency; others suggestedthat EPA curtail the implementing agency's authority by issuing more detailedrequirements. Several commenters were concerned about delays in site cleanupsthat might ensue because of additional requests by implementing agencies.Another suggestion was to expand the implementing agency's discretion torequire the UST owner and operator to start a site cleanup before a correctiveaction plan is finalized. In response, EPA has revised the final rule to clarify which elements ofthe UST corrective action process are mandatory and which are discretionary.As a result, the final rule mandates the response requirements that mustbe followed for all releases (andSection; 280.61), the investigation andcleanup requirements that are mandatory unless otherwise directed by theimplementing agency (andSection;andSection; 280.62 and 280.63), and the additionalsite-characterization and cleanup steps that may be required of UST ownersand operators if certain site conditions exist or that may be requiredby the implementing agency (andSection;andSection; 280.64 through 280.66).EPA notes, however, that section 9008 of RCRA enables state and local regulationto be more stringent than the federal UST program. Thus, even if EPA removeddiscretion from the federal rules, EPA would not have the authority toprevent implementing agencies from imposing more extensive requirementsthan EPA under state or local law.Commenters expressed concerns that cleanup of soil and ground water maybe delayed due to lengthy reviews of the corrective action plans by theimplementing agencies or by uncooperative owners and operators. In response,EPA has made two changes in the final rule. First, EPA has added the phrase``as appropriate'' preceding the list of factors that the implementingagency must consider when reviewing a corrective action plan in andSection;280.66(b). This change makes it clear that the implementing agency neednot formally consider all these factors if the agency determines analysisof these factors is not necessary to ensure protection of human health,safety, and the environment. Second, EPA has provided that owners and operatorsmay begin cleanup of soil and ground water before their corrective actionplan is approved by the implementing agency subject to conditions describedin andSection; 280.66(d). In addition, under existing law, EPA or authorized UST implementing agenciescan intervene to respond to clean up releases from UST systems. Under section9003(h)(2) of RCRA, EPA and states under cooperative agreement are authorizedto step in and take corrective actions for releases of petroleum from USTsin situations including the following: (1) The owner or operator failsto comply with the established cleanup schedule; (2) there is a need totake emergency action; (3) the cost of a corrective action exceeds theresources supplied by the financial responsibility mechanism provided bythe owner or operator; or (4) the owner or operator is insolvent. For arelease from a hazardous substance UST, EPA has the authority under CERCLAto respond. States are not provided such authority under CERCLA, but mayhave their own authorities under state law. c. <T3>Clarification of Owner and Operator Responsibilities. </T3>Many commentersexpressed the opinion that the proposed rule was difficult to interpretwith respect to what had to be done and by whom to comply with the federalrequirements. EPA agrees with these commenters that the language of theproposed rule was sometimes unclear regarding the specific responsibilitiesof UST owners and operators. The Agency, therefore, has revised the finalrule to make clearer which elements of the corrective action rule are mandatoryand which are discretionary. EPA has concluded that the following basic steps are required to ensurean effective response to every release: rapid notification that a releasehas occurred; investigation to mitigate fire, explosion, and vapor hazards;preventing further release of the regulated substance from the leakingUST system; and removing free product from the environment. These stepsare required of every owner and operator in response to a UST release;implementing agencies may not change these requirements. Similarly, EPA believes that the following initial site investigation andabatement steps are usually necessary to protect human health and the environment:Estimating the nature and quantity of the release; removing as much ofthe regulated substance from the UST system as necessary to prevent furtherrelease to the environment; and gathering information about the locationsof wells, subsurface sewer lines, and populations surrounding the releasesite. Thus, the final rule holds UST owners and operators responsible forthese actions unless the implementing agency directs them to do otherwisein response to site-specific considerations. The baseline requirements for initial release response and corrective actionare covered in andSection;andSection; 280.61 through 280.63 of the final rule.As noted above, the requirements of andSection; 280.61 in the final ruledescribe mandatory initial response measures to be taken by UST ownersand operators without exception. All UST owners and operators are responsiblefor meeting the requirements of andSection;andSection; 280.62 and 280.63, unlessthe implementing agency directs them to do otherwise. Sections 280.64 and280.65 address those requirements for which owners and operators are responsibleif certain site conditions exist. Section 280.66 describes soil and ground-watercleanup steps that may be initiated by the owner and operator or requiredat the direction of the implementing agency. d. <T3>Consolidation of Corrective Action Requirements for Petroleum and HazardousSubstances. </T3>In the preamble of the proposed rule, EPA requested commentson whether the corrective action requirements for petroleum USTs (SubpartF) and hazardous substance USTs (Subpart G) should be integrated into onesubpart or should remain separate (52 FR 12678). All commenters respondingto this request favored the integration of Subparts F and G; they differedonly in their suggestions to EPA on how to combine the two rules. Today's final rule has consolidated into Subpart F all the corrective actionrequirements for releases from underground storage tank systems storingsubstances regulated by Subtitle I. The title of this subpart has beenrevised to make clear that it addresses both release response and correctiveaction activities. As can be inferred from the new title, an appropriateresponse to a release, particularly those small in size that were caughtquickly and remedied, may not need to include long-term corrective action,if the initial response measures adequately protect human health and theenvironment. The general applicability sections of the proposed petroleum and hazardoussubstance requirements (proposed andSection; 280.60 and andSection; 280.70,respectively) have been replaced with a single new section. This revisedsection states that where RCRA Subtitle C corrective action requirementsapply to UST releases at permitted RCRA facilities, Subtitle I correctiveaction requirements will not apply. EPA has added this provision to avoidpossible duplication of requirements. The initial abatement requirements have been retained in the final rule.In response to commenters who preferred the more detailed language usedin proposed Subpart G, the Agency has carried forward the language emphasizingimmediate action to prevent further releases and the containment of visiblereleases to the environment. The principal change in the initial abatementrequirements provides owners and operators and implementing agencies greaterdiscretion for determining the need for and timing of contaminated soilremoval and the authority to decide appropriate soil management alternativeson a site-by-site basis.The proposed rule for hazardous substance USTs had no separate sectioncomparable to the proposed petroleum rule's requirements for free productremoval. By merging Subparts F and G, EPA extends the free product removalrequirements to all regulated substance releases, including removal requirementsdetailing precautions and other measures to follow during recovery operations.EPA recognizes that detection and removal of some hazardous substancescan be far more difficult than removal of petroleum free product, especiallyin areas of complex hydrogeology. The Agency believes, however, that thefree product removal requirements allow implementing agencies sufficientflexibility to consider factors that complicate the detection and removalof free product and to adjust the pace of actions to remove free productaccordingly. Both proposed rules had requirements governing additional investigationsand the cleanup of contaminated soils and ground water at UST release sites.The final rule also contains these requirements in andSection;andSection; 280.65and 280.66, which are discussed in more detail later in the next subsectionof this preamble. Both proposed rules contained reporting requirements. The hazardous substancerule, however, required additional specific reporting items, such as likelymigration routes and proximity to population centers. These additionalreporting items have not been retained in the initial site investigationrequirements of Subpart F because they are largely duplicative of the reportingrequirements contained within final andSection; 280.63, which governs initialsite characterization. Moreover, implementing agencies continue to havethe authority to require the reporting of additional specific informationshould the need arise. The public participation requirements of both rules have been combinedinto a single section of the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Section-by-Section Analysis </ITAG>In writing the final rule, EPA revised proposed andSection;andSection; 280.60through 280.66 to clarify the release response and corrective action steps.Most of the changes are editorial, prompted by concerns or confusion expressedon the part of commenters. Some substantive changes, however, were alsomade in response to public comments. The following sections discuss indetail the changes made to the proposal as reflected in today's final rules.Issues raised by commenters on the proposed requirements and the Agency'sconsideration of these issues are also briefly discussed. a. <T3>General (andSection; 280.60).</T3> Proposed andSection; 280.60 appliedthe corrective action requirements of Subpart F to all UST systems exceptthose exempted by statute or regulation. Owners and operators of tank systemsfor which other subparts of the proposed technical standard are deferredwere nonetheless required to comply with the Subpart F requirements inresponse to confirmed releases. In the final rule, EPA has added language to clarify the applicabilityof Subtitle C or Subtitle I requirements to USTs at RCRA-permitted facilitiesand to avoid potential overlap in regulatory authority. Section 280.60of the final rule reflects the fact that the Subtitle C corrective actionrequirements under the authority of RCRA 3004(u) will apply to many releasesfrom UST systems located at RCRA-permitted facilities, regardless of theregulated substance stored. For USTs not covered by 3004(u), includingfacilities without a final RCRA permit, Subtitle I corrective action standardswill apply to releases from all petroleum and hazardous substance tankscovered under Subtitle I. UST corrective actions underway at facilitieshaving interim status under RCRA may be subject to review under the RCRAcorrective action program during the development of a final permit, andthese ongoing corrective action activities may be incorporated into thefacility's RCRA permit. b. <T3>Initial Response and Reporting Requirements (andSection; 280.61).</T3>Proposed andSection; 280.61 (initial abatement requirements and procedures)has been separated into three new sections in the final rule: initial response(andSection; 280.61), initial abatement measures and site check (andSection;280.62), and initial site characterization (andSection; 280.63). These sections,plus free product removal (andSection; 280.64), encompass the first phaseof the UST corrective action process. As with the proposal, EPA intendsthese final requirements to achieve three goals: (1) To bring UST releasesites under control with respect to immediate health and safety hazards;(2) to stabilize the site so that contamination will not worsen as investigationsand potentially applicable long-term cleanup plans are considered; and(3) to be self-implementing, in that these measures emphasize the responsibilityof the owner and operator to take quick action without awaiting directionfrom the implementing agency. Thus, andSection;andSection; 280.62 through 280.64in the final rule represent the baseline release response and correctiveaction requirements that are mandatory for all UST owners and operatorsand all releases, unless the implementing agency directs otherwise. Therule has been reformatted to make this clearer. The initial response requirementsof andSection; 280.61 are mandatory for all owners and operators and allreleases without exception. In addition, andSection;andSection; 280.60 through280.64 have newly added reporting sections. The new placement of thesereporting requirements clarifies the owner's and operator's responsibilitieswith respect to the timing and content of the required reports. The final requirements of andSection; 280.61 for initial response and reportingare essentially identical to those proposed. The primary difference isthat the wording has been changed to make unambiguous the response requiredwithin 24 hours. These initial actions include: Reporting the confirmedrelease to the implementing agency; taking immediate steps to prevent furtherrelease to the environment; and mitigating fire, explosion, and vapor hazards.EPA recognizes that, in some cases, it may not be possible to completethese steps within 24 hours. For example, it is sometimes easier to confirmthat a release has occurred than to identify the precise location of therelease from the UST system. Similarly, it may take longer than 24 hoursto adequately vent hazardous vapors from building. In revising this section,however, EPA emphasizes the potential urgency of a release and the responsibilityof the owner and operator to quickly respond.c. <T3>Initial Abatement Measures and Site Check (andSection; 280.62).</T3>In order to clarify the on-site management steps that EPA believes arenecessary to abate hazards and stabilize the site, the Agency has groupedinitial abatement requirements into andSection; 280.62. Two of the requirementsin this section are carried forward from those in proposed Subpart G. First,andSection; 280.62(a)(1) requires removal of the regulated substance fromthe tank as ``necessary to prevent further release to the environment.''EPA has added this phrase to acknowledge_as some commenters pointed out_thatsome situations may not require complete removal of product from the tank(e.g., if the release is clearly demonstrated to be from one tank thatis part of a multiple tank system). Second, andSection; 280.62(a)(2) carriesforward the requirement to visually inspect aboveground releases or exposedbelowground releases and to prevent further migration of the released substanceinto surrounding soils and ground water (e.g., by using sorbents and bermsto control the flow of product). Section 280.62(a)(3) has been added to clarify EPA's proposed requirementto ``mitigate fire and safety hazards.'' EPA agrees with commenters whonoted that these hazards may persist or reappear beyond the initial responsephase and, thus, must be monitored and remedied throughout the cleanupprocess. The new requirement also emphasizes that, if present, these hazardsmay require mitigation both within and beyond the boundaries of the USTsite (e.g., in subsurface sewer lines or nearby buildings). The requirement in proposed andSection; 280.62(a)(4) to remove ``visiblycontaminated soil from the UST excavation zone'' has been deleted. EPAreceived many comments on this proposed requirement. Most commenters expressedconfusion regarding the definition of visible soil contamination and otherconcerns related to the appropriate timing and extent of soil removal.Commenters identified cases where a strict interpretation of the requirement(e.g., removal of slightly discolored soils) would translate into aggressivesoil removal that would be unnecessary, technically infeasible, and verycostly. Some commenters noted that extensive soil removal at UST sitescould exacerbate problems of the nation's limited landfill capacity, ifthese soils were taken off-site for disposal. Other commenters suggestedthat soil removal or treatment (beyond that which is needed to addressimmediate health and safety hazards) should be considered as part of thelong-term plan for corrective action. Many commenters suggested that EPAconsider various <T3>in situ </T3>or on-site treatment methods as alternatives to immediateremoval and disposal of contaminated soils. EPA agrees with these commenters. In particular, EPA is concerned thatrequiring immediate and extensive excavation of contaminated soil may transfercontamination to other media (e.g., air), may transfer risk from one siteto another, or may spread contamination at the release site beyond itsexisting extent. These outcomes are inconsistent with EPA's objective toprotect human health and the environment. Further, EPA did not intend topreclude consideration of alternative on-site or <T3>in situ </T3>treatment methods. As a result, EPA has created a new andSection; 280.62(a)(4) to clarify theobjectives of soil management that must be undertaken during the initialphases of corrective action. The new requirement states that UST ownersand operators must remedy hazards posed by contaminated soils that areexcavated or exposed as a result of release confirmation, site investigation,abatement, or corrective action measures. These hazards include vapor threatsand potential leaching of contaminants. EPA believes this new requirementaddresses concerns raised by commenters by more clearly stating the scopeand the objectives of initial soil management. In contrast to the proposed requirement for soil removal, EPA has not prescribeda specific management method. The final rule does, however, require thatany exposed soils be managed as necessary to remedy hazards such as thosementioned above. EPA expects there will be UST release situations whereprompt soil removal and disposal may be the most effective option (e.g.,where there are relatively small quantities of contaminated soil in urbanareas having high potential for human exposure to vapors, and where excavationequipment is already on-site for use in investigating the tank system).In such situations, soil removal may be necessary to bring the site undercontrol with respect to immediate threats and might also be adequate tocomplete cleanup at the site. In response to commenter's concerns thatsoil management not simply transfer risk, EPA has, however, added a newrequirement to the rule. If the owner and operator choose to treat or disposeof contaminated soils, they must comply with applicable state and localrequirements. (See also section VI.B. of today's preamble: Relationshipto Other Agency Programs.) EPA received comments regarding the explicitness of the proposed site investigationrequirements for corrective action, as well as for release confirmationand tank closure activities. Some commenters requested more specificity;others pointed out the difficulty of prescribing uniform requirements forall sites. In response, EPA has revised the rule (adding new andSection;andSection;280.52(b), 280.62(b) and 280.72(a)) to make consistent the site investigationrequirements for release confirmation, corrective action, and tank closureand to avoid potential duplication of these requirements within the rule.(See section IV.E.2.c. of this preamble for an explanation of these siteinvestigation requirements.) EPA believes this revised statement of sitecheck responsibilities, in conjunction with the new initial soil managementrequirements, addresses commenters' request for greater clarity concerningtheir investigation responsibilities without unduly restricting alternativeinvestigative techniques. EPA recognizes, however, that the primary hazard posed by contaminatedsoil at some sites will be as a continuing source of ground-water contamination.EPA addresses this concern through the final requirements for site characterizationand for delineating the extent and location of contaminated soils (andSection;andSection;280.63 and 280.65). As discussed later in this preamble, these investigationresults must be considered by the owners and operators and by the implementingagency with respect to site-specific exposure potential and effects onground-water resources. EPA believes that, in some cases, it may be preferableto treat contaminated soil on-site or <T3>in situ. </T3>The Agency is preparing technical information that willhelp owners and operators and implementing agencies assess the potentialhazards posed by contaminated soils and alternative methods to treat ordispose of them. Section 280.62(b) in the final rule states that owners and operators arerequired to report their initial abatement steps to the implementing agencywithin 20 days of release confirmation. Some commenters noted that thistime frame, which was proposed in andSection; 280.61(a)(5), could be interpretedto mean that EPA expected all the abatement measures in proposed andSection;280.61(a) to be completed within 20 days. EPA expects that many of theinitial abatement requirements can and should be completed within 20 days,but that some aspects of soil management and free product investigationsand removal may require more time to complete. EPA has thus amended thewording to clarify that the objective of this provision is to require ownersand operators to report their <T3>progress </T3>to the implementing agency. d. <T3>Initial Site Characterization (andSection; 280.63).</T3> Proposed asandSection; 280.61(b), this requirement has been amended (and renumberedas andSection; 280.63) to clarify the responsibility of owners and operatorsto collect and submit site information to the implementing agency. Severalcommenters noted that the same techniques can be used to confirm a releaseand to investigate contamination at a site. They expressed concern thatimportant information gained while confirming a release or abating immediatehazards should also be included in the information submitted to the implementingagency. Section 280.63 in the final rule emphasizes this point and requiresthat owners and operators submit all pertinent information about the siteand nature of the release.In addition, andSection;andSection; 280.63(a) (1) through (4) in the finalrule describe the minimum site investigation requirements that the ownerand operator must follow in the absence of other direction provided bythe implementing agency. Section 280.63(a)(1) is unchanged from proposal,and it requires information on the nature and estimated quantity of therelease. Section 280.61(a)(2) continues to require owners and operators to submitinformation from readily available sources or site investigations regardingsurrounding populations, subsurface soil conditions, climate, and landuse (e.g., from sources such as U.S. Geological Survey maps, Soil ConservationService maps, and local agencies). UST owners and operators are not automaticallyrequired to conduct surveys to collect this information if it is not alreadyavailable. In addition, two new requirements have been added to this section. First,information about water quality at all wells potentially affected by therelease partially supplants the more general proposed requirement for ground-waterand surface water sampling formerly in andSection; 280.61(b)(3). As discussedin more detail in section IV.C.f. of this preamble_investigation for soiland ground-water cleanup_the proposed requirement to delineate the extentand location of dissolved ground-water contamination has been amended.The final rule requires full characterization of dissolved ground-watercontamination if certain site conditions are met, or at the direction ofthe implementing agency. If nearby existing wells are potentially affected,however, EPA requires the owner and operator to immediately characterizetheir quality and use because they are potential human exposure pointsand because pumping at these wells can affect contaminant migration. Second,several commenters noted that subsurface sewer lines are often conduitsfor rapid migration of vapors or liquid product. Thus, EPA now requiresowners and operators to submit information on the location of subsurfacesewer lines (if any) at the site. Section 280.63(a)(3) cross-references the site investigation requirementsdescribed earlier and requires the owner and operator to submit the resultsof this investigation as part of the site characterization report. Thisnew section replaces proposed andSection; 280.61(b)(2), which required samplingof surface and subsurface soils. As described earlier, this change clarifiesthe investigation requirements and eliminates their possible duplicationwithin the rule. The timing and reporting of this investigation is unchanged.Section 280.63(a)(4) replaces proposed andSection; 280.61(b)(3), which requiredsampling of surface and ground-water at the site. This new section, inconjunction with andSection; 280.65 (described in subsection f., below),reduces the ambiguity noted by some commenters regarding the scope of siteinvestigations. In the final rule, EPA requires characterization of dissolvedground-water contamination when the following conditions exist: There isevidence that drinking water wells have been affected, free product isdetected on the water table or within the aquifer; there is evidence thatcontaminated soil is in contact with ground water; or as directed by theimplementing agency. Thus, the presence or absence of free product at anUST release site is one of the factors used to decide whether further investigationsof soil and ground-water contamination are necessary. The requirement toinvestigate for free product is unchanged from the proposed andSection; 280.61(a)(6).The final rule simply requires owners and operators to submit, as partof the initial site report, their findings that establish the presenceor absence of free product. EPA believes this action is warranted for severalreasons: andbullet; The requirement reinforces for owners and operators the importanceof the free product investigation; andbullet; The free product investigation requirement now also applies toreleases from hazardous substance USTs, which may contain products thatare denser than water and, therefore, may be harder to detect and locate;and andbullet; The conclusion that no free product is found provides anotherimportant consideration for the implementing agency as it decides if acorrective action plan will need to be submitted by the owner and operator.EPA believes this synthesis of information from the initial site investigationis essential for owners and operators to begin to fully assess their cleanupresponsibilities, and it provides the implementing agency with informationto decide if a corrective action plan is necessary. Section 280.63(b) replacesthe proposed requirement for reporting site investigation results. Thenew section clarifies that the information must be submitted in a mannerthat is clear and sufficiently detailed to demonstrate its applicabilityand technical adequacy, or in a format developed by the implementing agencyto achieve these same goals. e. <T3>Free Product Removal (andSection; 280.64).</T3> In response to commenters,EPA has made minor revisions to the free product removal requirements.Commenters raised four issues: Applicability, the definition of free product,the extent of removal, and the timing of removal. These issues are discussedbelow. First, EPA agrees with those commenters who suggested that free productremoval requirements similar to those proposed for petroleum releases shouldalso apply to hazardous substance releases. The final rule's Subpart Fmerges the proposed rule's Subparts F and G to make free product removalrequirements applicable to all releases. Second, EPA has revised the definition of free product to clarify the scopeof free product removal. Several commenters noted that, as proposed, thebroad definition of free product could be interpreted to mean that removalrequirements apply to product bound to soil particles or present as vapors.EPA notes that these forms of product are addressed, as appropriate, inother sections of today's final rule and has revised the definition offree product to more narrowly refer to a regulated substance that is presentas a non-aqueous phase liquid (e.g., not dissolved in water). EPA has alsodeleted the reference to ``floating'' free product (from proposed andSection;280.62) to clarify that product more dense than water is also subject tothe free product removal requirements. Third, other commenters requested clarification on how much free productwas required to be removed. In the final rule, the Agency has retainedthe phrase ``maximum extent practicable'' as the criterion for free productremoval operations at UST release sites. EPA has not specifically definedmaximum practicable removal because the extent of removal is largely determinedby available technologies and site-specific conditions. Consequently, EPAbelieves that implementing agencies should have the discretion to developoperational criteria for determining the presence of free product and theextent of its removal (e.g., product that flows in response to gravityor a minimum product thickness observed in wells). EPA has, however, addedto the final rule a minimum objective for free product removal operations.This new requirement states that, at a minimum, free product removal systemsshould be designed to abate further migration of free product (i.e., beyondsmall seasonal or recovery-related fluctuations). Fourth, several commenters offered their views about the appropriate timingof product removal. Most commenters agreed with EPA's proposal that freeproduct removal operations should begin as quickly as possible, but cautionedthat hasty and improperly conducted removal could spread contaminationvertically at the site. In the final rule, EPA continues to require thatremoval begin as quickly as practicable (andSection; 280.62(a)(6)). RevisedandSection; 280.64(a) emphasizes, however, that free product removal mustbe conducted in a manner that minimizes the spread of contamination andthat is appropriate to the hydrogeologic conditions at the site. EPA isaware, for example, of site conditions where trenching or vapor extractionto recover free product would be preferable to drawing down the water table_andthe free product plume_in order to collect and remove free product. EPAis preparing technical resource documents to assist implementing agenciesin advising owners and operators about potential complications when removingfree product. Similarly, in response to commenters concerns, EPA has extendedthe time period for owners and operators to report to implementing agenciesconcerning their free product removal from 30 to 45 days. This change willallow owners and operators more time to properly plan for free productremoval, especially for removal operations involving dense product or athydrogeologically complex sites. In addition, some commenters requested EPA clarify permitting requirementsfor discharges from the product recovery system. Others suggested thatEPA exempt UST cleanups from NPDES requirements or establish numericallimits for emergency permits. In response, EPA has revised andSection; 280.64(a)to clarify that all discharges are to be properly treated, in compliancewith applicable Federal, state and local regulations. In addition, EPAis investigating methods to expedite, where applicable, the NPDES permittingprocess for discharges necessitated by UST corrective action. f. <T3>Investigations for Soil and Ground-Water Cleanup (andSection; 280.65).</T3>Proposed andSection; 280.63 has been renumbered andSection; 280.65 in the finalrule. As proposed, this section required the owner and operator to investigatethe extent of soil and ground-water contamination at an UST release sitewhen the initial site investigation showed that contaminated soil remainedat the site, or when the required soil removal showed that the releasedproduct or product from contaminated soil may have reached ground-water.In addition, the implementing agency could direct the owner and operatorto conduct such an investigation. Several commenters requested that EPA clarify the minimum sampling requirementsfor these investigations. Other commenters suggested that these more extensiveinvestigations be better coordinated with the soil and ground-water samplingrequired earlier in the corrective action process. One commenter notedthat the phrase ``product from contaminated soil'' would be difficult todefine and might be interpreted to require extensive investigation at virtuallyall sites. In addition, EPA recognizes that some amount of contaminatedsoil will be present at most UST release sites, but that the threat posedby this contamination will depend on several factors. In response to these comments, EPA has revised this section to clarifythe situations that trigger more extensive site investigations. EPA notesthat the objective of these investigations is to support decisions concerningwhether soil and ground-water cleanup or other corrective action measuresare necessary at the site. Consequently, EPA has revised the rule to betterrelate these requirements to site-specific threats to ground-water contamination.Final andSection; 280.65 describes three specific site circumstances requiringfull for characterization of soil and ground-water contamination: (1) Whenrelease confirmation or previous corrective action measures indicate thatground-water wells may have been affected by the release, (2) when freeproduct is found on the water table or within the aquifer, and (3) whenany other site investigations show that contaminated soil may be in contactwith ground water. EPA recognizes that characterization of soil and ground-water contaminationmay also be necessary at sites where there are no ``automatic triggers.''Thus, the final rule retains the authority of the implementing agency torequest an investigation. Final andSection; 280.65(a)(4) clarifies that theimplementing agency should consider the potential effects of contaminationat the site in relation to nearby surface and ground-water resources whendeciding whether further investigations are warranted. In particular, EPAexpects that information required under andSection; 280.63 will provide implementingagencies with important information for determining if more extensive investigationsare required. In revising the rule, EPA sought to better tailor the investigation requirementsto site conditions that pose a potential threat to ground-water resources.EPA believes the final rule clarifies those situations that trigger moreextensive site investigations and better coordinates the objectives ofthe revised corrective action requirements within a site-specific framework.g. <T3>Corrective Action Plan (andSection; 280.66).</T3> In the final rule,proposed andSection; 280.64 has been renumbered as andSection; 280.66 and retitledas ``Corrective Action Plan.'' This revised section responds to commenters'requests for clarification of the owners' and operators' responsibilitiesfor submitting corrective action plans (CAPs) and of the implementing agencies'responsibility to request, review, and approve a CAP. Subtitle I of RCRAdirects the Agency to promulgate corrective action regulations applicableto owners' and operators' of UST systems. The corrective action plan approvalprocess, however, integrates the responsibility of owners and operatorsto ameliorate the adverse effects of UST releases with the responsibilityof implementing agencies to determine how they will carry out their establishedpublic health policies. EPA's role is to: (1) Establish the responsibilityof owners and operators to achieve adequate protection of human health,and (2) establish a baseline framework for evaluating and approving correctiveaction plans. Several commenters requested clarification of the owners' and operators'responsibilities for corrective action beyond immediate abatement stepsand removal of free product. In response, andSection; 280.66(a) of the finalrule has been revised to clarify that owners and operators are responsiblefor submitting, when requested by the implementing agency, a correctiveaction plan that provides for adequate protection of human health and theenvironment. Section 280.66(b) of the final rule sets forth the factorsthat implementing agencies must consider when approving a corrective actionplan. Consequently, this section also serves to inform owners and operatorsof the minimum elements required in the plans they submit. Some commenters suggested the Agency establish explicit criteria that implementingagencies could use to determine whether a CAP is needed and to evaluateCAPs after they are submitted. As described in the preceding sections,EPA has revised several parts of the proposed rule to clarify the objectivesof each step of the corrective action process. Owners and operators areresponsible for carrying out and reporting these actions, thus providingthe implementing agency with a good basis for determining the necessityfor additional cleanup. EPA believes it would be difficult and unproductive to incorporate moreexplicit evaluation criteria in today's rule. As described earlier in thispreamble, EPA received wide support for the proposed site-specific correctiveaction goals and has retained this approach in the final rule. Implementingagencies, however, may choose to develop their own site-specific correctiveaction goals, or they may base cleanup goals on statewide numerical standardsor aquifer characteristics. Rather than develop criteria that may conflictwith a state or local agency's preferred method, EPA has chosen to identifyin the rule those factors that are generally necessary for carrying outcorrective actions regardless of the chosen method for setting precisecleanup goals. For example, these factors include the persistence of thereleased substance and the hydrogeologic conditions at the site. EPA seesits role primarily as providing technical support for interpreting thesefactors in the context of site-specific application of corrective actiontechnologies. In particular, EPA is developing technical information andsupporting materials to assist implementing agencies in relating site assessmentresults to the feasibility of alternative technologies, and for evaluatinghow well these technologies are achieving cleanup at a site. In addition,EPA is beginning to develop methods to expedite exposure assessments. Otherprograms within EPA, such as the Office of Ground-water Protection, mayalso be called upon to provide support for evaluating ground-water resources.The overall objective of longer term UST corrective actions is to adequatelyprotect human health, safety, and the environment from contaminants remainingin soils or ground water after initial abatement measures and free productremoval. The Agency prefers that this objective be achieved, where practicable,through reducing contaminant concentrations in soil or ground water tolevels protective of health and the environment. In some situations, however,the Agency would require_under the standard in andSection; 280.66(a)_thathuman health be protected from exposure to contaminants through other appropriatemeasures, such as providing an alternative water supply. EPA cannot project the outcome of its site-specific approach to all USTreleases because the consideration accorded to some factors, such as aquiferresource value and its current and potential use, is largely left to stateand local policy. If an UST release affects a public or private drinkingwater source, however, the owner and operator must expect that the state'shealth-based drinking water standards would apply to the cleanup. If theowner and operator cannot meet these standards through cleanup technologies,then they should expect that they will be required to provide an alternatesource of drinking water or to provide treatment of the water to the peopleaffected. Similarly, the owner and operator should expect that UST releasesthat threaten current or potential water supplies will come under closescrutiny by the implementing agency. In these cases, the corrective actionrequirements will likely be influenced by the mobility of the contaminantsat the site and the estimated time and spatial extent over which the remainingcontamination may pose a threat. At a minimum, approved CAPs would likelyinclude requirements for long-term monitoring, continued control of ground-waterflow at the site, and notice of continuing hazard in the property deed.The final rule retains the implementing agency's authority to require submissionof a CAP based on information received from early corrective action measures.(EPA expects, for example, that implementing agencies might choose thisoption for UST releases that are of great magnitude or in close proximityto drinking water resources.) Final andSection; 280.66(a), however, has beenrevised to make clear that the implementing agency must first review thesubmitted material before requesting the submission of a CAP or additionalinformation. This section also has been revised to enable owners and operatorsto submit a CAP for soil and ground-water cleanup based on their own initiativeand assessment of the severity of the release. They need not wait for theimplementing agency to request a CAP. Several commenters expressed concern that lengthy reviews by the implementingagency might slow the pace of UST cleanups, creating delays that couldmake implementing the final CAP more difficult, because of the spread ofcontamination while delays persist. Some commenters also suggested thatowners and operators should be allowed_after a specified length of time_tointerpret inaction on the part of the implementing agency as approval ofthe CAP.Given the number of releases that are expected to be detected in the nearfuture, EPA acknowledges that there is potential for delayed cleanups underthe proposed approach if implementing agencies are unable to review allthe CAPs in a timely manner. The Agency concluded, however, that the alternativessuggested by commenters were inappropriate. To respond to this issue, however,andSection; 280.66(d) has been added to allow owners and operators to begincleanup of soil and dissolved contaminants in ground water without CAPapproval provided they: (1) First notify the implementing agency of theirintention to begin cleanup, (2) comply with modifications imposed by theimplementing agency, including halting cleanup activities, and (3) incorporatethese initial measures in the CAP to be reviewed and approved by the implementingagency. EPA has added this provision with the goal of encouraging effective andexpedited cleanup of soil and ground water. EPA emphasizes, however, thatthe implementing agencies remain the final arbiter for approving CAPs.Implementing agencies, therefore, can require the owner and operator torevise their CAPs and to modify the cleanup techniques in use at a site,including mitigating adverse consequences of cleanup activities. Sincethe implementing agency retains this authority, EPA expects that ownersand operators who choose to initiate cleanup prior to approval of thisCAP will select cleanup technologies that are widely used and recognizedto be effective. EPA believes some cleanup techniques, such as extractionand treatment of petroleum vapors from soils, can be initiated with littlerisk of worsening contamination at the site. EPA also notes that statesneed not adopt the policy of owner- and operator-initiated cleanup forstate program approval. Moreover, if states choose this option they cantailor its use to best meet their needs. For example, the implementingagency can identify specific cleanup technologies that are widely applicablewithout prior review or approval and those that always require explicitplan approval. Similarly, implementing agencies can decide to limit thisoption for use only at releases from certain USTs, such as petroleum USTs.h. <T3>Reporting (Proposed andSection; 280.65).</T3> The reporting requirementsin this section of the proposed rule have been consolidated with the requirementsin andSection; 280.51 of the final rule because they are part of the releaseconfirmation process. i. <T3>Public Participation (andSection; 280.67).</T3> The proposed public participationrule required implementing agencies to provide opportunity for public reviewand comment on all CAPs and to consider these comments before approvingCAPs. Although commenters agreed that public participation is desirable, manycommenters expressed concern that protracted public participation duringthe development of <T3>all </T3>CAPs could unnecessarily delay some UST cleanups. For example,cleanup efforts could be delayed while the development of a CAP was submittedto lengthy public review and deliberation. Also, mandating public participationfor all CAPs could divert implementing agency resources from other cleanupactivities such as oversight of ongoing cleanup operations. EPA agrees with commenters who urged that implementing agencies strikea balance between the involvement of the public in corrective action decisionsand the sometimes competing need to protect human health and the environmentthrough quick and effective responses to an UST release. To acknowledgethese sometimes conflicting objectives, the final rule for public participationestablishes a flexible approach that ensures public access to availableinformation on UST cleanups, although the public need not be involved,as a matter of routine, in all CAPs. Implementing agencies continue, however, to have the responsibility andauthority to notify the public about CAPs, to provide public access tothe site and cleanup files, and to involve the public in meetings if sufficientinterest is demonstrated. The final rule's public participation requirementsfor UST corrective action stress the need for adequate public notice, particularlyto those parties who could be directly affected by the release and theplanned corrective action. EPA expects that the public will be providedadequate opportunity to participate in and aid the UST cleanup process.EPA does not agree with those commenters who opposed including any publicparticipation requirements in the UST corrective action rule. In particular,EPA does not agree with the concerns raised that RCRA does not explicitlyrequire public participation under Subtitle I. EPA believes that section7004 of RCRA specifically mandates that all of the Agency's RCRA programsprovide for the opportunity for public participation, including the RCRASubtitle I program. This statutory mandate, combined with long-standingEPA policies to involve the public in the cleanup of contaminated sites,has prompted EPA's decision to keep the public participation requirementsin Subpart F. In meeting this need, however, EPA has intended to requirepublic notice and participation in UST corrective actions in a form thatdoes not unnecessarily disrupt what state UST programs already requireand provide. The final rule requires public notification and public availability ofinformation on CAPs. The implementing agency must notify the public abouteach confirmed release requiring a CAP. This notification requirement remainsas proposed, although the rule no longer mandates implementing agenciesto formally consider and respond to public comment before approving a CAP.The implementing agency must also provide public notice if implementationof the CAP does not achieve the established cleanup levels and the implementingagency is considering terminating the CAP. In most states, those affectedby the release are often kept well informed through personal contacts withthe state response staff. Today's requirements are not intended to changethis practice of personal contact as one of the first points of publicnotice in the existing state UST programs. This method of notice has beenadded to the rule to make this clear. The list of public notice vehiclescontained in the rule, however, is not intended to be exhaustive. In addition to this notification requirement, the final rule requires theimplementing agency to provide public access to site release informationand decisions concerning the CAP. By providing public notification andaccess to information, implementing agncies ensure the opportunity forpublic participation in specific CAPs of interest to the affected sectorsof the public. Because the Agency considers public notification and publicaccess to information to be the key components of public participationfor all CAPs, the final rule emphasizes the importance of these two requirements.The implementing agency may hold a public meeting to consider public commentson a CAP if sufficient public interest is shown concerning a proposed CAP.EPA uses the phrase ``public meeting'' in the rule to emphasize that aformal public hearing is not required. EPA intends that a public forumbe provided, in keeping with the state's administrative procedures, toinform the public and allow public comment on a CAP. The implementing agencywill decide when public meetings are warranted on a case-by-case basis.EPA expects that large releases involving extensive corrective action willinclude correspondingly more extensive public participation because publicunderstanding and acceptance is critical to the success of these CAPs.In summary, the final rule emphasizes the implementing agency's responsibilityto involve the public in a manner that best serves the environmental goalsof the CAP.G. Out-Of-Service UST Systems and Closures <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction </ITAG>As discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule, the principal objectiveof the UST system closure requirements is to identify and contain existingcontamination and to prevent future releases from UST systems no longerin service (52 FR 12757). Available information suggested that UST systemsimproperly closed in the past have had undetected releases that later requiredcorrective action. More of these systems may be found to have leaked and,in the future, require additional corrective action. Because a large numberof existing UST systems are expected to close in the next 5 to 10 years,EPA believes that it is particularly important to require proper managementprocedures for out-of-service UST systems so that contamination due toimproperly closed UST systems can be prevented from posing a threat ofadditional releases in the future and needed corrective action can be identifiedand taken. The comments on the proposal generally acknowledged that properclosure is an important aspect of sound UST management. The closure procedures are covered in andSection;andSection; 280.70 through280.74 of the final rule. Section 280.70 describes the requirements thatmust be complied with at all UST systems temporarily closed for less than12 months. It also requires tanks that do not meet requirements for newor upgraded USTs, and that are taken out of service for 12 months or longer,to permanently close. Those USTs that do meet requirements for new or upgradedUSTs can remain indefinitly out of service. Section 280.71 provides requirementsfor permanently closing or changing the service of an UST system, includingidentification of alternative methods for permanent closure and proceduresfor continuing the service life of an UST system when it is to be usedfor the storage of non-regulated substances. Section 280.72 describes therequirements for assessing the UST system excavation zone at closure. Section280.73 requires owners and operators to apply the permanent closure andsite assessment requirements of the final rules to UST systems taken outof service before the effective date of the regulations, if so directedby the implementing agency. Section 280.74 lists the recordkeeping requirements.These proposed requirements, highlights of public comments on them, andthe Agency's approach to the final UST system closure standards are discussedin more detail below. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Temporary Closure (andSection; 280.70) </ITAG>To prevent owners and operators from improperly closing UST systems inthe future, EPA proposed requirements in andSection; 280.80 (a)-(b) for tankstemporarily taken out of service for up to 24 months. These provisionsonly covered UST systems when a regulated substance was left in the tankand did not distinguish between unprotected tanks and protected tanks thatmet the requirements for new or upgraded UST systems. The applicability of these requirements depends upon what constitutes temporaryclosure. Although a number of suggestions were received, generally commentersrecommended defining temporarily closed based on both the use of the tankand how frequently regulated substances are typically moved through it.The failure to fill and/or take regulated substances from a tank on a regularbasis, however, was not always considered to be a reasonable criterionfor determining the tank was temporarily closed. Commenters cited severalexamples of infrequently used tanks where temporary closure was not appropriate,including emergency generator tanks and backup system tanks from whichfuels were not typically dispensed for long periods of time. The Agency believes that owners and operators will generally pay more attentionto tanks that are used frequently than to those that are used only occasionallyor are temporarily closed. Thus, the operation and maintenance proceduresused to ensure the integrity of a tank and the effectiveness of releasedetection efforts instituted to identify leaks in and around a tank willbe somewhat related to whether the tank is being actively used or not.Other possible factors in determining whether a tank is temporarily closedinclude adherence to the normal operation and maintenance procedures atthe facility, the types and amounts of regulated substances stored at thefacility, the likelihood that an undetected leak has occurred or may occurin the future, and the potential that the tank has become a receptaclefor illegal dumping. The Agency does not intend that the emergency generatorand backup fuel system tanks cited by commenters should be subject to automaticclosure requirements merely because regulated substances are not movedthrough the tanks on a regular or frequent basis. If, however, the infrequentuse of such a tank cannot be justified as part of its purpose and/or ifthe operation, maintenance, or release detection procedures associatedwith the tank are inadequate or inconsistent with the monitoring proceduresrequired for operating tanks, the tank will be considered temporarily closedand, after 12 months is up, subject to permanent closure requirements inaccordance with andSection; 280.70(c) of the final rule. Several commenters pointed out that proposed andSection; 280.80 (a)-(b),which covered temporary removal from use and temporary closure, only appliedat tanks where the regulated substances were left in the tank. As a result,if the regulated substances were removed from the tank, the proposed ruleappeared to exclude UST systems from the further application of the temporaryclosure provisions. EPA intended, however, that the closure requirementsshould be applicable to all UST systems that are taken out of service regardlessof the quantity of regulated substance remaining in the tank. The Agencyalso believes that continuation of release detection is not necessary whenthe regulated substances and residual material have been adequately removedfrom the UST system. Therefore, the revisions to andSection; 280.70(a) ofthe final rule subject tanks from which the regulated substances have beenremoved to the temporary closure provisions, but allows the owner or operatorto discontinue release detection as long as the UST system is completelyempty. The final rule also does not contain a requirement to test the integrityof a temporarily closed tank before refilling, although several commenterssuggested that such a test should be conducted before materials are reintroducedinto an empty tank. EPA does not agree that such a requirement would providesignificant benefits. There is no evidence that empty tanks are more vulnerableto structural failure than filled tanks. In addition, the Agency believesthat the release detection standards set forth in the final rule are sufficientto rapidly detect any leaks or structural failures that may occur oncethe system is brought back into service.Several commenters requested guidelines for determining when an adequateamount of the regulated substance has been removed from a tank to precludethe tank from the temporary closure requirements. In response to thesecomments, the final rule makes it clear all tanks that contained a regulatedsubstance are subject to the temporary closure requirements regardlessof the amount of material remaining in the tank when it is taken out ofservice. If the tank is empty, however, the owner and operator are notrequired to maintain release detection around the tank. The term ``empty''is defined by incorporating the definition of ``empty container'' set forthin EPA regulations under Subtitle C of RCRA. This definition requires allmaterials to be removed that can be removed using commonly employed practices.No more than 2.5 centimeters (one inch) of residue or 0.3 percent by weightof the total capacity of the tank can remain in the system. EPA believesthat this definition is adequate to ensure that the regulated substancesremaining in the tank will not pose an unreasonable risk to human healthand the environment if a release occurs during the temporary closure period.To prevent owners and operators from indefinitely postponing permanentclosure, EPA proposed in andSection; 280.80(c) that all tanks be closed thathad been out of service for more than 24 months. This period was considereda reasonable time for tank owners and operators to decide whether to permanentlyclose or continue the use of a tank. The period recommended to be allowedfor temporary closure by commenters varied greatly. Commenters cited numerouscases where mandatory permanent closure after 24 months of temporary closurewas neither appropriate nor justified. Most state regulatory authoritiescommenting on this proposal recommended a shorter temporary closure period.One of the principal reasons cited by the commenters recommending extendingthe temporary closure period was that tanks in compliance with the appropriatecorrosion protection and leak detection procedures do not pose a significantthreat of future releases. The commenters also argued that the permanentclosure of such tanks would create an economic hardship without providingany significant environmental benefit. EPA agrees with these commentersthat UST systems that are adequately protected from corrosion and equippedwith release detection systems pose a significantly lower threat to humanhealth and the environment than unprotected tanks. This conclusion is alsoconsistent with the comments submitted by state regulatory authoritiesthat recommended a reduction of the closure period. Their recommendationsare believed to stem primarily from the states' experience with unprotected,bare steel tanks and, consequently, strongly suggest that significant damageto the public health and the environment could occur if unprotected tanksare allowed to temporarily close and are left unattended for long periodsof time. Therefore, andSection; 280.70(c) in the final rule reduces the allowedperiod for temporary closure of unprotected tanks from 24 months to 12months. Any temporarily closed UST systems that do not comply with theperformance standards for new tanks under andSection; 280.20 or the upgraderequirements for existing tanks under andSection; 280.21 must permanentlyclose after the 12 month temporary closure period ends. However, UST systemsthat comply with the performance standards for new or upgraded UST systemsset forth in the final rule may remain out of service indefinitely so longas they remain in compliance with the operation, maintenance, and releasedetection requirements of the final rule. Since spilling and overfillingassociated with product transfer should not be a problem around tanks thathave been temporarily closed, UST systems are not required to satisfy thespill and overfill requirements for new and upgraded systems in order tobe excluded from the 12 month permanent/closure provisions in the finalrule. Many commenters also believed that owners and operators should have a mechanismfor seeking and obtaining an extension of the temporary closure period(to avoid the permanent closure requirements) on a case-by-case basis.These comments pointed out that the automatic permanent closure of certaintypes of tanks was not appropriate after 12 or 24 months (for example,where nearby road construction has temporarily closed the business usingthe tanks). In response to these comments, a provision has been incorporatedallowing the implementing agency to approve an extension of the temporaryclosure period to address situations where permanent closure of an unprotectedUST system is not appropriate after 12 months. To ensure that the varianceprocess is not used to postpone corrective action activities, however,the owner or operator must complete a site assessment before the extensioncan be applied for. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Permanent Closure (andSection; 280.71) </ITAG>The proposed rule required the owner or operator of an UST to notify theimplementing agency and assess the excavation zone at least 30 days beforepermanent closure. Several of the commenters argued that completion ofthe site assessment at least 30 days prior to permanent closure was notalways appropriate, for example, in cases where a tank is to be closedby removal or when closure is part of a corrective action. In responseto these valid comments, andSection; 280.71(a) of the final rule has beenrevised to allow more flexibility by requiring the owner or operator toconduct an excavation zone assessment after notifying the implementingagency but before completion of permanent closure. The final requirementscontinue to require notification at least 30 days before completion ofpremanent closure. To avoid any potential conflict between the notificationrequirements of this section and the response requirements under the correctiveaction provisions, closures initiated as a result of corrective actionsunder Subpart F are not subject to the notification requirements in andSection;280.71(a) because the implementing agency will have already been notifiedas part of the corrective action activities. The methods for permanent closure were proposed in andSection; 280.80(f)and the revised methods are set forth in andSection; 280.71(b) in the finalrule. Emptying the tank by removal or filling with an inert solid materialwas a prerequisite for permanent closure under the proposed rule. The term``empty,'' however, was not defined in the proposed rule. In response tothose commenters who argued that the amount of residual materials remainingin the tank system must be defined in order to minimize any future threatto human health or the environment, the final rule requires the tank tobe ``emptied and cleaned by removing all liquids and accumulated sludges.''In accordance with EPA's effort to build upon accepted industry consensuscodes, a note following final andSection; 280.71(c) identifies API 1604 andAPI 1631 as guidance on cleaning and closure procedures that may be usedto comply with these requirements. EPA believes that following these codesconcerning the removal of regulated substances and cleaning of tanks beforepermanent closure will ensure human health and the environment are protected.These codes also address the concerns expressed by a number of commentersregarding the disposal and reuse of tanks that have been removed from theground. Although not mandated in the final rules, adherence to the guidancein these codes concerning these activities will ensure the safe handlingof tanks and will minimize the risk of releases during closure.The note following andSection; 280.71(c) also contains a reference to thecriteria issued by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.These criteria provide guidance concerning the prevention of deaths andinjuries to workers involved in the assessment, decontamination, and cleanupof spills and leaks around underground storage tanks. EPA suggests thiscode is particularly important to consider in the closure of hazardoussubstance tanks. The final rule continues to allow owners and operators to permanently closetanks by either removing the tank from the ground or filling the tank withan inert solid material. Several commenters recommended that the rule requireremoval except when the tank is located under or immediately adjacent toother structures. Their concerns focused upon the potential for releasesof residual materials remaining in a tank after it is filled with inertfill and left in place. EPA believes, however, that the final requirementconcerning the removal of all liquids and accumulated sludges from thetank (required by andSection; 280.71(b)) and use of the procedures outlinedin API 1604 and API 1631 will adequately prevent the future release ofresidual material after a tank is filled. Therefore, the final rule allowseither method of permanent closure. Several commenters recommended further clarification of the meaning of``inert solid material.'' The Agency believes that permanent closure in-placewill adequately minimize the likelihood of future releases only if theinert fill material specifications and fill procedures used at closureare adequate to prevent the tank from surfacing after closure, will supportthe structural integrity of the tank as it deteriorates over time (to avoidcave-ins), and will completely seal the tank and associated piping fromfuture use as a tank system. However, the Agency has decided to not specifyin detail the materials for filling a tank because of the numerous choicesavailable and the special considerations and problems inherent in each.Sand or concrete, for example, may restrict future construction activitieson the site, or may complicate future removal and corrective action activitiesaround the tank. EPA believes that such decisions should be left to theowner and operator to make on a site-specific basis. EPA also agrees with the commenters who argued that the permanent closurerequirements set forth in the proposed rule precluded the reuse of USTsystems for unregulated substances. As a result, sound tanks could be forceablydiscarded even though this would serve no environmental purpose. Therefore,final andSection; 280.71(c) gives owners or operators a third method of closingan UST system. This method allows the owner or operator to complete a change-in-service,which will allow the tank to be used to store non-regulated substances.To complete a change-in-service and avoid the other requirements underpermanent closure, the implementing agency must be notified at least 30days before the change-in-service is completed, and the tank must be cleanedand emptied by removing all liquids and accumulated sludges. In addition,the owner and operator must assess the site in accordance with andSection;280.72. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Assessing the Site at Closure (andSection; 280.72) </ITAG>The requirements for assessing the excavation zone around an UST systemwere proposed in andSection; 280.80(d). Several assessment methods were listedfor satisfying these requirements, including the use of external monitoringrelease detection methods allowed under andSection; 280.41. Several commentersquestioned the applicability of one or more of these methods in certainsite-specific situations. Some commenters suggested that other equallyeffective, methods may be appropriate, including internal release detectionmonitoring. It was also suggested that the nature and extent of the excavationzone assessment should take into consideration various site-specific factors,many of which focused upon whether the tank is closed by removal or byclosure in place. The final rule, as set forth in andSection; 280.72, specifies minimum requirementsnecessary to adequately characterize the presence of contamination whereit is most likely to be present at the UST site. All of the methods listedin the proposed rule have been deleted except the use of external monitoringrelease detection methods, which continue to be allowed if they are operatedin accordance with the final andSection; 280.43 requirements at the timeof closure. Some of the other methods suggested by commenters, such asinternal release detection monitoring, were not incorporated into the finalrule because they do not monitor the condition of the environment outsidethe tank. EPA remains convinced that this is an important last step beforepermanent closure is complete to ensure prior releases are not missed orignored at closure like they have been in the past. Minimum assessment standards have been set forth in the final rule to coincidewith the requirements set forth in Subparts E and F. These standards aredesigned to ensure that assessment information is representative of thesite's condition and is obtained before closure. In order to be representative,the measurement methodology selected by the owner or operator must takeinto consideration factors such as the nature of the stored substance,type of backfill used around the tank, and the depth to ground water. Anyother factors must be considered that may be appropriate for identifyingthe presence and source of contamination from the UST system. For example,soil gas sampling could be used if the regulated substance contains compoundsthat are highly volatile and if the local geology and hydrology do notsignificantly restrict the movement of the volatilized organic species.However, if the regulated substance consists primarily of heavier hydrocarbonsand, as a result, the concentration of vapors in the soil is expected tobe very low, soil sampling may be needed to provide the necessary representativeanalytical results. The site assessment methodology used by the owner and operator must alsoconsider the method of closure. The two allowed tank closure methods maybe treated differently because tanks that are removed from the ground enablethe bottom of the excavation to be visually inspected. A visual inspectionof the tank and excavation zone should provide sufficient information fordetermining if and where the substances stored in the tank have leakedinto the subsurface soil. Using this information, a variety of samplingmethods may be adequate to make an initial determination of the presenceof contamination and the need for corrective action. On the other hand, the presence and size of leaks from tanks that are closedin place cannot be visually determined and, consequently, a more comprehensiveassessment is necessary. Therefore, several measurement methods may berequired to determine if contamination is present around the tank. Forexample, soil gas samples may be used to help identify where soil samplesshould be taken. EPA believes that these changes will give the implementingagency greater flexibility to consider a variety of site-specific factorsin defining the nature and extent of an assessment. For example, althoughEPA believes that samples taken below an UST system will generally providethe most representative results, the final rule would allow samples tobe taken at any depth or location. However, a state inspection may determinethat soil samples taken from the backfill surrounding a tank or soil gassamples taken at depths where significant volatilization has occurred maynot be representative and additional testing could be required. The proposed rule in andSection; 280.80(e) required the owner and operatorto comply with the corrective action requirements if a release was discoveredas a result of the activities conducted under any of the closure provisionsor by any other manner. As a result of comments that emphasized the interrelationshipbetween the corrective action provisions and the closure requirements,the Agency believes that the criteria for initiating corrective actionduring closure activities should be the same as the criteria for initiatingcorrective action at any other time during the operational life of an USTsystem. The final rule sets forth these criteria in andSection; 280.72(b).<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Applicability to Previously Closed UST Systems (andSection; 280.73)</ITAG>To address contamination threats expected to result from past closure practices,EPA proposed in andSection; 280.80(d) that UST systems not properly closedin accordance with recommended industry practices before the effectivedate of the final regulation be revisited and properly closed. The closureactivities were to include a site assessment of the UST system, and notificationto the implementing agency. In addition, EPA proposed in this subsectionto exept tanks that were previously closed in accordance with one of theexisting industry consensus codes from these sites assessment requirements.The Agency specifically requested comments on these previsions in the proposal.EPA proposed to apply the closure rules retroactively, recognizing thatsignificant manpower and cost could be required to locate all previouslyabandoned tanks and to conduct site assessments. To reduce this burdenand focus only upon abandoned tanks that possed the greatest potentialof leaking in the future, the proposed provisions were limited to tanksthat had not been properly closed pursuant to one of the industry consensuscodes in existence at the time. Those consensus codes were believed torequire only removal of the product stored in the tank.Upon review of numerous public comments received on this approach, it appearsthat the procedures used to close most abandoned tanks have not been welldocumented in the past, making it difficult to determine what constitutedcompliance with this requirement and whether a tank was properly closed.Moreover, several commenters argued that previous industry consensus codeswere not designed to ensure containment of the material in the abandonedtank and may have actually facilitated early releases due to the practiceof punching holes in the bottom of the tank. Thus, the commenters suggestedthat tank systems closed by using practices considered state-of-the-artat the time were just as likely to leak as those that were improperly closed.It was also noted by several commenters that the retroactive applicationof the closure provisions and imposition of site assessment requirementsupon owners and operators of abandoned tanks would be costly to implementand would require the commitment of significant resources by the implementingagencies to track down and enforce. EPA now believes that many of the concerns raised by commenters are probablywell founded if the requirements were applied to <T3>all </T3>USTs closed before the effective date of the regulations.Such a ``broad brush'' approach would be very difficult, if not impossible,to enforce because of significant problems in locating the large numberof tanks abandoned in the past, in identifying previous owners and operators,and in properly apportioning responsibility for the site assessment andclosure activities. As noted earlier, the lack of documentation would alsomake it difficult for the implementing agencies to determine if a tankhad been ``properly closed.'' EPA continues to believe, however, that a number of previously abandonedUST systems still contain regulated substances or may pose a threat tohuman health and the environment. As discussed in the preamble of the April17 proposal, state UST program incident reports examined by EPA revealedapproximately 300 releases reported between 1970 and 1984 that implicatedabandoned UST systems. In addition, EPA expects more releases from thenumerous operating USTs closed before the effective date of the notificationrequirements (May 8, 1986) and before the effective date of today's regulations.Because there is a reasonable probability that releases from such tanksmay pose a threat to human health and the environment, the applicationof the closure provisions to these tanks, and in particular the site assessmentrequirements, may be necessary and appropriate. EPA now believes that for tanks closed or abandoned before the effectivedate of today's regulations, the closure provisions should only be appliedselectively under the discretionary authority of the implementing agency.These agencies are in the best position to identify abandoned tanks thatmay have been improperly closed, and to gauge the nature and extent ofthe threat posed by those tanks. They are also better able to identifythe responsible owners and define the appropriate site assessment techniques.This approach is intended to enable the implementing agencies to effectivelyallocate their resources and only focus upon abandoned tanks that are suspectedof posing potentially significant problems. This revised approach alsoreduces the unnecessary burden upon owners and operators of the discoveredabandoned tanks by eliminating the requirement for them to revisit andconduct a site assessment at all tanks that have been previously closed,and removes the uncertainty associated with the ``improper closure'' standard.Therefore, the final rule deletes the proposed requirement to conduct siteassessments at all tanks improperly closed before the effective date ofthe final regulations. The final rule, however, requires owners and operatorsof abandoned tanks to comply with the closure provisions if so directedby the implementing agency when it determines there is a reasonable probabilitythat the tank poses a potential threat to human health and the environmenteither now or in the future. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Closure Records (andSection; 280.74) </ITAG>The recordkeeping requirements associated with closure were set forth inandSection; 280.80(g) of the proposed rule. These requirements have beenreorganized in the final rule in andSection; 280.74 but have not been significantlychanged. The principal change was the elimination of the reference to andSection;280.43 concerning the maintenance of release detection records. Becausethese requirements are in andSection; 280.70(a) of the final rule throughthe reference to Subpart D, and are thereby made applicable to all out-of-serviceand closed UST systems, repetition of the reference is not considered necessary.H. Analysis of Other Significant Comments <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Reliance on Codes Developed by Nationally Recognized Organizations</ITAG>As described in the preamble to the proposed rule (52 FR 12696), the regulationsrequired that all UST systems be designed, constructed, and protected fromcorrosion in accordance with a code of practice developed by a nationallyrecognized association or independent testing laboratory. In today's finalregulations, the Agency has also included the use of industry codes forother technical sections of the rule (such as upgrading and repair of existingUSTs). The Agency has noted throughout today's final technical regulationsspecific codes of practice that have or may be developed. EPA did not receive any comments that were against or critical of the useof industry codes. One commenter did express the need for public inputduring the development of Federal technical regulations. The Agency agreesthat public participation is necessary for the development of sound industrycodes and practices. In fact, the Agency wants to expand the use of andreliance on industry codes in order to provide a means for improving existingmethods or developing alternative methods of UST system management. EPAdoes not intend to adopt inadequate codes but wants to provide a flexibleapproach to codemaking by relying on nationally recognized organizationsto develop new and improved codes and practices through a public process.EPA is today clarifying this issue to alleviate any future misunderstandings.EPA interprets a ``nationally recognized organization'' to mean a technicalor professional organization that has issued standards formed by the consensusof its members. The organization should ensure consideration of all relevantviewpoints and interests, including those of consumers and future or existingand potential industry participants, and the resulting standards shouldbe widely accepted and technically sound. Thus, any code developed by anorganization should be based upon a broad range of technical information,and performance crtieria should be central elements of the resulting standards.EPA believes that the following organizations, which have codes and standardsreferenced in today's regulations, are examples of ``nationally recognizedorganizations'':<ITAG tagnum="26">American Petroleum Institute (API) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Association of Composite Tanks (ACT) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">National Leak Prevention Association (NLPA) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Petroleum Equipment Institute (PEI) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Steel Tank Institute (STI) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Underwriters Laboratory (UL)</ITAG>Other similar organizations may also be considered ``nationally recognized.''The final rule does not require the use of a particular issue of any code.The consensus codes are frequently revised and updated. The Agency believesthat requiring the use of ``the most recent edition'' would cause undueconfusion in the regulated community. For example, a facility may be installedin accordance with codes that are current at the time but may not havethe equipment that meets the codes that are current 10 years later. EPAhas concluded that the industry codes that are in effect at the date ofpublication of the final rule are protective of human health and the environment.The use of future editions of the codes in place of the editions that arenow in effect is not required, but is encouraged as the updated codes willprobably provide for newer, more effective technologies and practices.The use of past codes that have been replaced by new editions by the effectivedate of this rule is not allowed because some past recommended industrypractices were not fully protective of human health and the environment.The Office of Management and Budget has discussed regulatory codes andstandards (OMB Circular A119, dated October 26, 1982). OMB encourages thereliance on voluntary standards, commonly referred to as industry standardsor consensus codes. The developers of such codes are called voluntary standardsbodies, and are defined by OMB to include private sector, domestic, ormultinational organizations_such as nonprofit organizations; industry associations,professional and technical societies, institutions, or groups; and recognizedtesting laboratories_that plan, develop, establish, or coordinate voluntarystandards. EPA interpretation of the phrase ``nationally recognized organization''is intended to encourage the development and use of voluntary standards.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Additional Decisionmaking Authority for Implementing Agencies </ITAG>As discussed elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, EPA is promulgating requirements (in Part 281)for judging the stringency of state programs to be approved to operatein lieu of ``the Federal program.'' Under section 9004 of RCRA, the stateprogram must contain specific program elements that are no less stringentthat the corresponding Federal technical requirements. Instead of requiringa detailed line-by-line review and comparison of state requirements toFederal technical requirements, EPA is today finalizing an approach toprogram approval that will compare state programs to the attainment ofseveral general Federal objectives that underlie the specific technicalrequirements provided in Part 280. In support of this approach, on December 23, 1987, EPA proposed to includeadditional language in the technical requirements that was intended toensure this approval process is flexibly implemented (52 FR 48647). Inorder to establish the Federal objective for each program element, EPArequested comment on the addition of specific language into several sectionsof the technical standards that would clarify the Agency's intent to allowstate implementing agencies to substitute their own procedural and administrativerequirements for those set forth in the Federal requirements. Such administrativerequirements, while essential for direct implementation of the Federalprogram, do not represent the only possible approach for protection ofhuman health and the environment, and thus are not part of the Federalobjectives for defining what requirements must be ``no less stringent''under section 9004 of RCRA. Today's final technical standards include several of these wording changesproposed on December 23, 1987. A list of the specific sections and thechanges that have been made in the final rules are provided in Table 2.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s75,r85 </C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Wording Changes in the Final Rule </T4><H1>Section </H1><H1>Additional language in the final rules</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Subpart B_UST Systems Design, Construction, Installation and Notification:Section 280.20 (a)(2)(iv), (b)(2)(iv) <D>Adding ``or according to guidelines established by the implementingagency'' at the end of each paragraph. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Subpart C_General Operating Requirements: Section 280.31(b)(1) <D>Adding ``or in another reasonable timeframe established by the implementingagency'' to the end of the sentence. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Subpart D_Release Detection: Section 280.45 (a), (b), (c) <D>Adding ``or for another reasonable period of time determined by theimplementing agency'' after the terms ``for 5 years,'' and ``at least oneyear''. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Subpart E_Release Reporting, Investigation, and Confirmation: Section280.50 <D>Adding ``or another reasonable time period specified by the implementingagency'' after the term ``24 hours''. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Section 280.53 (a), (b) <D>  Do. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Section 280.53 (a)(1), (b) <D>Adding ``or another reasonable amount specified by the implementingagency'' after the term ``25 gallons''. </D></ITAG>Subpart F_Release Response and Corrective Action for UST Systems ContainingPetroleum or Hazardous Substances: <ITAG tagnum="2">Section 280.61 <D>Adding ``or within another reasonable period of time determined by theimplementing agency'' after the different reporting periods of 24 hours,20 days, 45 days, and 25 days, respectively. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Section 280.62(b) <D>  Do. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Section 280.63(b) <D>  Do.  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Subpart G_Out-of-Service UST Systems and Closure: Section 280.71(a)<D>Adding ``or another reasonable period of time determined by the implementingagency'' after the comma in the first sentence.</D></ITAG></ITAG> In general, the Agency decided to include this additional language in thefinal technical requirements to ensure that different state proceduraland administrative approaches could be judged no less stringent than thecorresponding Federal program. As discussed in more detail elsewhere intoday's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, EPA has concluded that different state proceduraland administrative requirements can be used and still achieve the underlyingperformance objective being established today for each program element.It is the Agency's intent to allow the states a significant amount of discretionin this matter, as long as they can demonstrate that overall program performancein each program element will not be adversely impacted by their use ofdiffering administrative practices and procedures. Many commenters were in favor of this more flexible approach to state programapproval and most recommended the additional language be provided in thefinal technical rules to ensure a line-by-line review is avoided. Othercommenters expressed concern that additional language in the technicalrules would encourage states to ignore the Federal model. Finally, onecommenter opposed the flexible approach and stressed the Agency should``hold the line'' in maintaining that states adhere to national regulatorydecisions, even if only in procedural matters. EPA disagrees with those commenters who opposed the addition of implementingagency administrative discretion in the technical requirements. They appearedto want to hold states to line-by-line comparisons to the Federal programas the preferred way to determine if they are no less stringent. Thus,they were generally opposed to the use of Federal objectives for purposesof state program approval, as much as to the addition of greater discretionin the technical requirements that would ensure this approach could beimplemented. As is discussed in the preamble to the state program approval regulationelsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, EPA has adopted the Federal objectives approachto assessing state programs for purposes of state program approval. Thus,the final technical standards rule also includes the proposed languageproviding additional authority to implementing agencies with respect tocertain procedural or administrative requirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Relationship To Other Aspects of the UST System Program </ITAG>A. Interim Prohibition Section 9003(g) of RCRA Subtitle I sets forth requirements for tank systemsinstalled between May 7, 1985, and 90 days after today's promulgation offinal new tank performance standards. During this period, UST may be installedunless it is corrosion protected, made of noncorrodible materials, or otherwisedesigned and constructed to prevent releases during the operating lifeof the facility due to corrosion or structural failure. The tank material(s)of construction must also be compatible with the substance(s) to be stored.The final standards for new tank systems in today's rule (as discussedin section IV. of this preamble) are designed to replace the Interim Prohibitionrequirements. These final performance standards address design, construction,installation, release detection, and compatibility for new tank installations.The Interim Prohibition will, however, remain in effect by regulation forthose tanks that have been deferred from coverage under the technical standardsin Subpart A (e.g., some sumps, and field-constructed bulk tanks). B. Notification On November 8, 1985, EPA published the Final Rule on Notification Requirementsfor Owners of Underground Storage Tanks (50 FR 46602). A form to be usedfor the required notification was included as part of the rulemaking. The UST rules and standards for new tanks promulgated today are not intendedto affect these established notification requirements except to add tothe information required to be submitted with the notification requirements(see section IV.B.). These existing requirements have been recodified intoandSection; 280.22 of today's final rule. Owners of existing UST systemswere required to notify their designated state agencies by May 8, 1986.Owners of new or replacement UST systems must notify their designated stateagencies within 30 days of bringing the tank into use by submission ofthe November 8, 1985, Federal form, or an approved alternate state notificationform. Section 9002(a)(6) of RCRA requires that, beginning 30 days after the issuanceof today's final new tank performance standards, any person who sells atank intended to be used in a UST system must advise the tank purchaserof the owner's notification requirements. This requirement is effective30 days after publication of the new tank performance standards that arebeing promulgated today. This requirement is codified in andSection; 280.22(e)of today's rule. C. Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund Amendments to Subtitle I of RCRA enacted as part of the Superfund Amendmentsand Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) provide for a Leaking UndergroundStorage Tank Trust Fund. The amendments (section 9003(h)) provide fundsfor cleanup of petroleum spills from UST systems and give EPA, and statesthat enter into a cooperative agreement with EPA, the authority to respondto releases of petroleum from UST systems. Almost all of the states haveentered into these agreements with EPA and are now responding to petroleumreleases from UST systems using Trust Fund revenues. These amendments toRCRA were necessary because no other Federal environmental program includesspecific authority for response to releases of petroleum from UST systems,although releases of petroleum affecting navigable waters can be respondedto under section 311 of the Clean Water Act.Section 9003(h) provides that the Administrator may issue an order requiringcorrective action prior to the promulgation of today's final correctiveaction regulations under Subtitle I. With the promulgation of today's requirements,the Administrator may use this same order authority, as well as the enforcementauthority of section 9006, to require owners or operators to undertakecorrective action. The Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund is being financed by taxeson motor fuels to pay for response costs in a limited set of circumstances.Until the effective date of today's final technical standards December22, 1988, the Administrator, or states under cooperative agreements, mayuse the Fund to pay for a particular corrective action whenever the actionis necessary to protect human health and the environment. After that date,the statute provides for the use of the Fund primarily where the financialresources of the owners or operators are not sufficient to pay for thecosts of corrective action, or if the owner or operator is otherwise unidentifiable,unwilling, or incapable of carrying out corrective action properly. Insome cases, an identifiable and solvent owner or operator may be in compliancewith all UST financial responsiblity requirements (to be discussed in alater <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice) but lack financial resources to pay theentire cost of a response. In those cases, the Administrator or a statewith a cooperative agreement is authorized to use the Fund to pay the coststhat exceed the level of financial responsibility required of the ownerand operator by the financial responsibility regulations. If the owner and operator has failed to maintain the required level offinancial responsibility, the Trust Fund may not be used, unless: (1) Thereis no solvent owner or operator; (2) there is an imminent and substantialthreat to human health or the environment; or (3) there is a need to takecorrective action outside the facility including the provision of alternativewater supplies or relocation of residents. Ninety days after publication of today's regulations, cleanups under theTrust Fund must be conducted in accordance with the corrective action requirements(Part 280 Subpart G). D. Exempted Tank Studies The regulations finalized today do not apply to certain tank systems thatwere exempted by statute under section 9001 of Subtitle I. Section 9009(d)and (e) of Subtitle I requires that EPA conduct a study of several of thesesystems and submit a report to Congress that includes recommendations asto whether these tanks should be regulated in the future. The Report toCongress will be issued later this year. The Report to Congress will cover the following exempted tanks whose volume,including piping, is at least 10 percent belowground: andbullet; Farm or residential tanks of 1,100 gallons or less capacity usedfor storing motor fuel for noncommerical purposes, and andbullet; Tanks used for storing heating oil for consumptive use on thepremises where stored. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Relationship To Other Agency Programs </ITAG>This section discusses the relationship of today's final rules to certainother EPA regulatory programs. This discussion is for informational purposesonly. A. CERCLA Section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation andLiability Act of 1980 (CERCLA, or Superfund) requires development of alist of national priorities among known sites with releases and threatenedreleases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants. The NationalContingency Plan (40 CFR Part 300) regulates development of the NationalPriorities List (of sites with releases) as well as appropriate responsesto the most serious releases. These regulations currently apply to releasesof CERCLA-designated hazardous substances from underground storage tanks.CERCLA, however, does not apply to releases of petroleum from USTs or othersources. Releases of hazardous substances from UST systems may require removal orremedial action responses by federal or state agencies, in accordance with40 CFR Part 300. Some UST releases of hazardous substances are alreadyincluded in the National Priorities List. When today's final rules becomeeffective (within 90 days), owners and operators of UST systems that releasehazardous substances will be subject to the corrective action provisionsof the rules and, in selected cases, the removal or remedial action measuresof 40 CFR Part 300. It is the responsibility of the owner and operatorof a hazardous substance UST system that releases hazardous substancesto consult with the implementing agency to determine the applicabilityof CERCLA requirements and Subtitle I release response and corrective actionrequirements under Subpart F. Under sections 102 and 103 of CERCLA, EPA has promulgated regulations (40CFR Part 302) that identify hazardous substances and quantities of releasesof these hazardous substances that must be reported to the National ResponseCenter. Those regulations contain reporting requirements for releases equalto or in excess of the established reportable quantities (RQs). Under CERCLA,owners and operators of all kinds of storage, transportation, and disposalfacilities containing hazardous substances must report releases to theNational Response Center. Owners and operators of USTs with releases ofhazardous substances that exceed the RQs set forth in 40 CFR Part 302 willcontinue to be subject to those CERCLA reporting requirements. Under today's rule, owners and operators that store hazardous substancesin USTs are also required to report spill or overfill releases of thesesubstances from USTs that exceed the RQ to the implementing agency within24 hours, or another period specified by the implementing agency, and immediatelybegin containment and cleanup of the release. Owners and operators withspills or overfills of hazardous substances from USTs that are less thanthe reportable quantity will not be subject to the release reporting requirementsalthough they will still be responsible to immediately contain and cleanthem up. B. Hazardous Waste Tank Program Under RCRA Subtitle C, EPA promulgated regulations for tank systems containinghazardous wastes (40 CFR Parts 264 and 265, July 14, 1986) including undergroundtanks. The RCRA Subtitle I rules promulgated today apply to USTs containing``regulated substances.'' These regulated substances include petroleumand hazardous substances defined in section 101(14) of CERCLA, <T3>except </T3>for hazardous wastes regulated under Subtitle C. The exclusionof hazardous wastes from the definition of regulated substance avoids mostof the overlapping jurisdiction of Subtitle I and Subtitle C. An overlapin jurisdiction does exist, however, for USTs containing petroleum wastesthat are subject to the provisions of RCRA 3014. This overlap is discussedin the next section. There is also a potential overlap in jurisdiction for USTs containing mixturesof petroleum and hazardous wastes. Today's final rules resolve this potentialoverlap by excluding such USTs from the universe of USTs subject to today'srequirements. Unless otherwise exempted, such USTs would be subject tothe requirements of Subtitle C. It is intended that today's rules regulatea different set of UST systems from those subject to regulation under SubtitleC.C. Hazardous Waste Management Regulations Section 3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act requires EPAto identify wastes that pose a hazard to human health and the environmentif improperly managed. Under the regulatory program established by SubtitleC of RCRA, EPA has developed a process that identifies and publishes listsof hazardous wastes. Generators must determine whether their waste is onone of the lists in 40 CFR Part 261, Subpart D. If a waste is not listedas a hazardous waste, waste generators are required to determine if theirwaste is hazardous either by testing it to determine if it exhibits any``characteristics,'' based on knowledge about the physical and chemicalcomposition of the waste. In the latter case, testing of the waste is notnecessary if it is believed that it would not exhibit a hazardous wastecharacteristic. The waste generator, however, remains responsible for makingthe correct determinations concerning the characteristics of reactivity,corrosivity, ignitability, and extraction procedure (EP) toxicity, as specifiedin 40 CFR Part 261, Subpart C. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Hazardous Substances </ITAG>Many hazardous substances regulated by the Subtitle I tank rules are currentlyon EPA's hazardous waste lists of commerical chemical products at 40 CFR261.33 (e) and (f). The products become hazardous wastes when discarded,including when spilled and then not cleaned up and used for their intendedpurpose. Soils, water, or other debris contaminated by these products aresubject to regulation as hazardous waste (see 40 CFR 261.33(d)). A personremoving such contaminated soil or debris during a cleanup is a hazardouswaste generator, subject to andSection; 261.5 or Part 262. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Petroleum and Petroleum-based Substances</ITAG>Petroleum-contaminated soils are not an EPA-listed hazardous waste. Basedon its physical and chemical nature, petroleum-contaminated soil wouldnot exhibit the hazardous characteristics of corrosivity or reactivityunder 40 CFR Part 261. Some state UST programs have reported to the Agencythat they require the use of the EPA tests for ignitability and EP toxicityto assist in making decisions about whether to manage the petroleum-contaminatedsoils on- or off-site. Other states have simply declared that the soilsare not a hazardous waste and, therefore, do not require testing or managementas a hazardous waste. Other states require management of petroleum-contaminatedsoils as a ``special waste'' that must receive special handling to controlenvironmental and human health risks believed to be associated with thevolatile organic chemical emissions known to come from such soils. Although some states require the use of the EPA tests, petroleum-contaminatedsoils do not satisfy the EPA criteria for an ignitable hazardous waste.A substance is classified as a hazardous waste if it exhibits the characteristicof ignitability according to one of the following four criteria (40 CFR261.21) as determined by using an ASTM or Administrator-approved testingprocedures. The substance must be: (1) A liquid containing less than orequal to 24 percent alcohol having a flashpoint less than 140anddegrees;F; (2) a nonliquid, but capable under standard temperature and pressureof causing fire through friction, absorption of moisture, or spontaneouschemical changes which burns so vigorously and persistently that it createsa hazard; (3) an ignitable compressed gas, as defined in 49 CFR 173.300;or (4) an oxidizer as defined in 40 CFR 173.151. Gasoline-contaminatedsoils do not satisfy criteria (1), (3), or (4). They do satisfy the nonliquidrequirement of criterion (2); however, the Agency has concluded that theyare very unlikely to ever be capable of causing fire by friction, absorptionof moisture, or spontaneous chemical changes. These soils, therefore, shouldnot be a hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA due to ignitability.Several states contacted by EPA reported that they have conducted thousandsof EP toxicity tests on petroleum-contaminated soils and they have neverexhibited the characteristic of EP toxicity at numerous sites nationwidewhere soils were contaminated by both leaded and unleaded gasolines. Thisresult is expected because the extraction procedure is designed to identifyindividual wastes that are hazardous due to their potential to leach significantconcentrations of eight specific metals, four insecticides, and two herbicidesin a municipal landfill scenario. When subjected to the EP toxicity test,the only constituent of concern for soils contaminated by petroleum islead. The extremely high adsorption coefficient of lead, however, indicatesthat such soils are unlikely to ever exhibit the characteristic of EP toxicity.In summary, the evidence collected by or reported to the Agency to-dateindicates it is very unlikely that petroleum-contaminated soils will befound to exhibit any of the characteristics of hazardous waste as currentlydefined by EPA regulations. However, EPA is also aware that there are potentialthreats that need to be considered in the management of petroleum-contaminatedsoils. For example, petroleum-contaminated soils (particularly motor fuels)can contribute significant amounts of volatile compounds to the air orbe the source of dissolved contaminants (such as benzene) in ground-waterresources. Today's final regulations leave the off-site management of theseconcerns to existing state and local requirements. EPA believes there areseveral ways to properly manage petroleum-contaminated soils that are nothazardous wastes, including the following approaches that are already beingused in various states: andbullet; Define petroleum-contaminated soils as a non-hazardous waste thatrequires disposal into permitted solid waste facilities. andbullet; Define it as a special waste that requires special handling (suchas land spreading, heat treating, or disposal in designated fill areas)that is tailored to remove the threats posed by the volatile constituentsof the petroleum. andbullet; Define petroleum-contaminated soils as a hazardous waste thatmust be treated or disposed of under the hazardous waste standards. EPA intends to study this technical issue further and provide more informationto the public and the implementing agencies concerning alternative waysto manage petroleum-contaminated soils when they are managed on-site orremoved off-site. This information may include, for example, a descriptionof different test methods that could be used to characterize petroleum-contaminatedsoils in a more meaningful fashion than present methods. EPA is currentlyinvestigating techniques to measure and assess the condition of petroleum-contaminatedsoils, and handling and treatment alternatives that can be used to properlymanage the potential risks they pose to human health and the environment.Finally, EPA notes that under proposed revisions to the toxicity characteristicunder the Agency's hazardous waste regulations (40 CFR 261.24), benzeneand a number of other compounds would be added to those constituents that,when measured in waste leachate, will determine whether a waste exhibitsa hazardous waste characteristic. (See 51 FR 21648; June 13, 1986.) Whenthese rule revisions are issued in final form, a large amount of petroleum-contaminatedsoils that are currently considered nonhazardous may have to be managedas hazardous waste. For example, all petroleum-saturated soils may be characterizedas a hazardous waste under the proposed revisions. EPA is unsure of theimpacts of this proposed rule change at this time, and in fact recentlyrequested additional public comments on the levels for benzene and otherconstituents. (See 53 FR 18024; May 19, 1988.) However, the public commentperiod is closed on this issue. The Agency will provide further guidanceon this issue at a later date. D. Used Oil Regulations Underground tanks storing used oil (e.g., automobile and truck used crankcaseoil) are under the jurisdiction of Subtitle I. Pursuant to section 9001(2)(B)of RCRA, underground tanks containing ``petroleum, including crude oilor any fraction thereof which is liquid at standard conditions of temperatureand pressure * * *'' are within the scope of Subtitle I. Since used oilis primarily composed of petroleum, although it may contain contaminantsdue to use of the oil, it is subject to Subtitle I requirements. Ownersand operators of UST systems containing used oil were required to notifydesignated state agencies of the presence of such tanks by May 8, 1986.Owners and operators of newly installed used oil UST systems have alsobeen subject to the requirements of the Interim Prohibition, which hasbeen in effect since May 8, 1985. As discussed above, however, today's regulations exclude any tanks regulatedunder Subtitle C of RCRA. Under Subtitle C, EPA has the authority to regulaterecycled oil, and to regulate used oil that is disposed of under SubtitleC if such oil is identified or listed as a hazardous waste. Under the authorityof Subtitle C of RCRA, EPA proposed to list used oil as hazardous waste(50 FR 49269-49270, November 29, 1985) and has proposed standards for recycledoil (50 FR 49250-49258, November 29, 1985). Since those publications inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>, several important decisions in terms of theseproposed rulemakings have been made, namely: (1) Storage of used oil (even when recycled) will be regulated, and (2) Recycled oil will<T3> not</T3> be listed as a hazardous waste (51 FR 41900, November 19,1986).The storage of used oil, however, is not currently regulated as a hazardouswaste under Subtitle C. Unless and until the Agency regulates the storageof used oil as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C, it will be subject toSubtitle I. Accordingly, the Agency is today including application of thetechnical requirements to used oil UST systems. This is discussed in furtherdetail in section IV.A. E. SPCC Under section 311 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, EPA has promulgatedregulations for the prevention of oil spills into navigable waters. Theserules (40 CFR Part 112) known as the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure(SPCC) regulations are intended to prevent and contain releases of oilinto surface waters which are navigable. Comparatively few UST systems are subject to SPCC regulations. Only thosetanks of greater than 42,000 gallons capacity that are located near navigablewaters of the U.S. or adjoining shorelines may be affected. UST systemswhich, due to their location, could reasonably be expected to dischargeoil into or upon navigable waters of the United States or adjoining shorelinesand which have a storage capacity greater than 42,000 gallons are subjectto both today's rules and the SPCC rules. F. DOE High-Level Radioactive Waste Program Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2001 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has promulgatedrules for the management of high-level radioactive waste resulting fromatomic energy defense activity. DOE Orders 5480.1, 5480.2, and 5820.2 regulatethe underground storage of these wastes, including corrective actions inthe event of a release. The UST rules include the storage of radioactive waste because any radionuclideis a ``hazardous substance'' under CERCLA and thus a regulated substanceunder Subtitle I. However, in view of the differences in high-level radioactivewaste from other RCRA Subtitle I regulated substances and the much largertanks storing this waste, EPA is today deferring regulatory action on theseDOE radioactive waste facilities. Until a determination is made as to whether,and how, the UST rules should apply to DOE facilities storing high-levelradioactive wastes, today's UST requirements, except corrective actionand the Interim Prohibition requirements, do not apply to these facilities.More details are provided on this in section IV.A. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Economic and Regulatory Impacts </ITAG>Section VII.A. discusses the Regulatory Impact Analysis of the final rulerequired by Executive Order 12291. Section VII.B. discusses the analysisof the effects of the final rule on small businesses required by the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. Section VII.C. addresses requirements under the PaperworkReduction Act. (A full draft of the Regulatory Impact Analysis for thefinal rule is available as part of the background documents supportingthis rulemaking.) A. Regulatory Impact Analysis <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193, February 19, 1981) requires regulatoryagencies to conduct a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for any major rule.EPA has conducted an RIA to assess the regulatory impacts of the technicalstandards rule for USTs based on the guidelines contained in the Officeof Management and Budget's ``Interim Regulatory Impact Analysis Guidance''and EPA's ``Guidelines for Performing Regulatory Impact Analysis.'' Theobjective of the analysis is to examine the anticipated costs, benefits,and impacts of the final rule rather than to select a regulatory option.Based on the results of the analysis, the Agency has concluded that thetechnical standards regulations being promulgated today represent a majorrule that produces significant net benefits to society. As described in today's preamble, these technical standards pertain totank system design, construction, and installation, leak detection, recordkeeping,reporting, closure, and corrective action. For the proposed rule (52 FR12761-12769), EPA conducted an RIA to compare several regulatory alternatives.Each of these alternatives is discussed in detail in the ``Regulatory ImpactAnalysis for Proposed Technical Standards for Underground Storage Tanks''(April 1987). (This RIA for the proposed rule is contained in AppendixB of the RIA for the final rule.) The RIA for the final rule does not considervarious options. Instead, it concentrates on the impacts of the provisionsof the final rule (see sections III. and IV. of today's preamble for afull description of the requirements of the final rule.) The final rule refines the proposed rule (April 17, 1987) by phasing inrequirements for release detection over a period of 5 years for existingtanks (based on the age of the tank) and by establishing more stringentrequirements for pressurized piping. Most of the other requirements inthe final rule pertaining to corrosion protection and release detectionare the same as in the proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Costs </ITAG>Compliance with the rule's requirements for release detection, system inspectionsand upgrading, and corrective action will require large expenditures bymost UST owners and operators. In addition, the large population of USTsmeans that the total costs for all USTs will be substantial from the standpointof the economy as a whole. Table 3, column 2, displays the costs of the final rule for the entireUST population, by category of costs. These cost estimates represent costscalculated using the UST Model, a model developed by the Agency to simulatethe release and transport of petroleum products. These estimates assumea total of 1.7 million USTs and a total of 30 years of costs after promulgationof the rule, discounted at a rate of 3 percent annually. Based on EPA'sanalysis and assumptions, the estimated cost of the final rule is expectedto be approximately $69 billion over a period of 30 years, or $3.6 billionper year (discounted at a rate of 3 percent).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s100,8,8,8,8</C><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>Costs Under the Base Case and Final Rule</T4><H1>Cost component</H1><H1>Total cost, all USTs</H1><H2>Base case (millions)</H2><H2>Final rule (millions)</H2><H1>Increment cost</H1><H2>Total (millions)</H2><H2>Per UST</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Component repair replacement, upgrade<D>$19,890</D><D>$32,300</D><D>$12,410</D><D>$7,300</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Leak detection and testing<D>440</D><D>4,980</D><D>4,540</D><D>2,670</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Corrective action in response to releases<D>\1\ 0</D><D>31,970</D><D>31,970</D><D>18,800</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total</ITAG><D>20,330</D><D>69,250</D><D>48,920</D><D>28,770</D><F>Source: UST Model runs, April 1988.</F><F>\1\ No cost is ascribed here because no corrective action is requiredin the base case.</F></ITAG>In order to evaluate the incremental costs of the final rule, EPA estimatedthe costs that would be incurred by UST owners and operators in the absenceof any further regulations. These costs are presented in column 1 of Table3 as base case cost. Subtracting the base case costs from the costs underthe final rule yields the incremental cost of the final rule, shown bycost category in Table 3, column 3. This incremental cost is expected tobe approximately $48 billion over 30 years, or $2.5 billion on an annualbasis (discounted at an annual rate of 3 percent). The administrative costsof implementing the final rule are not included in this analysis. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Benefits </ITAG>The final rule's requirements for leak detection and prevention and correctiveaction will provide society with a variety of benefits. The benefits aredefined as reductions in damages under the rule in comparison to the basecase. Two kinds of damages are considered in the RIA: Those that occurbefore a release is detected, such as contamination of private and publicwells; and those that occur after a release is detected, such as contaminationof soil and ground water. The pre-detection damages are $2.1 billion under the final rule, and $4.8billion in the base case. The incremental benefits of regulation resultingfrom this decrease in pre-detection damages are therefore $2.7 billion.The post-detection damages are estimated to be $52.8 billion under thebase case, and negligible under the final rule. (Under the final rule,corrective actions must be performed as soon as a release is detected whichaccounts for this drastic reduction in post-detection costs.) The incrementalbenefits of regulation resulting from a decrease in post-detection damagesare therefore $52.8 billion. The total incremental benefits of the rule,including the benefits from reduction in both pre- and post-detection damages,are $55.5 billion ($2.7 billion due to reduction of pre-detection damagesand $52.8 billion due to reduction of post-detection damages). The yieldin benefit for each UST is about $31,000. EPA believes that, in addition to the benefits summarized above, many additionalbenefits of release detection and prevention cannot be expressed quantitativelyor in purely monetary terms. Examples of these important benefits includethe prevention of added risks to human health, the value of preventingdamage to the ability of streams to support life, and the basic value ofpreventing contamination of ground-water resources whether or not theyare currently being used. In an attempt to provide some measure of these benefits, EPA has quantifiedthe health benefits of the release detection, prevention, and correctiveaction portion of the final rule, but has expressed the benefits in termsof cancer cases avoided and the reduction in numbers of USTs posing cancerrisks in excess of a specified threshold (Table 4). Of the two scenariosshown in Table 4, one scenario assumes that people will not use water thatsmells or tastes badly. The other scenario assumes that people will usewater whether it seems contaminated or not.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s60,r35,r35</C><T4>Table </T4>4._<T4>Reductions in Health Risks Due To Release Prevention and Detectionin the Final Rule</T4><H1>Type of benefit</H1><H1>Assuming taste and odor threshold limits exposure</H1><H1>Assuming no exposure limitation</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Reduction in population risk (total cases of cancer avoided)<D>20 cases</D><D>87 cases.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Reduction in numbers of USTs posing risks of cancer as high as onechance in 10,000<D>8,371 USTs</D><D>13,300 USTs.</D><F>Source: UST Model runs, April 1988.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">4. Cost Effectiveness of the Final Rule </ITAG>A comparison of the incremental costs of the final rule to its incrementalbenefits is shown in Figure 6. The figure shows the incremental costs ofthe final rule to be $48.9 billion, which include repair, system upgradingand replacement, release detection, and corrective action for the entirepopulation of 1.7 million USTs. In contrast, the incremental benefits ofthe rule are estimated to be $55.5 billion. These benefits consist largelyof reductions in damages occurring after releases are detected, but alsoinclude reductions in well and vapor damages and lost product occurringbefore the detection of releases. By subtracting costs from benefits, thenet dollar benefits of the final rule over the next 30 years are estimatedto have a present value of $6.6 billion, or $4,000 per UST. In additionto the benefits measured in dollar terms, the rule also significantly reducesdamages to human health and the environment.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 465</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">5. Economic Impacts on Existing Facilities </ITAG>An economic impact analysis was performed for the general industry andretail marketing sectors having petroleum USTs and for firms having hazardoussubstance USTs. The results of this analysis indicate that firms in theretail motor fuel marketing sector would be most adversely affected, forseveral reasons: they have a greater number of small firms that are morevulnerable to significant regulatory expenditures; regulatory expendituresin this sector are likely to be greater because motor fuel retail outletsgenerally have the greatest number of USTs per outlet; and firms in theretail motor fuel marketing sector do not have the option of closing theirUSTs and using alternative storage methods. The RIA reaches the followingconclusions: andbullet; By year ten, 43 percent more small firms are projected to closeunder the final rule than in the base case. andbullet; Most economic impacts of the final rule occur in the first 5 yearsafter its imposition. andbullet; Most closures of existing outlets are caused by corrective actionexpenses. andbullet; Were corrective action to be performed in the base case as wellas under the final rule, the model predicts that a higher percentage ofoutlets would survive under the final rule than in the base case. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Integration of Technical Standards and Financial ResponsibilityRules </ITAG>EPA prepared separate RIAs for the proposed technical standards and financialresponsibility rules in order to estimate the costs and economic impactsof each proposed rule. As many commenters pointed out, a major weaknessof this approach was that the two RIAs could not easily be used to assessthe combined impacts of the proposed technical standards and financialresponsibility rules to construct an ``after regulation'' picture of theregulated community. Commenters also noted that certain indirect coststhat would be imposed on the regulated community were not included in eitherRIA. They explained that in order to buy insurance to satisfy the financialresponsibility requirements, UST owners and operators would have to upgradetheir USTs by installing release detection systems sooner than requiredby the technical standards rule. In response to these comments, EPA has revised its approach in preparingthe RIAs for the final rules, so that the two RIAs now perform the followingfunctions: andbullet; Account for the indirect costs of having to upgrade tank systemssooner to procure financial assurance; and andbullet; Estimate the combined costs and economic impacts of both setsof requirements. The RIA for the financial responsibility rule assumes the technical standardsrule in its base case in order to estimate its costs and economic impacts.The costs incurred in upgrading, replacing, retrofitting, and correctiveaction are attributed to the technical standards rule. Costs incurred toupgrade sooner than required by the technical standards rule in order toobtain financial assurance are attributed to the financial responsibilityrule. By using the technical standards rule as the base case and computingthe incremental costs of the financial responsibility rule, the overallcosts to the regulated community can be estimated properly. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), agenciespublishing a proposed or final rule must prepare and make available forcomment a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis that describes the potentialimpact of the rule on small entities (i.e., small business, small organizations,and small government jurisdictions). The purpose of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct is to ensure that regulations do not impose unnecessary costs or otherburdens on such entities. As part of its RIA, EPA has examined the potentialimpact of today's rule on small entities and has concluded that the rulewill have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities,as described below:<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Small Entities Potentially Affected by the Rule </ITAG>The Agency divided the businesses potentially affected by the rule intothree categories: Firms engaged in retail motor fuel marketing (e.g., gasolineservice stations), firms engaged in other businesses (general industrycategory), and local government entities. EPA focused the emphasis of theRegulatory Flexibility Analysis on the retail motor fuel marketing sectorbecause (1) all firms in this sector <T3>must </T3>store their product in underground storage tanks; (2) aboutthree-quarters of all retail motor fuel outlets are owned or operated bysmall businesses; and (3) the data base for this sector is reasonably accurateand will capture the most severe small-business impacts likely to occuras a result of the rule. a. <T3>Small Businesses in the Retail Motor Fuel Marketing Sector. </T3>Forthis Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, small businesses in the retail motorfuel marketing segment are defined as firms with less than $4.6 millionin annual sales and include all firms with only one or two outlets. Firmswith $4.6 million in sales will typically have approximately $500,000 inassets and a net worth of about $250,000. EPA estimates that in 1984, smallbusinesses either owned or operated 72 percent of the 193,000 retail motorfuel outlets in the United States. To examine the rule's potential economic impact on small businesses, EPAestimated the rates at which existing firms in the retail motor fuel marketingsector would leave the industry with and without regulations. For the purposesof this analysis, EPA estimates that these outlets have historically tendedto exit the industry at a rate of 3 to 4 percent per year. If releasesoccur at the level estimated by the RIA and no revenue increases are possiblefor small businesses, this rate would increase to 6.2 percent per year,assuming average corrective action costs. b. <T3>Small Businesses in the General Industry Sector. </T3>An estimated24 to 41 percent of all USTs in the general industry sector are owned byfirms with less than $1 million in assets. A typical small firm in thissegment was assumed to have $300,000 in assets and net profits of $21,000a year. Overall, these firms represent about 12 percent of all UST-owningfirms in the general industry sector. The cost of corrective action for non-plume release (i.e., no ground-watercontamination) would leave a small general industry firm in severe financialdistress, and the cost of corrective action for a plume release (i.e.,contamination of ground water) would lead to the failure of the firm. Replacinga tank would cause a small general industry firm a temporary financialhardship; however, this hardship would not seriously threaten the survivalof the firm. c. <T3>Small Local Government Entities. </T3>Local government entities ofall sizes own USTs. In 1982, the typical municipality with a populationless than 50,000 had general revenues of $1.7 million. The costs of replacingeven a single UST would represent 2 percent of the revenue of such a municipality,a significant expenditure that would have to be taken into account whenplanning. A corrective action that required cleaning up a dispersed plumewould represent more than 13 percent of the general revenues of such acommunity, a sum that would probably cause severe financial distress. In 1982, of the 38,886 local governments classified as counties, municipalities,and townships, 37,581 (approximately 97 percent) had populations of 50,000or less. Almost all UST-owning local governments would, therefore, be subjectto potentially substantial economic impacts under the technical standardsrule if an UST release occurred. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this rule have been approvedby the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork ReductionAct (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2050-0068.Reporting and recordkeeping burden on the public for this collection isestimated at 8,265,220 hours for the 1,750,000 respondents, with an averageof 4 hours per response. These burden estimates include all aspects ofthe collection effort and may include time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. If you wish to submit comments regarding any aspect of this collectionof information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, or if youwould like a copy of the information collection request (please referenceICR andplusmin;1360), contact Rick Westlund, Information Policy Branch, PM-223,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC20460 (202-382-2745); and Marcus Peacock, Office of Information and RegulatoryAffairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 280 </ITAG>Administration practice and procedures, Confidential business information,Ground water, Hazardous materials, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,Underground storage tanks, Water pollution control, Water supply.<ITAG tagnum="34">September 8, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee Thomas, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Administrator.</ITAG>For the reasons set out in the Preamble, Part 280 of Title 40 of the Codeof Federal Regulations is revised to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 280_TECHNICAL STANDARDS AND CORRECTIVE ACTION REQUIREMENTS FOROWNERS AND OPERATORS OF UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS (UST) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_Program Scope and Interim Prohibition </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.10 Applicability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.11 Interim prohibition for deferred UST systems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.12 Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart B_UST Systems: Design, Construction, Installation and Notification</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.20 Performance standards for new UST systems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.21 Upgrading of existing UST systems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.22 Notification requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_General Operating Requirements </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.30 Spill and overfill control. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.31 Operation and maintenance of corrosion protection. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.32 Compatibility. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.33 Repairs allowed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.34 Reporting and recordkeeping. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Release Detection </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.40 General requirements for all UST systems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.41 Requirements for petroleum UST systems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.42 Requirements for hazardous substance UST systems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.43 Methods of release detection for tanks. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.44 Methods of release detection for piping. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.45 Release detection recordkeeping. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Release Reporting, Investigation, and Confirmation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.50 Reporting of suspected releases. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.51 Investigation due to off-site impacts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.52 Release investigation and confirmation steps. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.53 Reporting and cleanup of spills and overfills. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart F_Release Response and Corrective Action for UST Systems ContainingPetroleum or Hazardous Substances  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.60 General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.61 Initial response. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.62 Initial abatement measures and site check. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.63 Initial site characterization. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.64 Free product removal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.65 Investigations for soil and ground-water cleanup. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.66 Corrective action plan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.67 Public participation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart G_Out-of-Service UST Systems and Closure </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.70 Temporary closure. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.71 Permanent closure and changes-in-service. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.72 Assessing the site at closure or change-in-service. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.73 Applicability to previously closed UST systems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">280.74 Closure records. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix I_Notification for Underground Storage Tanks (Form). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix II_List of Agencies Designated to Receive Notifications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix III_Statement for Shipping Tickets and Invoices.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 6912, 6991, 6991(a), 6991(b), 6991(c), 6991(d),6991(e), 6991(f), 6991(h). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_Program Scope and Interim Prohibition </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 280.10</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability. </ITAG>(a) The requirements of this part apply to all owners and operators ofan UST system as defined in andSection; 280.12 except as otherwise providedin paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
