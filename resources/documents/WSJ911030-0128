(FDC)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   Your Sept. 23 Outlook column stated that faster bankclosings will cut Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. losses. Theconventional wisdom, which you repeated, is that the earlierthe FDIC closes a troubled bank, the less cost the taxpayershave to bear. In many cases, this is not true. I am anattorney, and I practice primarily in the regulatory area ofbank law. Many of my clients are troubled banks, which cometo me when they cannot be saved, and I have seen a number ofthem fail. Therefore, my evidence is empirical, although Ideny that I am an empiric.   In many instances, a troubled bank will have had a changeof management in the three years before the bank fails,usually precipitated when the board discovers the extent ofthe bank's problems. Therefore, the management in place whenthe bank fails is not the management that created the bank'sproblems. Usually new managers spend their time working outthe bank's problem assets by collecting loans and selling offforeclosed real estate. Capital continues to decline beforefailure, as the bank recognizes losses. If the bank managesto cover its overhead, before provisions for losses, then theproblem loans and real estate are being handled by theprivate sector, and we taxpayers do not have to pay thesalaries of government employees to manage these assets.However, most failing banks not only cover their overhead,but also make enough money to pay some, although not all, ofthe losses they will face on their bad loans and foreclosedreal estate.</LP><TEXT>   When a bank in this condition is closed, the FDICtypically tries to transfer all liability for deposits aswell as all assets to an assuming bank. However, during theexamination that leads to the closure of the bank, the bank'sassets are written down to &quot;fire-sale&quot; values. I have seenexaminers cynically write off loans that are current in theirpayments and tell the bank &quot;you can take {payments as} arecovery to your loan loss reserve&quot; during an examinationwhen the examiners know they will force a failure. When thebank fails, these loans are shown on the bank's books atartificially low values. In addition, the winner in theFDIC's bid process usually acquires the assets at a discount.In Texas, discounts of 20% to 30% are not uncommon, so thewinning bidder pays only a fraction of book value for assetsthat already have been written down below their true value.Who pays for this double discounting? The FDIC, andultimately the taxpayers.   The FDIC guarantees that it will suffer a loss every timeit closes a bank. Doesn't it make sense to work with banks tokeep them open if they have good management? Managementcertainly has a lot more incentive, and usually moreexperience, than the government employees who would take overtrying to collect the bank's bad loans and sell its realestate.   Time and again, we see demonstrated the fact that privateindustry does a better, faster or less expensive job than thegovernment. In light of that, it amazes me that newspaperscontinue to swallow the FDIC's claim that only by giving itmore money and letting it step in earlier will the taxpayersbe saved even greater losses. While statistics can bemanipulated to support this claim, empirical evidence andcommon sense prove otherwise.   Joan Conway Waller   Dallas</TEXT></DOC>
