Thedifference is literally night and day.&quot;;   Like the nearly 20 other familymembers -- husbands, wives, daughters and sons -- of loved ones withAlzheimer's or related brain impairment who dropped someone off at Camp Harmonoutside Boulder Creek for the weekend, Bergman had mixed emotions.;   He wasexcited about the break and the first chance to recharge himself in years, buthe felt a little sad that the same couldn't happen with his wife.;   &quot;It'slike having an adult child in the home,&quot; said Roger Wellman, chief executiveofficer of the Easter Seal Society of the Monterey Bay Region, which sponsorsthe care-giver respite weekends.;   &quot;They can't remember if they've justeaten,&quot; Wellman said. &quot;Sometimes they don't recognize a spouse and don't knowwho the stranger is who's trying to get them into the bath. Oftentimes, theperson the care-giver has known is gone but the physical needs are stillthere.&quot;;   Unlike day care programs that enable care-givers to keep a job butoffer no relief from the rest of the round-the-clock care they provide, theweekends allow more than a day of respite.;   &quot;It's really a 24-hour shift forthe care-givers,&quot; said Lorraine Beagle, a certified rehabilitation nurse whoworks for the Easter Seal Society. &quot;More even than you'd have to give to anewborn. Families need some time to get themselves back in shape.&quot;;   Beaglesaid she got some sense of how much the weekends mean when she had to call thewife of one of the campers.;   &quot;After I told her who I was and where I wascalling from, she said, 'Oh, no, not again,' &quot; Beagle said. &quot;She was afraid hewas going to have to come back from the camp early.&quot;;   With no nationalfunding for such programs, the Easter Seal Society has tried to find sponsorsfrom the community to help pay for the weekends and a small staff. CherylBentley, a consultant with the Del Mar Resource Center in Santa Cruz and thedriving force behind the weekend program, has worked hard to recruit enoughvolunteers to pull it all off.;   One woman who was able to take a break fromgiving round-the-clock care and listening to her ailing husband's &quot;incessanttalking&quot; this weekend told the staff, &quot;I just sat and was quiet.&quot;;   Thehusband of one Alzheimer's patient told Bentley after the second respiteweekend -- this weekend was the third -- that &quot;sometimes I wish I could shootboth me and my wife.&quot;;   But needing a break does not lessen a couple's bond,several people said Sunday. Care-givers come back refreshed, not lesscommitted to the people they're caring for.;   While Alice Hauso's 71-year-oldhusband, Warren, was taken on boat rides and nature walks at Camp Harmon, she&quot;got away&quot; and didn't even mind the snarled traffic as she drove to SacramentoFriday evening.;   &quot;I got away and nobody said 'Alice' in the middle of thenight or as I was about to get into the shower,&quot; she said. &quot;That's what's sohard.&quot;;   Her husband suffered a severe stroke three years ago that causedbrain damage, but his behavior is similar to someone with Alzheimer's, shesaid.;   &quot;Sometimes he forgets he can't walk and I have to follow along behindhim,&quot; she said.;   Still, there was that moment not too long ago when Hausowas discouraged and drained and said, &quot;This is a hell of a way to live.&quot;;  &quot;My husband looked at me and said, 'It is for me, too.' &quot;; IF YOU'REINTERESTED; For more information on the respite weekends or to donate time ormoney, you may call the Easter Seal Society at (408) 684-2166 or write thesociety at 9010 Soquel Drive, Aptos 95003.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LINDA GOLDSTON, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910930  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  833  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, September 30, 199100274170,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
