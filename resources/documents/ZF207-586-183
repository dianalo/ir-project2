(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>THREE 80386-BASED COMPUTER SYSTEMS: ALR 25386X, COMPAQ 386/25, IBM PS/2 MODEL70andM;The format of this review is different from previous &quot;Tested Mettle&quot; columns.andO;Instead of looking at a single hardware/software system and comparing it toother machines, this review examines three 80386-based UNIX systems: the IBMPS/2 Model 70-A21, the Compaq 386/25, and the 25386X Model 150 from AdvancedLogic Research (ALR).andP;  In addition, we shall use benchmark results from aprevious review of the Sun386i Model 250 (&quot;Tested Mettle&quot;, Vol.andP;  7 No.andP;  1).andO;We will also review different operating system offerings from IBM, The SantaCruz Operation (SCO), Microport, Interactive Systems Corp. (ISC), and SunMicrosystems.andM;The Intel 80386 chip is the dominant processor in the high-endpersonal-computer market.andP;  It has a large virtual memory address space,32-bit data and address busses, and a high MIPS rating.andP;  It is widelyavailable in relatively low-cost personal computers from many manufacturers.andO;For these reasons, among others, a number of UNIX versions have been portedto the 386 platforms.andM;SCO Xenix has a long history of offering UNIX versions that run onIntel-based PCs.andP;  The most recent, the 386 versions, are the most robust.andO;The fact that a large number of applications are designed to run under Xenixis due, in part at least, to its very large installed base.andP;  SCO hasindicated that it intends to merge SCO Xenix with an ATandamp;T-derived UNIX; thatmerged product is expected to be available later this year.andM;Both Microport and ISC have taken versions of ATandamp;T System V/386 and ported itto generic 386-based personal computers.andP;  These versions can run on machinesfrom many manufacturers, support a wide variety of peripheral options, andserve as a common software environment across the range of personalcomputers.andP;  Generally speaking, versions for the IBM PS/2 family areavailable later--typically, several months later--than versions that run on386 machines with the PC AT bus.andM;PS/2 AIX is IBM's version of UNIX designed specifically to run on its PS/2product line.andP;  First released in March of this year, this new AIX has clearroots in AIX versions that run on the IBM RT system.andP;  There is a very highdegree of compatibility at the user level between the two products.andP;  However,since the RT uses a RISC processor and the PS/2 is based on Intel CISC chips,the base instruction sets of the two product lines are very different,requiring that applications written for one system be recompiled before theycan run on the other system.andM;The SunOS operating system is the UNIX used by Sun Microsystems in itsproduct line.andP;  There are versions for three architectures: the Sparc (RISC),68020, and 80386.andP;  As with IBM's AIX, there is a very high degree ofcompatibility among the three versions, but applications written for oneprocessor must be recompiled to run on another processor.andM;With these five operating systems we shall look at four different hardwaresystems.andP;  To ensure a fair comparison, all of the systems have 25 MHz 80386processors, 25 MHz 80387 floating-point co-processors, and at least 32 KB ofcache memory.andP;  Display, and memory and disk sizes, unfortunately, varyslightly among the systems reviewed, but the disk size on all the systems isat least 110 MB, with a system memory of 6 MB on all except one--theSun386i--where it is 8 MB.andM;Because the Sun386i was examined in a previous review, we will not discussthis workstation in detail here, but we will use its features and especiallyits performance for comparison, referring the reader to the earlier articlefor specific information.andP;  The configuration reviewed has 8 MB of systemmemory and a 5 1/4-inch hard disk drive with a disk capacity of 327 MB.andO;Display resolution is 1152 x 900 pixels.andM;The IBM PS/2 70-A21 uses an 80386/80387 combination running at 25 MHz.andP;  Ourtest system has a 120 MB disk, and 6 MB of system memory, and a standard 640x 480 pixel VGA display.andP;  The other two products in the PS/2 Model 70 familyhave 16 and 20 MHz processors, and neither of those systems has a cachememory.andM;The base hardware cost of a PS/2 70-A21 is $11,295, but the complete systemas configured for our tests costs $16,103.andP;  In addition, the AIX software andcompilers cost $1866, the ISC operating system and compilers cost $1985, andSCO Xenix and compilers cost $2585.andM;The Compaq 386/25 also uses an 80386/80387 combination running at 25 MHz.andP;  Inthe review machine there is a 3 1/2-inch, 110 MB hard disk (manufactured byConner Peripherals), 6 MB of system memory, and a Compaq VGA card, for adisplay resolution of 640 x 480.andP;  There are several members in the CompaqDeskpro family--to which the 386/25 belongs--with clock speeds starting at 16MHz.andP;  The low-end product currently uses the 80386SX, a chip similar to the80386 but with a 32-bit internal bus and a 16-bit external bus.andM;The base price of a Compaq 386/25 is $10,299, but as configured for ourtesting, the system price is $17,479.andP;  In addition, ISC UNIX and compilerscost $1985, Microport UNIX and compilers cost $1642, and SCO Xenix andcompilers cost $2585.andM;ALR's 25386 FlexCache system, like the others, uses a 25 MHz 80386/80387combination.andP;  The review configuration has a 150 MB, 5 1/4-inch hard diskdrive, 6 MB of system memory, and a 640 x 480 pixel VGA display.andP;  At thistime, this is the high end of the company's product line, which contains 16and 20 MHz systems as well.andM;The base price of the ALR system is $9517.andP;  Configured as required for ourtesting, the system costs $14,983, the least expensive of the three systemsexamined.andP;  SCO Xenix is bundled with the ALR computer system.andP;  In addition,though, the software development system and FORTRAN compiler together cost$1790.andP;  For these prices, each system reviewed has at least 110 MB of diskstorage, 6 MB of system memory, a VGA display card and color monitor, a101-key keyboard, an 80387 floating-point unit, an operating system, and Cand FORTRAN compilers.andM;There are many similarities between the IBM, Compaq, and ALR systems.andP;  TheCompaq 386/25 and the ALR 25386X are based on the original PC-AT bus,although both have their main memories on separate high-performance 32-bitbusses.andP;  The IBM PS/2 70, on the other hand, uses IBM's Microchannelarchitecture.andP;  Another disparity is that the Compaq and ALR systems have 51/4-inch floppy disks while the IBM system has 3 1/2-inch disks, but supportfor both diskette sizes are available as options on all three systems.andP;  The80387 implemented in the review machines is an option on each, as is the VGAcolor display on the ALR and the Compaq; VGA is standard on the IBM system.andM;The ALR system is a floor-standing tower system, whereas the Compaq 386/25and the IBM PS/2 70 are desktop models (the IBM system is smaller than theCompaq).andP;  Both the ALR and IBM systems have 64 KB of static RAM for cache,but the Compaq system has 32 KB of static cache RAM.andP;  Although the Weitekfloating-point math coprocessor is supported under the Microport and ISCoperating systems on the Compaq 386/25, and would provide substantiallybetter floating-point performance than the 80387, we did not use the Weitekfloating-point chip for our tests--it is not available on the PS/2 70, and itis not currently supported under SCO Xenix.andM;For expansion purposes, the IBM PS/2 70 has three Microchannel slots.andP;  TheALR 25386 has four AT-style expansion slots and the Compaq 386/25 has five.andO;Both the ALR and Compaq systems actually have seven expansion slots, butseveral are used for disk controllers and VGA adapters; the IBM system hasits VGA adapter and disk-controller built onto the motherboard.andP;  Maximummemory for the IBM and Compaq products is 16 MB, for the ALR system it is 14MB.andM;IBM has an 8514A video-adapter card that provides 1024 x 768 pixelresolution.andP;  This card plugs into the Microchannel bus, but can also be usedas the primary output device if the VGA's 640 x 480 resolution isinsufficient.andP;  Using this board, IBM supports a 16-inch color monitor, aswell as a 19-inch monochrome monitor.andP;  The higher resolution would be usefulfor CAD/CAM or X Windows applications.andP;  Recently, Compaq has introduced agraphics product with similar resolution but we have not yet obtained thissubsystem for review.andP;  While the IBM 8514A is supported by X Windows underAIX, the new Compaq board is not yet supported by ISC for its X Windowsproduct.andM;PurchasingandM;The Compaq, IBM, and ALR systems are all widely available.andP;  IBM and Compaqhave a very strong presence in the retail store channel.andP;  ALR is a smallercompany, but purchasing any of these products should not be a problem.andO;However, IBM has said PS/2 supplies will be limited during the first half of1989, so that any particular PS/2 system may not be available from stock atmost places.andM;As is usual with systems sold primarily through the retail store channel,discounts from list price are common.andP;  Typical IBM and Compaq prices seem tobe discounted 25 percent from list at many stores, so purchasers shouldalways do comparative shopping.andP;  Moreover, these systems are commodityproducts, and many of their components are interchangeable.andP;  VGA monitors,for example, all seem to have the same interface and can be usedinterchangeably, so it is not necessary to purchase the monitor produced fora specific vendor's machine.andP;  Similarly, all 80387 chips come from Intel, socomparative shopping for this part (if it is required) can save the purchaserseveral hundred dollars.andM;Many computer stores sell SCO Xenix as their multiuser operating system.andO;Microport UNIX and ISC UNIX are obtained fairly easily as well, although theyare available in far fewer places than is the SCO product.andP;  IBM's AIX is newand its general availability from a resellers' stock is not yet clear.andO;However, as an IBM product AIX is likely to be widely available, since itwill probably become a stock item with many IBM resellers.andM;Thus, neither the software nor the hardware in any of these systems shouldpresent a problem where purchasing is concerned, and hefty discounts shouldbe found on these products even when buying them in low quantities (likeone).andP;  Currently, the UNIX-based uses for these systems are piggybacking onthe very competitive MS-DOS PC market, ensuring competitive pricing and wideavailability.andM;Slightly more obscure products, such as Weitek math co-processors or unusualdisplay adapter/monitor combinations are often not stocked by retail stores.andO;Even on factory orders, however, delivery times in the two-to-four week rangewould be the worst case.andP;  Discounts also seem lower on these special-orderitems.andM;InstallationandM;Hardware installation on these systems is just like that on any other PC.andO;Option boards often come separately, but putting a PC option into a system isa very easy task.andP;  Floating-point chips must be inserted more carefully andhave orientations that are often not well documented, but even here there isrelatively little difficulty.andP;  Adding RAM is likewise not difficult, althoughit involves inserting cards or modules into unique positions and in veryspecific sequences.andP;  Hardware installation of a PC system should not takemore than an hour from start to finish, for any of the systems reviewed here.andM;After the hardware has been placed in the system unit, a setup program mustbe run to place information unique to the system configuration into batterybacked-up RAM.andP;  This program is supplied by the system manufacturer and isself-configuring for the systems reviewed here.andP;  After hardware installationand setup have been accomplished, the procedures differ depending upon thesoftware being installed.andM;All the operating systems we installed were delivered on floppy diskette.andO;The number of diskettes varied depending upon the operating system and itsoptions, ranging from 20 to 50.andM;Of the systems examined in this review, only the ALR system comes with SCOXenix installed.andP;  We only needed to install the software development package(including the C compiler) and the SCO FORTRAN compiler (supplied to SCO byLPI).andP;  The installation of the software development package is done using anSCO Xenix utility, while the FORTRAN installs using tar commands.andP;  Thisprocess is easy, and well-described in the SCO documentation.andM;An entire SCO Xenix installation takes several hours, depending on the sizeof the disk in the system.andP;  It is straightforward and is normally successful,if the defaults provided in the installation procedure are followed.andP;  As isalways true with SCO Xenix, there are several strings of characters that mustbe entered to activate the installed software.andP;  These serial numbers arefound on special sheets in the Xenix documentation and must be carefullyprotected against loss--Xenix will not work until these codes have beenentered.andP;  There is one set of codes for the base operating system, one forsoftware development, one for graphics, and one set for text processing.andM;Microport and ISC UNIX installations are fairly similar.andP;  Agains, each takesseveral hours, each is unique in the set of commands required, and eachdemands substantial operator intervention during the installation process.andO;In both of these UNIX versions, the time-consuming step in installation isthe disk-formatting procedure.andM;The IBM AIX system we installed came on 48 diskettes, more than were neededfor any other operating system we evaluated.andP;  This is because morre moresoftware options are available on the IBM operating system than on the otherUNIX operating systems.andP;  AIX comes on 1.44 MB, 3-1/2-inch diskettes, and ourmeasurements indicate that these disks are read faster during theinstallation process than are 5-1/4-inch diskettes on other systems.andO;Although inserting many diskettes into a system during installation is neverfun, at least with the IBM the diskettes are read rapidly enough to keep theinstaller busy.andM;For some optional software products on each of the operating systems a kernelreconfiguration is required.andP;  X Windows, for example, on both the IBM AIXsystem and the ISC UNIX system requires that the kernel be rebuilt.andP;  IBM AIXdoes this automatically, while ISC requires that the user do it manually.andP;  Wefound the installation scripts on the IBM system easier to use than those onany of the other operating systems.andP;  All optional products from IBM areinstalled with the same installation utility.andP;  This is not necessarily thecase with the other operating systems; whereas IBM currently supplies all ofits own products, other vendors' operating systems sometimes depend onthird-party software suppliers, and installation procedures vary.andM;Support and DocumentationandM;The three machines have comparable hardware support available throughcomputer stores.andP;  IBM also services its PCs through its field service force.andO;Given the wide availability of these personal computers, we do not believethat finding hardware service for any of these products will be difficult.andO;The quality of the service will vary depending upon the retail store orsupplier, but we are not worried about the availability of hardware supporton these products.andM;We have more concern for the availability of support for the operatingsystems.andP;  We sought technical support from SCO, ISC, and Microport, using thetelephone service number provided.andP;  The quality of answers we received wasmixed--sometimes the response was adequate, but other times we receivedincorrect answers or none at all.andP;  For standard installations, thedocumentation should be sufficient to make the system work.andP;  Beyond that, weare not convinced that the technical support hotlines will be sufficient forsolving complex problems.andM;In previous columns we have discussed the problems with UNIX support throughthe retail channel, and this continues to be a concern here.andP;  Adequate UNIXsoftware support is not available through most retail stores.andP;  This seemsespecially true for windowing, networking, and compiler problems.andM;We do not know what IBM's plans for AIX support are.andP;  Clearly it expects itsresellers to support the products they sell, but we hope that there willeventually be a toll-free number for additional technical support as well.andM;We have always found IBM AIX manuals quite good, and the AIX PS/2 manuals areno exception.andP;  Of the operating systems reviewed here, IBM clearly has thebest set of documentation with respect to both organization and concent.andP;  SCOmanuals are adequate, but a little dry.andP;  SCO manuals also have a tendency tocontain errors because they are not always current.andM;We find the ISC and Microport manuals lacking in both completeness andcoherency.andP;  While Microport, for example, supplies Greenhills C with itsoperating system, the documentation for this product is hidden, less thancomplete, and difficult to use.andP;  ISC supplies ATandamp;T/Prentice Hall manuals aspart of its UNIX documentation, and also supplies the O'Reilly X11documentation as part of its X Windows documentation.andP;  Even after severalcompletely new versions of ISC UNIX we still do not understand the manual'sorganizational plan: sections seem to appear almost at random in the severalbinders.andM;Operation and Ease of UseandM;Basically, we consider the hardware supplied by the three vendors to beessentially equivalent.andP;  There are many differences, of course, and somepeople will be very strongly attracted to one particular product rather thananother, but from our perspective the hardware specifications are similarenough that only specific customer requirements can differentiate theproducts.andM;The operating systems of the five vendors, however, are quite different.andO;Both IBM and ISC have announced several optional features, such as NFSconnectivity, but not all of these are yet delivered.andP;  SCO Xenix andMicroport UNIX do not currently supply X Windows directly for their operatingsystems, whereas IBM and ISC do.andP;  TCP/IP networking is included--or isavailable--with the IBM, ISC, and Microport versions of UNIX.andP;  An MS-DOSemulation package is available with the same three operating systems.andM;Compiler options on IBM's AIX include FORTRAN, C, and Pascal with AIX, aswell as the portable C compiler (cc).andP;  These compilers use a commoncompilation switch syntax and have very similar performance levels.andP;  Thestatus availability of compilers for other operating systems varies, andshould be confirmed with each operating system supplier.andP;  For ISC, SCO, andMicroport systems, we have used a number of compilers available fromthird-party software vendors and found those preferable to the compilersavailable from the operating system vendor.andM;One of the few problems encountered among the products reviewed here was theLPI FORTRAN compiler supplied by SCO for Xenix.andP;  Full optimization with thiscompiler produced incorrect results on several different tests, mostsignificantly on the Linpack test used for measuring MFLOPS.andP;  There isnothing unusual about the FORTRAN code used in this test, and LPI was theonly compiler to generate bad code for any of the tests we ran.andM;IBM seems to offer more products directly than the other operating systemsuppliers.andP;  One such product is a DOS server utility set for interconnectingAIX with MS-DOS systems.andP;  In our evaluation IBM AIX has a strong edge overthe other operating systems in its broad plan for interconnection with othersystems.andP;  Since it is the only company in this review supplying both hardwareand software, IBM seems to be better able to sketch out its plans forinterconnection with hardware and software products than the other operatingsystem suppliers.andM;Because of the availability of X Windows on IBM AIX and ISC UNIX, we believethose systems are easier to use than Microport or SCO Xenix.andP;  SCO provides abetter set of administration shells than any of the other vendors, whichmakes for easier system administration.andP;  Aside from this, both user andsystem administrator functions are comparable among the operating systems.andO;All are clearly UNIX systems, providing the essential base set of UNIXfeatures and facilities (with different extensions as discussed above), andall require standard UNIX administration techniques.andP;  Full windowing on a 640x 480 display is acceptable, though barely, and IBM supports X11 on its 1024x 768 display.andP;  ISC also supports higher than VGA resolution displays, butthe boards it supports are from several different suppliers and none of thesealternative boards are widely available.andM;IBM's AIX has an underlying set of maintenance and installation utilities notfound in other systems.andP;  This is both a blessing and a curse.andP;  For someoneknowledgeable in the use of these, they provide easy manipulation of thedevices and partitions in the AIX system.andP;  For someone first approaching AIX,these utilities present a learning problem and might slow down the process ofmaking the system usable.andM;We have found some bugs in all of the operating systems that we tested forthis article.andP;  Surprisingly, perhaps, AIX seems to have no more problems thanany of the other operating systems, even though it is a brand new productcompared to the others, which are more &quot;mature&quot;.andP;  With the exception of oneminor software library bug, and the fact that the syntax of the compilercommands themselves changed, all the source code that we ran on IBM RT AIXported easily to AIX PS/2.andP;  We find that all of the systems are both usableand reasonable with respect to the stability of the operating system and lackof major problems.andM;PerformanceandM;For several different systems with very similar hardware and features,performance constitutes an interesting criterion for differentiation.andP;  In thefollowing discussion of performance it is important to remember that all ofthe systems run on 25 MHz processors with cache, and that all have 6 MB ofRAM, except for the Sun386i, which has 8 MB of RAM.andM;Figure 1 shows comparative results for Dhrystone, Whetstone, and Linpack(MFLOPS) for eight combinations of 386 machines and operating systems.andP;  Anumber of patterns in this data were not expected, and serve to reflect theunderlying hardware of the systems.andM;The Dhrystone is a measure of CPU (no floating-point and no disk activity)performance.andP;  There is a difference of 50 percent between the highestDhrystone performance number--that of the IBM PS/2 70 with AIX--and thelowest--the Compaq 386/25 running SCO Xenix.andP;  Other Dhrystone performancenumbers are spread out between these two values.andP;  From this first comparisonit is clear that the compiler is very significant to Dhrystoneperformance--on PS/2 70 hardware, the Dhrystone benchmark has a widevariation in reported values.andP;  This shows the difference in compilers acrossthe operating systems.andP;  The SCO compiler, along with the SunOS C compiler onthe Sun386i, return the lowest Dhrystone values in our test set.andP;  From theSCO Dhrystone results--taking into account results of other tests we haverun--it seems that the ALR 25386 FlexCache system is the fastest box we have,consistently running its tasks faster than other machines running SCO.andO;However, it is also clear that SCO does not have the best compilers (either Cor FORTRAN) among the operating systems tested.andM;There is some difference in the Dhrystone performance of the IBM PS/2 and theCompaq 386/25 when running ISC UNIX, using the same C compiler on bothplatforms.andP;  The difference (128 Dhrystones) is small enough that it is notclear whether there is any significant hardware difference between the twosystems for CPU-intensive activities.andM;The IBM PS/2 running AIX gets the best Dhrystone rating.andP;  Although we haveexamined a number of C compilers on these boxes, including Metaware Hi C andGreenhills C, the 12,679 Dhrystones rating for the IBM PS/2 running AIX isthe highest Dhrystone value we have found among 25 MHz 80386 systems.andP;  Thisprimarily attests to the fact that IBM has the best compiler technology forthis kind of test.andM;A Whetstone is a measure of floating-point performance, includingtrigonometric functions.andP;  Again, ALR has the best performance for a systemrunning SCO, but here performance is dictated by the FORTRAN compiler.andP;  Forall of the SCO tests we used the LPI compiler supplied by SCO, so anydifferences in SCO performance arise from hardware influences.andM;We are surprised that the Sun386i did not do better on the floating-pointtests--its performance was lowest.andP;  We have been unable to determine whetherthe problem lies in the hardware, the software, or a combination of both.andM;Comparing performance of the IBM and Compaq machines running SCO Xenix, andthe Compaq running Microport, is also revealing.andP;  For all of thesecombinations we used the same version of Microway's FORTRAN compiler.andP;  Theperformance difference between ISC and Microport on the Compaq (2205 versus2200 using single precision arithmetic, or 2064 versus 2057 with doubleprecision arithmetic) is minor and therefore not significant.andP;  But theWhetstone values for the IBM PS/2 70 running ISC UNIX with Microway FORTRAN(2089 and 1972) suggest that the floating-point hardware of the IBM systemis, for some reason, a little slower than that of the Compaq system.andM;However, when using IBM VS FORTRAN on the PS/2 70 running AIX, the Whetstonerating is the highest of any of the systems tested.andP;  Again, this suggeststhat the compiler technology on the IBM is measurably better than that on theother systems.andP;  From other tests run at Workstation Laboratories, we knowthat AIX's math library is quite good and that this helps the Whetstonerating for IBM.andP;  We do not believe that the IBM compiler eliminated muchsource code for either the Dhrystones or the Whetstones test; rather, webelieve the generated code and automatic inlining are the reasons forsuperior performance.andP;  (Inlining is the ability some advanced compilers haveto eliminate subroutine overhead by replacing each subroutine call with thesubroutine's actual source code.)andP;  The Linpack rating again shows a similarpattern.andP;  For systems running SCO, the ALR is the fastest.andP;  The Sun386ibrings up the rear for all systems.andP;  The Microway compilers, under ISC orMicroport UNIX, yield the best performance rating for the Compaq.andP;  The samecompiler running on the IBM PS/2 results in a lower performance value, whichindicates that the IBM's floating-point hardware is somewhat slower than thatof other systems.andP;  Here, for a change, the IBM VS FORTRAN does not do quiteas well as the other compilers, returning 0.290 MFLOPS, compared to 0.306MFLOPS for the Microway compiler on the same system.andM;The numbers presented here seem destined to be controversial.andP;  Basically,with identical compilers, it is possible to measure accurately parts ofoverall system performance, and on one hardware platform, it is possible tocompare the quality of different compilers.andP;  Based on the test results shownin Figure 1, and those from a variety of other programs that we use forfloating-point and compute-intensive tests, we believe that IBM has the bestcompiler technology, that AIX may be the fastest system for mostCPU-intensive tests, and the ALR system has the fastest hardware forfloating-point intensive applications.andM;We examined several C and FORTRAN compilers on some of these systems, but forreasons of space, not all can be discussed here.andP;  Although the numbers shownin Figure 1 would be somewhat different with other compilers, the conclusionsnoted above would not change.andP;  Furthermore, although there are some inherentproblems with Dhrystone and Whetstone tests, we feel that the results shownin Figure 1 are representative of CPU and floating-point performance of thesystems reviewed as they would perform on a number of programs.andM;Of course, the performance of all the systems tested in this run is subjectto change.andP;  At some point, SCO Xenix will be merged with UNIX, and thecompilers that run under ISC or Microport will be available under SCO'smerged operating system.andP;  At that time, the slightly faster hardware on theALR system should allow it to achieve the best performance of the non-IBMmachines.andM;Figure 2 shows sequential disk-transfer rates, in KB per second, for thesystems under discussion in this review.andP;  This test reads the first 2 MB ofan 8 MB file, with four different block sizes.andP;  Again, there are a number ofpatterns in this data that are interesting.andM;When the performance of the ALR machine running SCO and the PS/2 running ISCis compared to that of the Compaq running both these systems, the differencesare stunning.andP;  It is important to note that the ISC version used on the PS/270 is an older operating system having known lower performance.andP;  Diskperformance doing sequential reads on the Compaq is uniformly good, as it ison the Sun386i.andP;  The Sun386i has an SCSI disk drive and interface, as doesthe Compaq.andM;Both IBM and ALR use ESDI interfaces to their drives, which seems to lowerperformance.andP;  Across all of the systems we have examined, including those inthis review, SCSI disks often provide performance superior to that obtainedusing ESDI drives on sequential tests, so the pattern here is not entirelyunexpected.andM;IBM's AIX achieves reasonable sequential transfer rates.andP;  The other twooperating systems tested on the IBM do not do as well.andP;  While it is clearthat the sequential rates on the IBM are not currently as high as those oneither the Compaq or the Sun system, it is also clear that the performance ofthe PS/2 70 can be improved by a factor of three, given different operatingsystem software.andP;  Note that the Compaq system is running a more recentversion of SCO software than are the ALR and IBM systems.andM;Figure 3 shows test results for the systems reviewed when randomly reading 2MB from an 8 MB file.andP;  It is clear that for this test the Sun386i is thefastest of the systems examined--and by a considerable margin.andP;  We believethis is due to the hardware, memory size, and the structure of the filesystem.andM;Among the others, the Compaq running SCO Xenix is the fastest, followed bythe PS/2 70 running AIX, and the Compaq machine running ISC or Microport.andO;Given the relatively slow random-access seek rate of the IBM hard drive, weare surprised that the AIX system does so well.andP;  We are also surprised thatthe ALR system running SCO does not perform better, given the average accesstime of less than 20 milliseconds for the ALR drive.andM;Figure 4 shows Workstation Laboratories' Khornerstone benchmark rating forthe systems in this review.andP;  The Khornerstone test yields a normalizednumerical rating of performance based on a mix of floating-point, processor,and disk-intensive tests (21 in all), as well as another value representingthe total time it takes to execute all of the tests.andM;As shown, there is a very broad range of Khornerstone values for the systemsreviewed, from a low of 3917 Khornerstones for the ALR system to the highest,6800 Khornerstones for the IBM PS/2 70.andP;  This is a far wider variation thanwe expected to find.andP;  The Khornerstone test has a run-to-run variation ofabout 2 percent due to lack of precision in the UNIX time command used totime this test, so only differences in Khornerstone values of more than 5percent are significant from a performance viewpoint.andM;The Khornerstone test is made up of four parts, one each for the processor,floating-point, disk, and total time segments.andP;  Figure 5 shows the four valuecomponents for each of the systems tested.andP;  This is useful for determiningthe origin of the performance level--be it good or bad--because theKhornerstone rating itself is a mixture of test results.andP;  Also, examining theseparate components of the Khornerstone test may give a better indication ofwhich systems will do well on certain applications.andM;The &quot;control&quot; line in Figure 5 is a system that was chosen in 1986 torepresent then-current technology.andP;  It is a 16.67 MHz 68020 computer which atthat time cost about $40,000.andP;  Clearly, all of the systems tested for thisreview are faster overall (in terms of Khornerstones) than the controlsystem, but the mix of individual performance components is interesting.andO;Among the machines, disk performance is not uniformly better than the 1986standard--the Sun386i's is twice as good, but only four of the seven otherconfigurations have disk performance as high as the standard's, the threeothers being about half as fast.andP;  Floating-point performance is uniformlybetter, ranging from 150 to over 300 percent higher than that of the control.andO;CPU performance is also uniformly higher, generally about 200 percent higherthan the 1986 standard.andP;  Thus, although the Khornerstone values shown for the80386 systems are substantially higher than for the control, it isperformance in the floating-point segment of the test that has increased themost.andP;  CPU speed has doubled, but disk performance has not increased nearlyas much.andM;Also evident in Figure 5 is the relative closeness among the CPU performancevalues shown for most of the systems.andP;  Apparently there is not a lot ofvariation among the systems in terms of raw integer compute power or compilerperformance.andP;  The differences that do occur, although small, are measurable,and the IBM PS/2 running AIX comes out on top.andP;  There is far more disparilybetween the floating-point numbers.andP;  It is clear from Figure 5 that machinesrunning SCO Xenix have some problems with floating-point performance.andP;  Infact, this is traced to the C math libraries in SCO Xenix that are noticeablyslower than the math libraries in the other operating systems.andP;  While FORTRANfloating-point performance is not much lower for machines running SCO, thosemachines do exhibit lower performance for floating-point tests written in C.andM;Finally, there is more variation than we expected in both CPU andfloating-point performance for the three SCO systems.andP;  The 21 Khornerstonetests run sequentially, and we note minor time differences for individualtests, which accumulate to give the larger differences in the Khornerstonenumbers shown in Figure 5.andP;  Even though it appears that the ALR is a slightlyfaster system than the others on some individual tests, the ALR shows aslightly different result for the entire suite of tests.andM;Price/PerformanceandM;Our price/performance measure is determined by dividing the list price of asystem by its Khornerstone rating.andP;  Figure 6 shows the results of this testfor the eight hardware-software combinations.andP;  Most of the configurations inthis review rate as &quot;good&quot;: the PS/2 70 running SCO Xenix, at $4.71 perKhornerstone, is about average, while the same machine running AIX, at $2.64per Khornerstone, is excellent.andP;  the other systems, with ratings in the rangeof $3.18 to $4.28, are good when compared to all of the computer systems wehave evaluated to date.andM;The PS/2 70 running AIX has the best price/performance rating because it doeswell on floating-point and integer tests, a result primarily of very goodcompilers and libraries.andP;  The PS/2 70 running AIX has a price that iscompetitive with the others, as well as a slight performance advantage.andP;  Thesecond best unit with regard to price/performance, the Compaq system runningISC UNIX, is slightly more expensive than the IBM and has a slightly lowerperformance.andM;The Sun system offers both a higher resolution screen (1152 x 900 pixels) anda larger capacity disk drive than the other systems.andP;  Both of thesecontribute to its higher cost, and there is no corresponding performanceincrease.andP;  The ALR system has a 140 MB disk, slightly larger than eitherCompaq's or IBM's, which similarly contributes to a higher overall price.andM;As always, our caveats concerning price/performance scores include the factthat they do not take into account graphics capabilities (or their absence),or performance in a networked or multiuser environment.andP;  The rating is basedentirely upon, and therefore is only as valid as, the Khornerstone testitself.andP;  Minor differences in configuration also contribute to thedifferences in performance shown in Figure 6.andM;Report CardandM;Three report cards are given in this review, one for each of the hardwareplatforms.andP;  It is important to remember that many of the grades on the reportcard reflect the software used in the individual configurations.andP;  We chosennot to separate our evaluation of the hardware and software components ofeach system.andM;Operating system installation is about the same for all three, except for theALR machine, which comes with the base software pre-installed.andP;  IBM'sinstallation scripts work better than any other procedure, giving it a slightedge.andM;Documentation for AIX is quite good, and SCO Xenix documentation is average,but we find ISC documentation inadequate.andP;  All of the manuals are usable, butsome problems are difficult to solve using the ISC manual set alone.andM;All of the systems have expansion slots.andP;  IBM, with only three slots, has thefewest, and maximizing memory or adding a higher resolution video card willeach take a slot.andP;  ALR and Compaq have four and five slots available,respectively, and memory can be expanded to the maximum without having to useany slots.andP;  Both ALR and Compaq use a slot for a VGA graphics card, so ahigher resolution card would replace an existing card, not use a free cardslot.andM;IBM's AIX, and Microport's and ISC's UNIX have X Windows and MSDOS windowingenvironments.andP;  Other than windowing, all the operating systems present thesame user interface with the same keyboards and displays.andP;  IBM provides alittle more assistance with the maintenance and running of the system, whilethe system administration login for SCO Xenix allows many functions to bedone from a friendly shell.andM;For such similar hardware, many performance differences exist among themachines.andP;  When processor performance tests are run on the same software, itappears that the IBM PS/2 70 and the ALR 25386X have similar processorperformance, and that Compaq's is slightly lower, while in floating-pointperformance tests, the Compaq and the ALR show similar values, and IBM'sperformance is a little lower.andP;  ALR seems to have a very slight edge in bothof these areas.andM;However, if the performance values of different hardware-softwarecombinations on CPU or floating-point intensive tests are compared, AIXcompilers clearly provide a boost that allows IBM hardware to perform betteron many of the tests.andM;For disk performance, Compaq with its SCSI drive is the performance winner inthe sequential test, but in the random test--which has very mixedresults--the Sun386i is dominant.andP;  The ALR/SCO combination suffers noticeablyin disk performance.andM;Overall, both the Compaq and the IBM systems get a &quot;good&quot; rating, with theALR system achieving an &quot;average&quot; grade.andP;  A future ALR box with a newer ormerged UNIX operating system would undoubtedly improve enough in diskperformance to achieve a &quot;good&quot; rating.andP;  IBM's disk performance is a littlelow and Compaq's price/performance is not quite good enough to push either ofthem into the outstanding category.andM;It is important to remember that the benchmark results shown here reflectjust a few of many qualities of any given system.andP;  Furthermore, the resultsprovided are mixed--even for fairly similar tests, one system is not alwaysfaster than the others.andP;  Finally, differences of a percent or two inbenchmark performance are probably smaller than will ever be noticed directlyby a user.andP;  It is interesting to note that for many tests the choice ofoptimization level for compilation provides more performance difference thanwe measure between different hardware platforms.andP;  Although all tests were runwith full optimization, sometimes finding the proper switch for fulloptimization on the compile line is hard with the supplied documentation.andM;Each of the machines and operating systems tested in this review isimpressive in its own right.andP;  If I could choose one combination, I would pickthe Compaq or ALR box running the IBM AIX operating system.andP;  but thesecombinations are unlikely to be available, since no plans to port AIX tonon-IBM systems have been announced.andP;  My second choice would be the PS/2Model 70 running AIX, followed closely by the Compaq 386/25 running ISC UNIX.andO;Of the operating systems tested, SCO Xenix seems to be the weakest inperformance; although it does very well on the Compaq system it isparticularly weak only on some floating-point tests and with some diskdrives.andP;  However, a very large number of applications run under SCO Xenix,and this will certainly be the deciding factor for many users.andP;  A mergedXenix/UNIX product, allowing users to maintain Xenix compatibility whileachieving UNIX disk performance, and gaining access to other UNIX compilers,will certainly be an attractive product as well.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
