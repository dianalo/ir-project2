Now they have a good excuse.   The government statistics office said that westernGermany's gross national product, adjusted for inflation andseasonal factors, grew a surprising 2.5% in the first quarterfrom the fourth period, and 4.2% from the year-earlierquarter.</LP><TEXT>   Many economists already were adjusting their GNP growthestimates for the full year nearer to 3% from 2.5%, puttingwestern Germany in step with the average 3% growth rateprojected for the 24 countries of the Organization forEconomic Coordination and Development. GNP measures acountry's total output of goods and services.   For German officials, the economic data couldn't be moretimely. Brisk growth at home strengthens their hand whenresisting pressure to join an international round of interestrate cuts.   &quot;Western Germany is in a boom phase. Capacities are full.Lowering interest rates in the short term doesn't fit intothis landscape,&quot; said a Finance Ministry official. &quot;Thesefigures confirm this.&quot;   Bonn argues that monetary policy must be kept tight tooffset inflationary pressures caused by the high cost ofrebuilding eastern Germany's economy. Much of westernGermany's GNP increase is subsidized growth, fueled this yearby 140 billion marks ($80 billion) in deficit spending. Thatcompares with a public-sector deficit of only 21.6 billionmarks in 1989, prior to unification.   &quot;We're already exporting growth and are acting as alocomotive for Europe,&quot; said Ulrich Beckmann, an economistfor Deutsche Bank AG in Frankfurt. &quot;We're spending a lot ofmoney in eastern Germany, but much of it is coming back asorders and stimulating the economy.&quot; A 2.5% western Germangrowth rate for 1991, he said, &quot;now looks to be the minimum.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
