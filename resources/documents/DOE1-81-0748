While this originates from Alicein Wonderland, it adequately describes the feeling at the end of a bienniumwhen 2000+ articles are perused before compiling this review. Duringthe last two years articles have appeared which solved problems thatexperience and history suggest never were a problem, while other articlespresent solutions to problems that were thought to be insoluble, newideas, explanations, and instrumentation push at the frontiers whilelast year's sparks are still trying to initiate a flame. This reviewscovers the fundamentals in the field of atomic absorption, atomic fluorescence,and flame emission spectrometry since the last review and provides selectedcoverage of applications. The companion reviews entitled Emission Spectrometryand Atomic Mass Spectrometry in this issue should also be consulted forcomplementary coverage of related topics. The selection criteria forthe applications cited in this review reflect the authors' opinion regardingjournal availability, appropriate central focus of the article, and noveltyof the approach.</TEXT></DOC>
