Homeland President Lucas Mangope accused the ANC of plotting tokill him and overthrow the government, a charge the ANC dismissedas ``absurd.''   It said the crackdown was part of a pattern of repression goingon in Bophuthatswana.   Thousands of blacks stayed home from work Monday in Pretoria,the South African capital, to protest electricity cuts in nearbyblack townships.   Authorities shut off electricity last week because residentsrefused to pay their bills to protest living conditions.   Police said seven blacks died in scattered violence inJohannesburg area, including five in a faction fight in Katlehongtownship to the southeast.   Organizers said the one-day work boycott also was designed toexpress opposition to the government in Bophuthatswana, nearPretoria.   Activists consider South Africa's 10 tribal homelands part ofthe apartheid system of racial segregation. They want the fourhomelands with nominal independence - Transkei, Ciskei, Venda andBophuthatswana - to be reincorporated into South Africa.   Mangope refuses to consider rejoining South Africa despitemounting opposition to his rule.   He claimed over state-run Radio Bophuthatswana he had evidenceof the alleged ANC plot to overthrow the government. PoliceCommissioner Maj. Gen. P.J. Seleke said 32 ANC members weredetained Monday in response.   ``It is surely no coincidence that (Mangope's) absurd claim thatthere is an ANC plot to assassinate him comes on the day whenthousands of people have stayed away from work in response to acall,'' by ANC-affiliated groups, an ANC statement said.   In Transkei, Ciskei and Venda, army members have staged coupsand developed good relations with the ANC. Only South Africarecognizes the sovereignty of the so-called independent homelands.   Most black workers in Pretoria took part in Monday's workaction, forcing shops that employ blacks to rely on white staff.   Residents and police clashed Saturday in Atteridgevilletownship, leaving two people dead and 18 injured. The governmentSunday imposed a 9 p.m.-4 a.m. curfew and gave police expandedpowers in Atteridgeville and nearby Saulsville.   Winnie Mandela, wife of ANC deputy president Nelson Mandela, onMonday visited the homes of the two people killed.   Police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd at one home as shearrived. The choking gas visibly affected Mrs. Mandela andjournalists gathered there.   Police spokeswoman Lt. Ida van Zweel said that in Katlehongtownship, Xhosa and Zulu tribal members battled with guns andknives at a squatter camp.   Also, a man was hacked to death and set afire in Sebokeng, southof Johannesburg. In Jouberton, southwest of the city, a youth diedwhen police fired on group throwing gasoline bombs at a policeman'shouse.</TEXT></DOC>
