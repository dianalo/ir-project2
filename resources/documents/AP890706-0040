(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal regulators have approved the nation'sfirst open-air field test of a genetically engineered virus for useas a pesticide.   Researchers hope the step will help them develop biological meansof destroying crop-damaging insects.   Researchers at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Researchwill test the virus on cabbage plants at Cornell University's NewYork State Agricultural Expriment Station in Geneva beginning laterthis month, said H. Alan Wood, the virologist who will direct thetest.   The test is designed to see if a genetically disabled virus willdisappear from the environment quickly after working on insects,rather than lingering in the field.   ``The ultimate goal of our project is to come up withenvironmentally safe viral pesticides for biological control ofinsect pests,'' Wood said Tuesday.   The test would be the first time a genetically altered virus wasreleased as an insecticide in the United States, said Fred Betz, abiologist at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Severalgenetically altered batcteria have been tested as has a geneticallyaltered virus that was tested by inoculating animals.   Scientists are aiming their test at the cabbage looper, a palegreen caterpillar that attacks more than a dozen kinds of vegetablesincluding cabbage, beets, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower,collards and kale.   The virus they are using is identical to naturally occurringstrains known as baculoviruses, which cause viral epidemics in manyagricultural and forest insect pests.   Researchers will remove a gene that provides a protective proteincoat from the virus. The disabled virus cannot survive long in theenvironment, so scientists will mix it with a naturally occurring,wild strain of the virus before spraying it.   Scientists hope the method will allow the virus to live longenough to work on insects without having it linger in theenvironment. If the test is successful, researchers hope to combinethe method of disabling the virus with genetic enhancements thatwould make the virus more deadly.   Despite their innate ability to kill insect pests, manybaculoviruses need to be genetically improved to be commerciallyviable, said Cornell entomologist Anthony M. Shelton, who iscollaborating on the test.   The field test will be conducted on a two-acre doughnut-shapedplot containing 20,000 cabbage plants, of which 2,500 plants in thecenter will be sprayed with the virus.   Wood said the surrounding plants will act as a buffer to preventthe spread of the virus, and as a control group.   Shelton and Wood said even if the disabled virus does spread,there would be no danger to humans and animals because baculovirusesinfect only invertebrates such as insects.   The EPA approved the field test after determining it posed noenvironmental or human health hazards.   The test plot will be monitored through 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
