One protocol consisted of repetitiveweek-long exposures to 300 ppm benzene (6 h/d x 5 d/wk) interrupted by2 weeks of non-exposure. The exposure pattern (1 week of exposure followedby 2 weeks of non-exposure) was continued until the death of the lastexposed animal. The second protocol consisted of exposures to 1200 ppmbenzene (6 h/d x 5 d/wk) for 10 weeks. Exposures were then terminatedand the animals allowed to live out their lives. For each protocol, appropriateagematched control mice received comparable exposure to filtered, conditionedair. The discontinuous exposure patterns mimic the patterns of exposureoften encountered in the workplace and, in addition, prolong the survivalof exposed animals so as to maximize potential tumorigenic responses.Both exposure protocols were markedly hematotoxic to both mouse strainsas measured by peripheral blood counts. Both strains of mice respondedto the intermittent 300 ppm benzene exposures with elevated incidencesof malignant tumors. Particularly noteworthy was a 35% incidence of zymbalgland tumors in the C57Bl mice. In contrast, only the CD-1 mice respondedto the 1200 ppm benzene exposures delivered over 10 weeks with elevatedtumor incidences. A 46% incidence of lung adenoma was particularly strikingin these mice. Neither of the benzene exposure protocols induced elevatedincidences of leukemia/lymphoma in either strain. These studies demonstratethat discontinuous exposures to benzene are tumorigenic and that a lifetimeexposure to benzene, even if delivered at a lower concentration and inan intermittent exposure pattern, is more tumorigenic than a short-termexposure to benzene.</TEXT></DOC>
