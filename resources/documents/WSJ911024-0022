Windows is a software &quot;interface&quot; -- a consistent set ofscreen images and commands through which a user can control acomputer. It promises to make IBM-compatible machines more&quot;user-friendly&quot; -- more like Apple's easy-to-use Macintosh.   Like the Mac, Windows lets users run programs and managefiles by using a &quot;mouse&quot; pointing device to manipulate littleon-screen pictures called &quot;icons&quot; that represent the programsand files, or by highlighting commands in plain English onelectronic menus.   But for many personal-computer owners, Windows isn't agood fit. To run to full advantage, it demands newer-modelmachines with lots of memory and disk space. It disappointssome users because of incompatibilities with some oldersoftware.   And it can be clumsy. For instance, there's a maddeningseparation between the parts of the program that manage filesand those that launch programs. It takes several steps tomove between them.   Some of this is unavoidable. Unlike the Mac, whosehardware and software are designed together by one company,Windows must run on a wide variety of IBM-compatiblecomputers and on top of Microsoft's aging MS-DOS operatingsystem.   And a mainstream IBM-compatible with Windows still costsless than a powerful color Mac.   For IBM-compatible owners who like the Mac-style interfacebut have trouble with Windows, there are two goodalternatives: Norton Desktop for Windows, from Symantec, andGeoWorks Ensemble, from GeoWorks.   Norton Desktop for Windows, designed to augment ratherthan replace Windows, is one of the best software values I'veever seen. For about $99, it not only fixes Windows' mostglaring flaws, but adds several &quot;utility&quot; programs that bythemselves are worth the price of the package.   The heart of Norton Desktop is a greatly improvedinterface. Displayed on a single screen are iconsrepresenting disk drives and programs that can be run. Thisis more like the Mac's interface than that of Windows.   There are many methods for running programs, by icons orcustom menus. Related programs and files can be groupedtogether. Files can be deleted simply by moving the iconrepresenting them on top of an eraser icon, or printed bymoving them onto a printer icon.   Norton Desktop shines in file management. Double-clickingon a disk-drive icon opens a two-pane window, with one sideshowing the directories on the disk and the other sideshowing the files in a directory. Files can be moved amongdirectories, or different disks, by simply moving the iconsrepresenting them from one window to another. The contents ofdocuments can be viewed with a click of the mouse.   The package also includes a complete disk-backup programthat operates automatically while you do other work, a fastand powerful file finder, a file &quot;undeleter&quot; to restoremistakenly erased documents, disk diagnostic software andmore.   About the only flaw in Norton Desktop is that it makesWindows load more slowly, though it seems to operate morequickly once it's going.   GeoWorks Ensemble is a little-known but worthy competitorfor Windows. Like Windows, it offers a Macintosh-typeinterface with a set of basic applications, including a wordprocessor, graphics program, communications program, notepad,calendar, address book and calculator. It uses icons and themouse to launch programs -- both its own and plain old MS-DOSsoftware -- and to manage your files.   But GeoWorks, available at discount stores for around$125, operates smoothly and speedily, even on older PCs withlimited memory and slower chips. And, to my way of thinking,its interface is more intuitive and less cluttered than thatof Windows.   Like Norton Desktop, GeoWorks operates more like aMacintosh than does Windows. It groups programs and filesinto folder and disk-drive icons that can be manipulated onthe screen, and lets you delete them by moving them to awastebasket icon.   Installation and documentation are first-rate, and thepackage includes a built-in font system that permits basicdesktop publishing even on inexpensive printers. The includedapplications are generally quite good, though the otherwisestrong word processor takes a page-by-page approach toformatting that can be frustrating.   The company says it will soon add a scaled-down version ofBorland International's Quattro Pro spreadsheet. And it hasalso said it will sell some of Ensemble's own embeddedapplications separately for well under $100 each. It has alsoreleased a demonstration version of the whole GeoWorkspackage for around $9.99.   GeoWorks has only one major drawback: The company has yetto attract any significant third-party vendors to writesoftware that uses its interface -- perhaps because itscompetition is giant Microsoft. You can run most regularMS-DOS software from the GeoWorks desktop, but the onlyapplications that make full use of its elegant interface arethose that come with it.   Still, GeoWorks is a good value. It can bring easier, moreproductive computing to desktops where Windows strikes out.</TEXT></DOC>
