(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man upset over his failing marriage sethis car on fire outside his in-laws' home, fired more than 50 roundsfrom an AK-47 assault rifle at them and then killed himself, policesaid.   ``It was like something out of a movie,'' said police Maj. JohnWood. ``Like some Vietnam story.''   Willie and Ella Mae West were uninjured in the shooting.   Curtis Sanders, 31, came to the couple's house about 5:45 a.m.Thursday but her husband didn't want to talk to him, Mrs. West said.   ``We went back to bed, and then we heard shots ringing and glassbreaking,'' Mrs. West said. ``We were waiting and hoping he wouldn'tcome in the door. He was tearing this house apart, and we knew hewanted to kill us.''   After firing from outside, Sanders shot the lock off the door andentered the living room, firing bullets at waist level. He thenfired several shots through the bedroom wall amongst a row ofphotographs of the Wests' children.   None of the other portraits were hit, but a bullet passed throughthe center of a picture of Brenda Sanders, his estranged wife. Shewas not at her parents' home.   Mrs. West dove to the floor and called police, as a bulletslashed her pillow. Two holes were visible in the headboard on thecouple's bed. Another bullet ripped through a chair.   West managed to grab his own shotgun _ with one shot in it _ fromthe closet and fired at Sanders.   ``Maybe that's what kept him from coming back here, that he knewwe had a weapon,'' Mrs. West said. West said he ducked back into hisbedroom and waited in terror for police to arrive.   About five minutes after the shooting began, Sanders killedhimself near the front door, police said. He had two small-calibershots in his chest. Muscogee County Coroner J. Donald Kilgore ruledthe cause of death a suicide.   Sanders had filled his pockets with ammunition and also took a12-gauge shotgun into the house, police Lt. Robert Matthews said.Investigators said 52 AK-47 bullets were fired.   Mrs. Sanders said her husband was embittered at the Army forgiving him a dishonorable discharge, angry at the rest of the worldfor not hiring him because of the discharge and embittered at hisin-laws for what he thought was interference with his dissolvingmarriage.</TEXT></DOC>
