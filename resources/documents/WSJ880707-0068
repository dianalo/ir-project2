Under a pact signed recently by President Reagan and Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, Japan will donate $4 million to invite U.S. scientists and engineers to the country, open research laboratories to Americans and boost the number of foreign researchers invited on scholarships to 200 from 28.    Washington long has demanded more funding and a commitment to balancing the flow of researchers and information, getting tough as critics -- especially U.S. industry -- call for an end to what they say has been Japan's free ride.    The Japan Center at the University of North Carolina estimates that 15,000 Japanese students and researchers enter U.S. institutions a year, five times the number of Americans going to Japan. Japanese technological exports hit $2.2 billion in fiscal 1986, while imports totaled $2.4 billion, over 80% from the U.S.    &quot;It's a big step but it's still symbolic,&quot; said Hiroshi Inose, head of the National Center for Science Information System.    &quot;We should establish a sort of system of substantial scale in terms of money, or university chairs and positions, and let this be understood by the Americans and the Europeans,&quot; said Mr. Inose, developer of the government's fifth-generation computer-research project and one expert consulted by the government over the bilateral science pact. &quot;They will decide whether they want to come over.&quot;    Leading Japanese scientists, many of whom have studied or worked in America, agree the time has arrived for Japan to repay its debt.    &quot;My generation has all gone to the (U.S.) to study. Japan just preaches about international cooperation, but it really has to start putting out more funds. . .like the U.S. government which has spent so much over the years,&quot; said Tokyo University Professor Shoji Tanaka, one of the world's leading superconductivity researchers.    Mr. Inose, who invented the digital telephone switch as a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and Bell Telephone in the late 1950s, said:   &quot;I have repeatedly told the government that the (U.S.) has spent a great deal to invite Japanese scientists and engineers on Fulbright scholarships. . .I don't think we ever reciprocated for that.&quot;    The U.S.-Japan Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology was first signed in 1980 to promote basic research in non-energy areas. It was renewed five times since 1985 and, after 10 months of negotiations ending in June, officials agreed to a new pact effective from 1988 to 1993.    The largely symbolic agreement wasn't controversial until tensions mounted over Japan's trade surplus. When full-scale talks to renew the pact began last year, the U.S. proposed a list of stringent rules to balance bilateral cooperation.    In 11th-hour talks in June, U.S. negotiators won a major concession when Japan agreed to restrict the publication of joint technology with possible military application and to restrict the transfer of such information. Technological exports include information and licenses on old and new technology, such as submarine-silencing equipment Toshiba Machine Co. sold to the Soviet Union in violation of a Western block trade agreement.    No provisions exist under Japanese law to prevent the dissemination of scientific and technological information developed for peaceful purposes. But officials say they can adhere to the pact because both sides have agreed to distribute the research results as widely as possible.    However, Nagahide Onozawa, who will oversee 100 of the foreign researchers under the jurisdiction of the governmental Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, says promising U.S. scientists, eligible for 30 to 40 of the endowments, aren't the most likely candidates to respond to the new program.    He said: &quot;Apart from the problems of language and style of living, many researchers at the start or the peak of their careers aren't that interested in coming to Japan. . .they're afraid of being left behind by their colleagues back home.&quot;    Mr. Tanaka, head of the government's International Superconductivity Technology Center, said he found no takers when he recently visited the U.S. to woo corporate participation in a new superconductivity project, which promises a bounty in terms of application patents.    He said nationalism is driving the U.S. as it closes symposiums on superconductivity to foreign participation in a bid to lead the field. Yet superconductivity is one area selected for joint research in the new bilateral accord.    Mr. Tanaka and other scientists say U.S. industry isn't interested in joining costly programs like the one he heads.    William Norris, chairman emeritus of Control Data Corp., echoed the opinion of U.S. firms when he told a recent U.S. Senate space subcommittee that Japan should give U.S. firms &quot;free access&quot; in exchange for the technology it has developed from U.S. research.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda said in a briefing, &quot;The Americans' major interest is in Japanese institutions of applied science rather than basic science. Most of the applied-science institutions here are private. . .and we cannot control the private sector.&quot;    Japan's private sector footed 80.3% -- compared with 50% put up by U.S. firms in the U.S. -- of the $68 billion the nation spent on research and development in 1985. Of the research in Japanese industrial laboratories, 94% of the outlays went to experimental development and applied research.    Japan's technological standing, Mr. Inose said, is world class in fields like computer memories and biotechnology.    &quot;The United States cannot excel in every area and they have to think about an international division of labor,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
