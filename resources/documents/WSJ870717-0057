After a strong opening, crude for August delivery quickly soared 61 cents a barrel, to a day's high of $22.76, as speculators scrambled to buy contracts amid persistent concerns about Middle East tensions and reports that Venezuela raised its oil prices.    Then waves of profit-taking sent prices plunging to a low of $22, before they recovered late in the session to close at $22.34 a barrel, up 19 cents for the day.    &quot;The big trading range showed the extreme nervousness in the market,&quot; said Andrew Lebow, an oil analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York.    &quot;It was the type of day when you couldn't find a buyer and you couldn't find a seller at different times,&quot; he said.    There also were gains in the spot, or noncontract, market. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, rose 20 cents a barrel to $22.35.    Meanwhile, Venezuela raised the price of one of its types of heavy crude 70 cents a barrel to $16.58, according to news service reports. Although Venezuela is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, its sales of heavy crude aren't governed by OPEC pricing guidelines.    Despite the intraday drop in futures prices, many analysts said they expect further increases, particularly next week when the U.S. begins reflagging Kuwaiti ships in the Persian Gulf.    &quot;We closed on a strong note, and the feeling in the market is that we're still in a good, solid uptrend,&quot; said Richard Kane, an oil broker for Merrill Lynch Futures Inc. in New York.    &quot;Anytime we get close to $22,&quot; a New York Merc trader said, &quot;strong buying comes right back in the market.&quot;    In other futures markets yesterday:    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Pork bellies for summer delivery soared their daily limit amid tightness in the supply of frozen pork bellies and price gains in the fresh market. Hog futures also made a strong showing, as a slowdown in the movement of animals to slaughter forced packers to bid up cash prices. July pork bellies made the sharpest advance as traders continued their efforts to align the contract's price with the higher cash prices before the contract expires Monday. Cattle futures were mixed. August cattle were up a bit on strength from the hog market, while expectation that next Friday's cattle-on-feed report will be bearish hurt contracts for delivery this fall.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Most grain and soybean futures prices finished lower. Soybean prices tumbled as professional traders sold off positions. The soybean market was also hurt by news from Brazil that planted acreage this fall should increase 9% and word out of Argentina that soybean planting is expected to increase 5% to 8% and sunflower seed planting 20%, said Richard Loewy, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. Sunflower seeds are a source of an alternative to soybean oil. Wheat fell as pressure from the harvest continued.    COPPER: Futures prices rose in active trading amid reports of flooding in Chile, the world's largest copper producer, that would delay exports of the metal. Major flooding late Wednesday was reported between the El Teniente mine, which produces one-third of Chile's copper, and the ports of San Antonio and Valparaiso, according to Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. Late yesterday, though, some in Chile said the situation may not be as bad as first reported and shipments may be resumed in a matter of days, according to Miss Raptopoulos. Despite the apparently lessened severity of the situation, prices closed near their highs of the day, with September copper gaining 1.5 cents a pound to 73.5 cents. Meanwhile, dealer premiums for copper have shrunk slightly, indicating some easing of the recent tightness in supply, said Fred Demler, an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York. &quot;But inventories are still low and may remain tight when buyers enter the market again for fall needs,&quot; he said.    STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices reached highs, and analysts said prices are headed still higher, largely because of the strength of a firming dollar and government claims that the trade outlook is better than it appears. The stock market also moved into record territory as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which topped the 2500 benchmark before dropping back -- closed at 2496.97, up 13.23. The bellwether Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index future for September settlement at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange topped its previous high of 313.5 to close at 314.2, up 2, after briefly touching 314.4. Meanwhile, David Mulford, the Treasury Department's assistant secretary for international affairs, said in a speech in New York that the &quot;underlying progress in the U.S.-Japan economic relationship is greater than is commonly believed.&quot; His comments helped blunt the impact of Wednesday's report of a wider-than-expected, $14.4 billion trade deficit for May that sent the dollar and most financial markets into a tailspin, traders said. Scott Wilson, a futures analyst at Thomson-McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York, said that based on his analysis of price trends the Sandamp;P 500 stock-index futures should climb to 317 before it comes under selling pressure. </TEXT></DOC>
