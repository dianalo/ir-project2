GRACZYK</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a city where bank closings have become socommon they fail to attract much notice, officials of FondrenNational Bank of Houston did something that was extraordinary butmade no headlines.   They built a $900,000 bank building and opened it in June.   ``Obviously if we didn't feel things were moving positively, wewouldn't have done it,'' said Frank Goldberg, the bank's president.``We think things are better. We know they are.''   Fondren National, with assets of about $37 million, is far fromthe largest bank in town, but the confidence officials are showingin the city mirrors other signs that make some believe the economicnightmare that followed the energy crash of the early 1980s isslowly ending.   When the oil bust hit, Houston was left with the image of a cityof empty skyscrapers, unprecedented unemployment, banking chaos andmore recently, highly publicized bankruptcies involving prominentTexans like former Gov. John Connally and surgeon Denton Cooley.   But even New York bond rating firms are nodding cautiously thatthe worst may be over for Houston, which in the past decade usedthe energy boom to push past Detroit and Philadelpia and become thenation's fourth-largest city.   Last month, Moody's Investor Service, swayed by optimistic pleasfrom top Houston officials, kept the city's bond rating at the morefavorable ``Aa'' category.   ``We looked at the relationship of the city's attempt to balancethe current budget and finish the year in a positive mode,'' saidRobert Stanley, a Moody's vice president.   ``Their perceptions of Houston were wrong,'' said Paul Mabry,spokesman for Mayor Kathryn Whitmire, explaining why Moody'sofficials changed their minds.   What Moody's officials were told is that Mrs. Whitmire willresolve an unexpected budget deficit with a recently approved 18.9percent tax increase. And they were delivered a rosy picture of acity on its way back.   For example, unemployment, at nearly 13 percent in June 1987,most recently was reported at 7.1 percent.   In the 12 months ending in May, employment rose by 28,000. InMay alone, Texas Employment Commission figures showed the totalnumber of people working rose by 15,000 to 1,495,100.   Figures also show the city expects at least 20,000 new jobs thisyear with economic growth up 2 percent and expanding in subsequentyears.   City officials also are touting Houston's depressed housingmarket as a plus for people moving in, noting that home costs andapartment rents are among the lowest of major U.S. cities. Forexample, a 2,000-square-foot, three-bedroom house that sell for$250,000 in Boston or Los Angeles goes for a mere $80,000 inHouston.   Barton Smith, who heads the university of Houston's economicsdepartment, is forecasting home prices will jump 10 percent nextyear and continue to climb in the early 1990s.   Elsewhere, shipments through the Port of Houston were 30.2million tons through April, up 15 percent from the previous year.   At the Texas Medical Center, construction worth $1.5 billion isensuring the complex remains the world's largest medical center.   And Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. reported it installed morenew phone lines in April than any month in nearly three years.   At federal bankruptcy court, where clerks were so busy at onepoint that they refused to answer the telephone, the number offilings has leveled off, according to a Price Waterhouse survey.   Although the court received 429 petitions in the first quarterof the year _ up 3 percent from the previous quarter _ the numberwas 8 percent below the peak third quarter of 1986 and close to theaverage 422 recorded over the past year.   ``While the overall number of business bankruptcies increasedslightly during the first quarter, various sectors of Houston'seconomy showed signs of improvement,'' said Donald Thomas of PriceWaterhouse. ``Several companies have announced relocation plansmoving them to Houston. ... With low real estate and wage costs,Houston continues to be an attractive market for corporaterelocations.''   One of them is Grumman Corp., which recently broke ground for a$50 million space headquarters that is projected to add hundreds ofjobs.   Even Houston's legendary traffic problems appear to be easing,with freeway renovation and construction feverish. The first phaseof a long-awaited county toll road project was completed in lateJune with hopes it will unclog two major freeways to the city'snorthern reaches.   On the minus side, however, are new home sales, which trailanemic year-ago figures by 4 percent. For the first quarter of1988, the 1,520 permits issued for single-family homes was down 22percent from the same 1987 period.   ``The general consensus, from the people we've talked to, isthat Houston is probably at the bottom now,'' according to RoyBragg, editor of the trade publication U.S. Housing Markets.   And the energy business, spoiled when oil prices exceeded $30per barrel and knocked nearly comatose when prices slipped beneath$10, is learning the realities of coping with $16-18 oil.   A survey of the city's 50 largest public companies by the weeklyHouston Business Journal shows 20 lost money in 1987, and 12 ofthose 20 losers are energy-related firms.   But a forecast by the Rice University-affiliated Center forEconomic and Demographic Forecasting says favorable trends in theenergy business should continue through 1990, with higher pricesleading to more significant recovery.   ``For Houston's recovery to expand, conditions in the energyindustry must at least remain stable,'' said Michelle Foss, seniorassociate at the center.   Still, Rice Center economists believe that even if oil pricessoften, the city's employment should not be affected greatly.   ``Houston's economic recovery continues and may even be pickingup speed,'' the economists said.   At Fondren National Bank, employees and customers are glad to bein the gleaming new building and out of the mobile home that servedas the bank's temporary quarters.   ``We have lots of small- to medium-size businesses that arecustomers,'' bank president Goldberg said. ``It's pretty muchacross-the-board and not just in our minds. It's reflected in thosebusinesses. Things are better almost everywhere.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 17</NOTE></DOC>
