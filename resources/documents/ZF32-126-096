No.andP;  It isn't clear to me thatanyone will, although I suspect: some interesting entertainment will result.andO;But I learned a lot.andP;  And some of my thoughts about user programming wereconfirmed.andP;  After becoming convinced of the advantages of a  graphical userinterface,' my belief now firmly extends to programming  ages as well.andP;  Notjust the user interface part, but the underlying logic too.andP;  And not justdecision trees, but the whole program.andP;  I also see the advantages of havingthe development and run-time environments as seamless as possible.andP;  It reallyencourages experimentation because the feedback loop is so short.andP;  Mat'sobviously why interpreted languages are popular for training.andP;  Imagine if youhad to compile your spreadsheets before you could enter any data.andM;My last observation has to do with the level of abstraction of the objectsthemselves.andP;  I like having the objects at a similar level of abstraction tothe world I'm trying to manipulate.andP;  Professional developers may need theadditional control that comes from lower-level languages, but I'm more thanwilling to pay the extra price in memory or performance to get the bigincrease in productivity for the applications I write for myself.andM;So it's too bad that Hookup! doesn't support more data types (text would benice!) or use more of the user interface controls that are now standard ongraphical PC platforms.andP;  And frankly there are a number of other limitationsof this product that keep it in the  novelty' category, as opposed to being aserious development tool: the network is limited in size to what fits on yourscreen; there's no  undo' function; there's no convenient way to manage whatcan become a rat's nest of objects and wires.andP;  But the psychic rewards of theproduct are substantial, and I feel rejuvenated from having used it.andP;  Andalthough some may say Hookup! Succeeds precisely because of its limitedscope, I'm inclined to believe the underlying concepts can be extended into amore generalized offering.andP;  It's clear to me that user programming will onlycome into its own after the procedural, textual paradigms are abandoned.andO;Fortunately, the mainstream platforms are already capable of supportingsomething new, and it would therefore be possible to have user-developedprograms be compatible with (and even cooperate with) commercially developedapplications.andP;  So with renewed enthusiasm the search for the user programmingHoly Grail continues.andM;Hookup!
