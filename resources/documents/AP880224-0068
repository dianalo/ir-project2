Two of the students brandishing explosive devices and draped inSouth Korean flags stood at shattered windows on the second flooryelling ``Yankee go home'' as riot police ringed the building.   U.S. Embassy officials said they had no reports of injuries, butthe attackers smashed windows and set a fire in a periodicalstorage room. Thick smoke filled part of the building located inthe heart of Seoul.   People inside the building at the time of the attack, includingat least one American, were not detained by the radicals.   The students, who said they were members of the ``Young StudentSuicide Group'' claimed they had 18 bombs and screamed atsurrounding police to stay away. They tossed down a statementcharging the United States was attempting to make South Korea acolony.   ``Yankees stay out of Korea,'' the students yelled.   A police officer said it was unclear how many of the explosivedevices the attackers had. The bombs were crude chemical devices,possibly some kind of plastic explosive, he said.   About 200 radical students hurling firebombs and rocks clashedwith riot police about an hour later outside Myungdong Cathedral.Police fired volleys of tear gas at the students who yelled slogansdenouncing President-elect Roh Tae-woo, who is to be sworn inThursday.   Hundreds of protesters had gathered at the cathedral less than amile from the U.S. Information Service office earlier in theafternoon for an anti-government protest. ``Down with RohTae-woo,'' the students yelled.   Some of the attackers were reading in the office's library whenthere was a large explosion in a nearby roon and they suddenlypulled out bombs and started screaming slogans, eyewitnesses said.At least one of the attackers pulled out a knife and brandished it,they said.   ``He was kind of crazy-eyed,'' said Paul Wadden, a visitingAmerican teacher who was reading in the library at the time.   The attackers smashed three windows overlooking the main streetoutside and two of them stood shouting slogans out into the streetand brandishing bombs and cigaretee lighters. Riot police stood onthe sidewalk below with shields covering their heads and shatteredglass covered the street.   The students tossed at least one bomb into the street where itexploded harmlessly, eyewitnesses said. A second bomb was tossedout, but did not explode, they said.   People caught in the library said the students did not attemptto detain them and they were able to leave after recovering fromtheir initial shock. Wadden said he and other people were preventedfrom leaving downstairs for up to 10 minutes by building guards.   There were about 40 people in the library at the time, most ofthem Koreans, eyewitnesses said.   Police who entered the building by the rear entrance overpoweredthe protesters about 30 minutes after the attack began. Thestudents were taken out of the building in a bus with coveredwindows.   U.S. Embassy officials said South Korean riot police entered thebuilding at their request.   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita arrived at the LotteHotel across the street from the U.S. Information Service officejust as the incident ended, officials said. Takeshita is in Seoulfor Roh's inauguration.   American diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidthey did not know why the students attacked the U.S. facility. ``Wehave no idea what the motivation was,'' an embassy official said.   The United States is South Korea's chief ally. Washington has40,000 troops in South Korea under a mutual defense pact againstcommunist North Korea.   The U.S. Information Service provides reading material and othermaterials on the United States and operates libraries andinformation centers around the world in conjunction with Americanembassies. The service office in Seoul is located about half a milefrom the American Embassy.   The same office was seized by 73 radical students for four daysin May, 1985 as an anti-American protest. They ended the occupationpeacefully and some later received prison sentences.   U.S. Embassy officials were unable to explain today how theattackers were able to bring weapons into the well-guardedbuilding. Visitors must pass a metal detector, presentidentification and have their bags searched and there are policeguards inside and outside.   The statement by the students denounced Roh as a puppet who hadbeen installed by the United States.   South Korean radicals have repeatedly charged the United Stateshas kept a series of authoritarian governments in power in SouthKorea. Roh, a former general, won the first democratic elections in16 years last December.</TEXT></DOC>
