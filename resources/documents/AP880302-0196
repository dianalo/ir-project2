(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Jesse Jackson didn't have a paidstaff, much money or very high hopes in overwhelmingly whiteVermont, but his campaign pulled off a strong second-place finishin Tuesday's presidential primary.   ``It has a tremendous significance on a symbolic level,''Garrison Nelson, a University of Vermont political scienceprofessor, said Wednesday. ``This is exactly what Jackson hopedfor. He can now say he appealed to more than just blacks going intoSuper Tuesday.''   Jackson finished with 26 percent, behind Massachusetts Gov.Michael Dukakis, whose 15-person paid staff and 60-plus volunteershelped him capture 57 percent of the vote. Vice President GeorgeBush won the GOP primary.   ``This is a home-grown campaign where people have worked all thetime, constantly on the issues,'' said Chris Wood of the Jacksoncampaign. ``We're working on issues that Jackson is talking about.''   Wood said many of those who worked for Jackson also were activein grass roots organizations supporting low-income Vermonters andthe state's financially distressed dairy farmers. Many also haveprotested apartheid in South Africa.   Jackson raked in three times as many votes Tuesday as he did in1984, when he won 7.8 percent of the vote.   According to unofficial results, with 100 percent of the state's262 precincts reporting, Dukakis had 57 percent, Jackson 26percent, Rep. Richard Gephardt 8 percent; Sen. Paul Simon 5 percentand former Sen. Gary Hart, who won Vermont in 1984, 4 percent. Sen.Albert Gore Jr. was not on the ballot here.   On the Republican side, Bush received 49 percent, Sen. Bob Dole39 percent, former television evangelist Pat Robertson 5 percentand Rep. Jack Kemp 4 percent.   Political observers had predicted a tight race between Jacksonand Gephardt for second place, but Jackson stole the show.   He ran a strong second in the state's largest city of Burlingtonand actually beat Dukakis in 27 smaller communities and tied him intwo.   ``It depended really on volunteers,'' said Eric Davis, apolitical science professor at Middlebury College. ``They weren'tputting up lawn signs _ they weren't doing mailings. To get almost30 percent of the vote just on grass roots says something aboutJackson's appeal.''   Jackson's campaign was propelled by the alliance of the RainbowCoalition of Vermont and the Progressive Coalition and its mostprominent member, Burlington Mayor Bernard Sanders.   Sanders, a socialist, endorsed Jackson during one of his recentvisits to the state. Jackson was one of the few candidates toactively campaign in Vermont in the last days before the election.   The fight for Vermont's delegates to the national conventionbegins in April with local party caucuses.</TEXT></DOC>
