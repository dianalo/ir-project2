The process involves hydrogenation of the carbonaceousmaterial, for production mainly of gaseous methane. The methane is crackedto micron-sized carbon black particulates and hydrogen gas. Excess hydrogenis recycled. Mineral impurities are separated, oxygen impurity removedas water, sulfur removed as solid or gaseous sulfide and nitrogen isremoved as purge gas. An economic evaluation of the process is also given.6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
