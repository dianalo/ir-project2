It was not until 1980that Congress began to amend section 1862 of the Act to make Medicare secondary,first to no-fault and liability insurance, and later to employer grouphealth plans that cover end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and thatcover employed aged and aged spouses of employed individuals. Despite regulationsand instructions, implementation has fallen short of expectations. It ishospitals that are most directly affected by these changes because it isprimarily hospital services that are covered by private insurance.Experience has been that many ``Medicare secondary payer'' (MSP) claimsare not identified for MSP processing and that hospitals do not have proceduresto identify other insurance that the beneficiary may have. This situationhas been documented by_andbullet; A Bureau of Quality Control study (summer of 1984), which foundthat up to 90 percent of all working aged claims were billed to Medicarerather than the other insurer because the hospital did not ask the beneficiaryfor information on other insurance or did not follow through on that information.andbullet; Bureau of Program Operations (BPO) on-site review of hospitals,which revealed that hospitals did not have procedures to use at the timeof admission to identify other insurers.andbullet; BPO investigation of hospital software vendors, which revealedthat the standard software packages for hospital admission routines donot include sufficient questions about insurers other than Medicare.As a result, the claims that would properly be billed to another payerare sometimes mistakenly billed to Medicare. In some instances, the intermediaryis able to identify the claim as an MSP claim and, at considerable expense,follow through to achieve the MSP savings. In many other instances, thereis no way for the intermediary to know that a particular beneficiary hasother insurance. In those cases, the claim is paid incorrectly and MSPsavings are lost.This problem is particularly acute when the health insurance policyholderis not the Medicare patient, but his or her spouse. There is no way ofidentifying this person (who may be under 65 years of age) through HCFA/SSArecords. Only the hospital can identify this type of MSP case.A second observation on program experience was made by the Office of theInspector General in a memo dated March 18, 1985. The OIG review of hospitalsindicates that some hospitals bill both Medicare and the other insurer(which is contrary to program instructions) and, instead of refunding Medicare'spayment, retain it, unless Medicare requests that it be refunded. The hospitalhas no incentive to refund the money. Since it is unlikely that the intermediarywill find the case and ask for the refund, the hospital keeps a creditbalance on the patient account and holds the payment.Incorrect payments must be recovered. Medicare conditional payments, madewhen a claim against the other insurer is contested or payment is otherwisedelayed, are also subject to recovery. Recent legislation has a directbearing on this aspect of the program, as explained below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Statutory Changes</ITAG>A. Section 2344 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-369) amendedsections 1862(b)(1), 1862(b)(2)(B), and 1862(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act asfollows:1. Makes explicit the Federal Government's right to recover from_andbullet; Third parties that are required to pay before Medicare; andandbullet; Any entity (such as a beneficiary, provider, physician or Stateagency) that has received payment from a third party that is required topay before Medicare.2. Provides that the government_andbullet; Is subrogated to the right of any individual or other entity toreceive payments from a third party payer to the extent of Medicare payment;andandbullet; May join or intervene in any action related to the events thatgave rise to the need for the items or services for which Medicare paid.3. Adds the word ``promptly'' to paragraph 1862(b)(1), thus providing thatMedicare payments are limited to the extent that payment has been madeor can reasonably be expected to be made ``promptly'' by workers' compensation,or automobile, liability, or no-fault insurance. Medicare makes conditionalprimary payments only if the other insurer will not pay promptly. 4. Adds the phrase ``or could be'' to sections 1862(b)(1), (b)(2)(B), and(b)(3)(A)(ii), thus providing that Medicare conditional payments are subjectto recoupment when information is received that primary payment ``couldbe'' made by a workers' compensation plan, an automobile, liability, orno-fault insurer, or an employer group health plan, even though such paymenthas not yet been made. This change reinforces Medicare's position as secondarypayer, i.e., expressly permits HCFA to pursue recovery of conditional orincorrect payments as soon as it learns that another insurer is liablefor the payment. The provisions of section 2344 were self-executing. A notice to that effectwas published on July 17, 1985 at 50 FR 28988. B. Section 9201 of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of1985 (Pub. L. 99-272 enacted April 7, 1986) eliminated the age 70 upperlimit for individuals subject to the working aged provision, effectiveMay 1, 1986. This amendment makes Medicare secondary payer to employergroup health plan coverage for employed individuals age 65 or over andspouses age 65 or over of employed individuals of any age. Previously,Medicare was secondary for such individuals only until they attained age70. C. Section 4036(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Pub.L. 100-203), enacted December 22, 1987, provides that Medicare may notmake conditional primary payments on behalf of an ESRD beneficiary whois covered by an employer group health plan if the plan ``can reasonablybe expected'' to pay. Under previous law, Medicare could make conditionalprimary payments if the Secretary determined that the plan would not payas promptly as Medicare. This change makes the conditional payment criteriafor ESRD beneficiaries the same as for working aged beneficiaries who arecovered by employer group health plans. This change is effective for servicesfurnished on or after January 21, 1988. The section 4036(a) provision supersedesHCFA's implementation of a court order that was issued in 1984. In <T3>National Association of Patients on Hemodialysis v. Heckler, </T3>(CivilAction </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">No. 83-2210 (D.D.C.)), the district court for the District of Columbiaheld that HCFA's existing regulations, dealing with conditional primaryMedicare payments when Medicare is secondary to employer group health plansfor ESRD beneficiaries, are not consistent with the statute. The existingregulations provide that Medicare may pay conditional primary benefitsonly if the Medicare contractor knows from experience or ascertains thatthe employer plan payments in general are substantially less prompt thanMedicare's. The court held that the regulations that were in effect atthat time were not consistent with the statutory language which directedthe Secretary to deny primary Medicare benefits only if andbullet; The employer group health plan has paid; or andbullet; The Secretary has determined that the employer plan will pay aspromptly as Medicare. Manual instructions implementing the court decision were issued in 1985.They stipulated that providers and suppliers were no longer required tobill the employer plan first in ESRD cases; they had the option to billMedicare first. Contractors were instructed to pay conditional Medicarebenefits if billed first and to attempt to recover later from the employerplan. D. Section 4085(i)(15) of Pub. L. 100-203 provides a fourth exception tothe exclusion of services that are not reasonable and necessary ``for thediagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioningof a malformed body member''. Under this amendment, Medicare payment isavailable for services that are reasonable and necessary to carry out thepurpose of the patient outcome assessment program established under section1875(c) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Changes in the Regulations </ITAG>I. To Implement Statutory Amendments <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Prompt Payment </ITAG>To implement the statutory amendment that added the word ``promptly'' tosection 1862(b)(1) of the Act, we would make clear that Medicare makesconditional primary payments when the workers' compensation carrier orthe no-fault insurer will not pay promptly, that is, within 120 days afterreceipt of the claim. Current rules already provide for Medicare conditionalpayments in liability cases, if the beneficiary has filed, or has a rightto file, a liability claim. The changes pertaining to ESRD beneficiaries covered by an employer grouphealth plan would provide that Medicare makes conditional primary paymentswhen a proper claim has been filed with the employer plan and the planhas denied the claim in whole or in part. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Authority To Recover as Soon as Liability is Known To Exist, Subrogation,and Right To Intervene </ITAG>As discussed above under ``Statutory Changes'', the addition of the phrase``or could'' means that HCFA can seek recovery of conditional primary paymentswhen it learns that another party is primary payer, without waiting forthe other party to actually pay (411.24(a)). If HCFA is unable to recoverconditional Medicare payments from a beneficiary or other party that receivespayment from an entity that is primary to Medicare, HCFA has the rightto recover its payment from that entity in spite of the fact that the entityhas already reimbursed the beneficiary or other party (andSection; 411.24(h)).Therefore, entities that are primary to Medicare ought to make sure thatMedicare has no claim against payments they plan to make to individualswho are entitled to Medicare benefits. HCFA's clarified recovery rights, including subrogation and the right tointervene, apply to all payers that are primary to Medicare. These rightsare set forth in andSection; 411.24 and andSection; 411.26. In view of the clarified recovery rights, we propose to remove the requirement(in andSection; 405.319(b) of the current rules) for obtaining a repaymentagreement from the beneficiary as a prerequisite for Medicare conditionalpayment in workers' compensation cases. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Removal of Upper Age Limit For Working Aged </ITAG>This change is reflected in andSection; 411.70 of the regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">D. Coverage of Services That Are Reasonable and Necessary to CarryOut the Purposes of the Patient Outcome Evaluation Program This change is reflected in andSection; 411.15(k)(4). II. To Implement Policy Changes<ITAG tagnum="81">A. To Ensure Identification of Other Payers That Are Primary to Medicareand Prompt Reimbursement When the Beneficiary, Provider, or Supplier ReceivesPayment From These Payers </ITAG>1. <T3>Current rules. </T3>a. Part 489 of the Medicare rules deals with provideragreements. Section 489.20, which sets forth the commitments that a providermust make when it executes a provider agreement, does not include any requirementthat the provider identify other insurance, bill primary payers beforebilling Medicare or refund Medicare payments that duplicate payments bya payer that is primary to Medicare. b. Current rules do not expressly address HCFA's right to obtain informationfrom another payer with whom a claim has been or could have been filed.2. <T3>Discussion. </T3>a. Although the changes in the law have clarifiedHCFA's ability to recover conditional payments, it is obvious that therecan be no recovery without identification of other insurers that are primaryto Medicare. We believe that this aspect of the problem must be dealt within regulations to the maximum extent permitted under current law. b. In order to determine Medicare's proper payment under the law, it maybe necessary for HCFA to contact other payers that may be primary to Medicarewith regard to benefit coordination. For instance, if a claim for Medicareprimary benefits is received, but Medicare was secondary on a prior claim,HCFA intermediaries or carriers may have to contact the other payer todetermine whether it is still primary to Medicare. 3. <T3>Proposed changes. </T3>a. We propose to amend andSection; 489.20 to requireproviders to make four additional commitments, as follows: (1) To maintain a system for identifying, during the admission process,other payers that are primary to Medicare. (2) Except in the case of liability insurance, to bill the other insurerfirst. (3) When it receives payment from both Medicare and another payer thatis primary to Medicare, to reimburse Medicare within 30 days. (Section411.24, which deals with HCFA's recovery rights, would also require beneficiariesand other parties that receive duplicate payments to reimburse HCFA within30 days.) (4) If it receives, from a payer that is primary to Medicare, a paymentthat is reduced because the provider failed to file a proper claim withthat payer_ andbullet; To bill Medicare only to the extent that secondary benefits wouldhave been payable if the primary insurer had reimbursed the provider onthe basis of a proper claim; and andbullet; To charge the beneficiary no more than it would have been entitledto charge if it had filed a proper claim with the primary insurer. (Thisfourth commitment is discussed under section H of this preamble, whichdeals with Medicare Secondary Payments.) b. We propose to stipulate, in andSection; 411.24(a), that the filing ofa Medicare claim, by or on behalf of the beneficiary, expressly authorizesthe third party payer to release any information pertinent to the Medicareclaim. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. To Reflect Changed Interpretation of the ``Immediate Relative''Exclusion </ITAG>1. <T3>Current rules. </T3>The current rule at 42 CFR 405.315 implements the``immediate relative exclusion'' provision of section 1862(a)(11) of theAct. This provision precludes payment for expenses that ``constitute chargesimposed by an immediate relative of the beneficiary or a member of thebeneficiary's household''. Section 405.315_ a. Refers only to Medicare Part B; b. Bars payment for charges other than actual costs incurred by the physicianor other person (hereafter referred to as ``out-of-pocket expenses'') foritems furnished to relatives or household members; c. Defines ``immediate relative'' and ``member of household''; d. Notes that the person who imposes the charges may be a person otherthan the one who furnished the services; e. Exempts from the exclusion andbullet; Charges imposed by a partnership except when all the partnersbear the excluded relationship to the patient; and andbullet; Charges imposed by a corporation, regardless of the beneficiary'srelationship to the directors, officers, and stockholders of the corporation;and f. Makes the exclusion applicable to charges imposed by an individual proprietorshipif the individual who owns and operates the business is an immediate relativeor member of the beneficiary's household.2. <T3>Discussion. </T3>Reexamination of these rules has led us to concludethat our previous interpretation of section 1862(a)(11) of the Act wasinconsistent with the purpose of that provision, namely_ andbullet; To bar Medicare payment for items and services that would ordinarilybe furnished gratis because of the relationship of the provider or physicianto the beneficiary; and andbullet; To avoid payment for medically unnecessary services. Congress recognized that, in family situations, it is difficult to differentiatebetween medically necessary services and those that are furnished becauseof affection or concern. Thus, the exclusion was also intended to guardagainst potential program abuse. The prohibition is unqualified. Neither the statutory language nor thelegislative history support certain of our previous interpretations underwhich we_ andbullet; Limited the exclusion to services of physicians and suppliers,payable on a charge basis under Medicare Part B, while continuing to payfor services payable under Medicare Part A, and for actual out-of-pocketexpenses incurred by physicians or suppliers to furnish their relativesitems such as drugs or prosthetic devices; and andbullet; Exempted from the exclusion physicians who are members of a partnershipor corporation. We have concluded that Congress intended to exclude the following: a. Services furnished under Medicare Part A as well as under Medicare PartB. b. All charges imposed by persons having an excluded relationship, includingout-of-pocket expenses. c. Services furnished by physicians who are immediate relatives or householdmembers, regardless of whether they work within a partnership or a professionalcorporation, or as individual practitioners. It seems clear that a physician who joins a partnership or corporationdoes not, for that reason, become less likely to furnish free servicesto a relative or to bill the program for unnecessary services. The current policy that excludes charges imposed by partnerships only whenall partners are immediate relatives or members of the beneficiary's householdis too limited an application of the exclusion as it was intended by Congress.Current policy that exempts all corporations also permits circumventionof the law's intent and is inequitable. It allows Medicare payment forservices furnished by incorporated physicians (even corporations consistingof single physicians), but bars payment in identical situations for servicesfurnished by unincorporated physicians. Generally, State laws provide that the professional corporation, whileexisting as a separate legal entity, does not shield the practitioner fromliability for the professional acts performed by the practitioner or underhis or her supervision. The professional corporation affords the stockholderscertain advantages, such as favorable tax treatment, but does not permitthe abdication of responsibilities assumed in the practice of the profession.We, therefore, propose to make a distinction between the traditional corporationand the professional corporation in applying the ``immediate relative exclusion''.(It is relatively easy to identify a professional corporation because Statestatutes provide that only duly licensed members of the profession mayown shares.) Under the amended rules, physicians who are members of a professional corporationwould be subject to the exclusion, but the exclusion would not apply toother corporations, such as incorporated suppliers of medical equipment.3. <T3>Proposed changes. </T3>We would revise andSection; 405.315 (redesignatedas andSection; 411.12) to_ a. Remove the reference to Medicare Part B, so that the exclusion appliesto both programs; b. Remove the exemption of out-of-pocket expenses; c. Amend the definition of ``immediate relative'' to include adoptive siblingand spouse of grandparent or grandchild, which were omitted inadvertently;and d. Specify that the exclusion applies to the following: andbullet; Physician services and services furnished incident to those servicesif the physician who furnished the services or who ordered or supervisedservices incident to his or her services has an excluded relationship tothe beneficiary, even if the bill or claim is submitted by a nonrelatedindividual or by an entity such as a partnership or a professional corporation.andbullet; Services other than physician services when charges are imposedby_ (1) An individually owned provider or supplier, if the owner has an excludedrelationship to the beneficiary; or(2) A partnership, if any of the partners has an excluded relationshipto the beneficiary. Charges imposed by a corporation other than a professional corporationwould not be excluded. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. To Reflect Changed Interpretation of the ``No Legal Obligationto Pay'' Exclusion as it Applies to Services Furnished to Prisoners </ITAG>1. <T3>Current rules. </T3>Section 405.311 of the Medicare rules (which implementssection 1862(a)(2) of the Act) precludes Medicare payment for serviceswhen_ andbullet; The individual who receives the services has no legal obligationto pay for them; and andbullet; No other person has a legal obligation to provide or pay for thoseservices. 2. <T3>Discussion. </T3>Prisoners generally have the status of public chargeswho, as such, have no obligation to pay for the medical care they receive.Under those circumstances, andSection; 405.311 bars Medicare payment. However,andSection; 405.311 does not state the converse, namely, that if a prisonerreceives services and is legally obligated to pay for the services or toreimburse the State or other government entity the cost of the services,the exclusion does not apply. General instructions issued by HCFA do providefor payment in the latter circumstances. Under those instructions, thefact that State law or regulation provides that certain prisoners or groupsof prisoners may be charged for medical care is not enough to establishlegal obligation. It is necessary to show that the State regularly enforcesthe legal obligation by routinely billing and seeking collection from allsuch prisoners for medical care they receive. For those prisoners who areMedicare-eligible, this must include collection of applicable deductibleand coinsurance amounts and the cost of services not covered under Medicare.The State is expected to pursue collection of these sums in the same wayand with the same vigor that it pursues collection of other debts owedthe State. This includes the filing of lawsuits to obtain liens againstthe prisoner's assets outside the prison and income derived from nonprisonsources, when it is believed that such action would result in the recoveryof all or part of the debt. 3. <T3>Proposed changes. </T3>We propose to specify in the pertinent rule(now andSection; 411.4) that Medicare payment for services to prisoners maybe made_ andbullet; Only if State law requires prisoners to repay the cost of theservices; and andbullet; Only if the State actually enforces the requirement by billingand pursuing collection of amounts owed in the same way and with the samevigor that it pursues the collection of other debts. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. To Clarify the Rules on the Exclusion of Services Furnished Outsidethe United States </ITAG>1. <T3>Current rules. </T3>Section 405.313 of the current rules (which implementssection 1862(a)(4) of the Act)_ andbullet; Excludes services that are not furnished within the United States;and andbullet; Defines the United States to include the 50 States, the Districtof Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam,and American Samoa. General instructions issued by HCFA further specify that_ andbullet; United States territorial waters are part of the United States;and andbullet; Shipboard services furnished in a United States port or on thesame day the ship arrived at, or departed from, that port are consideredas furnished in U.S. territorial waters. 2. <T3>Discussion. </T3>The definition of ``United States'' needs to be expandedto include the Northern Mariana Islands. Under the Covenant to establishthe Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (Pub. L. 94-241), effectiveJanuary 9, 1978, ``* * *those laws which provide Federal services and financialassistance programs * * *'' apply to the Marianas as they do to Guam. The ``same day'' rule is too vague and too broad to be satisfactory. Itcould result in claims for services furnished in a foreign port (e.g.,in the Bahamas) that is less than 24 hours sailing distance from a U.S.port. Despite the specific language of the current definition of ``United States'',people tend to think that facilities owned and operated by the United StatesGovernment are part of the United States, no matter where in the worldthey are located. As a result of this misconception, we frequently receiveclaims for services furnished in U.S. Army hospitals in Europe, the CanalZone, etc., and requests for hearings on the denial of benefits for thoseservices. 3. <T3>Proposed changes. </T3>In accordance with the preceding discussion,we would, in andSection; 411.9_ andbullet; Add the Northern Mariana Islands and U.S. territorial waters tothe definition of the United States; andbullet; Specify that shipboard services are considered furnished in U.S.territorial waters if they are furnished while a ship is in a U.S. portor within 6 hours before arrival at, or after departure from, a U.S. port;and andbullet; Specify that a hospital that is not located within the UnitedStates as defined, is not part of the United States even though it is ownedor operated by the United States Government. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. To Update and Clarify Policies on Services Covered Under Workers'Compensation </ITAG>1. <T3>Current rules. </T3>The workers' compensation rules need revision toremove outdated content and to make them consistent with the rules pertainingto other types of insurance that are primary to Medicare. 2. <T3>Discussion. </T3>Some of the rules have become obsolete because workers'compensation laws and plans and medical care delivery systems have changed.For example, the laws and plans have fewer limitations on number of daysof care and amounts payable, and ward accommodations are no longer used.The workers' compensation rules also need to be updated to make them consistentwith the rules for other payers that are primary to Medicare. 3. <T3>Proposed changes. </T3>We would make the following changes: andbullet; Delete obsolete provisions, including those that deal with limitationsin workers' compensation laws regarding the number of days of care or theamount payable, and payment for ward accommodations.andbullet; Delete the provision dealing with Medicare payment for ancillaryservices not payable by workers' compensation. These cases would be coveredby andSection;andSection; 411.32 and 411.33 which set forth the basis and amountsof Medicare secondary payments when a third party payer does not pay infull. andbullet; Stipulate that the beneficiary must cooperate in any action HCFAtakes against a workers' compensation carrier. Since this rule appliesto all entities that are primary to Medicare, it would be set forth inandSection; 411.23. andbullet; Apply workers' compensation payments toward Medicare deductibleamounts (andSection; 411.30). andbullet; Specify different policies for lump sum workers compensation paymentsthat are commutations of future benefits (andSection; 411.46), and thosethat are compromise settlements (andSection; 411.47). andbullet; Make clear that Medicare does not pay for services for which paymentwould have been made under the Federal Black Lung Program administeredby the Department of Labor (DOL) if the DOL fails to pay solely becausethe provider did not obtain a provider number that must be included withthe claim for DOL payment (andSection; 411.40(b)). <ITAG tagnum="81">F. To Incorporate Changed Policy on No-Fault Insurance </ITAG>1. <T3>Current rules. </T3>With respect to no fault insurance, current rules_a. Apply only to <T3>automobile </T3>no fault, not to other kinds of no-fault insurancesuch as homeowners; b. Provide for Medicare conditional payment if the no-fault insurance paymentwill be delayed ``for any reason''; c. Do not address the beneficiary's responsibility for obtaining paymentunder no fault insurance; and d. Do not permit third party payments to be credited against the Medicaredeductibles. (This limitation also applies to payments under workers compensation,automobile medical and liability insurance.) 2. Discussion. We believe that_ a. Medicare should be secondary payer to all types of no-fault insurance,not just automobile no-fault, since the law is not limited to automobileno fault. b. Medicare should not make a conditional payment when a no fault insurerrefuses to pay primary benefits on the grounds that it is secondary toMedicare. c. Beneficiaries should be responsible for taking necessary action to obtainany payments that can reasonably be expected under no fault insurance asthey are required to do in the case of workers' compensation. d. All third party payments should be credited against the Medicare deductibles.Although title XVIII is silent as to whether payments under workers compensation,or automobile, liability, or no-fault insurance must be so credited, themore recent amendments do provide for employer plan payments to be usedto reduce the deductible amount for which the beneficiary is responsible.We believe that supports the proposed uniform policies. 3. <T3>Proposed changes. </T3>a. In andSection; 411.50(b), we would expand thedefinition of ``no fault insurance'' to include all other types of no faultinsurance, in addition to automobile no-fault. b. In andSection; 411.53, we would provide that Medicare conditional paymentwill not be made if the no fault insurance payment will be delayed becausethe insurer claims that its benefits are secondary to Medicare benefits.c. In andSection; 411.51, we would require that beneficiaries take any necessaryaction to obtain payment under no fault insurance, and specify the circumstancesunder which Medicare does or does not pay. d. In andSection; 411.30, we would provide that all third party paymentsare credited towards the Medicare deductibles. <ITAG tagnum="81">G. To Reflect Changed Policies on Liability Insurance </ITAG>1. <T3>Current rules. </T3>With respect to liability insurance, current rules_a. Leave the way open for an insured individual or other entity to avoiduse of its liability coverage by paying out-of-pocket instead of reportingthe incident to the liability insurer. b. In defining terms, under andSection; 405.322_ andbullet; Include self-insured plans within the definition of liabilityinsurance; andbullet; Include, within the definition of ``self insured plan'', a statementthat it is a plan under which an entity is ``authorized by State law tocarry its own risk''; andbullet; Do not specify that payments under the Federal Tort Claims Act(FTCA) are a type of liability payment under a self-insured plan; and andbullet; Do not specify that payments made by an insured party to coverdeductibles imposed by the liability insurance policy are considered tobe liability insurance payments. c. Do not clearly state that a provider has no right to charge a liabilityinsurer or a beneficiary who has received a liability insurance payment;d. Provide that Medicare will make a conditional payment if the beneficiaryhas filed or has a right to file a liability claim; and e. Do not specifically include underinsured motorist insurance (exceptas a type of uninsured motorist insurance) in the definition of liabilityinsurance.2. <T3>Discussion. </T3>a. In the first situation discussed above, HCFA paysfor medical expenditures properly covered by liability insurance and hasno opportunity to recover from the liability insurer. This needs to becorrected. b. The definitions need to be revised to_ andbullet; Reflect the fact that section 1862(b)(1) of the Act, which specificallyincludes self-insured plans, applies to entities that choose to carry theirown risk, not only to plans authorized by State law; andbullet; Make clear that the FTCA is a type of self-insured plan, sinceit is a plan under which the Federal Government pays for losses causedby wrongful actions of its employees or agents; and andbullet; Specify that payments made by an insured party to cover liabilityinsurance deductibles are considered to be liability insurance payments.c. A provider, or a supplier that has accepted assignment may not, underthe law, bill the liability insurer or the beneficiary who has receiveda liability payment, or file a lien against a liability settlement. Thereare four reasons: andbullet; With respect to Medicare covered services, sections 1866(a) and1842(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act permit providers, and suppliers who have acceptedassignment, to bill the beneficiary only for applicable deductible andcoinsurance amounts. andbullet; Services for which liability insurance payments have been madeor can reasonably be expected do not lose their identity as covered services.Since the amounts a beneficiary receives or is due to receive from a liabilityinsurer are his or her own funds, billing the liability insurer or thebeneficiary or filing a lien against the settlement would violate the statutoryprohibition. andbullet; In the case of liability insurance, the provider or supplierhasno standing to sue or send a bill to the insurer. Since only the beneficiary_notthe provider or supplier_has a right to sue the liability insurer, a billto the liability insurer or a lien against the settlement would, in effect,be a bill to the beneficiary. andbullet; Bills to liability insurers or beneficiaries or liens againstliability settlements, if effectuated, reduce the beneficiary's recoveryfrom the insurer unduly, since liability payments include compensationfor damages other than medical expenses. d. We believe that, given HCFA's strengthened recovery rights, no conditionsneed be placed on making conditional payments in liability insurance cases.e. We consider that underinsured motorist insurance is a form of liabilityinsurance. 3. <T3>Proposed changes</T3>. a. In andSection; 411.50(b), we would expand thedefinition of ``liability insurance payment'' to include out-of-pocketpayments by entities that carry liability insurance. This includes paymentsby the insured party to cover deductibles required by the liability policy.b. We would revise the definition of ``self-insured plan'' to include theFTCA and to remove the statement ``authorized by State law''. c. Under andSection; 411.54, providers and suppliers who have accepted assignment,would be precluded from billing liability insurers, from billing beneficiarieswho have received liability insurance payments, and from filing liens againstliability settlements. d. In andSection; 411.52, we would specify that a conditional payment maybe made when Medicare benefits are claimed for treatment of an injury orillness allegedly caused by another party. e. In andSection; 411.50(b), we would clarify the definition of ``liabilityinsurance'' by specifying that underinsured motorist insurance is an exampleof liability insurance.<ITAG tagnum="81">H. To Provide Uniform Rules for Computing the Amount of Medicare SecondaryPayment, and to Limit Charges When a Proper Claim Is Not Filed </ITAG>1. <T3>Current rules. </T3>a. Under andSection; 405.328 (for ESRD beneficiaries)and andSection; 405.342 (for working aged), in the case of services paidon a reasonable charge basis, the method for computing the Medicare secondarypayment is different if the claim is assigned. b. Under andSection; 405.342(b), when Medicare pays on a basis other thanreasonable charge, the amount of the Medicare secondary payment is computedon the basis of the Medicare payment rate, which may be more than charges.c. Under the above noted sections, the Medicare secondary payment is computedon the basis of the amount paid by the primary insurer. (Current rulesdo not speak to situations in which an insurer primary to Medicare reducesits payment because a proper claim was not filed.) 2. <T3>Discussion. </T3>a. As a result of the difference noted in a. above,the amount of secondary payment to a physician (or other supplier) whoaccepts assignment may be less than the amount paid to the beneficiarywhen the physician does not accept assignment, even though the reasonablecharge is the same in both cases. This difference is unfair and could discourageacceptance of assignment, which is desirable for the beneficiary. b. With respect to the situation noted under b. above, since the law providesfor secondary payments only when the primary payer pays less than the charges,we believe that the intent of the law is for Medicare to supplement theamount paid by the primary payer only in an amount that, combined withthe primary payment, equals the charges for the services, or the amountthe provider or supplier is obligated to accept as full payment. (Whena provider or supplier is obligated to accept as full payment an amountless than its charges, HCFA considers that lower amount to be the provider'sor supplier's charges.) c. With respect to item c. above, we believe that providers and suppliers,and beneficiaries who are not physically or mentally incapacitated, areresponsible for filing proper claims and for any third party payment reductionthat results from their failure to file proper claims. Therefore, andbullet; Medicare should not have to increase its secondary payment whenthe primary insurer pays less because a proper claim was not filed; andandbullet; The beneficiary should not be subject to higher charges becausethe provider or supplier fails to file a proper claim. 3. <T3>Proposed changes. </T3>a. With respect to services paid on a reasonablecharge basis, we would remove the special provisions applicable to claimsfiled under assignment (andSection;andSection; 405.328(a)(4) and 405.342(a)(4)).Because monthly capitation payments are now used for certain ESRD serviceswe would make the rules for determining the secondary payment amount (nowin andSection; 411.33), applicable also to that method of payment. b. With respect to services paid on other than a reasonable charge basis,we would revise the current formula for computing Medicare secondary paymentsto ensure that those payments are not greater than the excess of the chargesover the primary payments (andSection; 411.33(e)). c. In andSection;andSection; 411.32(c) and 489.20(i), respectively, we wouldprovide that, when a primary insurer pays less because a proper claim wasnot filed_ andbullet; The Medicare secondary payment will be no greater than it wouldhave been if the primary insurer had paid on the basis of a proper claim;and andbullet; A provider may charge Medicare and the beneficiary no more thanit would be entitled to charge if it had filed a proper claim. <ITAG tagnum="81">I. To Reflect Changed Interpretation of the Working Aged Provisions</ITAG>1. <T3>Current rules. </T3>Current rules_ a. Do not specify what is meant by ``employed''; b. Do not clearly interpret how the statutory language ``by reason of suchemployment'' applies in the case of reemployed retirees and annuitants;c. Do not specify that employer group health plans include ``employee-pay-all''plans. d. Make Medicare primary for members of a multiemployer plan that the planidentifies as employees of employers of less than 20 employees (andSection;405.340(b)(1)(ii));e. Provide (in andSection; 405.341(d)) that an individual who is receivingemployer disability payments is not considered to be employed if that individualwas, before attaining age 65, entitled to disability benefits under titleII of the Act before attainment of age 65, or is not receiving remunerationsubject to taxation under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA).f. Specify (in andSection; 405.341(c)(2)) that Medicare pays primary benefitsfor Medicare-covered services that are not covered under the employer plan;and provide that HCFA may make a Medicare conditional payment when employerplan payment is denied ``for any reason'' (andSection; 405.344(a)). 2. <T3>Discussion. </T3>a. For Social Security purposes generally, the term``employed'' includes the self-employed. (For example, self-employmentearnings help to qualify individuals for Medicare entitlement.) We concluded,therefore, that it is appropriate to make the working aged provisions applicableto all categories of employment, including self-employment. We have madethis clear in HCFA general instructions. b. In providing that the beneficiary must be covered ``by reason of suchemployment'', Congress clearly intended to ensure that other health insuranceplans not specified in the law (such as privately purchased plans and retirementplans) were not considered primary to Medicare. However, it is necessaryto clarify the rules with respect to reemployed retirees or annuitants.Some employers have rehired retirees, and continued secondary coverageunder the retiree plan, on the grounds that the employee is covered ``byreason of retirement'' rather than ``by reason of employment''. This misinterpretationcould lead to incorrect Medicare primary payments and to the costly andsometimes fruitless recovery efforts that they entail. c. The law defines ``group health plan'' as ``a plan of or contributedto by an employer''. The phrase ``plan of'' encompasses a plan that isunder the auspices of an employer who makes no financial contribution_aso-called ``employee-pay-all'' plan. d. Section 1862(b)(3) of the Act makes employer group health plans primaryto Medicare for the working aged. Section 1862(b)(4), added by section9319 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of October 21, 1986 (OBRA'86), makes ``large'' employer plans primary to Medicare for certain disabledbeneficiaries. Neither paragraph (b)(3), nor paragraph (b)(4) defines employerplan. Instead, they cite two sections of the Internal Revenue Code: andbullet; Section 162(i)(2) (later redesignated as (i)(3)) of the 1984 Code,for the working aged; and andbullet; Section 5000(b) of the 1986 Code, for the disabled.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Section 162(i)(2) makes no reference to number of employees. However,the Committee Report that accompanied the amendment indicated that thelimitation was not intended to apply to employers of less than 20 employees.That was the basis for our current rule under which Medicare is primarypayer for_ andbullet; Employees of employers of less than 20 employees; and andbullet; Employees who can be identified, among those covered under a multiemployerplan, as employed by employers of less than 20 employees. Section 5000(b) defines ``large group health plan'' as a plan that coversemployees of ``at least one employer that normally employed at least 100employees * * *'' Under this definition, there is no basis for exempting employees of employersof less than 100 employees when they are covered under a multiemployerplan that meets the section 5000(b) definition. On the basis of the morerecent legislation that deals with the multiemployer plan situation, webelieve that the exemption provided by our current working aged rules (asnoted under 1.d. above) is no longer appropriate. Instead, we would makethe rule for the working aged consistent with the rule for the disabledso that there will be no exemption for employees of employers of less than20 when they are covered under a multiemployer plan. e. Under section 1862(b)(4) of the Act, added by section 9319 of OBRA '86,Medicare is secondary for disabled ``employees'' under age 65 who are receivingsocial security disability benefits. By enacting this provision, Congressestablished the principle that an individual who is receiving disabilitybenefits can be considered an employee for purposes of making Medicaresecondary to an employer group health plan. This principle is contraryto the current working aged rule in andSection; 405.341(d). Under that rule,an individual aged 65 or over, who received social security disabilitybenefits before attaining age 65, is not considered employed even if heor she receives, from an employer, disability payments that are subjectto FICA taxes. In order to make the working aged rules consistent withsection 9319 of OBRA `86, we need to disregard receipt of social securitydisability benefits before age 65, and classify as ``employed'' all thosewho receive employee disability payments that are subject to FICA taxes.Since the basis for entitlement to social security benefits changes automaticallyfrom ``disability'' to ``age'' at age 65, no member of the ``working aged''group could be currently eligible for or receiving social security disabilitybenefits. However, for consistency with the section 9319 provisions, wewould disregard the fact that the individual had been entitled to socialsecurity disability benefits before attaining age 65.f. We believe that the statement in two current sections are too broad.Section 405.341(c)(2) states that Medicare makes primary payments for servicesnot covered under the employer plan. This may not always be so. For example,Medicare does not pay primary benefits for particular services that arecovered under the employer plan for younger employees but not for agedemployees. (Such a difference in scope of benefits violates the requirementsof the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act.) Section 405.344(a) provides that Medicare may make conditional primarypayments if the employer plan claim is denied ``for any reason''. We believethat HCFA should not make conditional primary payments when_ andbullet; The employer plan refuses to furnish to HCFA the information necessaryto determine whether the plan is primary to Medicare; andbullet; The employer plan is primary payer, but claims that its benefitsare secondary to Medicare; or andbullet; The employer plan claim is denied because the beneficiary, provider,or supplier failed to meet a claim filing requirement of the plan. (We would make an exception if the beneficiary failed to file a properclaim because of physical or mental incapacity.) 3. <T3>Proposed changes. </T3>We would_ a. Make clear that the Medicare working aged provisions apply not onlyto employees but also to the self-employed, such as owners of businessesor independent contractors, and to members of the clergy and of religiousbodies (andSection; 411.70(d)). b. Make clear that a reemployed annuitant or retiree who is covered byan employer group health plan is considered covered ``by reason of employment'',even if_ andbullet; The plan is the same plan that previously provided coverage tothat individual when he was a retiree or annuitant; or andbullet; The premiums for the plan are paid from a retirement pension orfund. (andSection; 411.72(c)) c. Modify the definition of ``employer group health plan'' to make clearthat it includes plans under the auspices of employers that make no financialcontribution, the so-called ``employee-pay-all'' plans. d. Remove from the definition of ``employer group health plan'' (andSection;411.70(d)), the statement that a multiemployer plan does not have to payprimary benefits for individuals whom it can identify as employed by employersof less than 20 employees. (This currently appears in andSection; 405.340(b)(1).)e. Specify that, effective July 17, 1987, individuals who receive employerdisability payments that are subject to taxation under FICA are consideredemployed (for purposes of the working aged provisions), even if they receivedsocial security disability benefits before attaining age 65. (July 17,1987 is the effective date of HCFA general instructions issued under OBRAsection 9319.) f. Make clear, in andSection; 411.75, the circumstances under which HCFAdoes or does not make Medicare primary payments and conditional primarypayments. <ITAG tagnum="81">J. To Provide Uniform Rules for Determination of the Amount of MedicareRecovery From a Party That Has Incurred Costs To Obtain a Judgment or SettlementThat Resulted in a Third Party Payment </ITAG>1. <T3>Current rules. </T3>Under andSection; 405.324(b), when a beneficiaryhas received a liability insurance payment as a result of a judgment orsettlement, Medicare reduces its recovery to take account of the procurementcosts, that is, costs such as attorney fees that the beneficiary incurredin order to obtain the judgment or settlement. 2. <T3>Discussion. </T3>Although procurement costs are generally incurredby a beneficiary and in connection with liability insurance, occasionallythey may be incurred by another party or in connection with other typesof insurance that are primary to Medicare.We believe that, as a matter of equity, the current provision should bemade applicable also when another party has incurred procurement costsand when the judgment or settlement is obtained under other types of insuranceprimary to Medicare. However, there need to be some exceptions and limitations. HCFA shouldnot take account of procurement costs that do not reduce the amount ofa judgment or settlement payment that is actually available to the party.This is the case, for instance, under the many workers' compensation lawsthat provide separate awards for attorney fees. Furthermore, there should be a special rule for a situation in which HCFAitself incurs procurement costs, i.e., must file suit because the partythat received payment opposes HCFA's recovery. 3. <T3>Proposed change. </T3>We would broaden the current rules, as notedunder the above discussion and include it in Subpart B, which is of generalapplicability, as andSection; 411.37. Section 411.37 would specify the amountsof Medicare recovery under different circumstances: (a) If the Medicare payment is less than the judgment or settlement payment,HCFA would share proportionately in the party's procurement costs. (b) If Medicare payment equals or exceeds the judgment or settlement payments,HCFA recovers only the amount that remains after subtracting the party'stotal procurement costs. (c) If HCFA incurs procurement costs of its own because the party thatreceived payment opposes HCFA's recovery, the recovery amount would bethe lower of the following: andbullet; The Medicare payment. andbullet; The total judgment or settlement amount, minus the party's totalprocurement costs. <ITAG tagnum="81">K. Clarifying Changes </ITAG>1. In andSection; 411.6 (which excludes from Medicare payment services furnishedby a Federal provider) we would include a paragraph (b)(4) to make clearthat services of a Federal provider (for example a VA hospital) are notexcluded if they are furnished under arrangements made by a participatinghospital. This ensures that a participating hospital can secure for itspatients necessary services that it cannot itself provide. 2. Consistent with Departmental rules (45 CFR 30.15) and other HCFA rules(42 CFR 401.607), andSection; 411.24(c) would make clear that HCFA may recoverby offset against any monies it owes to the entity responsible for refundingthe Medicare conditional primary payment. 3. In andSection; 411.35, we would clarify the limits on the amounts thata provider or supplier may charge the beneficiary (or someone on his orher behalf) when workers' compensation, no-fault insurance, or an employerplan is primary to Medicare. <ITAG tagnum="81">L. Organization Change </ITAG>In order to eliminate needless repetition, Subpart B of the new Part 411would set forth those definitions and rules that apply equally to all ormost of the types of insurance that are primary to Medicare. These include definitions of ``conditional payment'', ``secondary payment'',``third party payment'', and ``proper claim'', the rules on recovery ofconditional payments, and the effect of third party payment on benefitperiods, benefit utilization, and deductibles. <ITAG tagnum="84">Redesignation </ITAG>As part of the overall plan to reorganize the Medicare rules and provideadequate room for expansion, most of Subpart C of Part 405 would be redesignatedunder a new Part 411_Exclusions from Medicare, with a separate subpartfor each type of third party payer. A redesignation table presented atthe end of this preamble will enable the reader to locate specific contentunder the new numbers. <ITAG tagnum="84">Response to Comments </ITAG>Because of the large number of pieces of correspondence we normally receiveon proposed regulations, we cannot acknowledge or respond to them individually.However, we will consider all comments that are received by the end ofthe comment period and, if we proceed with a final rule, we will respondto those comments in the preamble to that rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact Statement </ITAG>Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires us to prepare and publish an initialregulatory impact analysis for any proposed regulation that meets one ofthe E.O. criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely toresult in: an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. In addition, we generally prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysisthat is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C.601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulationwould not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. For the purposes of the RFA, we treat all providers andthird party insurers as small entities. Also, section 1102(b) of the SocialSecurity Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysisif this proposed rule may have a significant impact on the operations ofa substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis must alsoconform to provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital withfewer than 50 beds located outside a metropolitan statistical area.Many provisions of this proposed rule either conform to recent statutorychanges or reflect current HCFA operating policies as expressed in programinstructions and manuals. These regulatory provisions, of themselves, wouldnot affect Medicare program expenditures. The other provisions of thisproposed rule would either correct overly narrow interpretations of existentstatutory authority, extend statutory precedents applying to some thirdparty payers to additional categories of payers, or clarify and increasethe consistency of our Medicare secondary payer rules. Of these proposedrule changes, we anticipate that all but one would have a negligible impactupon program expenditures. The proposed change at andSection; 411.50(b), under which the definitionof ``no fault insurance'' would be extended to include all types of nofault insurance, would bring our regulations into line with the intendedscope of section 1862(b)(1) of the Act. The enacting legislation (section953 of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980) clearly does not limit Medicare'ssecondary status to automobile no fault situations. However, our currentregulations at andSection; 405.322 (published as a final rule at 48 FR 14810)only partially implements the statute by making Medicare the secondarypayer to automobile no fault medical coverage only. We did not considerother forms of no fault liability insurance in the development of our currentregulations. Because of this regulatory oversight, our intermediaries andcarriers have been precluded from pursuing Trust Fund savings that wouldotherwise be available. This proposed rule change would then allow us tomaximize Trust Fund savings to the extent permitted by law. While we cannotat this time produce a precise estimate of the savings that would be achievedby this change, we expect that the maximum available savings would fallsignificantly short of the E.O. 12291 thresholds specified above. We expect that implementation of these rule changes would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For example,our proposal to amend andSection; 489.20 to require certain additional commitmentsin all provider agreements would largely serve to highlight the importanceof identifying Medicare secondary payer claims. Our intermediary and providerinstructions already require hospitals and other providers to systematicallyidentify and, where appropriate, bill payers that are primary to Medicarefirst. Subsequent to the OIG study, discussed under ``Background'' above, we instituteda computerized cross reference system (insurance companies, ESRD programs,etc.) to identify claims that should have been billed to payers primaryto Medicare. Once these payers are identified by the computer trackingsystem, the claims are referred back to the provider responsible for initialbilling. Under this system, Medicare no longer pays such bills automatically.This computerized cross reference system may eventually bring about someadministrative cost savings, to the extent that intermediaries may notbe required to process claims that providers properly charge to third partypayers. Providers may also reap several benefits once they take advantageof the fact that, in many circumstances, Medicare is the secondary payer.Current manuals instruct hospitals and other providers on how to identifypayers that are primary to Medicare. The marginal advantages for providerswould be savings on the administrative costs of billing Medicare, and additionalincome when the third party payer pays a higher rate than Medicare wouldnormally pay as primary payer. These benefits are already available toproviders under current instructions, and would not be altered by theseproposed rules. The proposed rule change at andSection; 411.70(d) would remove from the definitionof ``employer group health plan'' the statement that a multiemployer plandoes not have to pay primary benefits for individuals whom it can identifyas employees of employers of less than 20 employees. We had used our administrativediscretion (at 50 FR 14510) to grant this exception in light of then applicablestatutory precedents. However, for the reasons set forth elsewhere in thispreamble, we no longer believe this exception is appropriate. This regulatorychange may have an economic impact on some small entities, primarily thosemultiemployer plans (and the corresponding small employers with fewer than20 employees) which have routinely taken advantage of the current provisionat andSection; 405.340(b)(1)(ii). Such insurers may initially face the possibilityof increased outlays; however, employers with fewer than 20 employees mayreact to this rule change by setting up a single employer plan or by joiningmultiemployer plans composed entirely of employers with less than 20 employees.In the long run, then, we anticipate that this proposed provision wouldhave little economic effect. Furthermore, we do not believe that this provisionwould affect a substantial number of small entities, as (to the best ofour knowledge) few plan administrators have taken advantage of the currentexception in the past. For these reasons, we have determined that a regulatory impact analysisis not required. Further, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies,that this proposed rule would not have significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities and would not have a significant impacton the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.

(f) <T3>Examples:</T3> (1) A hospital furnished 7 days of inpatient hospital care in 1987 to aMedicare beneficiary. The provider's charges for Medicare-covered servicestotalled $2,800. The third party payer paid $2,360. No part of the Medicareinpatient hospital deductible of $520 had been met. If the gross amountpayable by Medicare in this case is $2,700, then as secondary payer, Medicarepays the lowest of the following amounts: (i) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the Medicare inpatient hospitaldeductible: $2,700^$520=$2,180. (ii) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the third party payment:$2,700^$2,360=$340. (iii) The provider's charges minus the third party payment: $2,800^$2,360=$440.(iv) The provider's charges minus the Medicare deductible: $2,800^$520=$2,280.Medicare's secondary payment is $340 and the combined payment made by thethird party payer and Medicare on behalf of the beneficiary is $2,700.The $520 deductible was satisfied by the third party payment so that thebeneficiary incurred no out-of-pocket expenses. (2) A hospital furnished 1 day of inpatient hospital care in 1987 to aMedicare beneficiary. The provider's charges for Medicare-covered servicestotalled $750. The third party payer paid $450. No part of the Medicareinpatient hospital deductible had been met previously. The third partypayment is credited toward that deductible. If the gross amount payableby Medicare in this case is $850, then as secondary payer, Medicare paysthe lowest of the following amounts: (i) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the Medicare deductible:$850^$520=$330. (ii) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the third party payment:$850^$450=$400. (iii) The provider's charges minus the third party payment: $750^$450=$300.(iv) The provider's charges minus the Medicare deductible: $750^$520=$230.Medicare's secondary payment is $230, and the combined payment made bythe third party payer and Medicare on behalf of the beneficiary is $680.The hospital may bill the beneficiary $70 (the $520 deductible minus the$450 third party payment). This fully discharges the beneficiary's deductibleobligation. (3) An ESRD beneficiary received 8 dialysis treatments for which a facilitycharged $160 per treatment for a total of $1,280. No part of the beneficiary's$75 Part B deductible had been met. The third party payer paid $1,024 forMedicare-covered services. The composite rate per dialysis treatment atthis facility is $131 or $1,048 for 8 treatments. As secondary payer, Medicarepays the lowest of the following: (i) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the applicable Medicaredeductible and coinsurance: $1,048^$75^$194.60=$778.40. (The coinsuranceis calculated as follows: $1,048 composite rate ^$75 deductible =$973andmultiply;.20=$194.60.)(ii) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the third party payment:$1,048^$1,024=$24. (iii) The provider's charges minus the third party payment: $1,280^$1,024=$256.(iv) The provider's charges minus the Medicare deductible: $1,280^$75=$1,205.Medicare pays $24. The beneficiary's Medicare deductible and coinsurancewere met by the third party payment.(4) A hospital furnished 5 days of inpatient care in 1987 to a Medicarebeneficiary. The provider's charges for Medicare-covered services were$4,000 and the gross amount payable was $3,500. The provider agreed toaccept $3,000 from the third party as payment in full. The third partypayer paid $2,900 due to a deductible requirement under the third partyplan. Medicare considers the amount the provider is obligated to acceptas full payment ($3,000) to be the provider charges. The Medicare secondarypayment is the lowest of the following:(i) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the Medicare inpatient deductible:$3,500^$520=$2,980.(ii) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the third party payment:$3,500^$2,900=$600.(iii) The provider's charges minus the third party payment: $3,000^$2,900=$100.(iv) The provider's charges minus the Medicare inpatient deductible: $3,000^$520=$2480.The Medicare secondary payment is $100. When Medicare is the secondarypayer, the combined payment made by the third party payer and Medicareon behalf of the beneficiary is $3,000. The beneficiary has no liabilityfor Medicare-covered services since the third party payment satisfied the$520 deductible. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 411.35 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Limitations on charges to a beneficiary or other party when a worker'scompensation plan, a no-fault insurer, or an employer group health planis primary payer. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Definition. </T3>As used in this section. ``Medicare-covered services''means services for which Medicare benefits are payable or would be payableexcept for the Medicare deductible and coinsurance provisions and the amountspayable by the third party payer.

(Under the Act, an applicationmay not be retroactive for more than 12 months.) (d) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate how to determine,in different situations, the number of months during which Medicare issecondary payer. (1) <T3>Individual filed a timely application and became entitled without awaiting period. </T3>In October 1981, John began a regular course of dialysisand filed an application for Medicare. In December 1981, John began trainingfor self-dialysis. Since John initiated self-dialysis training during thefirst 3 months of dialysis, he is exempt from the waiting period and becomesentitled as of October 1981, the first month of dialysis. In this situation,the month of entitlement coincides with the beginning of the 12-month periodand Medicare is secondary payer during the entire period. (2) <T3>Individual filed a timely application and became entitled to Medicareafter a waiting period. </T3>(i) Janice started a regular course of renaldialysis in October 1981 and filed an application in the same month. The12-month period begins with October 1981, but the 3-month waiting perioddoesn't end until December 1981. The month of entitlement for Janice isJanuary 1982. Medicare is secondary payer from January through September1982. (ii) Peter started a regular course of dialysis in January 1982, and washospitalized and received a kidney transplant in March 1982. The 12-monthperiod begins with January 1982. The kidney transplant cuts short the dialysiswaiting period so that Peter becomes entitled in March 1982. Medicare issecondary payer from March through December 1982. (3) <T3>Individual did not file a timely application. </T3>In January 1982,Katherine suffered kidney failure and received a kidney transplant butdid not apply for Medicare until July, 1983. Since the application is retroactivefor only 12 months, Katherine becomes entitled to Medicare in July 1982.The 12-month period begins in January 1982, the month in which Katherinecould have been entitled if she had filed a timely application. Medicareis secondary payer from July through December 1982. (e) <T3>Effect of changed basis for Medicare entitlement. </T3>If the basisfor an individual's entitlement to Medicare changes from ESRD to age 65or disability, the 12-month period terminates with the month before themonth in which the change is effective. (f) <T3>Determinations for subsequent periods of ESRD entitlement. </T3>Ifan individual has more than one period of entitlement based solely on ESRD,a period during which Medicare may be secondary payer will be determinedfor each period of entitlement, in accordance with this section. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 411.65</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Basis for conditional Medicare payments. </ITAG>(a)<T3> General rule.</T3>1<NOTE/> Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, theMedicare intermediary or carrier may make a conditional payment if_ <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>1 For services furnished before January 21, 1988, conditionalMedicare payments were made unless HCFA determined that the employer planwould pay the particular claims as promptly as Medicare.
