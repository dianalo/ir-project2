Juvenile Court Judge Orrelle Weeks ruled Tuesday that temporarycustody of the girl be given to Maxine McCaslin, 43, who has raisedthe child since she was 6 months old. A hearing on permanentcustody was not immediately scheduled.   Until Friday, the girl was unaware that McCaslin was not herbiological mother. That day, Cynthia Anderson, 31, was in asupermarket when she heard the voice of McCaslin, who used to workfor her as a baby sitter. Anderson had not seen McCaslin since1977, when she said the sitter and Anderson's daughter vanished.   Anderson got McCaslin's license number and notified police.Detective Mona Jaramillo said the women had lived just 17 blocksapart for the last two years.   ``It's a very sticky situation,'' said police Sgt. Gordon Reed.``There's always two sides to every story.''   Anderson, has charged that police mishandled the case and failedto investigate abduction charges she filed at the time of thedisappearance.   ``I will fight this. I will,'' Anderson said. ``They can believeit. And if they think they're going to wear me out, they can thinkagain.''   Police said Tuesday that Anderson did not report her childmissing until six weeks after McCaslin allegedly disappeared withher daughter. The report she filed was for a violation of custody,not kidnapping, officials said.   McCaslin told police that Anderson asked her to care for thechild because Anderson could not.   ``It was hell keeping the secret,'' police quoted McCaslin assaying. She had an unlisted telephone number and could not bereached for comment.   All supplemental reports and investigative reports, if there wasan investigation, have been destroyed, police said. They are forcedto rely on officers' memories.   The Rocky Mountain News quoted sources close to theinvestigation who said that at the time her child disappeared,Anderson was working as a dancer at a strip joint or as an employeein a nearby adult arcade.   When she said her baby sitter had taken her child, ``the officerthought I was overreacting,'' Anderson said Tuesday. ``He said Icouldn't just accuse someone of a felony.   ``He said I had to wait a legal amount of time and file amissing person report. I went back and signed a piece of paper thatsaid she was kidnapped. They said they put out an arrest warrant.''   Denver police never put out a warrant. They filed the case as acustody dispute.   McCaslin told the girl of her history after both were taken topolice headquarters Friday night, police said. No charges werefiled.   ``We are not sure whether we will file criminal charges againstMcCaslin at this point,'' said Capt. Jim Fitzpatrick. ``The mainperson we and the courts are concerned about at this point is thevictim.''   Police said the girl had been well treated and was raised in anexcellent environment. Neighbors and school officials said the girlis a well-adjusted seventh-grader, a B-plus student and avolleyball player at a private school.   Jaramillo said police were unable to comment on McCaslin'swhereabouts until two years ago because it is part of theinvestigation. There also was no information immediately availableabout the girl's father.   Anderson's lawyer, Dennis Blewitt, said his client was an unwedmother who ``was kicked out of her home'' as a teen-ager. Althoughshe is unemployed and not married, she received an insurancesettlement after an accident and is financially capable of caringfor her daughter, he said.   Blewitt said the city Department of Social Services, which tookcustody of the child over the weekend, refused to let his clientsee her daughter Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
