The Federal Open Market Committee, which establishes policy forthe central bank, voted 11-1 at its Dec. 13-14 meeting to ``increasesomewhat'' its restraint on reserves held by commercial banks,according to minutes of the session.   Lowering the amount of cash which banks have available to backloans drives up the interest rates charged on those loans.   The Fed minutes said most members favored some immediate addedrestraint on reserves, ``with some further tightening to beimplemented at the start of 1989, assuming that economic andfinancial conditions remained reasonably consistent with currentexpectations.''   The Fed, whose main job is to guard against inflation, has beenpushing up interest rates in an effort to slow economic growth to amore sustainable level and thus keep prices in check.   At the committee's December meeting, the minutes said, ``membersfocused on indications of continuing strength in the economicexpansion.''   ``Many expressed concern that continued expansion at a relativelyrapid pace raised the risk that inflation would intensify,'' theysaid.   The lone dissenter was Martha Seger, who ``viewed currentbusiness indicators as already pointing on balance to slowereconomic expansion,'' the minutes said.   Ms. Seger ``expressed particular concern that the higher interestrates implied by greater monetary restraint would aggravate'' thecondition of the financially troubled savings and loan industry,they said.   The Fed began a series of credit-tightening steps last Marchwhich included a one-half percentage point increase last August inthe discount rate, the interest it charges to make bank loans. Thediscount rate now stands at 6.5 percent.   Many private economists have been predicting the Fed willcontinue to push interest rates upward in the face of strongeconomic reports.   Those expectations were reinforced by a report from the LaborDepartment on Friday showing wholesale prices in January rose attheir fastest pace in nearly three years.   Several of the nation's biggest banks on Friday increased theirprime lending rate by one-half percentage point to 11 percent,reflecting the continuing rise of interest rates.   Mortgage rates have been rising as well. The Federal Home LoanMortgage Corp. reported Friday that fixed-rate mortgages now standat 10.56 percent, up from 9.84 percent a year earlier.   The Fed's Open Market Committee met behind closed doors againTuesday and Wednesday to review policy and set monetary growthtargets for 1989. Their actions will not be revealed until FedChairman Alan Greenspan testifies before Congress on Feb. 21.   Greenspan, in testimony before Congress last month, said the riskof inflation remained strong enough that the Fed should ``err moreon the side of restrictiveness than stimulus'' in determiningmonetary policy.   But Fed efforts to slow the economy could spell trouble for theBush administration, which has tied its plans to reduce the federalbudget deficit without increasing taxes to expectations of strongeconomic growth.   President Bush, asked about the latest inflation figures while ona visit to Ottawa, said he was ``not overly concerned aboutinflation at this point,'' although he added, ``I don't like thefigures.''   The Open Market Committee decided to tighten the central bank'sgrip because members felt ``the risks of a downturn stemming fromthe limited tightening under consideration were extremely small andneeded to be accepted in light of what they perceived as the muchgreater threat of a recession if inflation were allowed tointensify,'' the minutes said.   Minutes of this week's Open Market Committee meeting won't bereleased until after the committee's next meeting March 28. Thecommittee is composed of the seven-member Federal Reserve Board andfive of the 12 presidents of the Fed's regional banks.</TEXT></DOC>
