A report by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a part of the Commerce Department, urged regulators to scrap traditional regulation, which allows telephone companies to recover costs and earn a fixed percentage as profit.    The telecommunications administration proposed that regulators end all control of ATandamp;T's long-distance business, except its 800 service. The long-distance &quot;business in almost all respects is competitive,&quot; said Alfred Sikes, an assistant commerce secretary who heads the agency.    The proposal comes a few weeks before the expected launch of an inquiry into ATandamp;T deregulation by the Federal Communications Commission, which has authority over the company. The Commerce Department panel can only recommend policy changes, but former FCC Chairman Mark Fowler says its recommendations carry clout. &quot;The FCC gives deference to executive branch agencies to a considerable degree, particularly NTIA,&quot; he said.    FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick has suggested replacing current regulation of ATandamp;T with a plan that would cap phone rates and allow ATandamp;T to keep much of the profit from cost-cutting measures. The Commerce Department panel proposal goes further than the Patrick plan, and seems designed to pressure the FCC into making a more far-reaching proposal.    The Commerce Department report argued that traditional regulation inhibits innovation and causes companies to pad costs.    But deregulation is increasingly controversial in Congress, where legislators fear that ATandamp;T will use any new freedom to jack up prices to consumers, and to slash prices to business customers who might otherwise turn to ATandamp;T's competitors.    &quot;I have grave concerns that the marketplace isn't optimally competitive yet,&quot; said House telecommunications subcommittee chairman Edward Markey (D., Mass.). &quot;Consumers are facing the risk of much higher prices.&quot; Mr. Markey plans to hold hearings on ATandamp;T deregulation this fall.    The Commerce Department's Mr. Sikes said ATandamp;T would be foolish to raise its prices. &quot;If ATandamp;T does report excessive profits, the regulators, or politicians spurring them on, would push to reregulate,&quot; he said.    Gene Kimmelman, legislation director of the Consumer Federation of America, said that even if ATandamp;T doesn't increase its rates with deregulation, it wouldn't drop the rates as quickly as it would under traditional regulation. Indeed, MCI Communications Corp. is backing deregulation of ATandamp;T because it feels it would do better financially if ATandamp;T, rather than the government, set the rates.    ATandamp;T said it applauded the agency's recommendations. But a spokesman added that the company doesn't expect to be completely deregulated because such a move would require a change in the Communications Act. &quot;We don't think that's politically viable,&quot; he said.    ATandamp;T closed at $30.625, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. With 2.1 million shares changing hands, ATandamp;T was the most active issue on the Big Board.    The Commerce Department's report also proposed that state and federal regulators vastly change how they regulate local Bell telephone companies, which are governed along the same lines as ATandamp;T is currently. The report generally urged freezing rates, while giving the Bell companies authority to raise those rates annually for inflation. The agency suggested that regulators could review the effect of the price-freeze plan in three years.    A number of states are looking at similar plans, but the Commerce Department panel's influence over them is slight. </TEXT></DOC>
