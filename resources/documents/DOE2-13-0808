<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-13-0808 </DOCNO><TEXT>A high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneousdetermination of C/sub 1/-C/sub 2/ aldehydes and organic acids in aqueoussamples has been developed. Aldehydes and organic acids are separatedafter derivatization of the aldehydes by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine andby gradient elution on reversed-phase material. Measurement is by UVand conductivity, respectively. The detection limits, using an injectionvolume of 100 ul, for formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, formic acid and aceticacid are 5 ug.l/sup -1/, 10 ug.l/sup -1/, 20 ug.l/sup -1/ and 30 ug.l/sup-1/, respectively. Aldehydes are stabilized by the derivatization reagentfor a period of maximal five days in the field. Results of measurementsof rain, mist and dew samples, collected in Petten (The Netherlands)indicate the presence of C/sub 1/-C/sub 2/ aldehydes and organic acidsin the range from 0.01 to 3 mg.l/sup -1/. 6 figs., 42 refs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
