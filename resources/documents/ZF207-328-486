 And while the rate at which this happensshows signs of slowing, it looks as if it will continue to be true for atleast another 30 years.andP;  The Macintosh has already eclipsed the hugemainframe systems of 25 years ago in speed and processing power, and it isclosing in on the mainframes of only ten years ago.andP;  It won't be too manyyears from now when the Macintosh (or its successor) on your desk approachesthe power of the mainframes of today.andM;Many people think that the era of &quot;desktop mainframes&quot; will mean the death ofthe large centralized mainframes.andP;  Of course, many thought the minicomputerwas going to be the death of the mainframe.andP;  In fact, almost everysignificant advance in computer technology has been predicted by someone tomean the death of the mainframe.andP;  Yet there are more mainframes installedevery year.andP;  Why does the mainframe hold on against all these technologicalassaults?andP;  The answer is simple, really: data.andM;A computer system has two major components -- the computer (processor,memory, I/O buses) and the external data storage (disks, tapes).andP;  The majortechnological advances have been mainly in the computer component.andP;  Disks andtapes today are essentially the same as the disks and tapes of 20 years ago.andM;Several 300-megabyte hard disks, and even some hard disks with 600 megabytesand more, are available for the Macintosh now.andP;  But most mainframes havehundreds or even thousands of gigabytes (billions of bytes) of disk storageon-line as well as huge vaults of tape archives.andP;  Without this kind of verylarge data-storage ability, no microcomputer will ever cause the death ofmainframes.andM;The storage limitations of the Macintosh were underscored for me by a recentproduct announcement.andP;  Ebbars Microcomputing Company of Miami is developing asystem called HOPS (Heuristic Optimized Processing System), a new approach todatabase organization, indexing, and sorting that achieves performanceimprovements that are orders of magnitude better than existing products.andO;These performance advantages get more pronounced the more records there arein a file, so database files of millions of records are still lightning fast.andO;The prototype system runs on a Macintosh, so a demonstration with hundreds ofmillions of records is not really feasible, since there are few to no diskscapable of holding files that large.andP;  The principals in the company are allMacintosh enthusiasts and are committed to the Macintosh, but they maysomeday see their product making mainframes faster instead of improvingMacintosh performance, all because of the limitations of microcomputer diskstorage.andM;Even if the disk storage capabilities of mainframes could be harnessedlocally by desktop mainframelike computers, there are still many issues thatmake centralized mainframes attractive.andP;  Microcomputers and their programmersare just starting to learn how to share data, while mainframes have done thisroutinely for 20 years.andP;  Security, a major concern for most corporate users,is a gaping hole in most microcomputer software.andP;  Backup/recovery proceduresand disaster recovery plans are much easier to implement and facilitate in acentralized environment than in one where the data is scattered hither andyon.andM;So what does the future hold?andP;  Desktop computers will continue to become morepowerful.andP;  This will allow more processing to be off-loaded from mainframes.andO;But centralization of corporate data will still be desirable, so themainframes of the future are likely to be database servers to the desktopcomputers, where much of the processing will be done.andM;It will also be possible for companies to design true distributed databases(a dream of many database administrators), where departmental or branch datais stored on local micro-based database servers and aggregate data is storedcentrally.andP;  This type of design would have the benefits of local processing(like speed and isolation from host system problems) while still reaping mostof the benefits of centralized data storage.andP;  Mainframe servers could also beused as backups for local node databases.andM;The kind of cooperation required between the mainframes and the desktopcomputers will mean that designers of both kinds of systems will have to beconcerned with the capabilities of both.andP;  Since IBM makes both mainframes anddesktop systems, it has a head start and is working on strategies for thefuture based on OS/2 and Systems Application Architecture.andP;  If Apple wants tobe involved in the true distributed systems of the future, it needs tocontinue to explore these issues.andP;  Apple has started to move in thisdirection with products like MacWorkstation and MacAPPC, and its strategicalliance with Digital Equipment is intended to continue in a similardirection.andM;A critical component in the architectures of the future will be communicationlinks, another area that has not kept pace with advances in processortechnology but which is trying to catch up.andP;  Without advancements in thecommercialization of technologies such as fiber optics and ISDN, the vastamounts of data that will need to be trnasferred between mainframes anddesktop mainframes will become a major stumbling block to true distributedand peer-to-peer systems.andM;Centralized mainframes haven't died yet, and it will take more than desktopmainframes to kill them.andP;  The role of the mainframe will change over time,but it will survive for some time to come.andP;  The real question is whetherApple will the able to move far enough and fast enough in the right directionto be ready for the changed world the desktop mainframe will inhabit.andP;  Time,as they say, will tell.andM;PINSTRIPE PICKSandM;Some products that you may want to investigate if you need to connect yourMacintosh to an IBM mainframe now:andM;Netway 1000 and 2000 (TriData).andP;  These units take the place of 3274 remotecontrollers (and at attractive prices) and let you use Macs on an AppleTalknetwork as 3270 terminals.andP;  Software allows multiple sessions per Macintosh.andM;MacMainframe (Avatar).andP;  Software and add-in cards for the Macintosh II and SElines that allow coaxial attachment to a 3274 controller.andM;MacIrma (DCA).andP;  Software and Macintosh II and SE cards for 3274 coaxialattachment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
