DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Harry Hopkins had something in common withSamuel Pierce. Both were in charge of programs to help the poor.Both got a lot of criticism for the way they ran them.   In the case of Pierce, former President Reagan's housingsecretary, critics have said the poor people weren't getting thehelp.   In the case of Hopkins, the trouble was that they were gettingthe help, and critics of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal didn'tlike it.   Pierce's troubles have been in the news recently ascongressional investigators probe his administration of theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development's housing subsidyprograms.   The story of Hopkins, the social worker who headed the WorksProgress Administration and later became Roosevelt's most trustedwartime aide, is told tonight in a 90-minute PBS documentary airingat 9 p.m. EDT.   ``Hopkins kept the WPA free of scandal and became one of themost vilified public servants in modern times,'' narrator WalterCronkite says.   Businessmen said the New Deal agency undermined the morals ofworkers and created boondoggles for the lazy. Hopkins said if hedeserved any criticism it was ``that I didn't do enough when I hadthe chance'' to help the down and out.   Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Pulitzer Prize-winning historian of theNew Deal, who appears on the program, said in an interview, ``Thereis a difference between having idealists in government and havingpeople who are there either to promote their own careers or to makecontacts so they can make more money after their governmentservice. Idealists have many faults, but they rarely steal.''   Among others who reminisce about Hopkins on the documentary isthe late Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., a young senator in New Dealdays, who talked to the filmmakers in one of his last interviews.   ``You never heard of Harry Hopkins trying to make any money,getting Roosevelt to approve some project over there, getting somefellow a contract. He wouldn't any more have asked for that than hewould have asked for the Lord to come down in person,'' says Pepper.   Pamela Harriman, who met Hopkins when she was WinstonChurchill's daughter-in-law and Hopkins came on a wartime missionto Britain, is interviewed on the program, for which two Harrimanfamily foundations provided part of the funding.   She said the foundations took no part in planning for thedocumentary, but were called on for help when the producers neededto send three staff members to Moscow to obtain Soviet newsreelfootage.   Hopkins had a brusque manner and a talent for getting at theheart of things, which prompted Churchill to tell him jocularlythat the British crown was going to name him ``Lord Root of theMatter.''   The producers originally chose this for the title, but droppedit in favor of the more down-to-earth: ``Harry Hopkins: At FDR'sSide.''   ``You know, people today, the young, don't know who HarryHopkins is,'' Mrs. Harriman said. ``And he really was a giant, thattiny little man, and he did a yeoman's job.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wednesday PMs, Oct. 11</NOTE></DOC>
