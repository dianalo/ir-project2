The figure was above the carrier's prediction, made when it went public last May, that profit would be at least $128 million. Revenue rose 20%, to $1.16 billion from $963.9 million.    CIE. GENERALE D'ELECTRICITE of France is planning to raise the equivalent of about $980 million, &quot;plus or minus 15%,&quot; through a share offering that will coincide with its denationalization in May, financial sources said. The sources said CGE, which has interests in telecommunications, cables, energy and shipbuilding, has long been undercapitalized. The funds will be used partly to finance the group's participation in a telecommunications joint venture it formed recently with ITT Corp. of the U.S. CGE is expected to be put on the market May 11.    SUN HUNG KAI andamp; CO., a Hong Kong securities company, said profit rose 80% in 1986, to the equivalent of $15.6 million from $8.6 million a year earlier, converting the Hong Kong dollar at its current rate. Sun Hung Kai is owned chiefly by a group of Hong Kong businessmen and Hong Kong's Fung family. Earlier this year, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. of the U.S. sold its 25% stake in the company to a group of Hong Kong and foreign investors. </TEXT></DOC>
