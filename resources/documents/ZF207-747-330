(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By J.B.andP;  MilesandM;Showcasing ISDN technology as a serious alternative for managing LAN-to-LANdata traffic, Fujitsu Network Switching of America Inc. and VitalinkCommunications Corp. teamed up recently to demonstrate the connection ofEthernet and Token-Ring LANs over live ISDN circuits.andM;The demonstration at the recent Tele-Communications Association (TCA) show inSan Diego boasted a combination of routers, adapters, desktop applicationsand LAN peripherals that showed the feasibility of running traditionalnetwork services such as file and printer sharing, mass storage, desktopconferencing and facsimile over Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)lines at speeds up to 256K bps, officials from the companies said.andM;The main goal of the demonstration was to show that ISDN Basic Rate Interface(2B+D) technology can offer major cost advantages and speed improvements overmore conventional devices for connecting LANs, said Dean Wolf, marketingmanager for ISDN network products at Fujitsu, in San Jose, Calif.andM;&quot;Our ISDN-based system is faster than traditional analog modems and muchcheaper than T-1 circuits for connecting LANs,&quot; Wolf said.andM;Most analog modems transfer data at 9,600 bps, while the cost of installing1.544M-bps T-1 circuits usually involves a one-time fee of about $2,000 percircuit and steep monthly charges for bandwidth that sometimes goes unused,he said.andM;The Fujitsu/Vitalink demonstration used a Pacific Bell ISDN central-officeswitch in downtown San Diego for the ISDN circuit at Fujitsu's TCA booth.andP;  AToken-Ring LAN was linked to an Ethernet LAN by means of Vitalink's TransPath550 and 350 ISDN routers and Fujitsu's SRS-410 ISDN stand-alone terminaladapters.andP;  This gave the Token-Ring LAN access to the Ethernet LAN's printand file servers as well as its Fujitsu RX 7300 laser printer and StorEdgemass-storage device.andM;The design of the Vitalink 550 and 350 ISDN routers provided the key to thesystem's effectiveness for midsized departmental LANs, said Jeffrey Slagle, anetwork design consultant for Vitalink in Fremont, Calif.andP;  The routers canprovide speeds up to 256K bps, depending on the number of 64K-bps ISDNchannels used, he said.andM;Release dates and pricing for a commercial version of the system were notgiven.andP;  Fujitsu can be reached at (408) 432-1300, Vitalink at (415) 794-1100.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
