(``Company''), has filed an application withthe Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to section12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgatedthereunder to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registrationon the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``AMEX'').The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securitiesfrom listing and registration include the following:As of August 18, 1989, there were 53 registered holders of the SubordinatedDebentures. Additionally, since the original issuance of the SubordinatedDebentures in August of 1983, trading volume has been relatively low. Forexample, in 1988, there were 51 transactions in the Subordinated Debentureswith a total volume of $599,000 and in 1989 (through August 19, 1989),there were 19 transactions with a total volume of $205,000. Furthermore,the continued listing of the Subordinated Debentures is costly to the Company.The Company believes that a delisting of the Senior Subordinated Debenturesfrom the AMEX is warranted. As of August 18, 1989, there were 15 registeredholders of the Senior Subordinated Debentures. Additionally, since theoriginal issuance of the Senior Subordinated Debentures in April of 1986,trading volume has been relatively low. For example, in 1988, there weretwo transactions in the Senior Subordinated Debentures with a total volumeof $45,000, and in 1989 (through August 30, 1989), there was one transactionwith a total volume of $10,000. Finally, the continued listing of the SeniorSubordinated Debentures is costly to the Company.Any interested person may, on or before November 17, 1989, submit by letterto the Secretary of the Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington,DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordancewith the rules of the Exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposedby the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, basedon the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the applicationafter the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to ordera hearing on the matter.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
