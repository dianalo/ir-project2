OTC traders say dull markets often generate waves of rumors, which tend to proliferate when some OTC investors or traders get bored with the lack of activity.    Yesterday, St. Jude Medical, for example, slid 2 to 24 5/8 on rumors that David Duclof, a Dain Bosworth analyst, had dropped his earnings estimates for the medical equipment company as well as his recommendation. He was out of town.    By the time Mr. Duclof could be located and his response put out over the Minneapolis brokerage firm's wire it was afternoon and the stock had hit Nasdaq's most-active list, down 2 1/4. &quot;St. Jude Medical is weak today on a misunderstanding,&quot; was his response. &quot;Buy on the weakness,&quot; he urged investors, emphasizing that he still considered St. Jude a strong &quot;buy.&quot;    More OTC issues rose in price yesterday than fell. About 1,081 stocks advanced in price, compared with 978 that declined. But advancers and decliners each accounted for about 33 million of the 107 million shares that traded yesterday. Issues that didn't change in price accounted for the rest.    But because small and medium-sized issues generally did better than the giant OTC issues traded by institutions yesterday, the Nasdaq 100 Index, which is the closest of the OTC indexes to the Dow Jones Industrials, fell 0.6%, or 1.87 points, to 316.18. Even so, the biggest issues on the National Association of Securities Dealers automated quotation service did better yesterday than those in the Dow, which was dragged down by disappointing special earnings gains reported by IBM.    The Nasdaq composite index fell fractionally, by 0.17 points, to 340.36.    Among some of yesterday's middle-sized winners, Standard Microsystems, a computer hardware manufacturer with stock currently valued at about $85 million in the marketplace, rose 1 1/8 to 8 on a $9-a-share cash tender offer for its stock. And a few similar-sized computer and software issues rose in price. Cronus Industries, which makes a computerized system for recording and tabulating votes in elections, rose 3/4 to 13 3/4 on 143,900 shares.    Individuals were fairly heavy buyers yesterday, traders said, and many were looking for medical technology stocks with a story. Popular were issues such as Phoenix Medical Technology, up 1 to 10 1/2. The small company is in a turnaround, having reported earnings in recent quarters after a sequence of losses. Its share price is up from 2 3/4 a year ago. Phoenix makes surgical drapes and vinyl gloves for medical examinations. </TEXT></DOC>
