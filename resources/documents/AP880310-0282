(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   United Auto Workers union members inKenosha, Wis., have rented a billboard in this Detroit enclave toask Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca to keep their plant openand save their jobs.   Chrysler has announced it will close the former American MotorsCorp. car assembly plant in Kenosha at the end of the 1988 modelyear, eliminating 5,500 jobs. Chrysler acquired the plant when itbought AMC last year.   The billboard, located along Interstate 75 in Hamtramck, says:```Iacocca, keep your word to Kenosha!' UAW Local 72 Kenosha.''   The UAW and Wisconsin officials contend Chrysler promised tomodernize the plant and keep it open for five years of making DodgeOmni and Plymouth Horizon subcompacts. Chrysler denies it gave anyguarantees.   ``We hope this will generate interest and motivate Iacocca tochange his mind,'' said Rudy Kuzel, spokesman for Local 72.   The local paid $4,200 for one month's rent on the sign, which isa few blocks from Chrysler headquarters in Highland Park.   ``We will not crawl off in a corner,'' Kuzel said Wednesday.``They want us to lie down, play dead and wait to see how we aregoing to be buried.''   Top Chrysler and UAW leaders met in Milwaukee on Wednesday todiscuss the Kenosha plant and benefits for workers should it close.Unlike other Chrysler workers, those at Kenosha and other formerAMC plants aren't covered by the supplemental unemployment benefitsprovision of the Chrysler-UAW contract.</TEXT></DOC>
