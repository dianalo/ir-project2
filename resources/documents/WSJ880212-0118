The flare-up comes at a critical time in the relationship between the company and the United Auto Workers union. Triennial national contract talks are scheduled for this fall, and the sale of the subsidiary would create a &quot;highly charged&quot; atmosphere for those negotiations, Marc Stepp, the UAW vice president leading the Chrysler bargaining, warned at a news conference earlier this week.    At the same time, an erosion of trust could make it harder for Chrysler to get work-practice changes it says it needs to improve quality and productivity.    The Acustar Inc. subsidiary includes 20 of Chrysler's 44 U.S. facilities represented by the UAW, and employs 10,500 of the UAW's roughly 60,000 Chrysler members. The company consolidated its parts operations into a separate subsidiary last year, and last week officially confirmed that it is negotiating to sell all or part of the unit.    &quot;When (Chrysler Chairman Lee) Iacocca was not a household word, we stood with him to save his job,&quot; Mr. Stepp said, referring to worker concessions made during Chrysler's brush with bankruptcy in the early 1980s. &quot;We resent the fact that Iacocca and his colleagues are not showing any regard to help save our workers' jobs.&quot; His remarks followed an often heated strategy session of Chrysler local union leaders about how to deal with the matter.    A Chrysler spokesman declined comment on the union complaints.    The UAW said it would demand a meeting with top Chrysler officials to discuss the sale, but acknowledged that it couldn't legally strike over the issue.    Local unions, however, could call walkouts -- ostensibly over various unresolved health and safety grievances, but in reality over Acustar. For example, the UAW local at Acustar's Huntsville, Ala., electronics plant may seek permission as early as Monday to strike, according to Local 1413 President Jackie Russell.    The issue of parts workers has grown increasingly contentious at each of the Big Three auto makers. The companies complain that because they pay all their workers roughly the same wages, they pay parts workers far more than smaller parts suppliers, even ones that are based in the U.S. and are unionized. The auto makers have explored selling their parts plants to companies that would be free to slash wages. The auto makers would then, presumably, buy the parts back at a cheaper rate.    The UAW, fearing that practice, secured guarantees from General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. last fall that if a plant is sold, the new owner must adhere to the old UAW contract. Chrysler currently doesn't have such a provision in its labor agreement, but the union will push for a similar one this fall. That could be one reason the company is pushing for Acustar's sale now.    Separately, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson will hold a news conference this morning to discuss the state attorney general's recommendation to file suit against Chrysler. Chrysler, citing overcapacity, recently said it will close its aging Kenosha, Wis., car assembly plant. </TEXT></DOC>
