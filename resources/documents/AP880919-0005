The advertisements make the argument that nuclear power helpsreduce dangerous U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports.   Anti-nuclear activists, however, say the ads are misleadingbecause only about 4 percent of U.S. oil consumption goes towardgenerating electricity. They contend that the industry isbelittling or ignoring safety risks involved with nuclear power.   Spearheading the pro-nuclear campaign is the U.S. Council forEnergy Awareness, a Washington-based trade association largelysupported by the nuclear industry. USCEA's advertising and publicrelations activities are augmented by other groups, including theEdison Electric Institute, also based in Washington, representingthe nation's investor-owned utilities.   Carl Goldstein, a USCEA spokesman, said that about $7 million ofthe organization's $17 million annual budget goes to advertising.   The ad campaign includes a 15-second spot that ran during theCBS Evening News and Saturday afternoon baseball games on NBC thissummer.   The cartoon-style ad depicts a person perched atop oil drums asthey speed up and down a roller coaster. Then the person is flunginto midair and floats back to earth using a parachute emblazonedwith the words ``COAL'' and ``NUCLEAR.''   An announcer intones: ``The problem with foreign oil is thatprice and supply go up and down. To get off this roller coaster,America can use its own coal and nuclear energy. America can counton coal and nuclear energy.''   USCEA is striving to convey a similar message _ spelled out ingreater detail _ in advertisements in The Wall Street Journal andmagazines including Time, Newsweek, U.S. News andamp; World Report,Reader's Digest, National Geographic, Forbes and Sports Illustrated.   One ad says: ``Even though most Americans believe that nuclearenergy will continue to play an important role in our nation'senergy future, no new nuclear power plants are currently beingplanned. At present, too many financial, political, licensing andregulatory uncertainties stand in the way of America's furtherdeveloping its nuclear energy resources.''   Criticism of USCEA's advertising campaign has come from the SafeEnergy Communication Council, a Washington-based coalition of 13energy, environmental and public interest groups.   ``Current national television and magazine advertisementspromoting nuclear power as a solution to foreign oil dependence aremisleading and irresponsible,'' the council said in a statement.   It contended that ``since nuclear power provides onlyelectricity, it cannot substantially reduce U.S. dependence onforeign oil. ... Energy efficiency and conservation provide thegreatest potential for reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil andhelping avert another oil crisis.''   According to the organization, ``aggressive energy efficiencyprograms'' in the transportation, industrial, commercial andresidential sectors can yield seven times the oil savings possiblewith nuclear power.   Scott Denman, the council's director, said that ``when comparedto energy efficiency and conservation, the economic andenvironmental costs of nuclear power make it an undesirablealternative to oil-fired electricity.''   To counter the USCEA campaign, the council is distributingpublic service announcements to radio stations.   In one, actor Robert Redford tells listeners: ``This year thenuclear industry is spending millions to sell you on nuclear powerand also saying solar energy is not practical today. Yet every yearmore solar energy equipment is being bought by consumers and evenutilities to power a variety of our energy needs. ...   ``Nuclear energy creates wastes. Conservation creates jobs.Don't get sold on nuclear power. We can't afford the price,''Redford says in the radio spot.   USCEA's Goldstein defended the advertising campaign, saying, ``Ihave absolutely no trouble with our ads, and neither have the mediawho have carried them.''   ``The content of these ads is very carefully researched andtested externally before the ads are prepared,'' he said. ``We canback up every statement in the ads.''   Goldstein said USCEA believes that ``nuclear power is animportant component of the drive for energy self-sufficiency.'' Atthe same time, he added, ``we do not say that energy efficiency orother energy sources should be neglected.''   According to Goldstein, USCEA is trying to alert the Americanpublic to a ``serious looming energy problem'' _ growth of thedemand for electricity outstripping the ability of utilities insome areas of the country to provide the power.   Many utilities, he said, are reluctant to invest in nuclear orcoal-burning ``baseload'' generating capacity, but are resorting tooil or gas-fired combustion turbines as a short-term option forcoping with peaks in electrical demand.   ``It's happening even more than we had expected because oilprices have collapsed,'' Goldstein said. ``Utilities are now beingseduced by these low oil prices into thinking they should buildmore oil-fired capacity.''</TEXT></DOC>
