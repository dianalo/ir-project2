The demands underscore the Soviets' waning influence in EasternEurope, and they will prove a test of Moscow's willingness torelinquish control over a region where it has held sway for morethan 40 years.   If realized, the demands could also put pressure on NATO tomatch the Soviet troop pullouts with withdrawals of U.S. and otherAllied forces in Western Europe, perhaps escalating sharp cutbacksalready envisaged at Vienna talks on conventional arms reduction.   Both superpowers already have signaled willingness at thosetalks for sizeable cuts in their European forces. Washingtonproposes a ceiling of 275,000 men each for the United States andthe Soviet Union, while the Soviets want slightly higher ceilingsthat would remove other NATO forces from West Germany.   The United States has about 300,000 troops stationed in Europe;the Soviets have 575,000, according to U.S. estimates.   The Vienna agreement probably would envisage phased withdrawalover the next decade, rather than the immediate Soviet pullout thisyear sought by Czechoslovakia and Hungary.   East Germany, strategically most important to the Kremlin, hasmade more modest demands. Communist Party leader Gregor Gysiproposed all foreign troops leave both Germanys by 1999 _ atimetable and balance that probably matches Moscow's thinking.   Romania and Bulgaria, with no Soviet troops, are silent on theissue, while the prospect of German reunification leaves Poland inthe awkward position of viewing the Warsaw Pact as a guarantor ofits current borders.   The most strident demand for swift Soviet withdrawal has comefrom Prague, whose new coalition government opens negotiations Jan.15 with the Soviets on the pullout of Red Army soldiers who arrivedwith the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion and never left.   ``I suggest that the Soviet troops should withdraw fromCzechoslovakia by the end of 1990,'' Foreign Ministry spokesmanLubos Dobrovsky, like his minister and friend Jiri Dienstbier aformer dissident, said last week.   In Hungary, too, Soviet troops arrived to suppress revolution _the 1956 uprising against Stalinism _ and, as in Czechoslovakia,stayed under bilateral agreements now declared void in Prague andconsidered invalid by most Hungarians.   After the foreign affairs and military committees of Hungary'sparliament demanded withdrawal by the end of this year, HungarianPremier Miklos Nemeth met Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov lastweek to arrange bilateral talks on the issue.   But Nemeth _ unlike the current Prague government _ has stressedthe withdrawal depends on agreement on Europe-wide troop reductionsat the Vienna talks.   Some 10,000 Soviet soldiers already have left both Hungary andCzechoslovakia under the phased withdrawal of 50,000 men fromEastern Europe, which was announced by Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev in December 1988.   An additional 6,000 of the 52,000 Soviet troops said to be leftin Hungary are due to leave this year, and an undisclosed numberare scheduled to leave Czechoslovakia, where officials say thereare some 70,000 Soviet forces.   A tank regiment of 1,300 men, an anti-aircraft regiment, ahelicopter regiment and two battalions withdrew from Poland in1989, with an additional brigade of landing and assault troops dueto leave this year.   But Poland, in many fields an outspoken leader of EasternEurope's pull away from the Kremlin, has been quiet about demandinga full withdrawal of Soviet troops.   ``Poland is one of the strongest supporters of the Warsaw Pactleft in Eastern Europe,'' noted Hans Bennendijk, director ofstudies at London's International Institute of Strategic Studies.   Poland has suffered throughout its history from being sandwichedbetween Russia and Germany. With talk of German reunificationgrowing, the Warsaw Pact is protection against suggestions in WestGermany of reclaiming former German territory that became part ofPoland after World War II.   East Germany traditionally was viewed by Red Army chiefs as thebiggest conquest in the vast chunks of territory won in World WarII, protecting the Russians from a repeat of the devastating Naziattack in 1941 and enabling the Kremlin to threaten Western Europe.   Moscow has about 380,000 troops in East Germany.   Gysi's 1999 deadline for all foreign forces to leave bothGermanys fits better with the Kremlin's thinking than quickwithdrawals this year.   At the Vienna talks, the United States has proposed reducingU.S. and Soviet troops stationed abroad in the NATO and Warsaw Pactnations to 275,000 for each superpower.   The Soviet Union, eager to see cuts bite into the British,French and Canadian presence in West Germany, is talking of 300,000to 350,000 troops stationed abroad in each alliance, Westerndiplomats at the negotiations say.   The diplomats, speaking on condition they not be identified, saythat total alone suggests the Soviets were considering withdrawingfrom less strategic nations such as Hungary _ which has no borderwith NATO _ to save most of their East German presence.   But the demands from Prague and Budapest mean the Soviets losethe flexibility to scatter troop cuts as they want, and can nolonger make the withdrawals so gradual.   A preliminary agreement at the Vienna talks is envisaged by theend of this year, but negotiators expect it to take most of the1990s for East and West to slice the huge weapons arsenals andarmies amassed in four decades of Cold War.   ``This must come as an unpleasant surprise to Moscow,''Bennendijk said in a telephone interview. ``But what choice do theyhave? They are not in Czechoslovakia (for instance) as occupyingpowers.''</TEXT></DOC>
