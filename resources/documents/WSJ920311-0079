Hong Kong's authoritiesannounced proudly that for the first time in seven years, thenumber of new Vietnamese refugee arrivals in Hong Kongdropped to zero.   The reason is not that Communist Vietnam has suddenlybecome a realm of freedom and happiness, but that Vietnam'speople are finally getting the dirty message: Don't comeseeking liberty in the West. For most Vietnamesefreedom-seekers these past few years, the golden door hasbeen slammed and bolted shut.</LP><TEXT>   It has taken awhile for this message to filter through toVietnam's people because the West hasn't been able to bringitself to say, bluntly, that most refugees should get lost.Instead, the authorities in Hong Kong and in potentialsettlement countries such as the United States have beenrelying since the late 1980s on a &quot;screening&quot; process bywhich officials can conveniently decide that most boat peopleare not &quot;real&quot; refugees but &quot;economic migrants.&quot;   These economic migrants are then denied any chance ofstarting a new life in a free country. Their only options areto wait without serious employment, freedom of movement orhope of salvation in the bleak chickenwire concentrationcamps of Hong Kong, or to &quot;volunteer&quot; to go back to Vietnam.   It is this squalid exercise in attrition that the U.S.coordinator for refugee affairs, Ambassador-at-Large JewelLafontant-Mankarious, was praising during a press conferencein Hong Kong on Monday, when she said that America is &quot;verymuch in favor of encouraging voluntary repatriation.&quot; Ms.Lafontant-Mankarious added, &quot;There is no chance of coming tothe United States if they are screened out.&quot;   To further encourage boat people to &quot;volunteer&quot; forrepatriation, Hong Kong's government has since 1989 sent backthree batches of boat people against their will, mostrecently forcing back 36 boat people aboard a charteredfreight plane last month.   The policy of President Bush's administration has been toprotest such forced repatriation, which is a twitch in theright direction. But Hong Kong is by no means the only placeat fault. The obvious step for America would be to offerasylum in the U.S. for Hong Kong's &quot;screened-out&quot; boatpeople. There is no motion in this direction visible anywherewithin the U.S. government.   For Americans far removed from the more than 50,000 boatpeople still in Hong Kong's camps, the fate of these freedomseekers may seem a minor issue. It is not. There is aperilous trend afoot when we find the politicians and civilservants of the Free World busy relabeling refugees, thebetter to bundle them back as unwanted cargo to one of theworld's few remaining Communist states. It is pathetic to seeHong Kong's officials congratulating themselves that theyhave succeeded in broadcasting the message that Hong Kongwill no longer serve as a haven of liberty in Asia.   For freedom-loving citizens of places such as Hong Kongand the U.S., it would at least be healthier to see sometruth in advertising. A good start might be for America tostart selling refugee-screening manuals along with all theother paeans to freedom at the bookstore outside the Statueof Liberty on Liberty Island. It'd be a little embarrassing,but at least it would get the word out that the message onthe famous huddled-masses poem at the foot of the statue ishistory.</TEXT></DOC>
