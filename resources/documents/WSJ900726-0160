Edward G. Harshfield, Columbia's chief executive officer,said a partnership associated with Gordon Investment Corp.agreed to pay $3 billion for the thrift's portfolio of junkbonds and preferred stock. Gordon is a largelyemployee-owned, Toronto-based merchant bank that numbersCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and a General Electric Co.subsidiary among its investors. The portfolio was valued at$2.93 billion at March 31, after a plunge that dumped $890million of losses on Columbia, rendering it insolvent.</LP><TEXT>   Selling such a large amount of junk bonds into thebattered and illiquid junk-bond market was consideredimprobable just weeks ago. But that market has recoveredslightly, and Columbia offered unexpectedly favorable terms:90% financing on a so-called non-recourse basis. That meansthat the buyer can walk away from the portfolio if additionallosses exceed 10%, and the seller will in effect have to takethe bonds back. The financing and the limited risk is mainlywhat motivated Gordon to pay Columbia a slight premium for aportfolio that many investment bankers thought would have tobe discounted a further 10% to 15%.   The feat could save Columbia, or at least sharply reduceor even eliminate government losses if the Beverly Hills,Calif., thrift were to fail. Moreover, the transaction couldprove a model for dispensing with about $4 billion more ofjunk bonds that the government has inherited from seizedthrifts.   But the plan carries considerable risk for the government,which would inherit the junk bonds if the market turns souragain, forcing Gordon to return them to a Columbia that wouldthen be doomed to an even more expensive failure. Regulatorsand congressmen therefore might oppose the transaction.   &quot;Almost as dubious as the purchase of junk bonds withtaxpayer-insured deposits is financing of junk bonds withinsured deposits, especially on a non-recourse basis,&quot; saidRep. Jim Leach (R., Iowa). &quot;Given the circumstances, this maywind up being a reasonable deal for the government. But asattractive as the bold print of this deal may be, the fineprint seems questionable.&quot;   Mr. Leach also questioned whether the Columbia deal shouldbecome a model for the government's future management of itscurrent junk-bond portfolio. &quot;The idea should be to move thisindustry out of junk bonds&quot; and other forms of &quot;roulettefinance,&quot; he remarked. The Columbia deal &quot;may be aconceivable approach in some instances, but it's not at alldesirable,&quot; he said.   Columbia has two other big problems: it still needs toraise an estimated $300 million or so in additional capitalto meet regulatory standards. It can raise a good chunk ofthat by selling its equity interests in some highly leveragedcompanies. Those interests were valued at $230 million atMarch 31, but investment bankers say their value may be aslittle as $100 million because they are such illiquidinvestments. In any event, Columbia will still need cash fromoutside investors; such an investment will probably wipe outshareholders. Also, by selling the bonds, it is losing itsbiggest single source of cash, and the interest that it willbe receiving on the financing barely covers billions ofdollars in high-cost brokered deposits that remain on itsbooks. Some analysts believe that will make it next toimpossible for Columbia to be very profitable anytime soonand that a federal seizure remains a possibility.   However, Mr. Harshfield indicated he thought regulatorswould find it hard to turn down the proposed bond sale. Hesays rating agencies have already indicated that terms of theunderlying note are sufficiently rigorous to warrant aninvestment-grade rating. He said regulators were alreadystarting to review the transaction, and that a decision isexpected within 60 days.   &quot;I would be highly surprised if there was a better priceto be gotten from this portfolio,&quot; he added. &quot;I am extremelyconfident that this is a good package.&quot; He says Columbia isalready actively considering buyers for the rest of theinstitution, adding, &quot;I think there is still a possibilitythat we can pull this thing out.&quot;   If regulators prohibit the deal, the alternatives aren'tvery appetizing. To sell the entire junk-bond portfoliowithout non-recourse financing might require discounts thatwould add $300 million or more to Columbia's losses,virtually assuring its failure at a high cost to thegovernment. Columbia already has a negative net worth of $216million, a deficit that is expected to grow to nearly $300million because of expected losses for the second quarterended June 30.   In Washington, D.C., a spokesman for the Office of ThriftSupervision had no comment on the proposed sale but promisedan &quot;expeditious&quot; review of it. The agency is being advised byGeneral Electric's Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. brokerage subsidiary.The spokesman said regulators didn't consider that a problembecause General Electric's interest in Gordon Investment isfractional and indirect. &quot;There's a Chinese Wall that theyassured us would be meticulously observed,&quot; he added.   Gordon Investment itself is something of an unorthodoxchoice to come to the rescue. It has never before invested injunk bonds, much less a portfolio the size of Columbia's, anduntil yesterday, the boldest deal it had ever pulled off wasprobably an investment in Canada's phone company two yearsago.   &quot;Everybody has phoned&quot; wanting to know what prompted thecompany's apparent shift in strategy, says partner ThomasI.A. Allen. &quot;We hope when the dust settles over a number ofyears, that people will know the answer to that question.&quot; Hesays the Columbia bonds presented &quot;attractive investmentvalues over the long term.&quot;   Columbia and other thrifts are under the gun to sell theirjunk bonds because of a provision in the thrift bailout lawlast year. The thrift said there were eight final bidders forits portfolio. They are believed to have included LoewsCorp., Broad Inc. and Bankers Trust Corp.   ---   Charles McCoy contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
