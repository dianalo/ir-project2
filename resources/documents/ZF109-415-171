Johnson Space Center at Houston.andM;The satellite servicer system would be a spacecraft capable of autonomouslyrendezvousing and docking with satellites operating in orbits beyond therange of the space shuttle.andP;  It would be able to transfer fuel to thesatellites and replace components such as power units or science instruments.andO;Although these functions would be autonomous, they would be supervised fromboth the ground and the space shuttle.andM;(Dana Blankenhorn/19900608/Press Contact: Kerry Masson, Martin Marietta,303-977-5364)</TEXT></DOC>
