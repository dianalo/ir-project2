For the whole year, however, unit trusts that invest in Japanese, British and Philippine shares ranked among the top five of 21 fund categories monitored by the Hong Kong Unit Trust Association. Gold funds and British-pound currency funds also were among the top five.    Wyatt Co., an actuarial concern, tracks 273 unit trusts for the association. A number of single-country funds that invest in South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand aren't included in the rankings. Similar to U.S. mutual funds, unit trusts are professionally managed investment pools.    Despite the global stock market crash, for the full year Philippine unit trusts turned in the best median, or midrange, performance with a 51.45% gain. British equity funds rose 40.53%, reflecting the pound's growing strength against the U.S. dollar. Currency funds investing in the pound rose 36.51% for the year. Japanese funds finished the year up 36.18%. Commodity funds, which invest primarily in gold and energy shares, were up 34.4%.    Non-dollar currency and bond funds registered the best performances during the last three months of the year. The NM Schroder Gilt andamp; Fixed Interest Fund topped the list with a rise of 23.41%. Other funds investing in Swiss francs, West German marks and Japanese yen also rose by 20% or more.    Equity funds that invest in Australia and Hong Kong, whose markets were among the hardest-hit by the world crash, dominated the losers' list for both the last quarter and the year. The median, or midrange, Australian fund fell 20.32% in 1987 and dropped 49.95% in the last quarter. The median Hong Kong fund fell 14.15% for 1987 and 50.76% in the last quarter.    Only two Australian funds -- National Mutual Portfolio Selection Australian Fund and NM Schroder Australian fund -- registered positive returns for the year, but did so convincingly. They rose 36.54% and 53.43%, respectively. The best-performing Hong Kong fund, National Mutual Portfolio Selection Hong Kong fund, eked out a 1.85% gain for the year.    U.S. and European stock funds each fell a median 5% for the year, and the typical fund holding a diversified portfolio of Asian equities fell about 9%. Gartmore Oriental Ventures Trust, a speculative fund that invests throughout Asia, lost the most of any unit trust, declining 55.74% for the year and 70.64% in the last quarter.    While gold-related funds were among the top performers for the year, they were among the worst in the last three months, losing a median 34% of their value. </TEXT></DOC>
