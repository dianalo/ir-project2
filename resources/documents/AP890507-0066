Lee Hamilton,D-Ind. ``I think we need to know a lot more about ... then-VicePresident Bush's activities.''   On Thursday, the same day a jury returned its verdict in OliverNorth's trial, Bush said ``there was no quid pro quo'' arrangementdiscussed in his meeting in early 1985 with Honduran PresidentRoberto Suazo.   Documents introduced during North's trial indicated thatPresident Reagan approved a deal in 1985 in which U.S. military andeconomic aid to Honduras would be expedited in return for Honduranaid to the Contras.   At the time, Congress had banned U.S. aid to the Contras, whowere camped just inside Honduras' border with Nicaragua.   Hamilton, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' cited pastWhite House denials of arms sales to Iran and of CentralIntelligence Agency involvement in supplying the Contras with aid _allegations that later proved to be true.   ``I'm skeptical,'' he said, regarding Bush's denial Thursday oftalking with Suazo about any arrangement to indirectly funnel aidto the Contras. ``That's the whole story of Iran-Contra, I think.I'm bound to be skeptical of what the executive branch has said tome.''   Hamilton said the documents in North's trial ``show that wecontacted Honduras, we increased aid to Honduras and Honduras, inreturn, aided the Contras.''   ``Those documents are about as clear a statement of quid pro quoas you will ever see...'' he said. ``They are contrary to what thepresident says; we ought to pursue them.''   However, there is no immediate need to recovene the House andSenate Iran-Contra committees, Hamilton said. The next step, hesaid, is for the intelligence panels of both bodies to obtain thedocuments and examine them.   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., former chairman of the SenateForeign Relations Committee, called new efforts to link Bush to theIran-Contra affair ``a bad mistake, not only in terms of foreignpolicy, but just in terms of general public policy in thiscountry.''   ``Throughout the entire period of the Reagan administration, wewere giving a lot of assistance to Honduras,'' he said. ``And wedid so simply because they were very helpful to our foriegn policyand the prosecution of what we were doing in Nicaragua.''</TEXT></DOC>
