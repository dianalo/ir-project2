The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkU.S. crude oil, fell the most sharply Tuesday, settling 47 centslower at $15.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   Traders said the contract for August delivery, which expiresWednesday, was depressed partly by plentiful inventories of oil atU.S. terminals. The September contract, which is less sensitive toshort-term inventories, fell 26 cents at $15.63 a barrel.   ``The market took a more realistic view today,'' said AndrewLebow, an analyst at E.D.andamp;F. Man International Futures Inc. in NewYork. ``Based on real fundamentals, there still is a short-term ormaybe even intermediate-term oversupply of crude.''   On Monday, the August contract for West Texas Intermediate hadjumped 84 cents a barrel after Iran said it would accept a UnitedNations resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in itsnearly 8-year-old war with Iraq.   The news raised the possibility that members of the Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries would be able to set aside theirdifferences and agree to production cutbacks that would prop upprices.   But Lebow said, ``There's a lot of work to be done to get fromthe end of the war to OPEC production cutbacks.''   ``I think that yesterday's rally was totally overdone,'' saidWilliam Byers, an analyst at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.   Also depressing oil prices Tuesday were reports that Iraqiwarplanes raided an unfinished nuclear plant and other Iranianindustrial targets. War communiques from Tehran said Iranianwarplanes retaliated by raiding a dam in Iraq.   Another factor hurting prices was an unconfirmed report thatSaudi Arabia was selling oil from Caribbean inventories tonon-contractual customers at prices near the spot price, Lebow said.   The contract for August delivery of No.2 heating oil, up 2.15cents on Monday, fell .37 cent to 42.90 cents a gallon on the NewYork Merc. The contract for August delivery of unleaded gasoline,up 1.38 cents on Monday, fell .46 cent to 50.65 cents a gallon.</TEXT></DOC>
