Since the beginning of the war nearly seven years ago, Saudi Arabia has sought to protect itself by trying to mollify Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini even while financing Iraq. But the riots in Mecca, where at least 275 Iranians died when Saudi forces moved to put down an anti-American demonstration, followed by attacks against Saudi facilities in Tehran and Beirut, show that the policy has failed.    &quot;The Saudis thought if they played a low-key role, the Iraqis would take the brunt and they could stay in the background,&quot; said Washington-based Middle East expert Christine Helms. &quot;Iran, however, has long-term territorial, political and social ambitions for the Middle East which they intend to realize through whatever means necessary.&quot;    In the wake of the recent violence, Saudi Arabia faces two destabilizing forces it has worked hard to contain: the spread of a radical Islamic holy war throughout the Middle East, and threats to topple its ruling monarchy.    The Tehran-triggered demonstrations during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca suggest that Iran is waging a holy war for the soul of the region that goes far beyond its territorial skirmishes against Iraq. The Saudi newspaper Okaz, quoting anonymous officials, said yesterday that Iran sent about 20,000 fanatical Revolutionary Guards and volunteers to Saudi Arabia as pilgrims, according to an Associated Press report.    Following the deaths of Iranian pilgrims in Mecca, Iran's leaders have vowed to &quot;uproot the Saudi rulers.&quot; U.S. officials don't think Iran can carry out this threat; Saudi Arabia is heavily armed and the cautious rulers in Riyadh are very security-conscious. But over the weekend, Iranians captured four Saudi diplomats in Tehran and the deserted Saudi Embassy in Beirut was bombed. Yesterday, terrorists bombed a Saudi cultural center in Beirut -- which was closed along with the embassy in February 1984 at a time of mounting militia violence -- and the Saudi airline office there. All of this suggests that Saudi interests may face future terrorist attacks.    &quot;The Saudis and the Kuwaitis need to understand that there is no middle ground in this conflict,&quot; says Rep. Robert Torricelli, a member of the House subcommittee that deals with the Mideast. &quot;I hope they now recognize that their survival is in jeopardy.&quot;    Saudi Arabia is ruled by a strict sect of Sunni Moslems called the Wahhabi. They consider Shiites, who rule Iran and are a minority of 5% to 10% in Saudi Arabia, to be heretics because of differences over the succession to the prophet Mohammed.    Although the Shiite population in Saudi Arabia is small, it is concentrated in the province where most of the oil fields lie. To combat Iranian efforts at internal subversion, the Saudis have been spending far more resources in the province over recent years to provide jobs, schools and other benefits, but the Shiites remain the poorest people of Saudi Arabia.    Saudi Arabia, which sees itself as the protector of Islam's holiest shrine, moved quickly to stop the demonstration in Mecca. But the monarchy has been much more cautious in dealing with Iranian radicalism in the region. Saudi officials have told Americans that, while they don't seek to accommodate Iran, they're wary of provoking a country with nearly 10 times Saudi Arabia's population and many times its national fervor.    For example, Iraqi officials say Saudi officials often caution Iraq not to punish Tehran too severely in the war for fear that a frustrated Ayatollah will turn his venom to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Some Western diplomats also complain that Iran and Saudi Arabia have worked closely together to coordinate oil policies in the past year to achieve higher prices and hence more revenues to finance Tehran's war efforts.    Moreover, Saudi Arabia allowed more than 200,000 Iranian pilgrims to visit Mecca in this year's pilgrimage, which ends tomorrow. Administration officials say that is the largest number in several years.    One U.S. official expects that Saudi Arabia may redouble its diplomatic efforts to soothe Iran, perhaps through the Syrians, who receive large amounts of Saudi money. An administration official says Iran's latest threats to unseat the Saudi royal family are unlikely to prompt Riyadh to more actively help Iraq's war effort or more visibly assist the U.S. in its efforts to keep the Persian Gulf sea lanes open.    Ironically, experts on the Middle East and some administration officials believe that Washington's policy of reflagging Kuwaiti tankers and, more generally, of tilting somewhat more toward Iraq in the Gulf War has increased the danger to the closest ally of the U.S. in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia.    &quot;My one fear is that in a genuine effort to have been of assistance we have lit the match that sets a series of explosions in motion,&quot; says Rep. Torricelli. &quot;A new, more visible role of the U.S. in the Persian Gulf may tend to undermine rather than strengthen the Saudis.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
