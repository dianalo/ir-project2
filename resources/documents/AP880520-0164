The black Anglican leader, who returned Thursday from a month inEurope and the United States, also defended his controversialappeals for tougher Western sanctions against South Africa.   ``The problem is not sanctions, the problem is apartheid,'' Tututold students and staff at the University of the Western Cape. ``Iwant apartheid destroyed, not reformed. If it can be done away withwithout sanctions, I will sing hallelujah.''   Tutu's calls for punitive sanctions were covered extensively bythe South African media during his trip. His remarks have beendenounced not only by the government but also by white and blackmoderates who contend that sanctions will increase blackunemployment without inducing whites to accept reforms.   ``There are those who seek to generate hysteria,'' Tutu said ofhis critics. ``The onus is on those who oppose sanctions to providea viable, non-violent alternative.''   Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his fight againstapartheid, was greeted by several hundred cheering students when hearrived at the university's main hall before the ceremony.   His aides had to form a human wall around him as they usheredhim through a crowd that chanted the archbishop's name and wavedplacards with slogans like ``Viva Sanctions'' and ``Viva Tutu.''   Tutu said he accepted the chancellorship on behalf of detainees,political exiles, displaced blacks and other victims of ``this vileand obscene system'' of apartheid.   He said apartheid is ``so utterly evil, immoral, unbiblical andunchristian that it can only be compared with that equally evilsystem _ Naziism.''   As chancellor at University of the Western Cape, Tutu will bethe honorary leader of a university that the government establishedfor mixed-race students in 1960 as part of its segregatededucational system.   He praised the university, near Cape Town, as South Africa's``most potent academic institutional dissident.''   In the past decade, the university has increased its blackenrollment from a handful to 13 percent of the 11,500 students. Itsstudents and staff have grown increasingly militant in theiropposition to apartheid, under which the nation's black majorityhas no voice in national affairs.   The university's chief administrator, Rector Jakes Gerwel, saysthe campus will be ``an intellectual home for the left.''   Tutu has been the target of government wrath for years becauseof his support of sanctions. Recently, the archbishop has drawn anunprecedented degree of criticism from white liberals.   Business Day, a Johannesburg newspaper often critical of thegovernment, said in a recent editorial that blacks should insistthat Tutu live in the same conditions as the poorest unemployedblack squatter.</TEXT></DOC>
