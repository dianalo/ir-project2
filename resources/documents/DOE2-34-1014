The investment and maintenancecosts can be reduced, the amount of maintenance is reduced and the reliabilityof the plant is increased, which is particularly important for road signals.Plant supplied by solar electricity can be operated at low voltage, sothat the protective measures for 220 V become unnecessary. Energy costsaving is at present in the background, compared with these advantages.</TEXT></DOC>
