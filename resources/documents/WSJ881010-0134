The Labor Department's employment report was viewed by many economists as convincing evidence that earlier fears of an overheating economy were misplaced. &quot;The economy is slowing, not dramatically, but there is some modest slowing,&quot; said John Hagens of WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm.    Still, there were enough conflicting signals in the report to allow Republicans to celebrate the continued health of the economy while Wall Street concluded that growth is tapering off and, therefore, that inflation and sharply higher interest rates aren't as much of a threat.    Investors displayed their relief by pushing up stock and bond prices sharply, allowing interest rates on long-term Treasury bonds to fall to the lowest level in nearly six months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 42.50 points, closing at 2150.25. &quot;The market read it correctly,&quot; said Milton Hudson, economist for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York. &quot;I think we're headed for a soft landing. This gives us a glimmer of hope.&quot;    The Labor Department said non-farm payrolls grew by 255,000 in September. Ordinarily, that would be considered strong growth, but much of the September increase reflects greater-than-usual hiring by public schools at the beginning of the school year. Businesses added only 140,000 jobs, and factory payrolls fell for the second month in a row. In the past three months, the economy has added 638,000 new jobs compared with more than one million in each of the three preceding quarters.    The drop in the unemployment rate, from 5.6% in August, keeps that widely watched measure at the point that many economists consider full employment, and near the lowest levels in 14 years. By another measure that includes military personnel in the work force, the unemployment rate was 5.3%, down from 5.5% in August.    &quot;If this is pointing anyone's direction, it's George Bush's,&quot; said David Wyss, an economist for Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm. &quot;It's something that looks very good on the surface, but has enough in it to calm the markets.&quot;    On the lawn of the White House, President Reagan told reporters, &quot;We've talked of 70 months of economic expansion, but these figures tell the real story that people can understand. They mean paychecks and school clothes and families that can plan a brighter future.&quot;    It isn't clear, however, that the economy has slowed sufficiently to satisfy the Federal Reserve. Some members of the Fed's policy-making committee, particularly the presidents of some regional reserve banks, worry that inflation will accelerate unless growth slows to an annual rate of 2.5% or less; the economy grew by 3% in the second quarter. Others argue that the Fed has raised interest rates sufficiently in the past six months, and say the economy is behaving just as they hoped it would.    Robert Black, president of the Richmond, Va., Fed bank, said that the latest economic indicators &quot;tell me that we are growing at a somewhat slower rate which is really what our (monetary) policy actions are designed to do.&quot;    More clues about the economy's performance in September will come on Friday, when government reports on industrial production, producer prices and retail sales are released.    Private forecasters see continued sluggishness at the cash register, with the median forecast for the increase in retail sales, before inflation adjustment, at 0.5%. Estimates range from no change to a 0.8% increase, according a survey by MMS International, a Redwood City, Calif., research concern. Retail sales fell 0.2% in August.    They also see a modest 0.3% increase in the Fed's index of industrial production, with forecasts ranging from no change to a 0.6% increase. This index rose 0.2% in August and a brisk 1% in July.    Private economists estimate that producer prices rose more slowly in September, largely because of declining energy prices. The median forecast is for a 0.4% increase compared with 0.6% in August. Forecasts range from increases of 0.1% to 0.6%, MMS said.    Also expected this week is the Commerce Department's report Thursday on the August trade deficit. Although the deficit narrowed in July, to $9.53 billion, most analysts expect a larger deficit for August, figuring that imports surged and exports sagged during the month. Last month's figure was &quot;aberrantly weak,&quot; said Michael Englund, economist at MMS International.    Many forecasters now exclude import insurance and freight costs from their projections because the government will begin reporting solely on that basis next year. This figure reduces the deficit by about $1.5 billion from the current measure. Based on this method, forecasts of the deficit by economists surveyed by MMS range from $7 billion to $11.5 billion, with a $10 billion consensus. Half of the estimates are in the $10.7 billion to $9 billion range.    The Labor Department's monthly survey of households, which is used to compute the jobless rate, showed few changes of note. Most of the decline came among adult men, whose jobless rate fell to 4.5% from 4.9%. The proportion of working-age Americans with jobs reached a record 62.4% in September, the department added. But the current prosperity continues to be uneven. The jobless rate in Massachusetts in September was 3%, down from 3.3%, while the rate in Texas was 7%, up from 6.8%.    The 255,000 increase in payrolls follows a revised 169,000 increase in August, originally estimated at 219,000, and a 214,000 increase in July. These figures come from the department's monthly survey of employers, which has replaced the monthly trade deficit report as the government economic report read most carefully on Wall Street.    Wall Street forecasters had been predicting much more robust growth in payrolls.    &quot;The private sector, which grew strongly earlier in the year, exhibited relatively small gains,&quot; Janet Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics, told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. Business payrolls grew by only 120,000 a month in August and September compared with increases of greater than 300,000 in the first seven months of the year.    Private economists were surprised at the second monthly decline in manufacturing payrolls because factory orders have been growing so strongly, and several predicted a pick-up in factory hiring in the coming months.    Noting that the Labor Department's index of total hours worked in factories rose 0.4% in September, Mrs. Norwood suggested that employers may be trying to cut costs by relying on overtime rather than adding new workers. Average weekly hours worked in manufacturing rose to 41.2 hours from 41.    Mr. Wyss of Data Resources suggested that factories may be having difficulty hiring new workers at a time of such low unemployment or may simply not be able to absorb as many new workers as they would like. &quot;Maybe there aren't any more machines to run,&quot; he said.    The Labor Department said its hourly earnings index rose by a sharp 0.5% in September, more rapidly than the 0.2% increase in August and the 0.4% increase in July.    But several economists said the onemonth surge in wages wasn't enough to conclude that wage increases are accelerating markedly. &quot;Since the beginning of the year, we've had unemployment at around 5.5%, but wages have failed to accelerate significantly despite the seemingly tight labor markets,&quot; said Samuel Kahan of Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc.    In the past 12 months, the wage index has risen 3.3%, less than the inflation rate. This index excludes the effects of overtime and shifts in employment from one industry to another.    ---   WAGE OUTLOOK: Most employers facing labor negotiations in 1989 expect to hold union wage increases below 4% a year, according to the Bureau of National Affairs Inc. Its annual survey of bargaining objectives, based on responses from 261 companies with contracts expiring next year, found lump-sum payments, instead of general wage increases, growing in popularity among employers. Major agreements expire in 1989 in the aerospace, communications, fabricated metals, primary metals and service industries. The survey found 23% of the firms plan to seek new drug-testing programs; only 10% said they would consider the issue of establishing child care assistance programs.    ---   James C.
