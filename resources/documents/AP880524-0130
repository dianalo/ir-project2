Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he would offera cloture motion today to cut short the long series of amendmentsbeing offered by a small band of conservatives who oppose the pact.   ``It is conceivable that we could finish the work on the treatyby Friday or Saturday,'' Byrd said outside the White House after abipartisan leadership meeting with Reagan. ``The chances now arepretty good,'' he added. ``There's no reason why we should havecontinued delay for the sake of delay.''   Byrd's Republican counterpart, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, said hesupported the move to cut debate, and quipped that perhaps the wayto do so would be to have Reagan ``take Jesse with him'' to Moscow,a reference to Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the leading treatyopponent.   Reagan ``said he'd have to ride on the wing,'' Dole cracked,``and somebody else said the right wing.''   Helms and another opponent of the accord, Sen. Gordon Humphrey,R-N.H., showed no signs of backing off from offering a long seriesof amendments to the treaty, despite an appeal on Monday fromSecretary of State George P. Shultz.   ``I am at pains to understand why this administration, which ismy administration, has become such a bunch of nervous nellies whenit comes to going back to Gorbachev to work out obvious defects inthis treaty,'' Helms said.   ``I don't care whether we offend him or not. Let's get it rightthe first time.'' Speaking of Reagan, he added: ``I think he'swrong on this treaty, I think he's been misled. ... My consciencewill not allow me not to pursue the obvious defects of thistreaty.''   Shultz went to Capitol Hill to deliver the message that theMoscow summit, which starts in just five days, will be diminishedif Reagan is deprived of the vote of confidence that positiveSenate action on the treaty would give him.   ``There is a time to inquire and there is also a time to vote,''Shultz told reporters after a meeting with 17 Republican senators.``It would be a good thing to have it.''   Helms was invited to the Shultz session but did not show up. Andwhen Dole asked Helms how many amendments he would offer to thetreaty, Helms declined to say.   Three amendments offered by treaty opponents were defeated onMonday, bringing to nine the number of attempts to change thedocument's language that have been beaten back by the Senate sinceit was brought up for consideration a week ago.   First, the lawmakers voted 81-13 to kill a Helms amendment thatwould have required the president to certify as accurate a Sovietreport on the number of triple-warhead SS-20 missiles to bedestroyed before the treaty could take effect.   The Senate then voted 68-26 against an amendment by Sen. MalcolmWallop, R-Wyo., that would have required a change in the treaty'stext to eliminate what he said was a loophole that would havepermitted construction of some Soviet missiles.   And it rejected, 81-5, an amendment by Sen. Gordon Humphrey,R-N.H., that would have put the INF treaty on hold until the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union agreed on a more far-reaching pactproviding 50 percent cuts in each side's arsenals ofintercontinental atomic weapons.   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said the issues raised by treatyopponents ``have been raised and resolved'' during longconsideration by the Senate committees on Foreign Relations, ArmedServices and Intelligence.   ``It's legitimate to raise them for public debate again, butit's necessary to resolve them,'' Cohen said. He said Shultz hadwarned that failure of the Senate to act would ``diminish theluster'' of the summit and saddle Reagan with the image of apresident who ``can't deliver the Senate'' on matters he believesstrongly in.   ``It's important for the president to have that kind of visible,tangible support going to meet the head of the Soviet Union,'' hesaid.   Ratification, which requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate,ultimately appears assured. But conservatives have sought to bringattention to issues like the imbalance in U.S. and Sovietconventional forces in Europe and the problems of verifying Sovietcompliance with the pact.   The treaty, signed Dec. 8 by Reagan and Gorbachev, requiresdestruction within three years of all atomic missiles with rangesbetween 300 miles and 3,400 miles. For the Soviets, that includes400 deployed SS-20s and another 250 stockpiled SS-20s.   The Helms amendment defeated Monday focused on the number ofSS-20s reported by the Soviets. During debate, Helms maintainedthat U.S. intelligence officials are divided on whether that numberis accurate, and cited estimates that there are as many as twicethe reported number.   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said Reagan administrationofficials have rejected Helms' claim, although Lugar conceded it isdifficult to prove that no SS-20s are hidden.   ``It is akin to proving the Loch Ness monster doesn't exist,''Lugar said.   Among issues remaining to be settled is an amendment, backed bythe Senate's Democratic majority, which would require Senateapproval before any future administration could change how theUnited States interprets the INF pact. The amendment stems from afight between Reagan and Democrats over the U.S. interpretation ofthe 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile pact, the last U.S.-Soviet armsagreement approved by the Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
