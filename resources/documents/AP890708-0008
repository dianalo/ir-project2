Rep. Gary L. Ackerman, D-N.Y., chairman of a panel that overseesfederal pay, claims the plan would inject even more partisanshipinto the federal personnel structure than exists already.   ``It creates a system in which there will be a political litmustest. People will have to snooker up to their supervisors and kisstheir rings to keep their pay raises,'' Ackerman said. ``That's notwhat government service is all about.''   The Bush proposal would raise salaries for senior governmentexecutives by 8 to 25 percent. The evaluation every three yearswould certify they deserve the higher salary.   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater claims thecertification would ``assure that these people perform at a levelthat justifies the higher salary. We do not believe it would weakentheir rights.''   The package Bush sent to Congress Friday would give pay raises tosome 7,900 federal officials _ including 700 political appointeesand another 7,200 career executives. These include top ForeignService employes and three- and four-star generals and admirals.   The most-senior officials, including the political appointees,agency heads and other high-ranking officers, would receive the full25 percent. Lesser-ranking executives would receive smaller boosts,down to 8 percent.   Bush also proposed a ban on congressional honoraria, such asoutside speaking fees, to be phased in over the next 18 months.   The White House said the ban on outside income would open the wayto a congressional pay raise, but Bush stopped short of actuallyproposing one _ leaving that politically touchy issue forcongressional leaders to decide.   ``I will work with Congress toward this end,'' Bush said on thepay raise issue in a letter to House and Senate leaders.   Bush earlier this year gave his support to a proposed 51 percentpay raise for members of Congress endorsed by the Reaganadministration, but the plan was rejected in Congress after a publicoutcry.   Bush's package also includes a new super-pay category to enable200 federal employees with ``specialized and critical skills,'' suchas physicians or space scientists, to earn salaries well above whattheir regular pay grades would allow _ up to $124,400 a year.   That would also be the new pay of Cabinet officers under the payplan, up from $99,500 now. And the package would raise VicePresident Dan Quayle's salary, from $99,500 to $124,400.   The salary of the president, $200,000, would remain unchanged.   ``The pay of senior government officials has eroded significantlyin relation to the pay of executives in comparable jobs in theprivate and not-for-profit sectors of the economy,'' Bush said insending the plan to Congress.   The pay issue was highlighted Friday when Michael F. BallhausJr., the director of NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View,Calif., since 1984, said he was resigning because of low pay andregulations limiting his employment after government service.   The basic pay package would cost taxpayers $101 million in thefiscal year that begins Oct. 1 and $147 million the next year. Theprovision for a new category of high pay for specialized positionswould add $8 million more in each of the next two years.   The increases proposed Friday would be in addition to a 3.6percent cost-of-living increase the president is seeking for all 2.2million civil service workers.   Robert Tobias, president of the National Treasury Employes Union,called the package ``unfair, highly political and another karatechop at the real backbone of the federal work force.   ``It may stem the tide of flight at the top, but would furtheroppress the millions of employees who act as the glue holding thegovernment together,'' he said.   However, Carol A. Bonosaro, president of the Senior ExecutivesAssociation, which represents members of the federal SeniorExecutive Service who would be covered by the proposed pay raise,said the package was an important first step.   Still, she added, ``it should also be noted that a 25 percent payincrease for senior executives, even if the full 25 percent isreceived at one time, falls far short of achieving fullcomparability with the private sector, state and local governmentsand non-profit organizations.''</TEXT></DOC>
