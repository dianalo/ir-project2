She says rail stocks havesoared 50% to 60% in the past 12 months, twice the market'sgain. &quot;Railroads have made very significant changes in theircost structure that will make them more competitive withtruckers,&quot; she says.</LP><TEXT>   Signs of rejuvenation abound in an industry that not longago was synonymous with market-share losses to truckers andmeager growth prospects. For example, Santa Fe Pacific Corp.is expanding a freight terminal in Chicago and building onein nearby Willow Springs, Ill., to handle a surge of businessfrom companies putting their freight shipments on rail.&quot;We've become a growth industry,&quot; says Donald McInnes, asenior vice president of the Santa Fe Railway.   Union Pacific Corp. is spending $267 million to expand arail line with sidings, double track and new signals to haullowsulfur Western coal to utilities seeking to meet morestringent air pollution standards. And Consolidated RailCorp. executives expect to capture more than $1 billion ofadditional freight business in the next five to seven years.   The chief reason for the industry's turnaround is big cutsin employment. Santa Fe, for instance, has slashed its workforce to 14,000 from 23,000 six years ago. Overall, railindustry employment has dropped nearly 50% since 1980 toabout 283,000, according to the Association of AmericanRailroads. And railroads expect to save an additional $1billion a year from new labor pacts that reduce train crewsby one or two positions to only an engineer and a conductor.Railroads had been fighting for such contracts for decades.   But some rail industry executives temper predictions of arenaissance. Railroads have problems, including thecontraction of some of their largest industrial customers,fierce competition from trucks and strained relations betweenrail management and labor.   &quot;If they are going to have a renaissance, they betterfirst get the cooperation of their employees,&quot; says G. ThomasDuBose, international president of the United TransportationUnion. He adds that the militaristic style of management thatrailroads practiced for decades created a &quot;gap of distrustbetween the railroads and their employees.&quot;   Though main lines have been upgraded and freight trainspeeds increased, the rail industry has yet to modernize itsinefficient freight yards. For example, freight shipments cantake as long as 48 hours to maneuver through Santa Fe'ssprawling yard in Kansas City, Kan. Santa Fe officials saythey need to spend $12 million to streamline the yard tospeed shipments.   Shippers complain of delays when freight moves from onerailroad to another. Rail executives say railroads still havean anemic return on investment and big excess capacity.   &quot;The rail industry has too much capacity, with too manyunderutilized rail lines between major markets,&quot; says WilliamGreenwood, chief operating officer of Burlington NorthernInc. For example, he says, rail shipments between Chicago andCalifornia could be handled on the tracks of just one of thethree railroads that now compete for the business.   For railroads, the challenge of the 1990s is to fill thiscapacity. They plan to use the savings from changes in workrules and the adoption of new technology to boost trainfrequency while launching aggressive marketing programs tolure back shippers that have defected to trucks. Railroadsalso are expediting freight shipments by closing or bypassingfreight yards that too often caused delays.   Some shippers say they see improvements. &quot;The on-timeperformance of freight railroads is the best I have everseen,&quot; says Charles Wilkins, director of transportation andtraffic at Ford Motor Co., which is switching some freightback to rail.   Railroads are streamlining their management procedures.Rail executives, encouraged by Union Pacific's campaign toslash management layers and shake up the railroad'sbureaucracy, are taking similar steps at their railroads. Oneresult, say shippers and competitors, is that railroads arespeeding up decision-making, innovating more and enteringpartnerships with their rivals.   &quot;The railroads are wising up a bit and understanding themarketplace better,&quot; says Paul Bergant, executive vicepresident, marketing, of J.B. Hunt Transport Inc., a Lowell,Ark., trucking company. Volume has doubled in the past 12months at Quantum, J.B. Hunt's freight-hauling partnershipwith the Santa Fe, and forecasts call for another 100% leapin the next few years. Mr. Bergant says Quantum is winningfreight business because it combines the flexibility of J.B.Hunt trucks for pickup and delivery and the cost advantagesof the Santa Fe's long-haul service.   Rail executives expect to capitalize on the nation'senvironmental problems. They have awakened to the fact thattheir lines in urban areas could profit from carryingcommuter trains to relieve highway congestion. And they seeopportunities to move municipal waste, or &quot;suburban ore,&quot; asone rail executive calls it. Conrail is moving municipalwaste from New Jersey to a disposal site in Texas, whileUnion Pacific is hauling garbage from Seattle to a landfillin eastern Oregon.   Moreover, environmentalists say railroads use less fueland create less pollution than trucks moving similar loadswithout adding to road congestion and deterioration. Notsurprisingly, environmentalists rallied to the side of therailroads last year to defeat a proposal that would haveexpanded the use of larger and heavier rigs and divertedfreight to highways.   But the greatest opportunities still lie within the railindustry, say rail executives, to squeeze out inefficiencyand move more freight with fewer assets. &quot;We have to avoidspending capital for things we don't need,&quot; says Alvin &quot;Pete&quot;Carpenter, president and chief executive officer of CSXCorp.'s rail unit. CSX recently avoided having to buy orrebuild 3,500 coal cars by running more efficient unit trainsand storing export coal on the ground at piers rather than inrail cars.   Rail companies must continue to turn to technology to cutcosts and get better control of their far-flung tracknetworks, rail executives say. Some rail lines are weighingplans to centralize their dispatchers, as Union Pacific andCSX have done already. Burlington Northern is experimentingwith a car design that could carry 30% more coal and withlocomotives fueled by natural gas, which can run longer withless wear and tear. Railroads have begun to place radio tagson containers, locomotives and freight cars as part of anindustrywide program to automatically track the entirerail-car fleet by 1995.   Railroads are only beginning to tap the potential inoffering tailor-made services priced differently. Santa Fehas long promoted its 70-mile-an-hour &quot;steel superhighway&quot;between Chicago and Los Angeles. But lately the carrier isconsidering a plan to slow some trains to 55 mph if shippersaren't in a hurry to get their freight delivered. On theother hand, Santa Fe recently tested a train that would runover its lines at speeds of as much as 79 mph, for shippersthat need their freight in Los Angeles six hours earlier.   &quot;We often highball across the railroad to have freight sitat the terminal,&quot; says Russell Hagberg, Santa Fe Railway'svice president for transportation. He says he sees ampleopportunity for further efficiency gains. &quot;We're halfwaythere on this railroad,&quot; Mr. Hagberg says.   ---                   The Largest Railroads                                                                                                                                  OPERATING REVENUE      PERCENT RAILROAD                    ($ millions)         OF TOTAL                                                                                                        Burlington Northern           $4,674.4            16.5% Union Pacific                  4,587.7            16.2 CSX Transportation             4,435.8            15.6 Norfolk Southern               3,785.0            13.4 Consolidated Rail              3,292.9            11.6 Southern Pacific/DRGW Cos.     2,760.8             9.7 Atchison, Topeka andamp; Santa Fe    2,111.6             7.4 Chicago and North Western        810.0             2.9                                                                                                          Source: Association of American Railroads</TEXT></DOC>
