The former defense minister issued the challenge in a letterThursday to the pro-Labor Council for Peace and Security. Hisoffice released the letter Friday.   The council, a group of retired military officers, contendsIsrael's defense would be enhanced, not compromised, if itsurrendered occupied land in exchange for peace with the Arabs.   As defense minister, Sharon was the architect of Israel'smuch-criticized 1982 invasion of Lebanon, aimed at endingcross-border attacks from the Arab state.   In the letter, Sharon proposed a public debate followed by ``awar game in which we will test, again in public, the differentmilitary strategic concepts concerning the defense of Israel.''   Sharon, now Israel's commerce minister and a high-ranking memberof Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc, called for theconfrontations before the national elections Nov. 1. ``The publicshould see for itself and make its own judgment,'' he said.   National security and the future of the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip have become central issues in the election campaign.   The executive committee of the Council for Peace and Securitymet Friday to consider Sharon's proposal and will respond in thenext several days, said Moshe Amirav, secretary of the group.   A Sharon aide said that before the war game, research instituteswould be asked to define Arab positions and strengths. Sharon'steam then would ``defend'' Israel from within current boundaries,including the occupied territories, while the council would have to``defend'' from a more limited land area.   The Likud has consistently opposed any land-for-peace plans andhas stressed keeping the territories to strengthen security againstinvasion from neighboring Arab states. The leftist Labor Party, ledby Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, has favored compromise.   Israel has occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip since the 1967Middle East war. Palestinians launched an uprising in theterritories Dec. 8 to try to end Israeli rule. Since then more than260 Palestinians have died, mostly in clashes with Israeli securityforces. Six Israelis also have died.   Israel Gat, international secretary of the Labor Party, accusedSharon of preposing ``a David and Goliath show for media purposes.''   He said if the debate and war game were held, ``Mr. Sharon wouldcome out empty because his solutions are not well based.''   Uri Dan, a Sharon aide, said the minister would probably leadhis own team in any debate and mock battles. Dan said Sharon, aretired major general, sees such activities as a way to takepolitics out of the issues.   Another possible contender in the proposed games would be theOfficers and Academics for Security and Peace, a group of pro-Likudretired officers organized to counter the activities of the Councilfor Peace and Security.   But Yehoshua Saguy, a founding member of the pro-Likud group,was cool to the idea of a war game.   ``A game is a game is a game,'' Saguy said. ``Other elements areimportant, such as how to measure the possibilities of coming tocompromise with Jordan or the Palestinians and strategicquestions.''</TEXT></DOC>
