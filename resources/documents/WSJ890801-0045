Montedison owns 81% of Himont, the world's leading supplier of polypropylene, which is based in Wilmington, Del. The Milan chemicals and pharmaceuticals concern holds 72% of Erbamont, a maker of pharmaceuticals incorporated in the Netherlands.    A Montedison spokesman said taking full control of the units would give his company more flexibility in international markets and let it &quot;manage in a more direct way its chemicals and pharmaceuticals activities.&quot;    Listing the companies separately &quot;has developed into a somewhat unrewarding experience,&quot; said James T. Harmon, president of Wertheim andamp; Co., which helped Montedison make initial public offerings for the two companies and now is advising it on the current offers. Having separate companies indirectly controlled by Montedison made &quot;managing them more cumbersome,&quot; Mr. Harmon said. &quot;It created potential conflicts of interest within the group.&quot;    For each Himont share, Montedison will offer $47 in cash and a warrant to purchase one share of Montedison stock, valued at $2, for a total of $49. Erbamont holders will be offered $35 in cash per share, plus a warrant for a share of Montedison, for a total of $37.    In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Himont shares rose $3.625 to $47.75, while Erbamont shares gained $5 to $36.125. Wertheim's Mr. Harmon, who clashed sharply with Montedison Chairman Raul Gardini over the price offered minority shareholders of Ausimont N.V. in a similar offering this year, was less critical of the current operation.    Mr. Harmon said the market prices of Himont and Erbamont had been high because of rumors that Montedison was planning to buy the remaining shares. He noted that the price Montedison is offering for Himont is 75% above the stock's price when the company went public in 1986 for $28 a share, while the price offered for Erbamont is more than double its initial offering price of $18 a share. &quot;That isn't terrible,&quot; he said.    Himont's and Erbamont's boards are expected to meet within a few days to study Montedison's bids, which are subject to their approval.    Montedison should be able to finance the operation with existing credit lines, a company spokesman said. The company's restructuring program, which included the formation of the Enimont chemicals joint venture with state-owned Enichem S.p.A. last month, has reduced Montedison's debt to 2.2 trillion lire ($1.62 billion) from more than eight trillion lire at the end of 1987. About 3.8 trillion lire of debt was erased from Montedison's balance sheets through the formation of the Enimont joint venture.    Montedison denied that the purpose of the offers was to include Himont and Erbamont in the Enimont venture. Mr. Gardini in June set off a political storm when he declared that after three years, he would like to bring additional Montedison chemicals activities into Enimont and thus gain control of the company. Actually, his state partners would be able to block such a move.    A Montedison spokesman conceded that purchasing the Himont and Erbamont shares would provide some tax benefits for the Milan company, but couldn't say how much. The European Community is studying whether to open an investigation into special tax credits of close to one trillion lire Montedison will receive for the formation of Enimont. </TEXT></DOC>
