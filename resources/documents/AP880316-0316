He would make a killing in thestock market by trading on inside information about secret takeoverplans for Bluestar Airlines.   Fox _ the fictional focus of the movie ``Wall Street'' _ didn'tcount on getting nailed by a computer.   His trades sent the airline stock into an erratic flightpattern, which sounded an alarm in the control tower of the NewYork Stock Exchange.   As it might have unfolded in real life, the exchange's ``stockwatch'' monitors triggered an investigation that resulted in Fox'sarrest for securities fraud.   Collaring Wall Street's bad guys is not always so easy, but themovie turned the spotlight on a surveillance system that has becomethe first line of defense against abuse in the stock market.   ``They stole it from us,'' joked Donald J. Solodar, the NYSE'ssenior vice president for market surveillance, who supervises astaff of more than 100.   At the center of the Big Board's operation are four analysts whoscrutinize oddly behaving stocks from a carpeted, glass-walledoffice crammed with computer terminals and newswire printers highabove the exchange floor.   Solodar's detectives have played roles in exposing some of thebiggest insider traders in history, ranging from former LTV Corp.executive Paul Thayer to ex-investment banker Dennis B. Levine.   In an era marked by takeover speculation and daily volume thathas multiplied 12-fold over 20 years, tracking suspicious tradeshas become a high-tech adventure.   ``In 1965, we averaged a few million shares a day. We readticker tape and clipped items from the papers,'' said Solodar,whose NYSE career began then as an investigator. ``You didn't haveall the mergers and acquisition stuff.''   On a typical trading day now, dozens of computer alerts aboutunusual stock activity go off in the monitoring rooms at the NewYork and American exchanges in Manhattan and the NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers on-line office in Washington,which follows over-the-counter trading.   The computers are programmed to know the price and volumebehavior of every listed issue over the past several months, whichstock watchers call a parameter or ``fingerprint.'' When a sleepystock suddenly jumps in value, the computers send out theirwarnings.   They range from colored lights at the NYSE to a synthesizedvoice that shouts ``high price!'' or ``volume!'' in the Amex's``Stockwatch Automated Technique'' system, dubbed ``SWAT'' forshort.   ``It doesn't mean by necessity there's a violation,'' saidSolodar. ``But when you have a 200 million-share day you need thatcomputer support to guide the analysts. Once those flags orwhistles go off, we try to ascertain whether there's public news toaccount for it.''   The news could include relatively innocuous events such as adividend payment, earnings report, stock repurchase or a buyrecommendation from a respected investment firm.   When 32.4 million shares of Detroit Edison stock changed handsMarch 8, for example, NYSE analysts ignored their computer'sred-alert, the most serious warning. They knew investors weretrading the stock based on the company's quarterly dividend.   When more than 600 million shares were traded during the Oct. 19crash, volume warnings blazed across every computer screen, butanalysts paid little heed because massive selling affected manystocks.   If an analyst cannot determine the source of a stock's curiousbehavior, the next step is to call the exchange floor for anexplanation. The analyst also might call the company and brokerswho traded the stock.   ``More times than not it takes more than something on the screento figure it out,'' said Solodar. ``It doesn't flash, `insidertrader.'''   If questions persist, a mysterious trading pattern might bereferred to an exchange investigator and possibly the Securitiesand Exchange Commission, which is ultimately responsible forenforcing securities laws.   A common example is a stock that suspiciously rises in price,suggesting an impending takeover that hasn't been disclosed.Insiders with advance knowledge of that information might be buyingillegally, knowing the stock's price will jump after the takeoveris announced.   The SEC has sharply increased its prosecution of these insidertrading violations over the past few years. But in most cases, theagency must rely partly on evidence of wrongdoing supplied by thestock markets themselves.   ``I guess we're more like the cops on the beat,'' said Jay S.Bono, head of the Amex system in a cramped office 10 stories abovethe trading floor. ``I think we deter members from getting involvedin shady things. They know what we do.''   Bono oversees three analysts who work in perhaps the mostadvanced surveillance system of any exchange, withsynthesized-voice computers that not only shout warnings but alsoread news from a financial information service to advise analystsof market-sensitive developments.   The Amex operation also includes about 60 staffers who follow upleads uncovered by the stock watchers. Like the NYSE, Amex's systemhas been credited for exposing many illicit trades, notably theconspiracy that resulted in the arrest and conviction of formerWall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans a few years ago.Winans had peddled advance knowledge of his ``Heard on the Street''column, which often influenced the price of a stock he wrote about.   In a typical day, Bono's stock watchers will arrive an hourbefore the exchange opens and talk with floor traders to acquaintthemselves with the latest news and gossip. They also will scourthe newspapers and overnight copy from financial wire services.   The Amex computer ordinarily will record about 100 daily alerts,called ``kickouts'' or ``parameter breaks.'' Bono said about halfare readily explainable and the others require further inquiry.   Ultimately, a few might be referred to an Amex investigator andabout 50 a year are referred to the SEC, Bono said.   NYSE stock watchers conduct a similar screening process, alsoreferring about 50 trades a year to the SEC. Solodar didn'tdisclose the number of outstanding in-house inquiries but said itexceeds 100.   Does the operation deter wrongdoers?   ``In a broad sense I would say yes,'' observed Solodar. ``But ifsomebody wants to be a crook, they're going to be one, irrespectiveof the bells and alarms that are available to us.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday March 20</NOTE></DOC>
