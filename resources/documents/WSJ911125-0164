But Presidential objected to an announcement by the ratingfirm that it was withdrawing its rating, at the lifeinsurer's request.</LP><TEXT>   Sandamp;P hasn't changed its rating. However, its statementincluded the most recent opinion on Presidential, which wassimilar to the opinion it issued in April when it loweredPresidential's claims-paying ability to triple-B-minus fromtriple-B-plus. It said at the time that it expected continuedearnings deterioration because of the insurer's junk-bondinvestment losses.   In its own statement, Presidential, a Nyack, N.Y.,subsidiary of Presidential Life Corp., called the Sandamp;P release&quot;vindictive,&quot; saying that it was &quot;unfortunate that Standard andamp;Poor's continues to place its profitability ahead of itsresponsibility to the insurance industry and thepolicyholder.&quot;   Presidential said that after it notified Sandamp;P it intendedto cancel participation in the rating service, at a savingsof $25,000, Sandamp;P indicated it was planning to reaffirm thecurrent rating. Presidential claims that when it confirmedits withdrawal, the rating firm responded with the release.   An Sandamp;P spokesman said &quot;it is our standard practice to givethe most current, and in this particular instance, the lastopinion about the company's financial profile.&quot; Thesimilarity of the latest profile to the earlier one &quot;makestheir allegation seem pretty silly,&quot; an Sandamp;P spokesman said.   Herbert Kurz, chairman of Presidential Life, said thedecision to withdraw from Sandamp;P's ratings is based on &quot;ourcontention that rating agencies don't have the professionalexpertise to rate life insurance companies.&quot; The companycontinues to be rated by A.M. Best Co., Oldwick, N.J, whichspecializes in insurance ratings.   For the third quarter, Presidential Life Corp. had netincome of $572,000, or two cents a share.
