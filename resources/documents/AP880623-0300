(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Writers Guild of America voted3-1 to reject the latest contract offered by movie and televisionproducers and to continue its 4-month-old strike, union officialssaid Thursday.   The producers' alliance immediately responded by declaring therewas nothing more to negotiate and that it would produce as manyfall TV shows as possible, and begin layoffs if unable to completethe schedule.   ``Negotiations with the Writers Guild have concluded,'' saidHerb Steinberg, a spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture andTelevision Producers. ``We have nothing else to discuss with theWriters Guild. No further meetings are scheduled.''   Other than a few shows whose producers have signed contractsindependent of the alliance for such programs as ``The Cosby Show''and ``The Tonight Show,'' virtually all fall entertainmentprogramming is threatened by the strike.   The writers voted was 2,789 to 933, or 74.9 percent in favor ofrejection and 25.1 percent in favor of acceptance.   ``We remain ready, willing and able to conclude negotiations,''union President George Kirgo said.   Kirgo said the rejected offer was substantially better than thepreceding two offers and he credited chief executive officers ofmajor studios ``who joined with us in attempting to end thisstrike.''   Steinberg said the only further talks would have to be ``atelephone call saying they're willing to sign the strike settlementoffer as is.''   ``We are now moving ahead to produce as many programs as we can.We will do everything we can to get the town back to work. If wecannot produce our fall schedules in their entirety we will curtailoperations as required.''   Steinberg said that meant layoffs and shutting down facilities.   ``The message to the companies is loud and clear,'' said MonaMangan, executive director of the Writers Guild, East. ``Ourmembers want a contract that resolves the key issues of the strike.If the companies end their inflexibility, which forced the strikeand prolonged it, we can end this strike quickly and put everyonein our industry back to work.''   Ballots were cast during an often tumultuous membership meetingWednesday night in Los Angeles and another gathering in New York.   Writers opposing rejection of the proposed contract had concededthey would lose, but hoped to get enough votes to convince unionnegotiators to end the strike quickly. The union has 9,500 members.   The Writers Coalition, a union anti-strike group that includessome of Hollywood's top writer-producers, had said that 600 to 700votes for the pact would compel union negotiators to listen to thecoalition, said a coalition spokesman who talked on condition ofanonymity.   ``There is no victory here,'' said coalition member LionelChetwynd. ``The strike goes on. We're all losing.''   Business people from lighting suppliers to restaurant and deliowners said Thursday the contract's rejection would hurt.   ``If the television shows don't show up in August and September,the whole industry will be hurting,'' said John Clairmont, whoseClairmont Cameras supplies television crews.   Members voted in person or by proxy on the latest offer from theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, an umbrellagroup representing about 200 studios.   Chief union negotiator Brian Walton received a standing ovationlate Wednesday when he told the crowded meeting inside theHollywood Palladium ``I think the strike will end sooner and itwill end on fairer terms'' if the latest offer is rejected.   The rancorous meeting included shouted obscenities, hallwayarguments and booed-down speakers as it moved into the late nighthours.   Producers claim their four-year package will be worth an extra$71 million to writers and offers an across-the-board increase inresiduals of 14.7 percent. Payments to writers at present totalabout $360 million a year, producers' spokesman Herb Steinberg said.   The guild claims its negotiators accepted a flexible formula forpayment on one-hour televison shows sold for reruns but was notrewarded with a more generous offer for shows sold overseas. Theunion has linked the two items in an economic package.   With the new production season upcoming, lack of a contractcould hurt businesses who deal with major production companies thathave not signed independent contracts with the guild.   Other firms, which have dealt largely with independentproduction companies that have signed seperate contracts or hirednon-union crews, have said the strike has had little or no effect.   ``Some are hurting and some are cleaning up with all thenon-union work this has created. When this strike started, westarted shipping tons of equipment to Canada,'' said Ed Phillips,president of Matthews Co., a Burbank firm that supplies camera andlighting equipment.   Ron Dahlquist, president of Key Lite, said his firm supplieslighting equipment to the major studios and has been affected.   ``We have had quite a bit of slowdown. We've had to lay peopleoff and had a slowdown of production,'' Dahlquist said.   ``We have gone through this before,'' said Dahlquist. ``Therewill be some independent productions, regardless of a strike. Andthere is usually a tremendous surge after the strike is over, andthat more than makes up for the losses.''   At Art's Deli in Studio City, near the Universal Studios lot,owner Art Ginsburg bemoaned empty lunchtime tables.   ``We are off a good 10-to-15 percent,'' he said. ``Not only arethe writers and producers not coming in, but also the agentsmeeting with clients, the drivers, and all the related businesses.''</TEXT></DOC>
