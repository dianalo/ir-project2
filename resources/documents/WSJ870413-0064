Raymond A. Hay, LTV's chairman and chief executive officer, received total cash compensation of $694,137, of which $130,000 was a variable cash award. Such awards were given to executives &quot;provided their individual accomplishments, as well as those of the company and its subsidiaries, meet expected performance levels,&quot; according to documents filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    LTV defended the cash awards, saying they weren't bonuses, but part of each executive's salary. Bonuses were paid only to Billie Smith, president of the aircraft product group of LTV's aerospace and defense unit, and Robert N. Parker, president of the unit's missiles and electronics group, according to the filing. Mr. Smith received $22,439 and Mr. Parker received $13,432. The aerospace and defense unit is LTV's only consistently profitable business and LTV, which is also the nation's No. 2 steelmaker, plans to reorganize around it. The company filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code last July. Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay debt.    &quot;For an individual to receive no part of his variable compensation, it means he would have accomplished nothing during the year,&quot; a spokesman said, &quot;when in fact we had the most difficult year in the company's history, and people's performance in very difficult circumstances in many cases was quite good.&quot;    But the payments are almost certain to touch off creditors' and shareholders' concerns over LTV's management team, about which some sources have indicated dissatisfaction. Spokesmen for committees representing LTV's shareholders and unsecured creditors said they would review the payments and possibly challenge them in bankruptcy court.    LTV has racked up more than $4.6 billion in losses over the last five years, mostly from problems at its steel unit. In 1986, the company had a loss of $3.25 billion, after special charges of $3.24 billion. In 1985, the loss was $723.9 million, after $380 million in special charges.    LTV also disclosed that it agreed in 1983 that if Mr. Hay is fired except for reasons of fraud, willful misconduct or a felony conviction, he will be retained as a consultant for at least two years at a salary of 150% of his base, plus the annual average of his last three bonuses. </TEXT></DOC>
