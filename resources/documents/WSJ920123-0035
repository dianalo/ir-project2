Economics Minister Juergen Moellemann said the limit wasjustified by the uncertain future of the C.I.S., and by agrowing backlog of pledged guarantees that haven't been paidout, currently totaling 20 billion marks. The backlog is theresult of confusion over which institutions in the new stateshave the authority to vouch for the loans.</LP><TEXT>   The available credits will also be under a tighter rein.For instance, the new credits won't be available for businesswith Soviet states that didn't sign a debt agreement withWestern government creditors earlier this year.   Mr. Moellemann added, however, that the cabinet willreview in late March whether the cap should be increased,especially where eastern German exporters might benefit. Theexport-credit program is Bonn's favored means of aid becauseit secures 300,000 jobs at former Soviet suppliers in easternGermany.   The German government said it doesn't have figures yet onthe amount of guarantees provided last year. However, anEconomics Ministry spokeswoman said the total in 1991 wasmore than 5 billion marks. As of the end of last year,Germany had extended a cumulative total of 29.5 billion marksin the guarantee program.</TEXT></DOC>
