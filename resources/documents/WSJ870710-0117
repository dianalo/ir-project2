But he seems headed in the wrong direction in discussing new taxes; those are disincentives.    Why not look to tax credits for businesses and individuals who devote their resources to supporting and financing reforms in health care, social service, job training, etc.? More rigorous enforcement of current tax laws tempered by credits for direct investment in social services would avoid cumbersome new legislation, encourage more activism in business and cut out the middleman -- government -- which must take its share of the pie.    If we must have a new tax, levy a 90% flat tax on profits made through mergers and acquisitions. That would have the further benefit of either discouraging such activity and thereby protecting many existing jobs and benefit programs, which, once lost, create a whole new group of needy people for whom support must be found, or of paying for those lost economic benefits.    John R. Corkran   Director of Development   The Bush School   Seattle, Wash.   ---   It would not be an overstatement to say that our ability to resolve the issue of uncompensated care holds the key to the future for the health-care-delivery system in this country. If we allow the federal government and its state counterparts to neglect the Medicaid issue while mandating rigid and unworkable insurance requirements for the private sector, we will surely lay the groundwork for a nationalized health-care system.    The wheels are already turning in Congress to mandate private-sector benefits. Once the government controls the demand side of the equation for both the public and private sectors, it is just a matter of time until the government will have &quot;no choice&quot; but to confiscate the supply side for the avowed purpose of maintaining cost-effective, accessible, quality medical care.    If there was ever a time for the private sector to think through the pragmatic and philosophical consequences of action or failure to act, it is on this topic. Let us hope that bold and imaginative leadership will materialize to lead the charge.    T. Carter Melton Jr.   President   Rockingham Memorial Hospital   Harrisonburg, Va.</TEXT></DOC>
