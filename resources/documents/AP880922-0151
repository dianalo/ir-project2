The Indiana senator wrapped up a four-day swing across the Westwith what aides billed as a major foreign policy address, and heused a TelePrompTer for the first time since his conventionacceptance speech.   In a foreign policy speech earlier this month in Chicago, Quaylediscarded his text and gave a rambling, discursive address.   Addressing 1,300 people at a Los Angeles World Affairs Councilluncheon, Quayle made no mention of Michael Dukakis, the Democraticpresidential candidate. But he criticized several Dukakis foreignpolicy and defense stances.   Quayle said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev recognizes that``without major changes, the Soviet Union could well enter the nextcentury ... (like) a Third World nation.''   Of perestroika, or restructuring, he said, ``Like the book ofthe same name, actual content has so far not lived up to theadvance press notices.''   Americans should judge the Soviets' actions by whether they pullback from ``global `pot stirring''' in Afghanistan, Angola,Nicaragua and other places, he said.   He called the Soviet radar station at Krasnoyarsk a blatantviolation of the ABM Treaty and it should be dismantledimmediately, not turned into an international space trackingstation as Gorbachev recently suggested.   He also urged the Soviets to demonstrate their seriousness onarms control by reducing their long-range SS-18 missiles and theirnew, mobile SS-24s and SS-25s.   And Gorbachev should ``show his good faih by renouncing theBrezhnev Doctrine unequivocally'' and agreeing to a pullback ofSoviet troops from Eastern Europe, he said. Because of the currentimbalance of Soviet and NATO forces, the Soviets must pull backmore troops, Quayle said.   He also called for the Soviets to allow freedom to emigrate``for Jews and refuseniks and anyone else.''   ``One does not deal with the Soviet Union by unilaterallyremoving negotiating leverage before the negotiations even begin,''he said, in what appeared to be a reference to Dukakis' oppositionto the mobile MX and Midgetman missiles.   Turning to Star Wars, he said the proposed space-based missiledefense system ``is not a `fantasy' or a `fraud' or a `gizmo' assome have called it.''   ``It is the margin of survival for American citizens if anuclear missile, whether by design or accident, is ever launchedagainst our land,'' he said.   He urged a return to bipartisanship in foreign policy, saying,``Congress serves the nation best when it allows the presidentmaximum freedom in foreign policy decision-making.''   Quayle, who says the War Powers Act should be curtailed ordrastically rewritten, said cited Nicaragua as an example of aconfused foreign policy. Congress has no business ``drawing sillydistinctions between lethal and non-lethal aid to a guerrillaarmy.''   Quayle fielded 13 questions from the audience, stronglydefending Contra aid with a declaration that ``the Monroe Doctrineis alive and well in America.''   ``There is something in this country that is called the MonroeDoctrine ... (that) says foreign powers coming into our hemisphere... is against the national interest of this country,'' Quayle said.   Quayle said he voted for sanctions against South Africa ``tosend a message that we must begin to work and to see what apost-apartheid government will look like.'' But he said he does notsupport additional sanctions now.   Meanwhile, in Washington, Quayle's campaign said that Sen. BobPackwood, R-Ore., will play Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as Quayle preparesfor the Oct. 5 debate with his Democratic counterpart.   Packwood preceded Bentsen as chairman of the Senate FinanceCommittee, serves on the panel with Bentsen and is considered a topdebater in the Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
