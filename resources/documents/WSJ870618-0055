CohenStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><TEXT>   Richard J. Ferris is out of a job as head of Allegis Corp., and a small New York investment firm named Coniston Partners is largely responsible.    The former Allegis chairman apparently underestimated Coniston's clout last month when it surfaced with a 13% stake in the company and a plan to gain control of the board. &quot;He thought he could beat them with some sort of recapitalization plan,&quot; says an associate of Mr. Ferris.    Instead, Coniston -- run by two former investment bankers and a lawyer -- beat him. Last week, Mr. Ferris stepped down as chairman of the company that owns United Airlines, the Hertz car-rental chain and the Westin and Hilton International hotels. His resignation was fostered by an abrupt about-face by Allegis's board. The directors gave in to Coniston's proposal for boosting shareholder value by announcing that the company would break itself up into its three main businesses and sell off the pieces.    The breakup of Allegis is expected to net the company's stockholders nearly $100 a share. The biggest winner will be Coniston, which is controlled by former White Weld investment bankers Keith Gollust and Paul Tierney, and former merger lawyer Augustus Oliver. Coniston will earn more than $200 million on its investment. Not bad for three months' work.    Coniston has &quot;a real knack for knowing exactly when to strike,&quot; says James Clark, a partner of Tweedy Browne, a New York investment advisory concern. Coniston has struck more than half a dozen times before.    Coniston's assaults have helped the five-year-old firm build a capital pool of more than $500 million and garner returns averaging 50% annually before the three managing partners' 20% share of the profits (the other 80% is divided among 40 to 50 individual and institutional limited partners). But the assaults have also brought Messrs. Gollust, Tierney and Oliver severe criticism.    &quot;They stir up the pot, with all the controversy that engenders,&quot; says Joseph Flom, a managing partner of the law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher andamp; Flom who once was Mr. Oliver's boss.    &quot;I wish I never heard of them,&quot; adds Terry Lee, chairman of Storer Communications Inc. After Coniston won four of Storer's nine board seats in May 1985, Storer decided to go private in a leveraged buyout organized by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. Storer is now only a shadow of its former self, with most of its units having been sold off to pay debt.    Last year Coniston made a run at NL Industries Inc. before Dallas investor Harold Simmons took control, and sold its stake at a profit. It also made a run at Gelco Corp., in which it still holds a 20% stake. Coniston also profited in 1986 from a large position in Viacom International Inc., which went private in a management buyout.    On a couple of occasions, Coniston's forays have led opponents to accuse it of being little more than a greenmailer, buying a company's stock to force the concern to buy it back at a premium. For example, the partnership teamed up with Far Hills, N.J.-based Shamrock Associates in 1984 to acquire a 24% stake in Dorsey Corp. Ultimately, the group agreed to sell its stake back to the company at a premium.    The Dorsey transaction &quot;wasn't a shining moment in our history,&quot; concedes the 37-year-old Mr. Oliver, who sports shoulder-length brown hair that makes him look more like a rock star than a corporate raider.    Mr. Simmons says that Messrs. Gollust, Tierney and Oliver &quot;are really sharp guys&quot; who &quot;are attracted to the same situations I'm attracted to.&quot;    Despite their wealth, the three partners live relatively modestly. All three are low-key, preferring to spend weekends in remote spots in New Jersey, Connecticut or Long Island, N.Y., rather than in glitzy resorts. Mr. Oliver is a social activist who has promised to pay for the college tuition of an East Harlem seventh-grade class.    &quot;They're not workaholics,&quot; says James Regan, a partner with Messrs. Gollust, Tierney and Oliver in a rich arbitrage venture called Sabre Associates. &quot;They don't need to put in 12-hour days to feel they've accomplished something.&quot;    &quot;All we really need is a couple of good days a year,&quot; jokes Mr. Gollust, who will be 42 tomorrow. In fact, between deals, the three men take time off to pursue other interests. Mr. Gollust recently climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. Mr. Tierney, a 44-year-old former Peace Corps volunteer, competes in triathalons, which test running, swimming and biking skills.    The three men like to spend time with their children. Mr. Oliver says that unlike the law office, with its 70-hour to 80-hour workweeks, Coniston affords &quot;much more time to spend with my wife and daughter, and that's really important to me.&quot;    Mr. Gollust calls what Coniston does &quot;strategic block investing.&quot; Operating out of tony Park Avenue offices, where the hours are regular and the atmosphere relaxed, Mr. Gollust views Coniston simply as &quot;active shareholders.&quot;    Coniston typically buys 5% to 20% of the shares outstanding in just a handful of companies at a time, then tries to force management into making changes to boost the share price.    Mr. Gollust and Mr. Tierney first tested their mettle in the early 1980s when they forced three mutual funds that had been selling at discounts to net asset value to restructure. In 1982, they formed Coniston, naming the firm after a street in Short Hills, N.J., near Mr. Gollust's former home. Started with only $2.5 million, Coniston now has separate funds for domestic, foreign and tax-exempt investors. Mr. Oliver, who had done some of Coniston's legal work at Skadden Arps, joined Coniston in 1984.    One of Coniston's earliest investments was a 9% stake bought in 1983 in Sooner Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, a Tulsa, Okla., thrift. &quot;It was the one investment we sold out at a loss,&quot; Mr. Oliver recalls.    Coniston looks for companies that, like Allegis, are worth more broken up. Before taking a major position, the firm does exhaustive studies of a target's breakup values. &quot;They did their homework and their values were correct,&quot; says Ilan Kaufthal, former chief financial officer of NL Industries.    Now that Allegis has yielded to Coniston's demands, Coniston is likely to have a hand in helping sell the pieces. After Mr. Ferris's resignation last week, the company's investment bankers summoned Messrs. Gollust, Tierney and Oliver to their office late in the evening to ask for support.    &quot;I have a feeling they would have liked nothing better than to have controlled the board of directors and run this company,&quot; says Mr. Regan of Sabre Associates.    But Mr. Gollust demurs. &quot;We're reasonably happy with the way things turned out&quot; at Allegis, he says. &quot;We're financial people. It wasn't our ambition to become personally involved in the operation of an airline.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
