Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The collections of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemakinghave been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review inaccordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)).Comments on the collections of information should be sent to the Officeof Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,Washington, D.C. 20503, Attention: Paperwork Reduction Project (3064-0030),with copies to the Assistant Executive Secretary (Administration), Room6096, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Washington, D.C. 20429.The collections of information in this regulation are grouped under thetitle Securities of Insured Nonmember Banks (OMB No. 3064-0030) and arecontained in andSection;andSection; 335.212, 335.213, 335.221, 335.309a, 335.309b,335.312, 335.321, 335.331, 335.332, 335.407, 335.408, 335.413, 335.414,335.512, 335.513, and 335.627. This information is collected from insurednonmember banks that are subject to the securities registration requirementsof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (15 U.S.C. 78), andfrom their shareholders. The required information is considered necessaryfor actual and potential investors making investment decisions concerningthe securities issued by the reporting banks.The estimated annual reporting burden for the collections of informationin this regulation is summarized as follows:<T3>Number of Respondents: </T3>5,058.<T3>Number of Responses Per Respondent: </T3>1.09.<T3>Total Annual Responses: </T3>5,500.<T3>Hours Per Response: </T3>10.48.<T3>Total Annual Burden Hours: </T3>57,629.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Background</ITAG>Section 12(i) of the Exchange Act vests the powers, functions, and dutiesof the SEC to administer and enforce sections 12, 13, 14(a), 14(c), 14(d),14(f), and 16 of the Act with respect to nonmember banks in the FDIC. Thesame section requires the FDIC to issue regulations substantially similarto regulations issued by the SEC unless the FDIC finds that implementationof such regulations with respect to insured banks is not necessarily appropriatein the public interest, or for protection of investors, and the FDIC publishesthe findings in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The proposal is intended to satisfy that requirement.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Amendments to Part 335</ITAG>1. Independent Audit RequirementSince 1964 most banks have generally had the option of using verificationstatements which express the opinion of a bank's principal accounting officeror internal auditor. On July 19, 1971, the SEC required all corporationsreporting to it under the Exchange Act to have their financial statementsaudited by independent public accountants. SEC Rel. 34-9253, 36 FR 13915.(July 28, 1971.)On September 30, 1975, the FDIC reviewed the question of requiring auditsof banks' financial statements filed under Part 335. 40 FR 47346. (October8, 1975.) At that time, less than half of those banks whose securitieswere registered filed certified financial statements. Currently, only ninebanks reporting under Part 335 do not file certified financial statements.In order to make reporting requirements for publicly held banks consistentwith those requirements for all other publicly held corporations, the FDICproposes to amend Part 335 of its regulations to eliminate the use of verificationstatements and to require that bank financial statements be audited byindependent public accountants. It is intended that this requirement, ifadopted, would be effective for financial statements issued for periodsending after December 15, 1989. The FDIC proposes to amend andSection;andSection;335.602 and 335.603 to conform to the SEC rule.2. CompensationOn September 23, 1983, the SEC adopted an amended and retitled item ofRegulation S-K, item 402, providing for uniform disclosure of the compensationpaid to certain executive officers and directors. The amendment was intendedto simplify the current disclosure requirements, reduce compliance burdensand allow SEC registrants greater flexibility in selecting a presentationformat while providing investors and security holders with more comprehensiveinformation concerning executive compensation. (SEC Rel. No. 34-20220,43 FR 44467 (Sept. 29, 1983, corrected 48 FR 46012, Oct. 11, 1983). TheFDIC would also amend its regulations in a similar fashion to provide greaterflexibility in format and to otherwise conform with newer SEC requirements.A noteworthy change would be an increase in the threshold for disclosureof individual compensation of executive officers from $50,000 to $60,000.The FDIC proposes to amend andSection; 335.212 item 7 to accomplish thisresult. Changes in other aspects of items 6 and 7 relating to directors,officers, and insider transactions, as modified by the SEC on December13, 1982, SEC Rel. No. 34-19290, 47 FR 55861 (December 13, 1982) are alsoproposed, except for certain provisions governing disclosure of insiderloans for banks which have historically been governed by more specificregulations in Part 335.3. Small Transaction ExemptionSEC Rel. No. 34-18853, 47 FR 29652 (July 8, 1982) increased the reportingexemption for small ``insider trading'' reports from $3,000 to $10,000in market value for any six-month period. The FDIC proposes to amend andSection;335.410(h)to conform to the SEC change.4. Issuer Tender OffersOn July 28, 1983, the SEC amended its issuer tender offer regulation (SECrule 13e-4) to except from its requirements, offers by issuers to purchaseshares from their security holders who own a specified number of shares(less than 100) as of a specified date prior to the announcement of theoffer. A companion amendment was made to SEC rule 13(e)(3) (the ``goingprivate rule''). SEC Rel. No. 34-48 FR 34253 (July 28, 1983). The FDIChas applied SEC rules 13(e) (3) and (4) to nonmember bank transactionsby a statement of policy. 46 FR 25295 (May 5, 1981). Since the time ofadoption of this policy, issuer tender offers and going private transactionshave become more frequent among nonmember banks. Thus, a specific rulein the FDIC's regulations applying SEC rules 13(e)(3) and 13(e)(4) to nonmemberbanks is desirable. The FDIC proposes to amend andSection;andSection;335.409and 335.521 to reflect the application of these rules to registered nonmemberbanks.5. Comprehensive Review of Proxy RulesOn November 10, 1986 the SEC adopted amendments to its proxy rules in orderto bring to the proxy context the benefits of the SEC's existing integrateddisclosure system. The amendments provided for simplified disclosure ofcompensation plans. The amendments also require new registrants to providedisclosure concerning prior changes in accountants and any related disagreements.In addition, certain changes updated the rules to comport with currentSEC practice, interpretations and other changes of laws and rules. 51 FR42048 (November 20, 1986).The FDIC proposes to adopt technical changes made by the SEC which fitthe regulatory scheme of Part 335. A major difference would be that theFDIC would not repeat many regulations in a separate information statementregulation. References to the Securities Act of 1933 filings would be eliminated,since banks are exempt from the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77a <T3>et seq</T3>. (1982) (``Securities Act'').The proposed amendments primarily revise Subpart B of Part 335.6. All Holders and Best Price Rules in Tender OffersOn July 11, 1986, the SEC adopted amendments to its tender offer rulesproviding that a bidder's or issuer's tender offer must be open to allholders of the class of securities subject to the tender offer and thatany security holder must be paid the highest consideration paid to anyother security holder during the tender offer. In addition, the SEC amendedexisting rules concerning minimum offering periods and withdrawal rights.SEC Rel. No. 34-23421, 51 FR 25873 (July 17, 1986).The FDIC proposes to adopt the SEC amendments in substantially the formadopted by the SEC except that the issuer tender offer rules would be broughtinto play by the cross referencing regulation proposed in paragraph 4.Sections 335.507, 335.509(a), and 335.510 would be amended as set forthbelow.7. Shareholder CommunicationsOn November 25, 1986, the SEC adopted its new rule 14b-2 under the ExchangeAct and related amendments to rules 14a-1, 14a-13, 14c-1 and 14c-7 in orderto implement provisions of the Shareholder Communications Act of 1985 (Pub.L. 99-222, 99 Stat. 1737 (1985)). New rule 14b-2 governs banks as intermediariesand is administered by the SEC. Rules 14a-1, 14a-13, 14c-1 and 14c-7 wouldapply to nonbank issuers and are thus subject to our consideration undersection 12(i) of the Exchange Act. The rules govern the process by whichthe registrants communicate with the beneficial owners of their securitiesthat are registered in the name of a bank, its nominee, a broker, or otherentity acting as agent, custodian or fiduciary (i.e., held in street name).The FDIC proposes to amend its regulations with respect to those provisionsthat deal with the bank as issuer. Appropriate amendments would be madeto andSection;andSection;335.203 and 335.214.8. CompaniesSEC Rel. No. 34-23789, discussed in paragraph 4 above, also allows theincorporation by reference of information meeting the requirements of theproxy regulations that has already been filed under the Securities Act.The FDIC proposes to amend its regulations to allow the incorporation byreference of filings on SEC forms where the person incorporating filingsby reference is a holding company or nonbank company filing with the SEC.All filings incorporated by reference must be filed with the FDIC. Section335.212, items 14 and 15 would be amended as set forth below.9. Supplementary Statistical DisclosurePursuant to the SEC's Industry Guide 3, supplemental statistical disclosuresof material lending and deposit activities may be relevent and useful toan understanding of the bank's operations. The management's discussionand analysis of financial condition and results of operations sectionsof the annual report and registration statement (Forms F-2 and F-1, respectively)are proposed to be expanded to include statistical information similarto that required by Securities Exchange Act Industry Guide 3. Informationabout yields and costs of various assets and liabilities, maturities andrepricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities and risk elementsin the lending portfolio would be required. SEC Rel. No. 69, 52 FR 18200(May 8, 1987). The FDIC proposes to amend sections 335.309a and 335.312to provide for informative disclosures by nonmember banks as appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. SEC Amendments not Adopted</ITAG>1. Elimination of Legal Size PaperOn December 21, 1982, the SEC announced the adoption of amendments to itsrules to require the use of 8\1/2\andmin16;andmin16; x 11andmin16;andmin16; paperfor all statements, applications, reports, documents and amendments theretofiled with the SEC. The reason given for the change was that the adoptionof a uniform size for all documents filed under the SEC will achieve maximumcost-efficiency in the SEC's micrographics filing program. SEC Rel. No.34-19356, 47 FR 58237 (December 30, 1982).The FDIC does not intend to amend its rules to conform with the SEC inthis respect. The FDIC does not use a micrographics filing program andtherefore has no need for the change.2. Shareholder ProposalsOn August 23, 1983, the SEC adopted amendments to its shareholder proposalrule, rule 14a-8, 17 CFR 240.14a-8 (1986). The amendments introduce severalnew procedural requirements that proponents must meet, reduce the numberof proposals that a proponent may submit to an issuer in any one year,allow proponents to include supporting statements even where managementdoes not oppose their proposal, and make other changes.The FDIC does not propose to adopt these changes because it has not experienceda need for a revision of the rule.3. Reporting by Small IssuersOn July 8, 1986, the SEC adopted amendments to its regulation that wouldincrease the number of issuers outside the scope of its registration andreporting requirements by adjusting the total assets threshold upward to$5 million.The FDIC does not intend to amend its regulations in this fashion becausea $5 million threshold would not exempt any banks whose securities areregistered under Part 335.4. Preliminary Proxy Material_Shareholder ProposalsOn December 22, 1987, the SEC adopted amendments to its proxy rules toeliminate the filing of ``routine'' preliminary proxy and information statementsunder certain circumstances. It also amended its shareholder proposal rule.SEC Rel. No. 34-25217, 52 FR 48977 (December 29, 1987).In view of our past experience with proxy statement filings, we feel thatbank management and bank shareholders profit from our advance staff reviewand comments. Many registered banks do not have special securities counsel.Staff review of preliminary proxy statements regularly detects errors andinconsistencies in filed material. In particular, statements as to shareownership and insider transactions are frequently corrected as a resultof the review.The FDIC specifically invites comments on the cost savings of implementingthe SEC change and eliminating the filing of routine preliminary proxyand information statements. Thus, the FDIC does not propose to eliminatepreliminary filing requirements for ``routine'' proxy statements. The amendmentsto the shareholder proposal rule are not proposed for the same reason asstated in the above paragraph D.2.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Miscellaneous</ITAG>The regulations have been updated to reflect changes in the Call Reportsand in other minor technical respects. Some corrections have been made.<ITAG tagnum="84">F. Certain Factors</ITAG>1. Alternatives ConsideredSection 12(i) of the Act requires the FDIC to issue regulations substantiallysimilar to those of the SEC or publish its reasons for not doing so. TheFDIC believes that the reasons for the SEC regulations proposed to be adoptedare equally applicable to the banking industry.2. Cost-Benefit AnalysisAs noted above, the amendments are required by statute. Therefore, a cost-benefitanalysis was not prepared. The FDIC feels that at this time it is not appropriateto utilize a flexible regulatory approach (small bank/large bank) sinceshareholders and investors in small banks have the need for the same qualityinformation provided to shareholders and investors of large banks. TheFDIC requests comments upon any increase in costs or additional burdenthe amendments may impose, which would not be outweighed by the benefitsprovided the bank, shareholders and the public. The FDIC is specificallyrequesting information from banks concerning projected start-up costs andcontinuing costs. To the extent feasible, these estimates should be allocatedamong the various new areas of regulation.3. Regulatory Flexibility ActThe FDIC certifies that the proposal, if issued, would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small banks or other entities.Of the banks affected by the proposal less than 60 banks have individualassets no greater than $25 million.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 335</ITAG>Accounting, Banks, Banking, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities.Chapter III of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposedto be amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 335_SECURITIES OF NONMEMBER BANKS</ITAG>1.

Presentation Requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Pro forma financial information shall be furnished when any ofthe following conditions exist:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) During the most recent fiscal year or subsequent interim periodfor which a balance sheet is required by andSection;335.623 a significantbusiness combination accounted for as a purchase has occurred;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) After the date of the most recent balance sheet filed pursuantto andSection;335.628, consummation of a significant business combinationto be accounted for by either the purchase method or pooling-of-interestsmethod of accounting has occurred or is probable;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The bank is offering its securities to the security holders ofa significant business to be acquired or the proceeds from the offeredsecurities will be applied, directly or indirectly, to the purchase ofa specific significant business;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) The disposition of a significant portion of a business eitherby sale, abandonment or distribution to shareholders by means of a spin-off,split-up or split-off has occurred or is probable and such dispositionis not fully reflected in the bank's financial statements included in thefiling; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Other transactions or events have occurred or are probable forwhich disclosure of pro forma financial information would be material toinvestors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) A business combination or disposition of a business shall be consideredsignificant if:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) A comparison of the most recent annual financial statements ofthe business acquired or to be acquired and the bank's most recent annualconsolidated financial statements filed at or prior to the date of acquisitionindicates that the business would be a significant subsidiary under conditionsspecified in andSection;335.103(nn); or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The business to be disposed of meets the conditions of a significantsubsidiary in andSection;335.102(nn).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) When consummation of more than one transaction has occurred oris probable during a fiscal year, the tests of significance in paragraph(b) of this section shall be applied to the cumulative effect of thosetransactions. If the cumulative effect of the transactions is significant,pro forma financial information shall be presented.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) For purposes of this section, the term ``business'' should beevaluated in light of the facts and circumstances involved and whetherthere is sufficient continuity of the acquired entity's operations priorto and after the transactions so that disclosure of prior financial informationis material to an understanding of future operations. A presumption existsthat a separate entity, a subsidiary, or a division is a business. However,a lesser component of an entity may also constitute a business. Among thefacts and circumstances which should be considered in evaluating whetheran acquisition of a lesser component of an entity constitutes a businessare the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Whether the nature of the revenue-producing activity of the componentwill remain generally the same as before the transaction; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Whether any of the following attributes remain with the componentafter the transaction:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Physical facilities,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Employee base,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Market distribution system,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) Sales force,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(v) Customer base,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(vi) Operating rights,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(vii) Production techniques, or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(viii) Trade names.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) This section does not apply to transactions between a bank andits totally owned subsidiaires.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">II. Preparation Requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) <T3>Objective.</T3> Pro forma financial information should provide investorswith information about the continuing impact of a particular transactionby showing how it might have affected historical financial statements ifthe transaction had been consummated at an earlier time. Such statementshould assist investors in analyzing the future prospects of the bank becausethey illustrate the possible scope of the change in the bank's historicalfinancial position and results of operations caused by the transaction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) <T3>Form and content.</T3> (1) Pro forma financial information shall consistof a pro forma condensed balance sheet, pro forma condensed statementsof income, and accompanying explanatory notes. Where a limited number ofpro forma adjustments are required and those adjustments are easily understood,a narrative description of the pro forma effects of the transaction maybe furnished in lieu of the statements described herein.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The pro forma financial information shall be accompanied by anintroductory paragraph which briefly sets forth a description of (i) thetransaction, (ii) the entities involved, and (iii) the periods for whichthe pro forma information is presented. In addition, an explanation ofwhat the pro forma presentation shows shall be set forth.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The pro forma condensed financial information need only includemajor captions (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the numbered captions) prescribed by andSection;335.627 Aand B. Where any major balance sheet caption is less than 10 percent oftotal assets, the caption may be combined with others. When any major incomestatement caption is less than 15 percent of average net income of thebank for the most recent three fiscal years, the caption may be combinedwith others. In calculating average net income, loss years should be excluded,unless losses were incurred in each of the most recent three years, inwhich case the average loss shall be used for purposes of this test. Notwithstandingthese tests, <T3>de minimis</T3> amounts need not be shown separately.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Pro forma statements shall ordinarily be in columnar form showingcondensed historical statement, pro forma adjustments, and the pro formaresults.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) The pro forma condensed income statement shall disclose income(loss) from continuing operations before nonrecurring charges or creditsdirectly attributable to the transaction. Material nonrecurring chargesor credits and related tax effects which result directly from the transactionand which will be included in the income of the Bank within the 12 monthssucceeding the transaction shall be disclosed separately. It should beclearly indicated that such charges or credits were not considered in thepro forma condensed income statement. If the transaction for which proforma financial information is presented related to the disposition ofa business, the pro forma results should give effect to the dispositionand be presented under an appropriate caption.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Pro forma adjustments related to the pro forma condensed incomestatement shall be computed assuming the transaction was consummated atthe beginning of the fiscal year presented and shall include adjustmentwhich give effect to events that are (i) directly attributable to the transaction,(ii) expected to have a continuing impact on the bank, and (iii) factuallysupportable. Pro forma adjustments related to the pro forma condensed balancesheet shall be computed assuming the transaction was consummated at theend of the most recent period for which a balance sheet is required byandSection; 335.623 and shall include adjustments which give effect to eventsthat are directly attributable to the transaction and factually supportable,regardless of whether they have a continuing impact or are nonrecurring.All adjustments should be referenced to notes which clearly explain theassumption involved.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(7) Historical, primary and fully diluted per share data base on continuingoperations (or net income if the bank does not report discontinued operations,extraordinary items, securities gains (losses), or the cumulative effectsof accounting changes) for the bank, and primary and fully diluted proforma per share data based on continuing operations before nonrecurringcharges or credits directly attributable to the transaction shall be presentedon the face of the pro forma condensed income statement together with thenumber of shares used to compute such per share data. For transactionsinvolving the issuance of securities, the number of shares used in thecalculation of the pro forma per shares outstanding during the period,adjusted to give effect to shares subsequently issued or assumed to beissued had the particular transaction or event taken place at the beginningof the period presented. If a convertible security is being issued in thetransaction, consideration should be given to the possible dilution ofthe pro forma per share data.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(8) If the transaction is structured in such a manner that significantlydifferent results may occur, additional pro forma presentations shall bemade which give effect to the range of possible results.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Instructions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The historical statement of income used in the pro forma financialinformation shall not report operations of a segment that has been discontinued,extraordinary items, securities gains (losses), or the cumulative effectsof accounting changes. If the historical statement of income includes suchitems, only the appropriate portion of the statement (and appropriate captions)should be used in preparing pro forma results.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. For a purchase transaction, pro forma adjustments for the incomestatement shall include amortization of any intangible asset, depreciationand other adjustments based on the allocated purchase price of net assetsacquired. Disclose in a note the effect which the purchase adjustment willhave on the reported results of operations for each of the next five yearsin such adjustments:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Involve a significant write-down of the historical cost of theacquired assets to their fair value at the acquisition date; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Will have a significant effect on earnings in periods immediatelyfollowing the acquisition which will be progressively eliminated over arelatively short period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. For a disposition transaction, the pro forma financial informationshall begin with the historical financial statements of the bank and showthe deletion of the business to be divested along with the necessary proforma adjustments, including adjustments relating to expenses that willbe or have been incurred on behalf of the business to be divested. <T3>e.g., </T3>advertising costs and personnel expenses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. When consummation of more than one transaction has occurred oris probable during a fiscal year, the pro forma financial information maybe presented on a combined basis; however, in some circumstances. <T3>e.g.,</T3> where some transactions have been consummated and the othersare probable, it may be more useful to present the pro forma financialinformation on a nonaggregated basis, even though some of all of the transactionswould not meet the tests of significance individually. For combined presentations,a note should explain the various transactions and disclose the maximumvariances in the pro forma financial information which would occur forany of the possible combinations. If the pro forma financial informationis presented in a proxy or information statement for purposes of obtainingshareholder approval of one of the transactions, the effects of that transactionmust be clearly set forth.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Income tax effects, if any, of pro forma adjustments normally shouldbe calculated at the statutory rate in effect during the periods for whichpro forma condensed income statements are presented and should be reflectedas a separate pro forma adjustment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) <T3>Periods to be presented.</T3> (1) A pro forma condensed balance sheetas of the end of the most recent period for which a consolidated balancesheet of the bank is required by andSection; 335.623 shall be filed, unlessthe transaction is already reflected in such balance sheet.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2)(i) Pro forma condensed statements of income shall be filed foronly the most recent fiscal year and for the period from the end of themost recent fiscal year to the most recent interim date for which a balancesheet is required. A pro forma condensed statement of income may be filedfor the corresponding interim period of the preceding fiscal year. A proforma condensed statement of income shall not be filed when the historicalincome statement reflects the transaction for the entire period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) For a business combination accounted for as a pooling of interests,the pro forma income statements (which are in effect a restatement of thehistorical income statements as if the combination had been consummated)shall be filed for all periods for which historical income statements ofthe banks are required.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Pro forma condensed statements of income shall be presented usingthe bank's fiscal year-end. If the most recent fiscal year-end of any otherentity involved in the transaction differs from the bank's most recentfiscal year-end by more than 93 days, the other entity's income statementshall be brought up to within 93 days of the bank's most recent fiscalyear-end, if practicable.
