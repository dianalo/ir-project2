While rebel attacks back home continued unabated, guerrillacommanders cast themselves in the role of peacemakers duringmeetings this week with Salvadoran politicians at the resort town ofOaxtepec, 40 miles outside Mexico City.   The rebel Farabundo Marti Liberation Front left the meeting witha promise from political leaders to ``consider'' the proposal therebels made Tuesday and press the U.S.-supported government fordirect talks.   The San Salvador government had no immediate reaction to theproposal, but the Defense Ministry issued a statement Wednesdaycalling the rebel proposal a ``sinister'' plan to obtain power ``byforce of arms.''   If the government rejects talks, which appears likely, the rebelsare bolstered in their claim that government intransigence is toblame for continuing bloodshed.   The rebels would then have an excuse for stepped up attacks asthe March 19 elections approach and gain a propaganda tool in theirbattle for the hearts and minds of the Salvadoran people.   Rebel commander Roberto Roca said President Jose Napoleon Duarteand El Salvador's National Assembly will have to decide quickly orbear ``the blame for the continuation of the war. The matter isurgent.''   The war began in 1980 and has claimed an estimated 70,000 lives,most of them civilian. At least 27 people died over the last threedays, most of them in guerrilla attacks. Several were innocentbystanders.   The rebels have offered to take an indirect role in thepresidential elections, supporting the leftist DemocraticConvergence, which is now running third in polls behind the rightistNationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, and Duarte's centristChristian Democrats.   The guerrillas have vowed to respect the outcome if the vote ispostponed and their conditions are met.   But those conditions would mean sweeping changes in El Salvador'spolitical and military structure, including large cuts in the armedforces _ cuts the military has already rejected.   The armed forces have hinted at a coup if Duarte stays in officepast June 1, the constitutionally mandated end of his term.   Rebel leaders say they believe their proposal won theminternational sympathy and gained them credibility with Salvadoranpolitical leaders.   They said the very fact that they sat down with the politiciansfor the first time ever was a breakthrough.   Roca told reporters on Wednesday he believes at least somepoliticians left convinced the rebel front genuinely has democraticaims.   The rebel offer to end a decade-long ban on participation inelections, first made in January, has been treated with intenseskepticism by Duarte's government, the military and Arena, which haslittle incentive to make concessions because of its electoral lead.   The rebel leaders insist they are serious about peace _ under theright conditions. They said Wednesday that the end of the Reaganadministration was a factor in their decision to make a peace offerin hopes the Bush administration will press the Salvadorangovernment to agree to talks.   The United States has pumped more than $3 billion in military andeconomic aid into El Salvador without ending the conflict betweenthe 56,000-man armed forces and the 7,000 guerrillas.</TEXT></DOC>
