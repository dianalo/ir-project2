Soviet hero Yeltsin talks of having hisown army. That would leave the U.S. and European allies withan unprecedented question of how to deal with Sovietrepublics with their own military might. It is even possiblethat the Soviets' nuclear weapons arsenal could get dividedup.</LP><TEXT>   But even if Yeltsin's power rises, Bush feels he stillwill need Gorbachev on basic foreign-policy issues that theSoviet president controls. For one: How cooperative theSoviets will be at the Mideast peace conference set forOctober. Still, after the NATO meeting this week, Baker metprivately with Yeltsin's own foreign minister.   Some European allies fret that Yeltsin's radical reformswill produce chaos, but former Pentagon aide Richard Perlesays, &quot;If there is chaos, it is because the economy hascollapsed.&quot;                                                                                                          U.S. CREDIT EASING is put on hold amid the Soviet turmoil.The Federal Reserve's policy committee met Tuesday as theattempted Soviet coup raised serious economic worries. Withthe Soviet scare over, Fed policy makers see still-weak signsof recovery. Production is up, they say, but bad money-supplynumbers cause concern. Fed officials seem likely to wait afew weeks before deciding on any further action to easecredit.   The coup's collapse also ends some economic threats.Farmers are relieved that their sales to the Soviet Unionwon't be blocked. But U.S. officials concede that despiteBush's temporary freeze on Soviet aid, he never had anyintention of blocking government credits for grain sales.                                                                                                          DEMOCRATS GROPE to grab the health issue, but their forcesare divided. Missouri Rep. Gephardt and some other Houseleaders consider seeking a national health-care plan like theCanadian system, financed by tax dollars. But their billwould clash with Senate Democrats' proposal to requireemployers to provide health insurance or help pay for apublic plan. Some Democrats worry that the Senate bill is tootough on smaller businesses.   Labor splits over what approach to back. The AFL-CIOsupports the Senate proposal, but nine dissident unions thatwant national health insurance disavow AFL-CIO unity. Thedissidents, including the auto-workers union, warn thatcharges proposed by Senate Democrats might stir a publicoutcry that would boomerang in Bush's favor.   Sensing voter appeal on the issue, Arkansas Gov. Clintonplans to try to assume the health-care mantle from Sen.Rockefeller in any presidential bid.                                                                                                          CALIFORNIA'S PRIMARY for president could still be moved toMarch from June, despite Gov. Wilson's threat to veto suchlegislation. He suggests he would approve a bill to move upthe primary if the legislative and congressional primariesaren't switched, too. &quot;If they're decoupled,&quot; he says in aninterview, &quot;I'll sign it.&quot;                                                                                                          CHINA LURKS as a potential embarrassment for Bush.Human-rights groups press him to protest the jailing of twoChinese dissidents who have begun a hunger strike. The StateDepartment responds with a low-level letter of concern.Bush's differing actions bring &quot;cheers in Moscow but tears inBeijing,&quot; asserts Democratic Rep. Pelosi of California.                                                                                                          ETHICS DEAL? The Senate Ethics Committee's dropping ofcharges against New York GOP Sen. D'Amato may help lightentreatment of the Keating Five Democrats when Congressreturns. Sentiment grows among senators to ease up especiallyon California's Cranston, who helped raise nearly $200,000for 35 Democratic colleagues.                                                                                                          BCCI'S AID included helping procure mules for clients inPakistan, probably the Afghan rebels. A 1987 telex from thebank's office in Miami reads &quot;Awaiting details urgentlyregarding type, male or female mules, available from Colombiaor Peru.&quot;                                                                                                          ABORTION CLASHES may spur a politically volatile showdownat the high court. Anti-abortion laws in Pennsylvania andperhaps Louisiana could come before the Supreme Court nextterm. Both sides expect the conservative majority to furthererode abortion rights or overturn Roe vs. Wade. But strikingdown Roe in an election year &quot;would be very damaging forRepublicans,&quot; says Mary Crisp, a former party co-chairman andan abortion-rights advocate.   The National Abortion Rights Action League maps actionsagainst anti-abortion candidates. Even some anti-abortionleaders say that a ruling further restricting abortion rightsmight be preferable to triggering a huge political backlash.&quot;The key is the framing of the issue, not just overturningRoe,&quot; says the National Right to Life Committee's BurkeBalch.   Senate Democrats plan for Biden to press high courtnominee Thomas on abortion at confirmation hearings andKennedy to lead on affirmative action.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: Soviet Putsch-plotters, Comedian YakovSmirnov says, had a strange new disease: &quot;Russian flu --first you get cold feet, then your backbone dissolves.&quot; . . .As Bush was refusing to recognize the Soviet coup Tuesday,his Energy Department put out an energy analysis referring to&quot;the new government in the Soviet Union.&quot;. . . While Bushbasked in the coup-collapse, Democratic pollster Geoff Garinsaid Gore was the Democrats' one presidential hopeful with&quot;some credibility&quot; on foreign affairs. Hours later, Goreannounced he won't run.</TEXT></DOC>
