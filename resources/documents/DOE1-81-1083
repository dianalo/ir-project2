The process is controlled by chemical reaction with anactivation energy of 111 kJ/mol during the main period. The process isfaster than predicted by the known m/sup 1///sup 3/-law during the initialstage. An additional decomposition process is suggested as a possibleexplanation. (orig.)</TEXT></DOC>
