(editorial)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Hurwitz, Judith S.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>A Clean Slate for the New Year THE OTHER DAY, I got a call from a distresseduser.andP;  His company was planning to implement a Unix-based system.andP;  But,before proceeding, management decided to call in a consulting firm (one ofthe big-six accounting firm types) to make sure that they weren't making abad move.andP;  Much to my caller's distress, the consultant warned that Unix isnot a stable operating system and therefore should not be used in commercialapplications development.andM;My caller wanted to know what he could do.andP;  Was this true?andP;  Was Unix unsafe?andM;I assured the caller that Unix was being successfully implemented in manycommercial organizations.andP;  I also told him that this was not the first timeI'd heard the claim the Unix was unstable.andP;  It comes up repeatedly amongconsultants who, because they are unfamiliar with Unix, base their judgementon rumor rather than research.andP;  Some of these consultants are caught offguard when customers start asking them about environments and operatingsystems they are unfamiliar with.andP;  They become uncomfortable.andP;  It is apsychological truism that people are uncomfortable with change.andP;  Most wouldprefer to remain with the systems and technology they have used for yearsthan to learn something new.andM;I'd like to set the record straight.andP;  All our modern operating systems havesome bugs--Unix, VMS, VM, MVS, OS/2, to mention a few.andP;  Every operatingsystem has some problems in some areas.andP;  Do IS professionals shy away fromMVS because of some anomalies?andP;  No.andP;  Users simply find work-arounds and geton with the job.andP;  So why all the fuss?andP;  I believe that it may be the resultof the politics of computer technology at work.andM;Over the past six months, we've been finding that the Unix operating systemis becoming much more stable and robust.andP;  ATandamp;T has done an excellent job ofimproving the quality and reliability of System V.4.andP;  Open SoftwareFoundation (OSF) members are working feverishly to bring OSF/1 to market.andO;Activity has never been so intense.andP;  The competition for the hearts and mindsof users has driven both organizations to try to out do each other.andP;  The samecannot be said of proprietary operating system efforts--with the notableexception of OS/2.andM;These are transitional, and therefore difficult, times for the computerindustry or users of technology.andP;  Users are confused about the myriad oftechnology coming at them from every angle.andP;  When they see a technology theylove, they are often at a loss to understand how they would implement it.andO;Computer vendors are eager to prove they are really open, but they only wantto sell their higher margin products.andP;  While users want the most advancedtechnology, they are frightened off by the price tag and base requirements(memory, etc.).andM;The bottom line is that users should not just accept the old myths aboutUnix.andP;  This second year of the '90s is a good time to ask for proof.andP;  Whenconsultants, vendors, or developers make claims about how the world reallyis, be skeptical.andP;  Make them prove their points.andP;  Make vendors show you howtheir technology will take you out of the mess you're in today and move youinto a more efficient mode.andP;  Make developers show you how their tools andapplications will solve your problems.andP;  When vendors talk aboutinteroperability and heterogeneous computing environments, make them show youhow these technologies will work together.andP;  Make consultants deal with thefacts, not the legends.andP;  Let's make 1991 the year when the user takes thelead.andP;  All players in the industry will benefit.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
