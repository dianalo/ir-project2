Summary of Petition</ITAG>The Cellulose Industry Standards Enforcement Program (``CISEP''), an industryassociation of cellulose insulation manufacturers, requested that the Commissionadopt a revised version of the blower cyclone shaker (``BCS'') settleddensity test procedure under andSection; 460.5(a)(2) of the Commission'sTrade Regulation Rule Concerning the Labeling and Advertising of Home Insulation(the ``R-value Rule'') 16 CFR Part 460.\1\<NOTE/> The revised procedure has been adopted by the American Societyof Testing and Materials (``ASTM'') in its ASTM C739-86 material standardfor cellulose insulation. The Commission tentatively has decided to adoptthe revised test procedure as a technical amendment to the R-value Rule,and solicits written public comments on this decision.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The request, plus attachments, has been placed on thepublic record as Doc. No. BB-2 in FTC File No. 215-59.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>The R-value of an insulation product is dependent upon its density andthickness. Loose-fill insulations normally settle, becoming more denseand less thick, after they are installed in an open space such as an attic.Therefore, andSection; 460.5(a)92) of the R-value Rule requires that teststo determine the R-value of loose-fill cellulose insulation be conductedon samples prepared at the product's ``settled density,'' <T3>i.e.</T3>, the density to which the product can be expected to settleover time. R-values and other coverage chart information on product labelsand fact sheets and in promotional materials must be for the product atits settled density and settled thickness.Section 460.5(a)(2) requires that manufacturers determine the settled densityof loose-fill cellulose insulation according to the settled density testprocedure required by Federal Specification HH-I-515D for loose-fill celluloseinsulation issued by the General Services Administration (``GSA''). Atthe time the Commission promulgated the Rule, the GSA specification requireduse of a settled density test commonly known as the ``Canadian drop boxtest,'' or ``drop box test.''GSA thereafter amended its specification to require use of a differentsettled density test commonly known as the ``blower cyclone shaker test,''or ``BCS,'' which had been developed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission(``CPSC'') for a safety standard it issued for cellulose insulation. Inan advisory opinion issued on September 25, 1980, the Commission announcedthat it would permit, but not require, the use of the BCS test procedurecontained in the amended GSA specification for compliance with andSection;460.5(a)(2) of the R-value Rule.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ During the original R-value rulemaking proceeding andsince the Rule has been in effect, the Commission and its staff have attemptedto make the R-value Rule's testing requirements consistent with those ofother federal agencies.More recently, GSA has been eliminating all of the Federal Specifications\3\<NOTE/> for insulation products, as ASTM issues complete materialspecifications for the products. GSA has eliminated Federal SpecificationHH-I-515 because ASTM issued C739-86. Instead, GSA regulations now citethe current version of the ASTM insulation specification for celluloseinsulation purchases by the Federal Government. Therefore, GSA has in effectaccepted the revised version of ASTM C739.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ GSA's Federal Specifications were issued as purchase specificationsfor purchases by the federal government or for use in programs financedby the federal government, such as in HUD financed housing. They were notmandatory material standards for other purposes.Both the Canadian drop box and the original BCS test procedures attemptto replicate actual long-term, on site measurements of settled densityin a laboratory setting. Under the Canadian drop box test procedure, settleddensity is determined by comparing the product's density as originallyinstalled (or ``blown'') and product settlement resulting from droppingtests and climatic cycling over a 28 day period. Under the BCS test procedure,settled density is determined by measuring the volumetric difference beforeand after applying concentrated vibration to a measured sample for approximatelyfive minutes.The Commission believes that most or all loose-fill cellulose insulationmanufacturers in the United States today use the BCS test procedure insteadof the Canadian drop box test procedure. The BCS procedure is much simplerto conduct and gives a result much faster, and thus is useful for on-goingquality control (``QC''). However, some cellulose manufacturers have arguedthat the original BCS test procedure results in a too dense result andthat the repeatability \4\<NOTE/> of the results between laboratories, and even within thesame laboratory, has been inadequate. Some manufacturers argue that thereason for these problems is that the original BCS procedure used a smallscale laboratory blowing machine to blow the sample at the beginning ofthe test, and that this small scale blower does not sufficiently breakup products that are particularly tightly packed by the manufacturer. Theyargue that the sample should be preblown using the same type of equipmentthat is used by installers in the field to replicate field applicationsmore closely. The major revision to the BCS test procedure in the revisedASTM C739-86 specification is the addition of this ``preblow'' step.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Repeatability refers to how closely the results of a testcan be repeated. Thus, repeatability helps assure that test results havevalue to consumers in comparing different products.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion of CISEP Request</ITAG>In support of its request, CISEP submitted test data that was preparedfor presentation at an ASTM C-16 \5\<NOTE/> meeting in October 1984. The data are for ``Round-Robin''tests conducted on loose-fill cellulose insulation samples produced especiallyfor the test round. The primary objectives of the Round-Robin were: (1)To determine whether the results of the BCS test were significantly affectedby how densely the insulation was bagged or compacted; and (2) if the resultswere significantly affected, to determine whether use of commercial blowingequipment (like that used to install insulation in the field) to prepare(<T3>i.e.,</T3> ``preblow'') the insulation sample for the settled densitytest procedure would significantly reduce differences in settled densityresults between separate tests.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The ASTM C-16 Committee is the committee that covers testand material specifications for insulation products.According to the petition, all the test samples were manufactured simultaneouslywith production equipment that had seven bagging outlets. Three of thebagger outlets produced the dense pack sample material, three outlets producedthe sample material that was loosely packed with a ram, and the seventhoutlet fed unbagged sample material into open boxes. The insulation sampleswere prepared in this manner in order to examine the first objective. Inorder to examine the second objective, bags of the prepared dense packand loose pack samples were then blown through a commercial blower andhopper to prepare control ``preblow'' samples from the dense pack and loosepack sample material. This preblow step was repeated by each of the participantsin the study, using their own blowing equipment, to prepare the remainingtwo samples.Insulation from each of the prepared samples was sent to 12 laboratories.\6\<NOTE/> The 12 laboratories participating were not informed thatthe samples they tested were identical in composition. Each laboratoryconducted five settled density tests on material from each of the sevendifferent samples.\7\<NOTE/> The report included in the CISEP request contains each separatetest result.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Eight of the laboratories were insulation manufacturers'sin-house laboratories, one was a manufacturer of fire-retardant chemicalsused by cellulose manufacturers, three were independent testing laboratories,and one was Oak Ridge National Laboratory.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Sample andplusmin;1 was the dense pack material; andplusmin;1Awas the dense pack material preblown with the participant's blower; andplusmin;4was the dense pack material preblown with the control blower; andplusmin;2was the loose packed material andplusmin;2A was the loose pack material preblownwith the participant's blower; andplusmin;5 was the loose pack material preblownwith the control blower; and andplusmin;3 was the unbagged material.Based on the results, CISEP asserts that the BCS settled density resultis directly related to the blown density that is determined at an earlierstage of the BCS procedure, and that the blown density result is stronglyaffected by the material's compaction in its packaging at the manufacturingplant. CISEP states that the variability (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the standard deviation) between the test results in itsstudy decreased with decreased initial compaction, going from the denselypacked material down through the unbagged material. CISEP also indicatedthat the variability of the results on prebagged samples decreased whenthe preblow step was added to the test procedure.CISEP argues that the preblow step at the beginning of the settled densitytest procedure, using the type of commercial blowing equipment used inthe field to install loose-fill cellulose, provides a necessary standardizedreference point to remove much of the variability in settled density testresults that is due to the material's compaction in bagging. In supportof this proposition, CISEP points to the reduction in the standard deviationof the test results in its study that occurred when the preblow step wasadded to the test procedure.Based on its results and on the acceptance of the revised test procedureas an ASTM standard, CISEP requests that the Commission adopt the revisedBCS test procedure in ASTM C739-86 for compliance by loose-fill cellulosemanufacturers with andSection; 460.5(a)(2) of the R-value Rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. The Commission's Decision</ITAG>The Commission is concerned that the Rule not have the undesirable effectof chilling advances in thermal testing technology, or for that matterin manufacturing and installation procedures. It therefore standards readyto consider seriously proposals to adapt the requirements of the Rule tochanging technology. In this case, the Commission believes that CISEP'sanalysis of the test results it submitted is accurate and that the resultsdemonstrate a decrease in the variability of the settled density resultsobtained after addition of the pre-blow step to the test procedure.\8\<NOTE/> Indeed, it appears that CISEP's data and analysis led toASTM's adoption of the pre-blow step to its standard. The Commission alsobelieves that improvements to the test procedures that reduce variabilitybenefit consumers and the industry and improve the Rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The Commission drawns no statistical conclusions aboutthe variability of the BCS test procedure based on the CISEP test results.Accordingly, the Commission has tentatively decided to adopt the revisedtest procedure as the only settled density test procedure allowed underandSection; 460.5(a)(2). In issuing the proposed amendment, the Commissionfinds that the revision to the BCS procedure adopted by ASTM in its C739-86specification is a technical or housekeeping change. The amendment, ifthe Commission makes it final, would require that all future settled densitytests by loose/fill cellulose manufacturers for compliance with the Rulebe conducted according to the ASTM C739-86 procedure. Manufacturers whohave not changed their products could continue to rely on their previousresults. To give all interested parties an opportunity to respond to the proposedamendment, the Commission will allow interested parties to submit writtenpublic comments on these two decisions for 60 days. The Commission willannounce its final decision and an effective date after reviewing the comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 460 </ITAG>Advertising, Insulation, Labeling, Trade practices.Accordingly, the Commission proposes to amend 16 CFR Part 460 to read asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 460_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
