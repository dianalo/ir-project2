However, theConstitution is silent regarding any sort of protection for trademarks.andM;This omission did not deter Congress from acting in response to pressure fromanxious commercial interests.andP;  That body first attempted to legislate asystem that in essence extended patent protection to trademarks.andP;  In 1879 itdidn't require much of a strict constructionist bent for the Justices of theSupreme Court to point out the obvious: &quot;The ordinary trade-mark has nonecessary relation to invention or discovery&quot;, nor can it be classified underthe head of writings of authors&quot;.andP;  In other words, forget the Science andArts Clause as a Constitutional peg on which to hang Congressional protectionfor this category of intellectual property.andM;Providentially for the concerned business enterprises, the Framers saw fit toconfer authority upon Congress elsewhere in Article 1, section 8 &quot;To regulateCommerceandM;among the several States&quot;.andP;  Only the First (freedom of speech, press, andreligion) and Fourteenth (due process, equal protection of law) Amendmentsrival this simple language contained in the Commerce Clause for the sheervolume of litigation-and Supreme Court decisions-they have generated.andM;In the case of the Commerce Clause, it's easy to see why strictconstructionists face an uphill battle.andP;  Nowhere in the Constitution do theFramers define what they mean by commerce among the states&quot;-a phrase nowencompassed by the legal term, interstate commerce.andP;  As early as 1798, whenNew York began its attempts to confer upon Robert Fulton and his associatethe exclusive rights to operate steamships on its waterways, the controversyover the interpretation to be given the Constitution's reference tointerstate commerce started up the judicial ladder towards the Supreme Court.andO;A series of landmark decisions resulted-many authored by Chief Justice JohnMarshall-which law students still pore over today.andM;Throughout the greater part of the 19th Century, the Supreme Court's approachto defining interstate commerce was consistent with Marshall's 1821 assertionin Cohens vs.andP;  Virginia that commercially we are one nation&quot;.andP;  This broadinterpretation of the Constitution's sketchy language suited the country'sburgeoning commercial sector just fine, because it had the effect of denyingthe states the authority to place legislative curbs on business activities.andM;Toward the end of the century, however, the pendulum began to swing in theother direction.andP;  Now it was the federal government's intervention thatthreatened the nation's business interests, as they saw it, by concoctingsuch schemes as antitrust laws.andP;  A basically pro-business Court responded bynarrowing the definition of commerce&quot;.andP;  (For a previous discussion of this,see Vol.andP;  7 No.andP;  5.)andM;But in one area, at least, the country's merchandisers desperately wantedfederal intervention, and that area consisted of protection for trademarks.andO;If the Science and Arts Clause couldn't serve this purpose, perhaps theCommerce Clause would.andP;  As it turned out, this view proved correct.andP;  Over thefollowing half century, the Supreme Court gradually mellowed in its antipathyto government involvement in the nation's business affairs.andP;  In the realm oftrademarks, the result was the present dual system of federal and statelegislation, that apply respectively according to whether the product orservice with which a mark is associated can legally be deemed to constitutepart of the stream of interstate commerce.andM;In case some readers are wondering at this point why all this should matterto creators of software, let me make reference to a recent example.andP;  InSeptember 1989, Adobe Systems Inc. filed suit in federal court againstPrintware Inc., claiming that the marketing of Printware's Printscriptprogram infringed on Adobe's trademark on its Postscript software.andP;  We don'tusually think of a trademark as providing protection for a product in thesame fashion as a copyright or patent and, technically speaking, it doesn't.andO;But when it comes down to the marketing of software products designed toachieve essentially similar results, this becomes a distinction withoutdifference.andP;  Trademarks are no longer mere peripheral aspects of intellectualproperty protection, at least not as far as the computing industry isconcerned.andM;Unfortunately, trademarks comprise one of the most complicated areas in theamorphous terrain we have labeled &quot;intellectual property&quot;.andP;  To illustrate,let me quote the chairman of the California Bar's intellectual PropertySection:andM;Unlike patent and copyrightandM;law, trademark law.andP;  .  .  involvesandM;state law.andP;  .  .. It does also involveandM;the federal trademark statute ...andM;and proceedings in the USandM;District Courts for infringementandM;of federally registeredandM;trademarks.andP;  There are additionalandM;practice regions which fringe onandM;trademark law not strictlyandM;involving trademark disputes,andM;e.g., antidilution law, passing-offandM;cases, false designation ofandM;origin, and counterfeiting.andM;In other words, when we mention &quot;trademark&quot; in the same breath as copyright&quot;or &quot;patent&quot;, we're just touching the tip of a very large iceberg ofcommercial rights that defy categorization.andM;This is why the vast majority of lawyers deem it best to leave trademarkmatters to practitioners who concentrate exclusively on this arcane area.andO;That said, we will now plunge in where angels would hesitate-with theunderstanding, I trust, that what follows will of necessity be a highlysimplified discussion.andM;For roughly forty years, the federal law applying to use of trademarks ininterstate commerce has been the 1946 Lanham Act.andP;  However, Congress recentlyamended this trademark law, as it did the copyright law, so that it wouldcorrespond more closely to laws in other countries.andP;  The new enactment,officially titled the Trademark Law Revision Act, went into effect November16, 1989.andP;  it retains the basic features of the Lanham Act but for the firsttime in the US permits enterprises to reserve prospective trademarks withoutfirst having used them in domestic interstate commerce, or having applied fortheir registration in foreign countries.andP;  All that's required is anapplication stating that there's a &quot;bona fide intent&quot; to use a mark (ofcourse, the mark still has to satisfy the numerous technical requirements forregistration as a trademark) .andM;Exactly what this change will mean in practice is the subject of considerabledisagreement.andP;  Some have predicted that aggressive companies will now be ableto gain marketing advantages by  bottling up&quot; scores of names for newproducts, whether or not they really intend to use them.andP;  Others point toprovisions of the law that are</TEXT></DOC>
