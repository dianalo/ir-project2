Yet despite an occupancy rate about 80% almost from its opening day two years ago, the operator of the 384-room Radisson Plaza is far behind in his rent payments and other operating expenses. If it is making money, the roughly 6,000 investors in the $70 million Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. partnership aren't seeing any of it.    Brokerage-industry officials conceded recently that $5 billion to $10 billion, and probably much more, of the $100 billion of limited-partnership investments marketed publicly in recent years are in trouble. Until lately, they have blamed regional economic problems, most evident in real-estate partnerships, and the 1986 tax overhaul that took away crucial tax benefits of many partnership investments.    In fact, the new law merely unmasked many deals as solely tax-motivated. Other deals, investors complain, were poorly conceived or structured. And now thousands of investors face heavy losses.    The debacle illustrates how Wall Street can stub its toe when trying to sell products besides stocks and bonds. Many brokers complain that their bosses pushed them to sell questionable partnerships -- in many cases, slighting their fiduciary responsibility to investors. Several present and former Shearson brokers say their bosses warned them not to waste time reading prospectuses, time that would be better spent selling to clients.    However, Stephen H. Silverstein, Shearson's top real-estate and limited-partnership official, remarks: &quot;My experience is that there are a number of brokers who read the prospectus and communicate the risks to clients.&quot; He adds that if brokers don't do that, they're &quot;not doing their job for the client.&quot;    Not that Mr. Silverstein has unqualified sympathy for investors. He finds it &quot;somewhat fascinating&quot; when they blame brokerage firms for disappointing investments. &quot;The risk is specified in the {partnership} agreement,&quot; he says. He also notes that unlike many stocks, a partnership investment takes years to either succeed or fail and can be difficult to sell off; so, he says, a partnership that flounders seems worse because it's a &quot;continued irritant&quot; to an investor.    Still, he concedes: &quot;Being a Monday-morning quarterback, there are probably investment opportunities that all of us have made available that, based on hindsight, based on a lot of factors, we may have decided to do differently.&quot;    Though Shearson is hardly the only big Wall Street firm with partnership woes, it is the most prominent. E.F. Hutton Group, which Shearson absorbed in 1987, was a major seller of partnerships, and last year the combined Shearson Lehman Hutton led the securities industry by raising $1.4 billion through partnership syndications. In addition, some of the most publicized partnership troubles have been at Shearson's Balcor Co.; the real-estate unit, headed by Mr. Silverstein and based in Skokie, Ill., recently decided to get out of the partnership game.    Shearson, a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co., acknowledges setting aside reserves for partnerships that are going bad, even though its officials say they can't be expected to inject capital into every one that sours. Industry officials estimate the reserves at nearly $200 million; Shearson declines to confirm that figure.    In any event, Wall Street clearly is facing years of partnership headaches, including the growing bitterness of brokers who sold investors on partnerships that later crumbled. Many frustrated brokers are surprisingly candid. Fred Sanderson, a 66-year-old broker at First Affiliated Securities in Newton, Kan., says he gets &quot;very angry&quot; about the thousands of dollars his clients lost. While at another firm, he says, &quot;I did such a disservice in selling so many limited partnerships. I don't think these things should ever have been sold.&quot;    Says Irwin Stein, a San Francisco plaintiffs lawyer who predicts a wave of investor lawsuits: &quot;The industry deserves everything it gets.&quot;    Regulators are just waking up to the extent of the problem. In California, where blue-sky laws certifying new partnership offerings for sale are unusually tough, a third of investors' complaints lodged with the Department of Corporations allege that the general partners illegally commingled funds. Many of the syndicators took cash out of profitable partnerships to prop up failing ones, the department's investigators say. Eventually, most of them crashed.    &quot;If it's a clean, provable case, we take it to the district attorney to prosecute for grand theft and illegal sale of securities,&quot; says Irwin Fisk, the chief investigator in the department's Southern California office. He says that &quot;we see maybe 50&quot; cases of allegedly commingled funds a year, many of which &quot;result in prosecutions and, usually, in convictions.&quot; But often, he laments, &quot;the general partners' right to move money around is written into the partnership agreement. That's a crazy thing to sign, but investors don't read it.&quot;    The Manhattan Beach Radisson exemplifies what can go wrong with a partnership investment and why limited partners often don't smell trouble until it is too late. Radisson Plaza investors are still getting quarterly income checks, but, unbeknown to most of them, the payments aren't coming from the $145 a night that guests pay for rooms overlooking the golf course or for drinks and dinners.    Instead, Horst Osterkamp, the flamboyant German hotelier from whom Shearson bought the Radisson in 1987 and kept on to run it, is $3.2 million -- more than six months -- behind in rent owed to the partnership and $500,000 in rent penalties, real-estate taxes and legal expenses. The payments to investors are coming out of a rapidly dwindling $9.5 million letter of credit that Shearson got from Mr. Osterkamp in case of just such problems. Shearson is scrambling to extricate itself from a 30-year, sale-leaseback arrangement with Mr. Osterkamp before the funds run out.    Shearson also is seeking to replace him as manager. Mr. Silverstein confirms that talks are going on &quot;to possibly modify {Mr. Osterkamp's} management of the property,&quot; but he won't be specific. The 49-year-old Mr. Osterkamp agreed to be interviewed for this article but then failed to answer repeated attempts to set up a meeting. His lawyer, John Child, blames his problems at the Radisson on room rates that &quot;haven't reached expectations of any of the parties.&quot;    Helping force the issue is feisty Local 814 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union, which has represented Radisson Plaza workers without a contract since last November and has picketed the hotel and Shearson's downtown Los Angeles office. In April, it also appealed directly to Radisson investors. Buying a large ad in The Wall Street Journal, the union detailed &quot;a web of financial and legal crises&quot; entangling Mr. Osterkamp. Among other things, it noted that six of his other hotels had sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, and two more were in foreclosure.    Local newspapers chimed in and began listing the debts directly related to the Radisson, including $1.7 million in unpaid federal and state payroll taxes. A few weeks later, Shearson filed the partnership's annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosing several of the Radisson Plaza's longstanding problems for the first time. For example, the filing revealed that the hotel's liquor licensee, a company formed by Mr. Osterkamp, had filed for Chapter 11 protection the previous August -- more than eight months earlier. The hotel continues to serve drinks only on temporary, short-term permits.    The securities firm contends that the Radisson's overdue operating expenses are the sole responsibility of Mr. Osterkamp, the tenant, and not the partnership, the landlord. Moreover, the hotel itself, purchased for $56.5 million cash, isn't burdened with mortgage debt, as is so much other real estate owned by struggling limited partnerships.    Says Linda Miller, a Shearson executive vice president who put together the Radisson deal, &quot;We have some serious operational problems, but they are short-term and I believe solvable&quot; if Mr. Osterkamp is removed. She adds that when the firm asked him this spring whether he was diverting the hotel's profits, &quot;his lawyer looked our lawyer in the eye&quot; and said no. In May, however, Shearson ordered an outside audit of the Radisson's books by Kenneth Leventhal andamp; Co. on the partnership's behalf. The audit showed, according to a Shearson report filed recently with the SEC, that Mr. Osterkamp is &quot;experiencing substantial financial difficulties&quot; and that the Radisson's &quot;current level of net operating income&quot; is insufficient to cover the rent as it becomes due.    Shearson also warned of the potential drain on Radisson investors' funds if it takes a court battle to replace Mr. Osterkamp. Upset by the bad publicity, Minneapolis-based Carlson Cos., which franchises Radissons, may step in. But, says Juergen Bartels, the head of Carlson's hotel division and a longtime friend of Mr. Osterkamp, &quot;we wouldn't do something {to go} around the current management.&quot;    Any legal fight would almost certainly embroil J. Ronald Getty, another close friend of Mr. Osterkamp. The reclusive son of the late billionaire J. Paul Getty guaranteed Mr. Osterkamp's financial obligations under the Radisson lease. (However, the guarantee, which was explained in the prospectus for the Radisson partnership offering, included the disclaimer that the guarantee might not be honored in all cases.)    The two men became business partners in 1974, when they began forming private partnerships to invest in financially troubled, generally rather small Sheratons and Holiday Inns located from Ohio west to Oklahoma, Texas and California.    Later, they rolled the partnerships up into two large ones, with their company, U.S. Hotel Properties Corp., as general partner. Tax losses from the struggling hotels were then sold off to new investors.    Shearson, which took more than a year to orchestrate the Radisson partnership agreement, apparently failed to uncover the extent of Mr. Osterkamp's poor track record in previous hotel deals. By that time, at least four hotels managed by Mr. Osterkamp for U.S. Hotel Properties were in foreclosure, two of his former aides say. They add that even as Shearson was negotiating with him to buy the Radisson Plaza, black-suited federal tax authorities were camped in the hotel's bar, collecting bar receipts to pay thousands of dollars in back payroll taxes.    More than four months after the November 1987 offering, the firm issued a supplement to the prospectus further illuminating U.S. Hotel Properties' poor track record. In light of the new information, investors already in for a minimum of $5,000 got two weeks to back out.    Still smarting from the stock-market crash, some buyers were attracted by the sales pitch from Michael Finizio, a Shearson broker in Woodland Hills, Calif. In a letter to clients, Mr. Finizio described the Radisson as a &quot;guaranteed real-estate program&quot; offering a 9% annual return.    He persuaded Michigan investor Murray Bourassa, a retired construction-site inspector, to borrow $5,000 against some mutual-fund shares to buy in. A friend of Mr. Bourassa's borrowed $80,000 of her own and margined $50,000 of her mother's securities to buy interests. The loans' variable interest rate, then 8.75%, has soared to 13%, leaving an ever-widening deficit. Complains Mr. Bourassa bitterly, &quot;They painted a rosy picture, said we couldn't lose.&quot;    Mr. Finizio declines comment, but Shearson's Ms. Miller defends its due diligence -- its exercise of fiduciary responsibility to investors -- in looking into Mr. Osterkamp's checkered financial past. &quot;His business was buying distressed hotels,&quot; which is a high-risk business, she snaps, explaining Shearson's involvement with him. As for the partnership's prognosis, the Radisson hotel's location and amenities make it &quot;an irreplaceable asset&quot; that should appreciate handsomely, she says.    In coming years, scores of lawsuits are expected because of such alleged problems, though how much success investors will have can't be foretold. One frustrating problem for investors is that they face as many difficulties suing their brokers as they had with their partnerships.    For example, Richard M. Griest, a Sparks, Nev., investor, has been trying for months to launch a class-action lawsuit against an $82 million Balcor real-estate partnership, in which partnership interests have recently traded in the secondary market at 20 cents on the dollar. But he can't obtain a list of other limited partners; he says he needs at least a few other names to get a lawsuit started.    He says the law in Illinois, where Balcor is based, requires that such names be furnished. But Balcor, in a June 13 letter, told Mr. Griest that he couldn't have them because the partnership agreement says they must be provided for &quot;any proper purpose.&quot; Balcor's lawyers say &quot;litigation purposes&quot; aren't proper. </TEXT></DOC>
