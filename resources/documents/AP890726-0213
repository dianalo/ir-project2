Castro said that although the socialist world _ particularlySoviet bloc nations _ faces serious difficulties, the United Stateswill be no more successful in creating a global empire than wasHitler.   ``Imperialist circles are dreaming about an empire of 1,000years, as in his times Adolf Hitler dreamed,'' Castro said,addressing a crowd of tens of thousands of rain-soaked listeners.   The Cuban people have overcome difficulties before and cansurvive any challenge the United States might pose, be it a war ofattrition, an occupation, an invasion, or a total blockade, Castrosaid.   The occasion for Castro's speech was the 36th anniversary of hisdebut as a guerrilla fighter. Cubans packed Camaguey plaza to heartheir revolutionary leader.   Rain fell during much of his speech, which lasted one hour and50 minutes and was one of the briefest he has delivered at such aceremony.   Castro was not protected against the rain, and his greenmilitary uniform was soaked through by the time he finished.   Castro was sharply critical of President Bush, ridiculing his``triumphant'' attitude concerning difficulties the socialist causeis now experiencing.   Castro warned of an American effort to ``recolonialize'' theworld in the event of the complete demise of socialism.   During Bush's visit to Poland, placards appeared in crowds thatgreeted Bush, saying ``The best communist is a dead communist,''Castro said.   He described this sentiment as ``fascist'' and said thatsocialism's enemies ``should know that we communists won't letourselves be killed easily.'' The remark was received with longapplause.   Castro raised the possibility that his countrymen might somedaywake up and learn that a civil war has broken out in the SovietUnion or that the country has disintegrated altogether.   ``In this event, Cuba will continue fighting and will continuestruggling,'' he said.   He recounted the drift toward capitalism in Poland, reflected inrecent electoral setbacks for Communist Party candidates.   He suggested that perhaps it would be a good thing for Polishyouth to know how ``egotistical, brutal and inhuman'' capitalisticsocieties are.   It was Castro's first public speech since the execution twoweeks ago of an honored comrade and three other military officerson corruption charges, but he made no reference to the scandal.   The speech marked July 26, 1953, when the young Castro led anattack on a military barracks that launched his long campaignagainst dictator Fulgencio Batista, who fled the island on Jan. 1,1959.   President Castro uses each anniversary for a major address.Interest was heightened this year by the trials of the fourhigh-ranking officers.   They were convicted of drug smuggling and other offenses in thebiggest corruption scandal of Castro's time in power.   Among them was Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, who was with Castro from thebeginning and was made a Hero of the Revolution for his performanceas a commander of Cuban expeditionary forces in Africa. Lessersentences were given to several other officials.   Except for a speech to the Council of State last month, excerptsof which have been made public, Castro generally has been silent onthe subject.   Lower-ranking officials who met with reporters Tuesday, however,made a favorable comparison between Cuba's record in combattingdrug smugglers with that of the United States.   Castro, who will be 63 next month, toured the area aroundCamaguey on Tuesday, visiting projects built since thisagricultural center 300 miles west of Havana was chosen for thisyear's July 26 festivities.</TEXT></DOC>
