The discussion includes real trade issues and internationalmonetary considerations or financial considerations, emphasizing therelationship between the two. Included in the discussion of internationalmonetary considerations are the causes, consequences, and resolutionof six historical financial crises which are used as analogues for planningfor restoration of the international monetary system. Additionally, thefoundation of the multinational enterprise and its possible roles inrecovery are addressed. Although the report addresses several specificdisaster scenarios and appropriate policy responses in reaction to them,a number of important general policy guidelines were discussed. First,international cooperation and coordination are of paramount importancein restoring the effective functioning of the international monetarysystem. Second, a policy of fixed exchange rates in the aftermath ofan international disaster is ill-advised. Third, except for commoditiescrucial to national defense, domestic import and export controls cannotbe justified. Fourth, the extent of real trade reduction during a conflicthas widespread financial---as well as real---repercussions. The UnitedStates probably could withstand real trade disruptions during a conflictmore successfully than many of its current trading partners. Finally,multinational enterprises might be important institutions in recoveryfrom both real and monetary standpoints, acting as the internationalconduit for capital flows, trade flows, and in more serious disasters,price signals and international monetary and financial reconstruction.91 refs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
