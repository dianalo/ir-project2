The data are useful for investigatingthe performance and cost of drinking-water-treatment process systems.In order to perform multiple and/or extensive evaluations of this data,it was necessary to develop a computer-based information-retrieval systemthat would provide a consistent-input data format and the capabilityto manage, access, and report required information. The computer softwareresulting from this effort has provided DWRD with an effective methodfor analyzing large amounts of field-scale research data and providingideas to upgrade water quality.</TEXT></DOC>
