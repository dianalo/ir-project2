(TCTC)of Charlotte, N.C., acknowledged that he sold millions of dollars worth ofcomputer equipment to South Africa last year, including Macs and other Appleproducts.andM;Under U.S.andP;  law, American companies may export computers to South Africa, butnot to apartheid agencies such as the military or police.andP;  In addition, adealer selling Mac II, Mac IIx and Mac IIcx systems must obtain a specialexport license because their 32-bit architecture has potential military use.andM;Buckner denied any violation of U.S.andP;  law.andP;  TCTC has an associate company inSouth Africa that makes sure that the &quot;products are handled in the correctway,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We will not supply to anybody in South Africa without properverification of who the end user will be.&quot;andM;Rich Karakis, who as dealer development manager heads up Apple's efforts tostop U.S.andP;  gray marketing, said neither Punchline nor TCTC are authorizedApple dealers -- and therefore shouldn't be selling Macs either in the UnitedStates or in South Africa.andM;Karakis described Apple's standard method for stopping gray marketers: Applebuys a gray market computer, traces the serial number and then contacts theauthorized dealer who made the sale.andP;  Apple could then cancel its contractwith the authorized dealer.andM;Karakis, however, made no specific commitment to track down how Punchline andTCTC get their Macs.andM;Most anti-apartheid activists here call on U.S.andP;  companies like Apple tostrengthen their enforcement of sanctions to stop such imports.andP;  But stemmingthe gray mar-ket flow into South Africa isn't easy.andP;  Apple must policethousands of computer outlets in the United States and even more overseas.andO;Gajjar, the Capetown dealer and an opponent of apartheid, argues thatsanctions on computers will never work.andM;&quot;Sanctions and disinvestment may have been a correct decision two or threeyears ago,&quot; he said, &quot;but we don't agree with blanket sanctions anymore.andO;They do not prevent the goods reaching the South African market.&quot;andM;Gajjar argued that Apple and other U.S.andP;  computer companies should insteadaward franchises to black-owned businesses in order to promote black economicempowerment.andP;  Capetown's HNR, for example, is now the sole South Africandistributor for WordPerfect.andP;  White-owned computer companies must come to HNRto legally buy that highly popular program.andP;  HNR plans to provide computertraining to the Capetown black and Asian communities.andM;Corey Freebairn, WordPerfect's international marketing coordinator in Orem,Utah, said his company found it impossible to stop gray marketing.andP;  By givingthe franchise to HNR, WordPerfect once again has access to the lucrativeSouth African market.andP;  The parent company can also more closely control whothe end user will be -- and at the same time help a black-owned company.andM;Unfortunately, there are only two black-owned computer companies in all ofSouth Africa.andP;  So some anti-apartheid leaders view Gajjar's alternative withskepticism.andP;  Leaders of the South African Council of Churches asked how U.S.andO;companies could prevent white South Africans from setting up front companiesand thus undercut sanctions.andM;Azhar Cachalia, national treasurer of the United Democratic Front, thecountry's largest and most respected anti-apartheid organization, said he hasno objection to U.S.andP;  investment in South Africa &quot;provided it is done withthe consent of the democratic movement.andP;  We would, however, have a problemwhere investment goes to certain groups of black people, where that is notused as a means of political pressure.&quot;andM;Cachalia admitted that computer sanctions have not worked, but he said thatis because companies such as Apple don't apply their policies vigorously.andO;Combined with other pressures, he said, sanctions have indeed weakened theregime, in part by driving up prices for imports and thus adding to thegovernment's multibillion-dollar foreign debt and making it potentially moresusceptible to pressure for reform from the international community.andM;Last week, Apple made the news by donating Macs and other equipment to amultiracial group of South Africans who plan to use the systems to desktoppublish an independent, uncensored weekly (see MacWEEK, Sept.andP;  19).andM;As yet, however, the company has made no commitment to enforce its ownsanctions more vigorously or to negotiate with anti-apartheid leaders toimplement Gajjar's franchise plan.andP;  n</TEXT></DOC>
