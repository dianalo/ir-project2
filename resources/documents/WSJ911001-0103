A few years ago, such a joke would have been consideredunpatriotic. After all, Brazil has long been known as theland of the future, a new frontier. It's a country whosecitizens express their deep love for it with theuntranslatable Portuguese word that expresses simultaneouslyhomesickness, yearning and nostalgia: saudade, pronouncedSOW-dad-gee.</LP><TEXT>   But today, risking deep saudades, an increasing number ofBrazilians are packing up and saying goodbye to Brazil, oftenfor good. The phenomenom marks a reversal of the immigrationtrend that made Brazil one of the world's most ethnicallydiverse nations. While the trend is still nascent, it's takenon such importance that it was the subject of an August coverstory in Brazil's biggest newsweekly, Veja, under theheadline: &quot;The great exodus.&quot;   With inflation at 15% a month, the economy in recession,the infrastructure, health and education near the breakingpoint, and urban violence widespread, the wave of emigrantsis indicative of a deepening sense of gloom about thecountry's future. &quot;The idea of emigration is becoming acollective idea,&quot; says sociologist Helio Jaguaribe. &quot;There'sa growing feeling that this country is threatened with a verylong crisis. What's worrying is not so much that people arethinking of leaving, it's that they are right to think ofleaving.&quot;   Estimates of the number of Brazilians living abroad,mostly in the U.S., Japan, Italy and Portugal, are sketchy,ranging from 630,000 to 1.4 million out of a total populationof about 150 million. But what's certain is that the numberof people leaving is rising markedly. The Japanese consulatein Sao Paulo says the number of people requesting visas hasshot up to 48,189 in 1990 from 5,842 in 1987 -- and by Augustof this year alone had reached 47,132. Most of those leaving,a consulate official says, are descendants of Japanese whocame to Brazil three generations ago and are looking for workin the land of their forefathers.   Many emigrants, of course, hope to return to Brazil.Edilberto Martins, the 42-year-old editor of the Brazilians,a New York-based bilingual monthly about Brazil whosecirculation has doubled to 45,000 in the past four years,says he, like a majority of the estimated 330,000 Braziliansin the U.S., would &quot;return yesterday&quot; if conditionspermitted.   &quot;Almost everyone wants to return,&quot; he says. &quot;People comehere seeking ways to create a future in Brazil, seekingknowledge and enough money to return. We all have our headsand hearts in Brazil.&quot; Despite all its woes, he says, &quot;Brazilis the most marvelous country in the world. It just has aproblem of management.&quot;   But to many in Brazil, Mr. Martins' vision is romantic andtainted by distance. &quot;For everyone now, it's becoming everyday more unpleasant to live in Brazil,&quot; says politicalscientist Luciano Martins. Indeed, as many Braziliansemigrate, the country is losing many of its best brains andtalents, further compromising its chances of emerging fromits crisis.   Most of Brazil's soccer stars play in Europe. Musicianslike Antonio Carlos Jobim, composer of &quot;The Girl fromIpanema,&quot; spend most of their time in the U.S., as do theaterdirectors like Caca Rosset, who recently won over New Yorkwith his production of Shakespeare's &quot;A Midsummer Night'sDream.&quot; Brazil's biggest television star, the hostess of adaily children's program called Xuxa, shocked the countrylast month by saying that, after being the target of a failedkidnapping attempt, she wants to give up her show and spendmore time abroad. &quot;I speak to give people hope, but hope inwhat?&quot; she says.   More ominously, the trend is hitting Brazil's academic andbusiness elite. So few recipients of overseas scholarshipsreturn home that the National Council for Scientific andTechnological Development provides financial incentives toattract them. Top businessman Luis Octavio da Motta Veiga,who quit last year as chairman of state-owned oil giantPetrobras after a fight with the government, is now anexecutive for Rayner Coffee International in London.   A 48-year-old Sao Paulo businessman who owns a largeagro-industrial company says he is leaving the countrybecause of widespread corruption in Brazilian business.&quot;There's no future here,&quot; says the businessman, who requestsanonymity. &quot;I'm not worried about the year 2020. I'm worriedabout the next decade. It's absolutely tragic that a countryof {such} potential could come to this.&quot;   A similarly gloomy outlook led Luis Carlos MansurBaptista, 28, to decide to leave. A talented journalist andacademic, Mr. Baptista, whose wife is Portuguese, got himselfa Portuguese passport and left recently for Lisbon. &quot;I likeBrazil, but there are no conditions here for things toimprove,&quot; he said on the eve of his departure.   Mr. Baptista says his academic goals were compromised bythe country's neglect of education. &quot;There's all this talk ofmaking Brazil a First World country, but they aren'tinvesting in the most vital thing to achieve this:education,&quot; he says. &quot;I had a secure job {in Brazil}, buteverything else is uncertain. There's always a risk of aneconomic shock; the streets are terribly unsafe. It will takeme a while to get used to not taking off my wedding bandbefore boarding a bus or not seeing prices rise every week.&quot;   Won't he have saudades though? &quot;All Brazil has to offernow is samba, cachaca (an alcoholic beverage) and soccer,&quot; hesays. &quot;I'm not crazy about samba or cachaca, and we're noteven good at soccer anymore.&quot;   The following day, at the airport, his wife, Teresa, is intears as she bids farewell to her friends. Mr. Baptista isall smiles as he goes through the passport line and, withouta look back, boards the flight to a new life.</TEXT></DOC>
