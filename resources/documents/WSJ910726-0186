Unfortunatelyfor that idea, people have different beliefs of what moralvalues are.

Reasonable peopleof good will differ categorically on this subject on moralgrounds.   Let's stick with freedom, which enough of us have thoughtsufficiently well of to die for, and restriction of thenatural tyranny of government, which is what law is allabout.   Herbert E. Bixler   Jaffrey, N.H.   ---   I've been reading Judge Thomas's writings and monitoringthe reaction to his nomination in the press. The latter hasfallen into the tired and misleading dichotomy of born-againliberals insisting on renewed deference to precedent, andBeltway conservatives demanding increased deference to theexecutive and legislative branches.   Prof. Macedo has framed the issues more usefully. Heemphasizes that Judge Thomas's devotion to natural lawprovides him with exactly what the court now needs: someonewho, in accord with the Framers themselves, recognizes anobjective set of transcendent moral principles (life, libertyand the pursuit of happiness) that provides an objectiveauthority for constitutional interpretation. This will enablehim to rein in the tyranny of majorities and custom, whileavoiding the judicial tyranny that results from having no wayto articulate individual rights, however valid in themselves,other than by conjuring them out of whatever &quot;penumbras andemanations&quot; are available to him.   I may suggest in addition that anyone who thinks JudgeThomas's Catholic background will lead him to &quot;impose hismorality on us&quot; (as liberals express their own version ofBorkian nihilism) is simply ignorant of the rich tradition ofAugustinian thought on just this issue (the prudential limitsof morally informed decision making), which that backgroundmakes available to him. A reading of Graham Walker's &quot;MoralFoundations of Constitutional Thought: Current Problems,Augustinian Prospects&quot; (Oxford, 1990) should proveenlightening on this question.   Far from being a disqualification, Judge Thomas'snatural-law perspective is precisely his greatest asset.   James J. O'Meara   New York   ---   By Mr. Macedo's reckoning, all the Framers of theConstitution needed to do was create the federal judiciaryand then pack their bags and head home. The judges would fillin all the other fine points of republican government.   Facts alone dispel Mr. Macedo's main contention. If thecourts were intended to have such enormous weight -- diviningand declaring the higher law in the concrete cases andcontroversies that come before them -- it is surely odd thatthe Constitution does not bother to create them. Article IIIprovides only that there be one Supreme Court; further, thatthere be only one chief justice of the United States. Beyondthat slender skeleton, there is no more. Congress is left tocreate or not create &quot;inferior courts&quot; as it sees fit; it isalso given the power to determine the number of justices onthe Supreme Court.   But that is not the most telling fact. By the Framers'prudent design, the Supreme Court is explicitly given only asmall sliver of power -- its original jurisdiction. Beyondthat, the appellate jurisdiction is subject to whateverexceptions Congress shall see fit to impose. Beyond that, thecourts generally are subject to whatever rules and proceduresthe legislature thinks appropriate. In short, theConstitution creates judicial power, but leaves it toCongress -- and to the discretion of those majorities Mr.Macedo so distrusts -- to fashion and regulate the judicialprocess.   Whether one agrees with the Constitution's design on thesematters is beside the instant point. But one cannot deny thatthese are pretty meager grants of power for an institutionthat now possesses the broad moral authority Mr. Macedo andperhaps Judge Thomas attribute to it.   Should the view of the court that Mr. Macedo and hisfellow libertarians (let's be honest: They are notconservatives in any traditional sense) celebrate ever beallowed to gain credibility, we can kiss popular, republicanconstitutional government goodbye.
