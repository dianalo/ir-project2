Klein</HL><DD> 04/28/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   In &quot;Rashomon,&quot; several witnesses give different accounts of a crime at a bandit's trial. This spring's crop of baseball books features similarly diverse perspectives on the New York Mets' 1986 championship season. Call them, collectively, Rashomet.    Just about everyone connected with the mighty Mets who didn't have a book last year has one this year. New entries include Ralph Kiner and Tim McCarver, the team's broadcasters, catcher Gary Carter and rookie centerfielder Lenny Dykstra, of all people.    The good news is that, in their lust to print anything connected with New York sports, the New York publishers have about exhausted the list of possible Met subjects. I think Rafael Santana and Tim Teufel are the only team members who haven't produced jockographies. Look for theirs next year. Suggested titles: &quot;Santana!&quot; and &quot;Tim Talks.&quot;    Not surprisingly, the best of the current Met books has the least to say about the team's '86 exploits, which were covered more extensively than any event since, and possibly including, World War II.    &quot;Kiner's Korner: At Bat and on the Air -- My 40 Years in Baseball&quot; (Arbor House, 239 pages, $16.95), by Big Ralph with Joe Gergen, is a nice collection of stories about the old slugger's careers on and off the diamond, told with columnist Gergen's wry touch. A lot of them aren't about baseball. Didja know that movie star Esther Williams once skinny dipped in Kiner's home pool in Palm Springs, Calif.? &quot;Best backstroke I've ever seen,&quot; observed Kiner.    &quot;Oh, Baby, I Love It!&quot; (Villard Books, 245 pages, $16.95), by Tim McCarver with Ray Robinson, is an odd batch of reminiscences, Met anecdotes, lists and opinions by another ex-jock in the Mets' booth. As a broadcaster, McCarver has been hailed as the greatest thing since poached eggs, but you can't prove it by me. If he can quote Shakespeare, as the book's jacket claims, why couldn't he write his own book?    &quot;A Dream Season&quot; (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 210 pages, $15.95), by Gary Carter and John Hough Jr., is straightforward baseball stuff. You can get it for your kids, because Carter says he loves God, his wife and children, and playing baseball, and uses decent language. That's more than you can say about &quot;Nails: The Inside Story of an Amazin' Season&quot; (Doubleday, $15.95) by Dykstra, with Marty Noble. If you took the four-letter words out of this silly book, it would run about 150 pages instead of 215.    Publishers realize that not everyone loves the Mets, so they have thoughtfully put out some books about a team farther west: the Yankees. As befits this gang's so-so status in the standings in recent years, these efforts focus on the past. You well might ask what there is left to say about Yankee history. The answer is not much. But it's said anyway.    &quot;I'd Rather be a Yankee: An Oral History of America's Most Loved and Most Hated Baseball Team&quot; (Macmillan, 364 pages, $19.95), by John Tullius, is gathered from interviews and archives. History buffs might like it.    &quot;Explosion! Mickey Mantle's Legendary Home Runs&quot; (Arbor House, 400 pages, $18.95), by Mark Gallagher, recounts every one of the Mick's 536 big-league round-trippers, including the nonlegendary ones. The most noteworthy thing about this book is that it was written at all.    &quot;Slick: My Life in and Around Baseball&quot; (Morrow, 256 pages, $16.95), by Whitey Ford with Phil Pepe, is the biography of the Yankee pitching ace of the 1950s and '60s. Its main contribution is yet another appalling story about Billy Martin, one-third of the good-buddy trio of Whitey, Billy and Mickey. Mickey took Whitey and Billy quail hunting, explaining that it wasn't sporting to shoot the birds on the ground. But ol' Billy saw 10 of them huddled together, and killed 'em all with one shotgun blast.    More edifying by far is &quot;How to Watch Baseball: A Fan's Guide to Savoring the Fine Points of the Game&quot; (Facts on File, 204 pages,$16.95), by Steve Fiffer. This examines the technical aspects of baseball with the fan in mind. Fiffer's well-crafted accounts of his talks with players, managers, coaches and executives make sharp points about the games within and behind the game on the field. The chapter in which Dick Howser, manager of the 1985 champion Kansas City Royals, recounts his out-by-out strategies in the epic sixth game of that year's World Series is alone worth the price.    &quot;Jackie Robinson: A Life Remembered&quot; (Watts, 260 pages, $16.95), by Maury Allen, told via interviews, is a worthwhile addition to the growing literature about this remarkable man. Ironically, one of the book's most laudatory interviews about Robinson is with ex-teammate Al Campanis, whose dumb remarks about why baseball has so few black executives on a TV show marking the 40th anniversary of Robinson's Major League debut led to Campanis's recent firing as an L.A. Dodgers vice president.    The worth-getting list also includes &quot;The Illustrated Casey at the Bat&quot; (Workman Publishing, $5.95), featuring drawings by Keith Bendis. The cartoons do full justice to Ernest L. Thayer's famous poem. If your kid doesn't like it, you will.    &quot;The 1987 Elias Baseball Analyst&quot; (Collier Books, 448 pages, $12.95) is the third annual treatise by Seymour Siwoff, Steve Hirdt and Peter Hirdt, and the Elias Sports Bureau crew. It's the one baseball stats book no Figure Filbert can do without. New this year is a section on the best and worst visiting hitters in every Major League park. How can anyone get along without knowing that?    Finally, there's &quot;Baseball: A Comprehensive Bibliography&quot; (McFarland, 915 pages of small print, $60) by Myron J. Smith Jr. It contains references from 365 journals on every topic tied to the game, and on 1,647 players, past and present, from Henry Aaron to Richie Zisk. Now your library can be complete. </TEXT></DOC>
