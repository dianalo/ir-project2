The strike would halt all freight traffic on government-owned Canadian National Railways and on CP Rail, a unit of Canadian Pacific Ltd., the Montreal-based railway and industrial concern. Also affected would be Via Rail Canada Inc., Canada's passenger rail service as well as commuter rail services here and in Toronto.    About 30% of freight movements in Canada are by rail. A strike would halt rail movements of major exports including grain, coal, forest products, autos and auto parts, potash and sulfur and would likely lead to calls for the Canadian government to force an end to the walkout. The last Canadian rail strike in 1973 lasted for two weeks before Parliament passed back-to-work legislation.    &quot;We're shutting the railway,&quot; said Donald Fraleigh, assistant vice president of industrial relations at Canadian National, after the talks broke off yesterday afternoon.    Mr. Fraleigh accused the unions of wanting the railways to commit &quot;economic suicide&quot; with their demands for expanded job security.    &quot;We want protection for these railway workers,&quot; responded Armand Passaretti, chairman of the Associated Rail Unions, a group of nine separate rail unions. &quot;We're talking about workers with 25 to 30 years seniority.&quot;    Mr. Passaretti said that the two sides also failed to agree on major issues including subcontracting and wages. He said the railways' last wage offer was for a 4% raise over two years.    He said the unions still were seeking a 4% wage increase in each year of a two-year pact. The last contract expired Dec. 31, 1986.    Mr. Passaretti said the unions were willing to continue talking but he charged that the railways set preconditions that were unacceptable to the unions.    Robert Colosimo, vice president of labor relations at CP Rail, said the two sides also failed to agree on company demands to permit operation of caboose-less trains.    In anticipation of a strike, Via Rail, which uses track on the two major railways and their operating crews, began suspending some services midday yesterday. The railways ordered embargoes on freight traffic Friday.    Some rail services were disrupted here and in Toronto over the past week in sporadic walkouts as the talks continued in the presence of a government-appointed mediator. </TEXT></DOC>
