The board oversees the Sandamp;L deposit insurance fund, which insuresdeposits up to $100,000.   Bank board officials said the estimated costs of closing ormerging ailing Sandamp;Ls totaled $11.6 billion more than the fund'sassets at the end of 1987. That figure compares with a deficit of$6.3 billion at the end of 1986.   Bank board officials conceded that even this sharply higherfigure was disputed by congressional auditors, who contend it istoo low.   The deficit figure underscores the problems facing the Sandamp;Lindustry, where hundreds of institutions are insolvent but are keptopen because the government cannot afford to close them and pay offdepositors.   The new report estimated it will cost $15.3 billion to close orsell 204 savings and loans which are considered to be in the worstshape.   When $3.7 billion in fund assets are subtracted from the $15.3billion in expected liabilities, FSLIC is left with an estimateddeficit of $11.6 billion.   However, the figure of 204 insolvent Sandamp;Ls represents only theworst financial cases. Another 306 institutions were also insolventat the end of the year under generally accepted accountingprinciples.   The FSLIC report estimated that if all of these institutions hadto be rescued, it would add another $6.5 billion to the amount ofmoney the insurance fund will be obligated to pay out.   White defended the $6.5 billion estimate, saying not all of theadditional Sandamp;Ls will actually need assistance and the institutionsrepresenting the biggest drain on the funds had already beenincluded in the first group of 204 Sandamp;Ls.   However, critics contend that a figure of around $30 billion isa much more reasonable estimate and that the costs could climb ashigh as $60 billion for solving the industry's problems, far abovethe amount approved by Congress last year.   In August, President Reagan signed legislatio to pump $10.8billion into FSLIC over the next three years through the sale ofbonds which will be paid off by a special assessment on profitableinstitutions.   There have been reports that the Reagan administration isbeginning to study alternative methods of financing because of thethreat the soaring FSLIC deficit poses to efforts to reduce theoverall federal budget deficit.   The ideas being considered reportedly range from merging FSLICwith the healthy Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insuresfunds at banks, or tapping into the money generated each year bythe Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., popularly known as FreddieMac, which Congress created in 1970 to funnel money from investorsto home buyers.   Freddie Mac president Leland C. Brendsel said that diverting hiscompany's income stream to assist FSLIC ``is an idea that doesn'tstand up to financial scrutiny.''   White said it was premature to consider major changes to getmore money for FSLIC.   He said that the Sandamp;L fund will have $20 billion at its disposalover the next three years and that this amount would be sufficientto deal with the worst problems facing the industry. He said thenew president would have plenty of time to study what furtherresources would be needed.</TEXT></DOC>
