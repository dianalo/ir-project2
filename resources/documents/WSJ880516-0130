That fact had eluded the regional telecommunications company's market researchers, and it ended up dooming the Silver Pages, a directory that lists retailer's discounts for older people. Earlier this month, Southwestern Bell announced it was ending publication of the Silver Pages and folding AD/VENT Information Services Inc., the unit that published the buyers' guide.    The problem: As the older population attracts more marketing attention, the directory's chief draw -- discount promotions -- is undercut by the growing availability of such offers. Increasingly, an older person can &quot;get a discount merely by looking like a senior and asking for it,&quot; says R.M. Jennings, president of AD/VENT.    Silver Pages, a product planned before the Bell System breakup in 1984 and launched the following year in Southwestern Bell's hometown of St. Louis, had initially shown great promise. Distributed free to people 60 years of age or older, it carried alphabetical listings and advertisements from a wide range of merchants and purveyors of services -- from clothing stores, theaters and restaurants to barber shops and taxi operators. Eventually, it spread to 89 markets, with concentrations in states with large older populations, such as Florida.    Southwestern Bell began with a five-year business plan and in the first year exceeded projections. &quot;We fell slightly short in the second year, and by the third year, it was clear revenue growth couldn't sustain publishing,&quot; says Mr. Jennings.    &quot;The advertising community and seniors didn't embrace the product to the degree our research said they would,&quot; Mr. Jennings says. &quot;All of our feedback said they were eager to get the product.&quot;    Mr. Jennings offers another possible reason for the failure of the Silver Pages: &quot;My overall impression is that the habits (of older people) are slow to change.&quot;    The company won't say how much it had invested in the venture, but it expects that the costs of closing AD/VENT won't have any material effect. AD/VENT's other business, competing Yellow Page directories in markets outside Southwestern Bell's territory, will be transferred to another Southwestern Bell unit.    Southwestern Bell isn't the first to abandon the specialized-directory business. Since the seven regional telephone companies were created in the breakup of the Bell System in 1984, Pacific Telesis Group has launched and folded two such buying guides -- one aimed at hotels and motels, the other at architects.    The older-people market, Mr. Jennings says, is &quot;big, growing and lucrative with special needs,&quot; and one that Southwestern Bell won't abandon. From the Silver Pages project, the company has generated an address list of about 14 million older people, and it still plans some form of targeted marketing to them.    &quot;We've got to go back to the drawing board and reformulate what we do,&quot; Mr. Jennings says. But he acknowledges it is a difficult, diverse market. &quot;We may never find what is the right product,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't know anybody who's got their arms around it in a big way&quot; except the American Association of Retired Persons. </TEXT></DOC>
