A report issued by the National Research Council, the academy'soperating arm, said ``DOE currently lacks a clear conceptualframework for addressing safety issues at the reactors.''   It said that because most of the reactors were designed manyyears ago and since have been modified to operate at higher powerlevels, ``prevention and mitigation of some potential accidentsrely heavily on the proper and timely response of reactoroperators.''   ``In extreme cases, operators might have to act in the presenceof radiation or steam in order to prevent releases of radioactivematerials to the environment,'' the report said.   At a minimum, it said, contractors running the facilities shouldprovide the capability to operate critical valves from remoteconsoles outside the reactor confinements.   Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said his department welcomedthe academy's safety review, which DOE had requested in May 1986.It followed an October 1987 report dealing with safety at thedepartment's weapons production reactors.   ``The NAS has again presented DOE with a very constructiveanalysis of the issues relating to reactor safety. ... Thedepartment has made structural, long-term changes in response toprevious NAS recommendations, and we will continue to do so,''Herrington said.   The five DOE test and research reactors examined in the NASreport are the Advanced Test Reactor and the Experimental BreederReactor II at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near IdahoFalls; the Fast Flux Test Facility at the Hanford Federal NuclearReservation near Richland, Wash.; the High Flux Beam Reactor atBrookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y.; and the HighFlux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.   The report concluded that safety oversight at the DOE reactorscurrently is carried out by ``a fragmented collection ofcontractors, operations offices and programmatic divisions inheadquarters.''   ``The structure tends to disperse responsibility for safety andseems to require decisions with safety consequences byorganizations that are divorced fro day-to-day safetyresponsibility,'' it said.   The test and research reactors operate at power levels of 60megawatts to 400 megawatts, compared with the 1,000-megawatt levelstypical for commercial power reactors.   However, the report cautioned that ``even the smallest of thetest and research reactors contain several million curies ofvolatile radionuclides that must be controlled during an accident.''</TEXT></DOC>
