Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek, who for 23 years has championedunity in this mixed Arab and Jewish city, announced he is runningfor a sixth term.   ``This is a united city and will remain a united city, with equalrights to Arabs,'' said the 77-year-old mayor, who faces oppositionon the City Council from ultra-Orthodox and right-wing elements thatcontrol almost half the 31 seats.   The raid on Habla adhered to the army policy of disruptingnationalistic activities on days of general strikes called byleaders of the 13-month Palestinian uprising.   Today's strike, called to protest harsh new army tactics forquelling the revolt, closed down shops in the West Bank and Arabeast Jerusalem and paralyzed commerce in the Gaza Strip, where thearmy confined at least 200,000 Arabs to their homes.   The Shin Bet security service arrested dozens of Arabs suspectedof belonging to the ``Palestinian Popular Army'', the militarycommand announced today. Officials said the group was led by YasserArafat's mainstream Fatah branch of the PLO.   Israel radio said the main suspect apprehended, Abdel FatahHassan of the West Bank town of Nablus, received weapons and moneyfrom Fatah and trained dozens of youths for attacks against Israelisas part of the uprising against Israel's 21-year occupation of theWest Bank and Gaza.   The radio did not mention what type or quantity of weapons wereseized and a military spokesman said he was unable to providedetails.   Hassan also possessed special badges for his squads, which weredue to train ``hundreds of others'' in the West Bank, the reportsaid. No further details were released, including when the arrestswere made.   It was not immediately clear how seriously the wave of arrestshad debilitated the group. Palestine Liberation Organizationstatements have said such a group was being formed under theauspices of Force-17, a Fatah unit, and had thousands of members inthe occupied territories.   The organization issued its first leaflet last week, describingitself as ``an inseparable unit of other military Palestinian forcesin the diaspora'' under Arafat's leadership.   Palestinian observers have said the organization was formed in anapparent attempt to unite loosely organized groups of youths whoenforce strikes and attack collaborators.   Before the Shin Bet crackdown, there was little indicationorganized or armed units existed in the occupied lands.   The soldiers who raided Habla, which is near Qalqilya,encountered a squad of masked Arabs and killed one of them after theArabs ignored orders to halt, military officials said.   Another Palestinian was wounded, and four managed to escape.   The dead youth was identified by his family as Issam Hashemel-Marabi, 19. Arab reports earlier had said the victim was17-year-old Khaled Mardawi, but he later was reported recoveringfrom a wound in his left leg at an Israeli hospital in the city ofKfar Saba.   The death raised to 368 the number of Palestinians killed sincethe rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987. Fifteen Israelis have also beenkilled.   The PLO-linked Unified National Leadership of the Uprising calledtoday's strike to protest the policy announced by the military lastweek of demolishing homes of stone-throwers and Arabs convicted ofviolent acts against Israel.   In an underground leaflet distributed Monday, the leadership alsodecried a new army policy that allows officers and specially trainedtroops to shoot plastic-tipped bullets at fleeing stone-throwers andArabs who set up barricades.   Previous regulations gave officers permission to fire the bulletsonly in life-threatening situations or to incapacitate leaders ofdemonstrations.   At least 47 Arabs have been killed and 288 wounded by theplastic-tipped bullets, said chief army spokesman Brig. Gen. EphraimLapid.   Speaking on Israel Television's Arabic-language service, PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir defended the orders.   ``Nobody is happy about the fact that there are wounded,'' hesaid. ``But a war has been forced on us. It's not only a war againstIsrael's presence in certain areas of the country. It's a waragainst our existence.''</TEXT></DOC>
