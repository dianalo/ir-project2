The ``ABC World News Tonight'' report came the day after FMCfiled suit in Chicago against ABC News to regain what the companysaid were stolen documents used for an earlier story on allegedparts overcharges for the Bradley.   ``FMC has brought suit against ABC charging that we arewrongfully in possession of FMC documents,'' anchorman PeterJennings said Thursday at the beginning of the Bradley segment. ``AtABC News we say that's not true.''   In Thursday's report, the network said it had obtained agovernment memo in which a Defense Department quality assuranceinspector cited the Chicago-based builder for a faulty mechanismthat was supposed to help the Bradley float.   According to the memo, the problem was not fixed by FMC and thevehicle, which resembles a tank, was shipped to the Army, ABCreported.   Critics of the Bradley, which has been deployed mostly in Europe,content the vehicle doesn't work and is unsafe. By last December,FMC had delivered about 3,100 Bradleys at a cost of $10 billion. ABCsays the cost of the Bradley program has reached $11.3 billion.   ``There was never a vehicle that left here that didn't havemultiple defects on it,'' Jesse Ringstaff, one of the governmentinspectors who worked on the Bradley at the FMC plant in SantaClara, Calif., told ABC.   Ringstaff, asked by ABC if the defects could have been dangerousto soldiers riding in the vehicle, said, ``Of course, it could.''   After FMC shipped the Bradleys to the Army, a few were supposedto be tested. But the Army and FMC were not enthusiastic aboutperforming the tests, Air Force Col. James Burton, the Pentagon'skey Bradley tester at the time, told ABC.   ``I had a three-star general tell me that we don't want to testbecause we know it may blow up and then that will just cause a stinkand so we really don't want that to happen,'' he said.   According to an unidentified FMC engineer, workers installedflawed metal armor on certain Bradleys and in some cases the layeredmetal delaminated, the network reported. ``That is an extremelydangerous condition,'' he said.   In another memo obtained by ABC News, government inspectors foundFMC had removed parts from Bradleys after they had passed inspectionand then placed those parts on other Bradleys still to be inspected.   ABC News said FMC declined to discuss the Bradley on camera.   Although FMC and the Army allegedly were unenthusiastic abouttesting the vehicle, eventually it was tested and flaws wereuncovered. Last December, Pentagon officials told Congress theyplanned to thicken the armor on the vehicle to make it 50 percent``more survivable'' in battle.   But ABC reports that many flawed vehicles still remain in thefield.   It also reported that former members of the Army's senior staffnow work for FMC. It said Gen. Edward C. Meyer, the Army chief ofstaff at the time the first Bradleys came off the assembly line,took a position on FMC's board of directors three months after heretired from the Army in June 1983.   In 1986, Meyer was paid about $128,000 by FMC, ABC reported. Hedeclined to talk to the network.   Col. David Doyle, who oversaw production of the Bradley at theFMC plant, retired from the Army in 1981 and a few days later hewent to work for the company, ABC reported. He also declined to talkto the network.   On Oct. 20, ABC aired the story that quoted unidentified formerFMC employees who accused the company of overcharging the governmentfor spare parts on the vehicle.   ``We don't know how they got the documents,'' said Pat Brozowski,spokeswomen for FMC. An in-house investigation of the televisionstory ``turned up the fact that the documents were missing from ourfiles,'' she said.   FMC also said it has told the government's General AccountingOffice it will cooperate with any investigation of prices charged onthe Bradley parts, according to the statement.</TEXT></DOC>
