Futures contracts for December-delivery gold rose 60 cents an ounce to $436.30. December silver was up six cents to $6.7450. Platinum, which had a late surge, rose $9.60 an ounce in the October-delivery contract, to $537.50.    Precious metals are coming into a strategic period, according to Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metals Advisors Inc., New York consultants.    &quot;They're entering a period during which seasonal factors should provide support,&quot; Mr. Nichols said. &quot;If it doesn't take place, metals will be much more vulnerable during the last quarter.&quot;    The jewelry industry is returning from vacation, he noted, and there will be a pickup in jewelry manufacturing for the year-end holiday season.    There will also be seasonal demand from the Indian sub-continent, principally from India, according to Mr. Nichols.    &quot;They've had a good monsoon season, and farmers have more money than last year,&quot; he said. He estimated that 150 tons of gold will be imported by the area this year, compared with 120 tons last year, &quot;and a large part of this will come in the next several months.&quot;    Investors and professional dealers also are returning from vacation, Mr. Nichols noted, and the international trade in precious metals should improve.    &quot;Japan in August imported only about 10 to 12 tons of gold,&quot; Mr. Nichols said. &quot;Imports should rise to between 20 to 30 tons per month, particularly during September and October, just reflecting the seasonal pickup.&quot;    On the other hand, Mr. Nichols observed, increasing gold loans may depress prices. Gold loans involve the borrowing by gold mining companies of gold from bankers and dealers and selling it to get cash to run their operations. The loans are paid back with gold mined later.    &quot;This throws a lot of gold out onto the market, and tends to put a damper on price advances,&quot; Mr. Nichols said. Traders then get the impression that the market can't advance, and that can further suppress it, he said.    &quot;Mining companies don't help, because they've been progressively lowering the prices at which they're willing to sell gold,&quot; Mr. Nichols said. &quot;Some time ago, it was $460, then $450, then $445, and now it is between $435 and $440.&quot;    In other commodity markets yesterday:   COPPER: Futures prices rose, principally on the announcement by a major refiner that it won't be able to meet some shipping commitments because of miners' strikes in Peru, analysts said. The December contract rose 0.75 cent a pound to $1.0010. Asarco Inc. declared a 50% force majeure on shipments it had scheduled for October to Europe, a spokesman in New York said. The copper was to have come from Southern Peru Copper Corp., and the amount of copper that won't be shipped was estimated by the spokesman at less than 1,000 metric tons. A metric ton is equal to 2,204.6 pounds. A month-long nationwide strike among miners in Peru recently ended, and Peruvian miners are scheduled to go on a three-day walkout Monday to protest the dismissal last week of some workers at one copper mine.    CURRENCIES: Currency futures ended lower on the day but near session highs, in the wake of remarks by the U.S. assistant Treasury secretary for international affairs, David Mulford. Mr. Mulford, speaking at Goldman Sachs andamp; Co.'s annual foreign exchange conference yesterday, said, &quot;we recognize a concern that (an extreme) dollar rise could hamper the trade balance.&quot; His comment drove the dollar down toward its lows of the day. &quot;It looks like the political temperature has changed; they now seem happier with a lower dollar,&quot; said Cynthia Johnson, Lloyds Bank N.A. foreign exchange manager. September West German mark futures ended 0.13 cent lower, at 54.20 cents, having traded between 54 cents and 54.25 cents, and September yen futures ended 0.0021 cent lower at 0.7485 cent, having traded between 0.7464 cent and 0.7486 cent. But traders said the lack of fresh news and uncertainty ahead of the release of the producer price index for August, scheduled for this morning at 8:30 EDT, and the trade data, due Wednesday, kept activity thin and price action limited for most of the day. </TEXT></DOC>
