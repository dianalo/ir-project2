A pretreatment which includespartial delignification will increase the biogas yield, presumably 30-50%.The primary aim of this proposal is to develop a more effective process(a two-stage process) for degradation of lignocellulosic materials tomethane. The first stage is partial delignification with fungi. The secondstage is degradation of the resulting intermediate products in an anaerobicfixed film reactor. Certain process conditions favouring the total degradationto methane must be determined. These include the method of fermentation,the type of substrate and the fungi culture. A more effective process,as described, will make it technically economically more feasible touse straw and other lignocellulosic wastes for production of methanegas. (Refs. 30).</TEXT></DOC>
