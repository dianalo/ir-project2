F.W. Dodge, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., said that U.S. construction contract awards in December rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $247 billion from $241.4 billion in November.    So-called non-building construction surged 40% in December to an annualized $49.5 billion rate from $35.3 billion the previous month. Most of that rise was attributed to a 40% increase in new contracts for such items as roads and sewers following a drop of 24% in November and a 35% October rise.    &quot;Federal funding for public works construction has become highly erratic since the new fiscal year began Oct. 1, resulting in wide swings in construction contracting,&quot; said George A. Christie, chief economist for F.W. Dodge.    Residential building awards in December rose 1% to a $120.1 billion annual rate. At the same time, nonresidential building fell 11% to an annualized $77.5 billion from $87.5 billion in November.    The Dodge index of construction contracting, which compares current activity with a 1977 base of 100, rose to 175 in December from 171 a month earlier.    For the year, new construction contracts were up 5% to $243.3 billion from $232.3 billion in 1985. Led by a 20% rise in single-family home-building, the construction industry had its fourth consecutive year of growth.    All residential building contracts rose 11% last year to $120.6 billion. The total includes hotels and motels as well as apartment buildings and single-family dwellings. F.W. Dodge attributed the jump in single-family homes to falling interest rates.    Moreover, Mr. Christie predicted that in 1987 single-family building will continue to displace apartment units because the new tax law has &quot;eliminated the tax-shelter motive for apartment development.&quot;    Nonresidential construction fell 2% last year to $81.3 billion, reflecting a sharp decline in office and industrial plant building. Non-building construction rose 2% to $41.3 billion.    During 1986, construction in the North Central region climbed 13%, followed by an 11% rise in the Northeast and a 6% increase in the West. The South had a 3% decline.    ---                            a-Dec. '86        Seasonally                           Construction       Adjusted %                           Contract Val.
