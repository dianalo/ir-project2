Salvador Laurel, who resigned as foreign affairs secretary in Mrs. Aquino's cabinet last month but retained the nominal post of vice president, denied Manila newspaper reports that he would join the major opposition party, the Nationalists, in such a political overhaul. Rather, Mr. Laurel said, the party will be led by one of his brothers, Jose, and will include the former defense minister, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, as well as several former cabinet members.    But he also said that the United Nationalist Democratic Organization, an umbrella group that formed the basis of President Aquino's coalition in presidential elections last year and which he heads, may pull its support from the government and form a &quot;tactical alliance&quot; with the Nationalists to oppose government candidates in local elections in January. Mr. Laurel made his remarks Saturday to a small group of foreign correspondents.    A system with two major parties governed Philippine politics from independence from the U.S. in 1946 until former President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972. Mr. Marcos was head of the Nationalists prior to martial law, and Mr. Laurel was also a Nationalist. But politicians often switched parties, and Mr. Marcos and Mrs. Aquino's husband, Benigno, at different times held offices in both major parties, the Nationalists and the Liberals.    Mr. Laurel's comments follow reports that leaders of the Philippine Senate and House are preparing a similar rehabilitation of the Liberal Party. There are now 48 registered parties in the country, and the government rules as a multiparty coalition.    The move for a political realignment is yet another sign of just how weak Mrs. Aquino's coalition has become. Her government is plagued by internal dissension, public bickering and open defection. Mrs. Aquino's spokesman alleged last week that five right-wing groups, including renegade military officers loyal to Mr. Marcos and soldiers who failed in the latest coup attempt in August, have united to try again.    While many political observers dismissed the alleged conspiracy as a government attempt to boost its sagging popularity, few would deny that dissatisfaction remains widespread in the military and is growing among the civilian population -- chiefly because Mrs. Aquino isn't seen as dealing firmly enough with a growing communist insurgency and the nation's economic problems. Senate President Jovita Salonga said last week Mrs. Aquino may have to declare a state of emergency if the situation worsens.    While Mr. Laurel said martial law isn't necessary, he urged Mrs. Aquino to act forcefully to &quot;correct the impression she is indecisive.&quot; This, he said, must include an &quot;all-out&quot; campaign against the communist insurgency.    The country also faces strikes that could paralyze business and transport. A leftist labor alliance has called a general strike today and selective strikes during the week to back its demands for across-the-board pay increases. In August, military men took advantage of the disorder following a transport strike in Manila to attempt a coup.    While Mr. Laurel's vice presidential position is largely nominal, he is first in line to succeed Mrs. Aquino. An associate of former Defense Minister Enrile said the inclusion of Mr. Laurel in any opposition alliance could strengthen support for moves to force Mrs. Aquino from office. </TEXT></DOC>
