(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man accused of killing 14 members ofhis family punched a prosecutor today in front of the jury and acrowded courtroom hearing his murder trial.   R. Gene Simmons, 48, and lawyers in the case were in conferenceat the bench of Johnson County Circuit Court Judge John Pattersonwhen Simmons struck out with his right fist and hit Prosecutor JohnBynum on the chin.   As Simmons struggled and Bynum regained his balance, lawenforcement officers swarmed Simmons, subdued him and hustled himout of the courtroom.   Some spectators shrieked and several relatives of the peopleSimmons is accused of killing ducked to the floor and huddled overeach other.   ``I'm all right,'' Bynum said. ``He just got me one time. I'm allright.''   Bynum said the conference was about how much more time would beneeded to complete the trial, which began Monday.   The scuffle took place in full view of the jury.   A few minutes later, Patterson had the jury brought back to thecourt and announced that the trial would take a recess for lunch.   ``I want you to set aside what happened in the courtroom justnow,'' Patterson said. ``This trial has gone on five days. We wantto finish it if we can. You need to disregard the incident thathappened here today.''   Defense lawyers said they were shocked by the attack and saidthey were considering seeking a mistrial.   Earlier today, firearms expert Burwin Monroe of the state CrimeLab in Little Rock testified that a gun handed to authorities bySimmons was one that fired the bullets that killed several victims.   Monroe cited tests that showed a .22-caliber revolver whichSimmons had when he surrendered after a 40-minute shooting rampagein Russellville on Dec. 28, 1987, fired the shots that killed hiswife, eldest son, and others whose bodies were found that day inSimmons' house or the next day in a nearby grave.   On Thursday, defense and state attorneys blamed each other forleaking a statement to the press in which Simmons said he would seehis eldest daughter in hell.   Simmons made the remark about Sheila Marie McNulty, 24, in awritten statement found in his safe-deposit box in a bank inRussellville.   Simmons also apparently refers to Mrs. McNulty's husband, DennisMcNulty, 33, in the note.   ``You have destroyed me,'' Simmons wrote. ``I do not want D. toset foot on my property. He turned you against me. You want me outof your life. I will be out of your life. I will see you in hell.''   A three-page transcript of Simmons' five-page handwrittenstatement was published in Thursday editions of the ArkansasDemocrat, a Little Rock newspaper.   The bodies of the McNultys and 12 other members of Simmons'family were found at his home on Dec. 28 and Dec. 29, 1987,following Simmons' arrest for a shooting rampage in Russellvillethat left two people dead. Simmons was sentenced to death for thetwo Russellville killings last year and has tried to waive appealsof his death sentence, saying he wants to die.   Patterson said he was disappointed at the disclosure of thestatement, which appears to be notes Simmons made to himself,possibly to prepare for a telephone conversation with his daughter.   ``I think evidence ought to come out in the trial, not in thenewspapers,'' Patterson said.</TEXT></DOC>
