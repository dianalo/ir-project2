By a 92-5 vote, senators approved an amendment to the pending trade bill that would impose a two-year to five-year ban on &quot;importation into the United States of all goods&quot; produced by Toshiba and Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk of Norway. The sanctions cover &quot;the parent, affiliate, subsidiary, and successor companies&quot; of the two concerns.    The measure also would require the U.S. government to seek financial compensation in court from the two companies for the military damage caused by the sale to the Soviets of milling machinery. The Pentagon says the sale enabled Moscow to make its submarines quieter and thus harder for the U.S. to locate.    The extraordinary action against specific foreign companies won't become law unless it is accepted by the House and the overall trade bill is signed by President Reagan. But the huge margin of approval, reflecting widespread anger in Congress over the diversion of technology, indicates that even if the trade bill fails, the ban could be attached later to another measure.    &quot;TVs, copying machines -- their consumer goods would be banned,&quot; said Sen. Jake Garn (R., Utah), a sponsor of the amendment. &quot;We want to hurt them in their pocketbook.&quot;    Toshiba, a huge consumer and industrial electronics concern, has annual U.S. sales exceeding $1 billion, a company spokesman said. The Kongsberg group, a military equipment manufacturer, has agreements for tens of millions of dollars in U.S. sales, according to Norwegian Defense Minister Johan Joergen Holst.    A spokesman for the Japanese company's Toshiba America Inc. unit declined to comment on the legislation. Mr. Holst, however, said he hasn't given up hope of saving Kongsberg's sale of its Penguin anti-ship missile to the U.S. Navy. &quot;We hope that the administration is left with enough discretion to judge the Penguin on its own merits,&quot; he said.    The Senate's tough action came despite Japanese and Norwegian offers to help the U.S. improve its anti-submarine warfare capability as partial compensation for the damage caused by their export of technology to the Soviet Union.    Japan's offer was announced by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger after talks in Tokyo with Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and Defense Minister Yukio Kurihara. Mr. Weinberger said on NBC-TV's &quot;Today Show&quot; yesterday that he found the Japanese officials &quot;very cooperative&quot; and &quot;very interested&quot; in working with the U.S. to regain its lead in submarine technology.    Separately, Defense Minister Holst has offered to share with the U.S. the latest submarine-detection technology developed by Norway's Defense Research Institute. Mr. Holst declined to be more specific. &quot;That's for the experts to discuss,&quot; he said.    The two companies would also be barred from contracts with the U.S. government, and the measure would amend existing law to apply the same treatment to companies committing similar offenses in the future.    The amendment exempts certain items from the ban, and gives the president discretion to make other modifications, including ending the ban after two years. Exempted would be goods shipped under contracts signed before May 1; spare parts and components &quot;essential to United States production;&quot; &quot;routine&quot; servicing and maintenance of products already in place, and information and technology. Products deemed essential for defense could also continue to be sold.    In addition, the president could, after consulting Congress, limit the sanctions on one or all arms of the two companies, under certain conditions. However, the president wouldn't be allowed to exclude the two parent companies from sanctions unless they agree to &quot;suitable compensation.&quot;    After some indecision caused by interagency conflicts, the Reagan administration announced its opposition to such punitive bills, but it was too late to halt the Senate action. Allan Wendt, the State Department's special representative for strategic technology policy, told a House subcommittee yesterday that the administration is &quot;against all the bills and amendments we've seen so far.&quot;    Mr. Wendt said forcing countries to pay compensation for such offenses could make the U.S. &quot;vulnerable to retaliation&quot; by countries that could claim injury for other &quot;breaches of security&quot; committed by American citizens. &quot;Retaliating against Norway and Japan after their governments have taken remedial actions isn't going to solve the problem,&quot; he added.    Previously, the House overwhelmingly approved a bill of Rep. Duncan Hunter (D., Calif.) instructing the State Department to negotiate with Japan and Norway for the payment of compensation for the shipment to the Soviets. Rep. Hunter estimated the cost of the diversion at about $30 billion, claiming that the lost advantage in submarine technology has to be made up by building 30 more Los Angeles-class submarines at about $1 billion each. Stephen Bryen, a deputy undersecretary of defense, said the Pentagon isn't prepared to announce its own estimate.    Mr. Wendt told the subcommittee, though, that the administration could work together with Congress on more moderate legislative remedies that would leave President Reagan &quot;room to manuever&quot; in negotiating stronger cooperation with U.S. allies. </TEXT></DOC>
