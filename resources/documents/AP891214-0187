The issue also has reached the U.S. Congress where senators andrepresentatives act either for environmental reasons or to assureplentiful supplies of tuna and salmon for American West Coastfishermen.   Much of the conflict, however, is in the South Pacific, whereenvironmentalists and governments charge that fish stocks are beingwiped out by a sudden wave of Japanese and Taiwanese fishing boatsusing giant nets called driftnets.   Japanese fishing officials say the criticism is another form of``Japan-bashing'' motivated more by displeasure over Japan's rapideconomic growth e the United States that once welcomed Asianfishermen to their relatively unexploited 200-mile economic zonesnow have developed their own fishing industries and are limitingforeign access to stocks that are seen increasingly as a limitedresource.   ``It's a whole new situation that fisheries is entering,'' saidIan Kennedy, fisheries officer at New Zealand's embassy in Tokyo.``There's a definite trend from management not only within 200-milelimits, but with the high value of migratory species, of fishmigrating outside the limits.''   In 1981, Japan was allowed to catch about 1.2 million tons offish within the United States' 200-mile zone, but its quota was cutto virtually zero by 1988.   In their search for fish, some countries are entering deals withnations they had little to do with before:   _Companies in anti-communist South Korea have landed deals tofish in Soviet, Chinese and Vietnamese waters.   _Taiwanese fishing companies plan to visit the Soviet Unionearly in 1990 to explore fishing cooperation, officials say.   _China has established joint ventures with Nigeria,Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Morocco in Africa and plans to increaseits fishing fleet in foreign waters next year from 100 to 120boats, according to official press reports.   _Japan is interested in entering joint ventures in Soviet watersbut is waiting for more signs of political stability in Moscowbefore deciding, U.S. officials say.   But increasingly, Asian fishing powers are turning tointernational waters for their fish.   Last season, after Japanese fishing researchers discovered largesupplies of albacore tuna in the South Pacific high seas, Japanesedriftnet boats in the region increased from 20 to 60, and Taiwaneseboats surged to at least 60 and perhaps as many as 130.   Driftnets, which sweep as much as 30 miles of ocean at once,consist of a line of nets, each about two miles long, separatedfrom each other by about a quarter of a mile, Japanese fishingofficials say. The nets, attached to floats, are allowed to driftuntil they are picked up later.   Driftnetting countries say the nets are the only economicallyfeasible way to fish on the high seas, where fish are lessconcentrated than in coastal areas.   In October, however, Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer of NewZealand asked the United Nations to ban driftnetting, calling them``walls of death'' that ``catch and kill, like a vacuum cleaner,virtually every living creature _ including some endangered species_ which come in contact with them.''   In November, 20 South Pacific nations decided to ban driftnetsfrom their economic zones and urged Japan and Taiwan to agree to aregional prohibition on the method.   The two nations agreed to reduce their fleets but refused todiscuss a total ban; Japan called instead for an internationalcommission to oversee regional fishing stocks.   ``There's no scientific evidence yet that driftnetting isdamaging fisheries resources, so it's premature to institute aban,'' said Kunio Kimura, senior managing director of the JapanFisheries Association.   ``It's true that there is an incidental catch of marine animalsin driftnets,'' said Katsuyama, the Fisheries Agency official.``But it's a mistake to ban a method because one or 10 are caught.If the number is too large, then what we need to do is reduce it.''   Controversy over driftnetting originally began in the NorthPacific, where U.S. salmon fishermen protested poaching by Asiansquid driftnetters.   Taiwan has acknowledged that violations occurred and, along withSouth Korea, has agreed to let U.S. officials inspect driftnetvessels suspected of illegally catching U.S. fish.   American officials in Tokyo say that because of the Japanesegovernment's tough monitoring, they do not believe Japanesedriftnetters now are poaching substantial amounts of U.S. salmon,despite such charges by members of the U.S. Congress.   The U.S. Senate has voted for a prohibition of imports of tunacaught with driftnets, while a congressional subcommittee has givenits approval to a bill calling on the Bush administration to seekan international ban on driftnetting.   That could be embarrassing to the United States, said anAmerican official in Tokyo, ``because the U.S. has one of thebiggest driftnet fisheries in the world'' _ for salmon in Americanwaters near Alaska and elsewhere.   ``Environmentalists have a bad taste in their mouth regardingJapan because of its whaling,'' the U.S. official said, speaking oncondition of anonymity. ``There's a sense that if Japan does it, itmust be bad environmentally. But if Japan does change its policyregarding driftnetting, it could start pointing its finger at us.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wednesday AMs, Dec. 20</NOTE></DOC>
