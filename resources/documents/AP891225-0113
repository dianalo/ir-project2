Ceausescu, the last hard-line Communist leader in the WarsawPact, was chased from power Friday after his dreaded securityforces massacred thousands protesting his repressive 24-year ruleand harsh economic policies.   The radio also blamed the Ceausescus for the deaths of more than60,000 Romanians and said they plundered the poor country of morethan $1 billion that they deposited in foreign banks. The reportdid not make clear whether the deaths occurred during the 11-dayuprising that toppled Ceausescu or during his entire tenure.   Ceausescu, 71, and his wife, Elena, who served as a virtualsecond-in-command, were executed after a trial at an undisclosedlocation. Executions usually are carried out by firing squad inRomania.   ``Oh, what wonderful news!'' an unidentified announcer said onthe radio, which is controlled by the provisional government, theNational Salvation Committee.</TEXT><DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Romania's revolution against Communism,unlike others in Eastern Europe, has exploded in volatile emotionsand violence against the repression enforced by the 24-yeardictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu.   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were reported to be executed onMonday after a secret trial on charges of particularly grave crimesagainst the people.   No other East European country revolting in the name ofdemocracy has reacted in this way. But no other East Europeancountry had a Ceausescu, whose unparalleled personality culttrumpeted his ``golden era'' while imposing more and more hardship.   As mandated debt repayment and industrialization programsbrought hardship to every Romanian, dissent was largely repressedby his dreaded Securitate, a massive network of at least 700,000people.   Workers who dared to protest disappeared mysteriously.Intellectuals, with a higher profile in society, faced prison,mental hospital, internal exile or house arrest.</TEXT><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. troops kept a vigil on theVatican Embassy where Gen. Antonio Manuel Noriega sought asylum asofficials debated what to do with the man who once ran this country.   Dozens of U.S. soldiers, armored vehicles and helicoptersencircled the embassy after Noriega turned himself in Sunday, fivedays after the U.S. invasion overthrew his government, blasted hisheadquarters and drove him into hiding.   Panamanians living in refugee camps and Americans on patrolfound something to celebrate. Near Santo Tomas Hospital,infantrymen put up a tiny Christmas tree at their post and a signsaying ``Feliz Navidad,'' merry Christmas. They shared their foodwith people from the neighborhood.   President Guillermo Endara, the U.S.-backed leader who tookpower minutes after the U.S. invasion, visited refugees during aChristmas Mass at a camp in a soccer stadium. Endara refused tocomment on Noriega's status, saying, ``It is a very delicatediplomatic matter with the papal state.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Manuel Antonio Noriega's decision to seekasylum at the Vatican's embassy in Panama City forces PresidentBush into the thicket of diplomacy and international law in pursuitof his goal of bringing the deposed dictator to trial on drugtrafficking charges.   ``Now it's up to the lawyers and the diplomats,'' summed upPentagon chief Dick Cheney, whose troops tried but failed tocapture the elusive dictator in more than four days of searching.   When Noriega drove up to the Vatican embassy in Panama City onChristmas Eve, Bush accomplished a central goal of the invasion heordered last week: removing the indicted drug trafficker from allpower in Panama.   But how Bush, Panama's U.S.-backed government, the Vatican andother nations handle the next step could determine not onlyNoriega's fate, but the future of the strategically placed isthmusfor years to come.   U.S. interests appear to be best served by Noriega's speedyremoval from the Papal Nunciature, where he is protected bydiplomatic immunity and by the spotlight of internationalattention. As long as he stays, attention could be diverted fromU.S. efforts to restore order to the devastated country.   The White House said Sunday it still hopes to bring Noriega tojustice. He was indicted in Florida on federal charges in 1988.</TEXT><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Manuel Blanco rummaged through theashes that had been his home and salvaged a balpeen hammer with acharred handle and a blackened pair of pliers.   The two tools and the clothes on his back are what remains ofhis earthly possessions. Even so, the 70-year-old retired automechanic says he is glad U.S. forces invaded Panama and overthrewthe dictatorship of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   ``It hurts that I've lost everything, but what are you going todo? The gringos had to do it like they did. I only wish they wouldhave done it long ago,'' he said.   He stood on blackened sheets of corrugated zinc that had beenthe roof of the two-story wooden apartment building, where he livedwith his wife and their granddaughter. The only remnants of thebuilding are two masonry columns that supported the communalbathrooms.   Blanco and his neighbors had the misfortune to live a block fromthe headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces, Noriega'scommand center.</TEXT><BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE><TEXT>   Millions of Eastern Europeans celebrated their first freeChristmas in four decades: Political prisoners rejoined theirfamilies, East Germans and Czechoslovaks watched Mass on TV, andRomanians listened to carols long-banned on state radio.   Pope John Paul II prayed for Romanians ``celebrating thisChristmas in fear and trembling,'' mourned the thousands killedoverthrowing their Communist leaders, and praised the democraticreforms remaking his native Eastern Europe.   The Soviet Union's Baltic republics enjoyed the first officialChristmas holiday allowed by the Communists.   Panamanians and U.S. soldiers spent Christmas on the lookout forsnipers.   Church bells pealed across Czechoslovakia to mark the newfreedoms won in a pro-democracy movement that toppled Communistleaders, created a free press and brought promises of freeelections.   ``I feel like this is a miracle,'' said Ivan Martin Jirous, whowas reunited with his family after being released from prison onemonth ago.

To effervesce, Mr. Webster says, is to ``bubble and hiss.'' Ifanything, the unretiring retiring mayor of New York now leavesoffice after 12 noisy years with more bubble than hiss.   ``God has been very nice to me,'' Ed Koch concludes, withoutsuggesting that God ever got a single word in edgewise.   American leaders cross the bridge from power to private life ina variety of moods. Ulysses S. Grant worried about money. WilliamHoward Taft felt like a ``giant locomotive suddenly pulling a toytrain.'' Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter felt dejected and rejected.</TEXT><DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There's still doubt whetherPresident F.W. de Klerk will personally oversee the end ofapartheid, but his performance since his inauguration has raisedhopes higher than ever for peaceful change.   Even the white-run government's most militant opponentsacknowledge a dramatic shift in mood since P.W. Botha quit thepresidency. They say de Klerk's conciliatory moves resulted frompressure rather than conviction, but many anti-apartheid leadersnow believe _ for the first time _ that the government sincerelywants to negotiate with them.   ``Exit a president named P.W., to be replaced by one named F.W.Remarkable what a difference that one letter made,'' wrote TheWeekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper, in its year-end issue.   ``Suddenly the logjam seemed to break. Good intentions twinkledaround the country. ... For the first time, people of widelydiffering views agreed: there is hope in our land.''</TEXT><DATELINE>JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Christmas Eve fire that killed 16and injured dozens at a high-rise retirement home might have beenworse if so many people hadn't been away for the holiday,authorities said Monday.   Officials accounted for 10 of 11 residents who had been listedas missing after the blaze at the 11-story John Sevier RetirementCenter. The 11th person is also believed to have been away at thetime, they said.   ``I can't think of a worse time, on Christmas Eve,'' said P.C.Snapp, mayor of this town of 40,000. ``On the other hand, it couldhave been a good time because a number of people had gone to visitrelatives.''   The blaze surged through the lower floors of the brick building,sending thick smoke to the floors above. Residents of upper floorswaved flashlights and screamed for help from the windows of theirsmoke-filled apartments.   About 50 people were injured, including about 15 firefighters,some of whom also suffered frostbite. Most were treated for smokeinhalation and released. At least one person was seriously burned,said Dan Blevins, spokesman for Northside Hospital.</TEXT><DATELINE>JACKSON, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some advertisers promoting vacation spotshundreds of miles from Wyoming have the power to move mountains.   The picturesque Grand Teton and its sister mountains have beenused in ads for Amtrak, which doesn't run through Wyoming; and suchplaces as a resort in Montana and even a condominium in the heartof the Rockies in Colorado.   For the record, the Tetons have been standing firm innorthwestern Wyoming for eons.   And while imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, theJackson Hole Chamber of Commerce isn't happy to see the craggypeaks plastered on brochures touting destinations that don't have aview of the range even on a clear day.   ``The Tetons are one of the most recognizable mountain ranges inthe world and we are more than a little miffed that our competitorscontinue to use our assets to promote their areas,'' said CarolWaller, the chamber's director of marketing. ``We are seriouslyconsidering trademarking the Tetons _ I'm only half-joking.''   While managers of those out-of-sight resorts responded withshock or embarrassment when queried about their use of the Tetons,none offered any apologies. Not even resort managers in Colorado,which boasts of being home to the greatest skiing in the world.</TEXT></DOC>
