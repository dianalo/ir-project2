The West African nation's population is estimated at 114 millionwith an annual growth rate of 3.3 percent. The present average issix children per family.   ``Let me stress that the policy is not a coercive measure, andas such no special legal provisions for its enforcement have beenmade,'' Babangida said.   But he added: ``If women space their child bearing at intervalsof two or three years, or they decide not to give birth after 35,then they would probably bear not more than four children.''   Health Minister Olikoye Ransome-Kuti has said Nigeria seeks toreduce the growth rate to 2.5 percent in 1995 and 2 percent in 2000.</TEXT></DOC>
