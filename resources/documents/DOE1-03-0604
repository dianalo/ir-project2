Subjects identified desirable and undesirableconsequences for each topic and formulated an associative rule linkingtopic and consequence in either a causal or correlational framework.Likelihood estimates, generated by subjects in several formats (probability,odds statements, etc.), constituted one outcome measure. Additionally,source of belief (personal experience, news media, etc.) and perceivedpersonal and societal impact are reviewed. Briefly, subjects believethat AIDs causes significant emotional problems, and to a lesser degree,physical health problems whereas toxic waste causes significant environmentalproblems.</TEXT></DOC>
