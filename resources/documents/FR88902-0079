Also, this document establishes certainblanket routine uses which may be made of the information in FCC's systemsof records. Proposals in this notice are written in the present, rather than the futuretense, to avoid unnecessary expenditure of public funds to republish it,unless FCC receives comments which make republication necessary. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Written comments on the proposed changes should be receivedby October 3, 1988. All proposals shall be effective after this date, exceptfor new/altered systems, unless FCC receives comments that would requirea contrary determination. A longer comment and review period will be requiredfor the two new systems of records described in <T2>``SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION''</T2> below. As required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(o)of the Privacy Act, FCC submitted reports of new and altered systems tothe Congress and to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on August29, 1988. The new systems of records, including routine uses, will becomeeffective 60 days from publication unless FCC receives comments which wouldrequire a contrary determination. For the three altered systems proposedbelow, FCC is requesting a waiver from OMB of its 60-day advance reviewperiod. If OMB grants the waivers, the proposed altered systems will beeffective 30 days from publication, unless FCC receives comments whichwould require a contrary determination. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments should be mailed to Terry D.

This agencypreviously gave complete notice of its systems of records by publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 30, 1981, 46 FR 63108. This noticeis a summary of more detailed information which may be viewed at the locationand hours given in the <T2>``ADDRESS''</T2> section above. <ITAG tagnum="84">PREFATORY STATEMENT </ITAG>Minor Corrections and Changes: This document corrects minor typographical or editorial errors and reflectsminor administrative changes such as to organization names, location ofthe records, and records disposition instructions which appeared in thelast complete publication of FCC's system notices at 46 FR 63108, December30, 1981. Existing routine uses for some systems have been editoriallyimproved to clarify the purposes and compatible uses of the system. Whereminor stylistic differences occur, routine uses have been made editoriallyuniform by making reference to the Blanket routine uses listed below. Noneof these typographical, editorial, or administrative changes alter thepurposes for which the systems were created, nor do they meet other criteriawhich would require an Altered System report under the Privacy Act andOMB Circular No. A-130. Revision of a System by Combining Two Existing Systems: FCC is revising FCC/OMD-2 and deleting FCC/Central-3, in order to combinetwo existing systems of records into one composite notice. The compositenotice, published in its entirety below, is titled ``FCC/OMD-2, Labor andEmployee Relations Case Files'' and supersedes the previous notice ``EmployeeRelations Case File'' published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 30, 1981, 46 FR 63108. ``FCC/Central-3,Grievance Records'' which last appeared in the same December 30, 1981 systemnotice, is combined into the composite ``FCC/OMD-2'' notice published below.FCC/Central-3 is hereby deleted from the FCC inventory of Privacy Act systemof records notices. The combining of the record systems reflects a change in the actual mannerin which the records were formerly maintained. The change does not alterthe purposes of the system, nor does it create increased access to it.Seven new compatible routine use disclosures are being applied to the Laborand Employee Relations Case Files. Also, six other compatible routine usedisclosures formerly applicable to FCC/Central-3 are being applied to Laborand Employee Relations Case Files. Altered Systems of Records: Three systems of records are being substantially revised. As required bythe Privacy Act and OMB Circular No. A-130, Altered System Reports forthese systems were submitted on August 29, 1988 to the Office of Managementand Budget, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House forthe following three systems. Because these altered systems are existingsystems necessary for the conduct of internal security programs, regulatoryenforcement activity, and committee management, we have requested the Officeof Management and Budget to waive the 60-day advance review period forall three. All new and revised text for altered systems is printed <T3>in italics</T3> in each individual system notice below. The proposedmodifications are as follows: 1. For FCC/Central-6, Personnel Investigation Records, the categories ofrecords included in the system is expanded to include, in some instances,photographs of the subject individual. 2. For FCC/FOB-2, Violators File (on individual subjects of FCC field enforcementactions), a new intra-agency use is added which permits the forwardingof limited information via an automated database to the central computerfacility and field facilities. This use is compatible with the originalpurpose of the records. Because this modification constitutes a changein computer configuration, the FCC is establishing safeguards to counteractthe increased potential for unauthorized access to the system. 3. FCC/OMD-3, National Industry Advisory Committee Membership File, isrenamed ``Federal Advisory Committee Membership File'' and the categoriesof individuals covered by the system are expanded to include members ofall advisory committees sponsored or co-sponsored by FCC. The expansionis necessary for the FCC to properly administer the committees it sponsorspursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. This change avoids theunnecessary duplication that would result from creating a separate systemof records for each type of advisory committee. Also, new compatible routineuses are being established to permit disclosures that are permitted bythe Federal Advisory Committee Act. New Systems of Records: Two new systems of records are included in this document: FCC/Central-8,Telephone Call Detail Records, is being established by the FCC to enableit to carry out a program to help it control the costs of operating itstelephone system. The proposes for this collection of information are (1)to deter the use of the telephone system for unofficial purposes and (2)to recover for the agency the cost of unofficial calls. FCC/OGC-7 is being established by the FCC Office of General Counsel toenable it to implement orders received from courts of competent jurisdictionor authorized government entities concerning garnishment or levy of wagespayabled to FCC employees, as set forth in the system notice publishedbelow. These systems will be effective 60 days from publication, unless commentsreceived require a contrary determination. Deletion of Existing Systems:A total of eight FCC systems of records are being deleted, all of whichlast appeared in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 30, 1981, 46 FR 63108. Six systems are being deleted because they are not systems of records asdefined by the Privacy Act, in that information in the six systems is notretrievable by name of individual: FCC/BCB-1, Broadcast Station OwnershipFile; FCC/CTB-1, Cable Operator Ownership File; FCC/CCB-2, Contracts forPersonal Services; FCC/CCB-3, Employment Discrimination Complaints AgainstCommon Carriers; FCC/OMD-1, Docket History Cards; and FCC/PRB-3, CurrentProjects File (Applications/Licensees that may not comply with rules).One system FCC/PRB-1, Amateur and CB License Fees, Refunded and Uncollectable,is being deleted because it is no longer maintained and all records formerlyin the system have been destroyed. Also, FCC is deleting FCC/Central-3,Grievance Records because the records have been incorporated into anothersystem, FCC/OMD-2, as explained above. Blanket Routine Uses: The Commission is establishing general or ``blanket'' routine uses thatmay be made of the information in its systems of records. The followingblanket routine uses may be applied to, and incorporated by reference into,every record system maintained within the Commission. The extent of theirapplication is indicated by a listing of the blanket routine use numbersin each individual system notice. These blanket routine uses are publishedin this manner in order to avoid unnecessary repetition and in the interestof simplicity and economy, rather than repeating them in each individualsystem of records notice: 1. ROUTINE USE_LAW ENFORCEMENT: Where there is an indication of a violationor potential violation of a statute, regulation, rule, or order, the relevantrecords may be referred to the appropriate Federal, state, or local agencyresponsible for investigating or prosecuting a violation or for enforcingor implementing the statute, rule, regulation or order. 2.
