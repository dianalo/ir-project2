That's the interest the Fed charges on loans to member banks andsavings institutions, and it's considered the most direct vehiclefor the central bank to make its credit policies known. Mosteconomists predicted the discount rate would be raised 0.5percentage point to 7 percent.   The Fed already had given numerous indirect signals of its desireto keep credit tight.   This past week alone, it stood by while another importantinterest rate, the federal funds rate, headed sharply higher. Therate on funds, or overnight loans between banks, had gone as high as9.25 percent on Thursday before closing at 8.87{ percent, up from8.37{ Wednesday. The rate had been well below 8 percent for most ofthe summer.   Had it wanted to keep interest rates down, or loosen credit, theFed would have injected more reserves into the open market throughthe purchase of government securities.   But, ``it failed to counteract the uprward pressures that havetaken place,'' said William V. Sullivan, director of money marketresearch for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``That was a very clearsignal.''   Over the past few months, the Fed has allowed the fed funds rateto move higher to keep inflation in check, driving up the yields onTreasury bills and most other short-term securities. Long-term ratesalso have risen, including rates on commercial mortgages and homeequity loans.   Some economists are predicting the bank prime lending rate, whichwas raised a half percentage point to 10.5 percent in late November,will reach 11 percent by the end of the year.   Concerns about inflation, coupled with the dollar's recentweakness in foreign exchange, have been mainly responsible for therise in interest rates, economists say.   Carol A. Stone, a senior economist for Nomura SecuritiesInternational Inc., said this past week's government report onretail sales especially fueled the inflation fears because it showedbrisk economic growth.   The report said that November retail sales rose 1.1 percentfollowing an upwardly revised 1.6 percent increase the previousmonth.   ``What we had thought some months ago was that consumer spendingwas only sluggish ...,'' Stone said. ``It now looks like consumershave been spending at a pretty good rate since the summer and thatthere's more ... economic activity.''   Other economic reports released this past week showed thatnationwide industrial production rose a brisk 0.5 percentage pointsin November and that factory use climbed 0.2 percentage points tothe highest level in nine years.   Raising interest rates will amount to throwing cold water oneconomic growth because it will make borrowing costs for businessesand consumers more expensive.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Dec. 17-18</NOTE></DOC>
