U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell blamed the dilemma not onindependent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh but on an inter-departmentaltask force that has control over hundreds of thousands of secretdocuments that may be needed in the case.   ``A stone wall is being built up between this court and thetrial,'' Gesell said at the end of a day-long pre-trial hearing.   Noting that Walsh has tried to get the documents for thedefense, the judge said: ``The responsibility lies with theattorney general and the White House. I want to find out promptlywhat is taking place and what is going to take place.''   Gesell said the case has encountered a serious obstacle becauseof the administration's ``intentional withholding of documentsnecessary for the defense.''   He also has said the case cannot go to trial unless theadministration declassifies relevant documents that may beintroduced into evidence.   Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten said, ``There iscertainly no attempt being made to impede the process in any way....   ``We're talking about a large volume of material here that needscareful examination. The task force, with Justice Departmentinvolvement, is working as fast as they can to process thedocuments,'' he said.   Korten noted that the task force is ``not something totallywithin Justice Department control. It's something that involves anumber of different agencies'' including the White House, the StateDepartment, the Defense Department and the CIA. ``It is not aprocess that works quickly.''   Gesell said, ``We cannot satisfy the maximum desires of theinter-departmental committee'' and added he was not interested intrying to summarize ``contents of masses of documents.''   ``We are not going to sit around in court, in a series of secrethearings, and rewrite the documents and get them ready for trial.That is not (the way to conduct) a trial in this country,'' he said.   The question of the classified documents _ to be discussed at ahearing Thursday _ and defense accusations of improperevidence-gathering by the prosecution dim chances of an early trialdate, although Gesell did not address the date directly.   He said there would be hearings on those two matters throughMay. Gesell originally sought a July trial date, while the defensehas said it will not be ready until next March. Walsh said he isready to go to trial in July.   Gesell said he was gravely concerned about the classifieddocuments, sternly warning prosecutors ``the case will have to bedismissed'' if the records are not turned over to defendants OliverL. North, John M. Poindexter, Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord.   Walsh said 24,597 classified government documents are nowavailable for review by the defense team, only slightly more thanthe 24,000 pages that Walsh said were ready two weeks ago.   Gesell has ordered Walsh to make up to 300,000 pages ofclassified documents available to the defendants.   The judge said, ``I was extremely disturbed by theimplications'' of a motion filed Tuesday by Hakim, who complainedthat Walsh was trying to limit his access to the most sensitivedocuments gathered in the investigation.   At a previous hearing, Gesell said all defendants and theirlawyers must have access to the records, including Hakim _ abusinessman who never has been granted a security clearance.   The other three defendants have had long military careers _North in the Marine Corps, Poindexter in the Navy and Secord in theAir Force _ during which they frequently handled classifiedmaterials.   Gesell said he wants to ``break what appears to be a veryserious logjam'' over the records.   The defendants are charged with conspiring to defraud the UnitedStates by illegally diverting money from secret U.S. arms sales toIran to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels when such assistance wasbanned by law.   The 23-count indictment also accuses North, Hakim and Secord ofimproperly benefiting financially from the arms sales profits,which it says belonged to the United States.   North is the former National Security Council staffer whodirected the Iran and Contra assistance operations; Poindexter, whoapproved North's activities, was President Reagan's nationalsecurity adviser; and Secord and Hakim were businessmen recruitedby North to handle logistics and finances in both operations.   The problem of prosecution evidence-gathering results fromcongressional grants of limited immunity for North, Hakim andPoindexter when they testified before Congress on the Iran-Contraaffair last summer. Secord testified without immunity.   Immunity grants bar Walsh from using testimony of the threedefendants in prosecution against them, except in cases of perjury.The defense has accused Walsh and his assistant prosecutors ofusing just such evidence, with North attorney Brendan V. SullivanJr. saying the prosecutor's procedures to avoid ``taint'' were``laughable on their face.''   Gesell ordered this week's limited hearing on the immunityquestion to determine if he would need a much longer pre-trialsession on the subject. He decided Wednesday that the expandedhearing would be necessary before trial.   ``We're a long way from any resolution'' of the question, Gesellsaid. ``I want the benefit of a full argument on both sides. Itought to be clear there is a ... problem.'' He acknowledged thatthe difficulty was caused by Congress' decision to grant theimmunity.   As he did in a hearing on Monday, Walsh took the witness standWednesday to describe the precautions he and his staff took toavoid exposure to testimony given under immunity.   Walsh testified that Judith Hetherton, an associate counsel onhis staff, had to cut off a Justice Department official who hadstarted to convey to her testimony from North to the House-SenateIran-Contra committee last summer.   ``She had to really be forceful with him to get him to stop,''he testified.   The Washington Post quoted a Justice Department spokesman assaying that the official was Assistant Attorney General WilliamBradford Reynolds but that his remark to Ms. Hetherton was only abrief inadvertent reference to a segment of North's testimony.   Hetherton was one of the prosecutors who questioned Reynoldswhen he appeared before a grand jury earlier this year forquestioning about his role in the November 1986 investigation ofthe Iran-Contra affair.   In addition to general instructions to his staff, theindependent counsel said he took extraordinary steps at times _even ordering staffers to take a two-week vacation after Poindexterbegan to testify. Walsh did the same.   Even so, he said, there was the day he turned on the lights inhis hotel room to sign for breakfast, and accidentally saw a bannerheadline in the newspaper on Poindexter's testimony.   Another time, Walsh testified, his daughter called him afterNorth's testimony to say ``she didn't realize how difficult'' hisjob was. ``I learned there was enough of an impact (from thecongressional testimony) to have her call,'' he said.   And Gesell indicated that it was impossible for anyone to avoidthe impact of the case, pointing out that he saw a ``North ForPresident'' sticker on the way to his Virginia farm.</TEXT></DOC>
