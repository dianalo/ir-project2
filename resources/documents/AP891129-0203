Krenz insisted that East Germany will remain a staunchlysocialist state, sovereign and independent.   The United States already has given its support to uniting theGermanys, whose common border is considered the dividing line ofEast and West and was established after the Nazi defeat in WorldWar II.   Soviet officials on Wednesday rejected a reunificiation planadvanced by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and said a unitedGermany could upset European stability.   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher informedBritish officials about the proposal in London Wednesday andplanned a similar stop in Paris Thursday. He will brief the Sovietson it Tuesday in Moscow.   About 10,000 people marched late Wednesday in a CommunistParty-organized rally in Leipzig, considered a hotbed ofpro-democracy opposition.   ``There is no collective guilt of the Communist Party,'' saidcity party leader Thomas Bonesky, referring to widespreadcorruption being uncovered during the leadership of oustedhard-line party chief Erich Honecker.   Speakers clearly rejected reunification, the official EastGerman news agency ADN said.   Krenz and other East German Communist leaders have rejected anytalk of reunification, despite sweeping changes and upheavals inthis troubled nation. He and Communist Premier Hans Modrow signedan appeal circulated by leading dissidents demanding an East Germanstate that offers ``a socialist alternative to West Germany.'' Itwas initiated by writer Stefan Heym and other East Germanintellectuals concerned about the nation's future.   Krenz told the organizers in a letter: ``We have the historicduty to preserve this country with its anti-fascist ideals andtraditions as a socialist alternative within German development.''   Echoing the petition's sentiments, he called for ``peace andsocial justice, individual freedom, freedom of travel for all andthe preservation of the environment.''   His government, bowing to reform demands, already has promisedfree elections by early 1991 and a constitutional amendmentstripping it of its 40-year monopoly on power.   Kohl says East Germany must hold free elections if it wants WestGerman aid and closer ties.   Kohl on Tuesday outlined his 10-point reunification plan, whichreceived the approval of West Germany's opposition Social Democrats.   Kohl discussed his proposal Wednesday with President Bush in a``very intensive and complete telephone conversation,'' governmentspokesman Hans Klein said in Bonn.   West Germany sent the plan to its embassies worldwide, andambassadors were told ``to deliver it to the host governments'' andexplain it, Klein said.   In Rome, where Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev began astate visit on Wednesday, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman GennadyI. Gerasimov told reporters, ``Not one country in Europe is anxiousto see a united Germany because it could upset the presentstability in Europe.''   He said Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told Italianofficials that before Moscow would reconsider, West Germany mustrenounce any claim to Germany's pre-World War II borders, whichincluded many areas now belonging to Poland, the Soviet Union andother border states.   Gerasimov deputy Yuri A. Gremitskykh said in Moscow that Kohlpresented his proposal ``without considering the opinions of othercountries. ... We can clearly see an attempt to shift the movementthat started in East Germany to nationalistic lines.''   Many Europeans fear a reunified Germany, with a population of 80million people, would dominate the continent politically andeconomically.   Kohl sought to ease such worries Tuesday by saying a unitedGermany would never again threaten Europe.   He did not offer a timetable for reunification, but said itcould take years.   Reunification talk began after East Germany opened its bordersand the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9 as part of a policy allowing citizensto travel freely.   The moves came after thousands fled their homeland and hundredsof thousands took to the streets demanding social and politicalreforms.   The party ousted Honecker Oct. 18 and the new leadership hasbegun exposing corruption and abuses by party members.   East German newspapers on Wednesday described how former PremierWilli Stoph turned a natural park into a private estate.   Stoph was sacked from the ruling Politburo and resigned aspremier Nov. 7.   The official Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland said hehad lived ``surrounded by Western luxury'' on an estate containinghouses, fruit plantations and an indoor swimming pool.   East German opposition groups, church leaders and the Communistsare to meet Dec. 7 for the first round of talks on reform.</TEXT></DOC>
