The sale is viewed by many diplomats as an important step toward cementing U.S. ties with the strategically important south Asian country, while U.S. executives have said it could help open up a bountiful market for American goods. The negotiations also have been watched by other developing nations in need of American technology, as a test of the way the U.S. will reconcile the conflicting goals of pushing free trade internationally and guarding U.S. technological secrets more tightly.    Some Pentagon officials have worried that expanded trade with India, in particular, would increase the risk that U.S. technological secrets will seep into the hands of the Soviet Union, India's major military supplier and longtime friend. But the U.S. says it now is satisfied that the sale of the Cray supercomputer will meet all of its security requirements.    Shortly after U.S. Ambassador John Gunther Dean signed an agreement in New Delhi allowing the sale, the Commerce Department issued a license to the Minneapolis company to sell an XMP-14 supercomputer to India's Ministry of Science and Technology. Cray said the sale represented the first U.S. transfer of such advanced technology to a buyer outside Western Europe and Japan.    The accord ended prolonged negotiations over the conditions of the sale and which model computer the U.S. would allow India to have. India wanted an XMP-24, which has double the processing capacity of the XMP-14, but U.S. officials convinced New Delhi that the smaller machine could handle the intended load.    State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the XMP-14 is &quot;in fact more modern, sophisticated and capable than the supercomputers used for weather forecasting by the U.S. Weather Service.&quot;    The agreement was clinched in time to brighten the stage for Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's second visit to Washington, later this month. Mr. Gandhi, who also holds the post of science and technology minister in his government, placed a high priority on the acquisition.    The State Department said the transfer will add luster to a broader science and technology agreement that President Reagan signed with the Mr. Gandhi's mother, the late Indira Gandhi, in 1982. The Reagan administration is using specific sales made under this accord to wean India away from its technological dependence on the Soviet Union.    The U.S. and India also are negotiating terms for New Delhi's proposed purchase of sophisticated cockpit instruments for its new jet fighter, called the Light Combat Aircraft. But certain security problems have yet to be overcome. The U.S. says it has to be convinced that its secrets would be safe with Hindustan Aerospace Ltd., a state-owned Indian firm that will manufacture the new fighter. Hindustan Aerospace currently builds Mig-21 jets under license from the Soviet Union.    India has promised to keep the Cray supercomputer at the ministry's weather research facility and to allow Cray personnel continuous access to it. In effect, that arrangement will give the U.S. continuous information on how the computer will be used.    &quot;We'll be watching the machine, but purely for maintenance needs,&quot; said John Swanson, a Cray marketing manager. The XMP-14, valued at $8.3 million, is one of the less-expensive models marketed by Cray, although the firm says its basic technology is still &quot;state of the art.&quot; The firm has sold a more powerful model, the XMP-48, to the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting in Reading, England, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. </TEXT></DOC>
