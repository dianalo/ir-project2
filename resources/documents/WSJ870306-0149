Redstone could easily rest on his laurels as one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the entertainment industry.    A tenacious executive who once survived a Boston hotel fire by hanging from a window ledge by his fingertips, he controls one of the largest movie theater chains in the country. And, through a series of shrewd entertainment-related investments, he has built a personal fortune estimated at half a billion dollars.    But with his latest investment Mr. Redstone takes on the biggest challenge of his career. Late Wednesday a unit of his National Amusements Inc. won the bidding war for New York-based Viacom International Inc. with a $3.4 billion offer, after sweetening the price three times to compete with a management leveraged buyout plan. Jokes Mr. Redstone, &quot;This could add another 10 years to my life.&quot;    Mr. Redstone's task now is to figure out how he will run Viacom, which dwarfs most of his previous ventures. Viacom produces television shows and motion pictures, owns cable television and broadcast properties and is a major syndicator of television programs. Though no decisions have been made yet, industry executives say that tensions built up during the takeover battle make it highly unlikely that any of Viacom's top management will stay.    Mr. Redstone says he is impressed with many of Viacom's midlevel managers and with some executives who left the company within the past 12 months -- before the takeover battle. But he also expects to have a strong hand in operations himself.    The feisty executive successfully built and runs the 400-screen National Amusements theater chain, a lean operation with practically no corporate staff. But as a manager he has never ventured outside the movie theater business. Though he has owned shares in half a dozen publicly held entertainment concerns, he has always sold his stake after realizing a handsome gain on his position.    Initially, he says, he regarded Viacom as an investment, too. But as he delved deeper into the company's operations, and saw what he believed to be untapped potential in some of its markets, he says he decided to go for the whole company.    &quot;I have a great feeling for the company,&quot; says Mr. Redstone. &quot;It's on the cutting edge of so many growth businesses.&quot;    Mr. Redstone also has become increasingly concerned about the lack of growth in his own basic business. Box office revenue has been generally flat in recent years and the theater-going audience appears static. While he pioneered the concept of &quot;multiplexing&quot; -- placing as many as twelve screens in one giant location -- he says there are fewer opportunities for growth in that exhibition strategy now.    &quot;While we don't intend to get out of our business, our opportunities for expansion are more limited today,&quot; he says. &quot;Good new locations by giant highways and other local areas don't exist anymore.&quot;    Some critics say that in his zeal to win the bidding contest, and thus diversify, Mr. Redstone may have overpaid for Viacom. The Viacom management's initial leveraged buyout bid was $2.7 billion, and even that price was thought too much by a number of rivals that looked at Viacom as a potential acquisition.    During several decades as a theater owner negotiating terms with studios to show their movies, Mr. Redstone has gained a reputation as an iron-willed deal maker. A graduate of Harvard Law School, where he still teaches an entertainment law course, Mr. Redstone helped crack Japanese signal codes during World War II and later served as a special assistant to the U.S. attorney general. He is married and has a son and daughter, both lawyers, who aren't currently involved in the family business.    After practicing law in Washington for 12 years, the Boston native joined the family-owned drive-in movie business and turned it into a thriving indoor theater operation in the Northeast and Midwest. Unlike most large theater chains, which lease their real estate, Mr. Redstone owns his theaters and land as a hedge against the fickle entertainment business.    Mr. Redstone has made some particularly shrewd -- and lucky -- investments over the years. He made $25 million from a 10% stake in Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. when Coca-Cola Co. bought the company. He made an additional $20 million on his interest in Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. when oilman Marvin Davis took the company private, and he made a gain of $15 million by selling his 7.1% share in MGM/UA Home Entertainment Inc. back to the company.    While Viacom has such valuable assets as syndication rights to the top rated &quot;Bill Cosby Show,&quot; it also owns the struggling Showtime pay cable channel. Showtime has paid dearly for exclusive rights to some movies but has lost subscribers recently and remains a distant second to Time Inc.'s Home Box Office service.    Mr. Redstone acknowledges that some Viacom operations pose a &quot;difficult&quot; challenge. But he says Showtime's prospects should perk up as new film titles become available under the exclusive contracts.    With the acquisition of Viacom, National Amusements also becomes the largest shareholder in Orion Pictures Inc., a small studio whose stock price has benefited heavily from such successful movies as the current release &quot;Platoon&quot; and last year's &quot;Back to School&quot; as well as Woody Allen's recent films. Viacom owns 15% of the studio, and Mr. Redstone recently acquired a 6.4% stake. </TEXT></DOC>
