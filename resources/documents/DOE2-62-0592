Data collection,storage, and retrieval of single-well data, field data, and general informationare practiced by most oil companies. A field usually contains a wealthof information in the form of log, core, geological, geophysical, testand production data, and these should be used collectively to enhancethe understanding of the reservoir's geometry and dynamics. At present,most items of data are collected and processed independently. What hasnot been effectively achieved is a dynamic data base in which all thedata can be interacted and efficiently used to obtain field maps andgrids, well-to-well correlations, and transforms to optimize data inwells where data are limited. This paper discusses the principle, structure,and application of a dynamic data base that allows data to be not onlyretrieved and displayed, but also used to evaluate trends, calibrateand reinterpret new and old data, and optimize both the single-well andfield results. Additional data are readily integrated into the system;in addition, the data base can e used to check and calibrate new dataand then to update existing field models, trends, and grids. Statisticalbanks can be created and used to optimize the information from old loggingsuites and to estimate missing parameters, such as permeability. Fieldand reservoir zone parameters can be modified easily. Output data, inthe form of tabulations, maps, and grids, can be obtained readily andused as input data in reservoir simulation. Examples that demonstratehow the data base can be used effectively by all levels of managementare presented.</TEXT></DOC>
