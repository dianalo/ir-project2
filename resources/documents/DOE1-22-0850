In the confined, strong coupling phase, the propagatorresembles that of a massive particle. In the weak coupling phase, thepropagator is that of a massless particle. An abrupt change occurs atthe transition point. The results are compared to simulations of thegluon propagator in SU(3) lattice gauge theory.</TEXT></DOC>
