The 559 legislators, who for 19 months battled over the245-article document, cheered and shouted ``Brazil is changing!''as the president of the Constituent Assembly, Ulysses Guimaraes,declared law the new document.   ``I declare enacted the constitution of liberty, of dignity, ofdemocracy and social justice,'' Guimaraes, 72, said in a voice thatstruggled above thunderous applause. ``May God help us enforce it.''   Brazil's new democratic charter leaves behind the oldauthoritarian document that was handed down by military generals in1969.   The enactment was the last step in Brazil's return to fullydemocratic rule begun in March 1985, when Jose Sarney becameBrazil's first civilian president since a 1964 right-wing militarycoup.   ``We have created a new Brazil, a new social and economicorder,'' Dante de Oliveira of the governing Democratic MovementParty said after the ceremony. ``We have taught the world animportant lesson, peacefully overturning an authoritarian regime.''   The new document, a mixture of left-leaning, conservative andnationalistic articles that touch almost all aspects of life fromland reform to interest rates, granted none of the arbitrary powersused by the repressive military government during 21 years to rulethe country.   The new charter bans censorship, removes the president's powerto simply decree law and outlaws torture, which in the past wasused against the military government's political opponents.   But many of the articles were confusing. Several such as areduced work week, more maternity leave and extra pay for overtimeimmediately became law; 154 would need complimentary legislation tobecome effective.   One such confusing article limited ``real'' interest rates to 12percent though no one knows what ``real'' interest rates ininflation-ridden Brazil are. Inflation in Brazil is averaging morethan 350 percent over the last 12 months.   One of the most controversial articles fought over bylegislators, who shouted each other down in day-long debates andoften resorted to physical violence, set presidential elections inNovember 1989. Brazilians haven't voted for president since 1960.   Representatives from 21 Latin American and Portuguese-speakingnations watched legislators enact Brazil's eighth constitutionsince the country gained independence from Portugal in 1822.</TEXT></DOC>
