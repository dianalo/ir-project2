TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A poll published today said 56 percent ofIsraelis oppose any peace talks with the PLO. Arab sources saidPalestinian moderates have been threatened with death if theycontinue talking with Israelis.   The poll by the independent polling group Modain Ezrachi,published in the daily Maariv newspaper, contrasted with findings ofa survey published in December by Dahaf Institute, which is alsoindependent.   The earlier poll said 54 percent of Israelis favored talks withthe Palestine Liberation Organization if it dropped terroristoperations against Israel.   The new poll of 1,251 randomly selected Israelis dropped anyreference to ending terrorism and found 56 percent said ``no'' whenasked: ``Do you believe there is room for negotiations with the PLOand if so, towards what end?''   Rachel Israeli of Modain Ezrachi said the reason for the swing ofopinion was because the new survey simply asked about talks withoutthe question of terrorism. ``Many people do not believe the PLO hasstopped their terror activities,'' she said.   In the new poll, 8 percent favored talks with the PLO on anindependent state in the occupied lands, 17 percent endorsed talksaimed at establishing a state in Jordan, 12 percent endorsed talkson autonomy for Palestinians, and 7 percent said Israel should talkto the PLO on other issues.   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percent.   PLO chief Yasser Arafat declared in December that his group wasrenouncing terrorism and recognizing Israel's right to exist. Thestatements led the United States to begin a dialogue with the PLO.   Israel refuses to talk to the PLO, saying it is a terroristorganization.   In the West Bank town of Nablus, Palestinian sources said atleast seven Palestinian moderates have been threatened with death ifthey continue exploratory talks with Israelis.   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that onMarch 17, two masked Arab youths claiming to represent theSyrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine visitedthe moderates and gave what they called a ``last warning.''   The moderates, most of them Arafat supporters, were told to haltmeetings with Israelis and foreign delegations.   The Popular Front, a Marxist PLO faction, is opposed toconcessions Arafat has made in a bid to start peace negotiations.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was quoted today as saying in aninterview with the Maariv newspaper that he still believes there arenon-PLO Palestinians available for negotiations with Israel.   ``There can be leaders in the (occupied) territories who are notconnected with the PLO. There are among them wise people,intellectuals, but I am not going to reveal their names because itmay bring them harm,'' said Shamir.   Shamir vowed to continue a secret dialogue with Palestiniansbefore his trip to Washington in early April. He was quoted assaying he would present to the Bush administration ``things whichperhaps have not been heard from me before.'' He gave no details.   Also today, two Palestinians died of wounds sustained earlier,raising to 407 the number killed since the Palestinian uprisingagainst Israeli rule in the occupied lands began in December 1987.Eighteen Israelis have been killed.</TEXT></DOC>
