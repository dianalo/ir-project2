The PF4 disappearance after pre-treatment with 1500 APTT unitsof LMW heparin followed a monoexponential curve with an half-life of11.03+-1.69 minutes. PS at each dosage given 1 minute after LMW heparinand PF4, caused an immediate and deep drop of PF4 circulating level.A second LMW heparin bolus 10 minuts later induced in which 50 mg ofPS were given, the PF4 release was only 40% of that obtained in the ordertwo groups of animals.</TEXT></DOC>
