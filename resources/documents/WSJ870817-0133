WinterStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CMZ CTCO LIT AIL GLE TXT ALDINDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT, MACHINE TOOLS (IND) </IN><TEXT>   In the 1990s, fewer shops will be making machine tools in the U.S., and more of them will bear foreign names.    Which will they be? Industry executives and analysts see four breeds of machine-tool makers surviving into the 21st century:    --The handful of sizable machine-tool producers committed to metal-working and with the resources to develop systems that solve manufacturing problems. Cincinnati Milacron Inc. is on everyone's survivor list. Others likely to remain major players: Cross andamp; Trecker Co., of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; Ingersoll Milling Machine Co., of Rockford, Ill., and Litton Industries Inc., of Beverly Hills, Calif. Also likely to survive is Giddings andamp; Lewis Inc., a Fond du Lac, Wis., unit of AMCA International Ltd., of Hanover, N.H. AMCA denies rumors the business is for sale.    --The niche players -- &quot;boutiques of the machinery business,&quot; as one executive calls them -- that do one thing especially well. For instance, Gleason Corp., of Rochester, N.Y., makes machines to cut gears, and Minster Machine Co., of Minster, Ohio, specializes in presses that stamp out small parts. These pockets of precision will survive by meeting specific manufacturing problems better than anyone else.    --The U.S. branches of foreign toolmakers. One of the most modern machine-tool plants in the U.S. is operated at Florence, Ky., by the Mazak Corp. unit of Yamazaki Mazak Corp., a major Japanese producer. The plant has totally automated flexible-manufacturing systems and cells that produce parts without human supervision. Mazak imports spindles and some other important parts from Japan, but it puts the U.S. content of machining centers and lathes produced at Florence at more than 50%. Critical units are assembled in a clean room, where air is filtered to avoid getting dust between moving parts.    --And the systems integrators -- concerns that engineer production systems to meet a user's needs, often including machines produced by other builders. Litton's Industrial Automation Group does that, and Lamb Technicon, which Litton bought this year, is already working with automotive companies to help improve efficiency of existing plants and equipment.    Among the industry dropouts will be producers at both ends of the spectrum. Many small, family-held machine-tool companies can't afford to invest enough in product development and in modern production facilities to stay competitive. For many of them -- accustomed to weathering an order drought for a few years, then recouping with healthy profits when demand picked up -- the tough times have simply persisted too long.    Also throwing in the tool rags will be some large, diversified companies that jumped into the business because they expected a boom as U.S. industry rebuilt. Textron Inc., of Providence, R.I., says it has already decided &quot;to put our money somewhere else.&quot; It has sold several machine-tool businesses and is considering selling the rest. Allied-Signal Inc. sold the machine-tool operations that it obtained when it took over Bendix Corp. AB Electrolux of Sweden is likely to do the same with the White Consolidated Industries Inc. machine-tool business, which it bought with the appliance maker last year.    The survivors may have to make radical changes. They will use more of their own advanced manufacturing equipment to cut costs. &quot;We all have to stay lean and super quality-conscious,&quot; says Harold J. Winch, Minster's chief executive.    They also will have to put more emphasis on selling production systems instead of individual machines. And they may charge separately for engineering. Traditionally, those costs were recovered in profits on the sale of machine tools used in the system. With stiff price competition from imports, profits on machine tools may not be high enough, Cincinnati Milacron executives say.    Another possibility is a push into custom-parts production. Small machine-tool builders traditionally made parts for other manufacturers when orders were scarce. Now, some major producers are contracting to make parts for auto makers and other manufacturers instead of selling those companies the equipment to make their own parts. For example, Lamb is making some engine parts for General Motors Corp., and Cross andamp; Trecker is considering going into parts production. </TEXT></DOC>
