Beginning today, the exchange said, the margin requirement for the new purchase or sale of a July copper futures contract for speculating or hedging will be $8,000. On Tuesday, the July margin, or good faith deposit, was boosted to $4,000 from $900 for speculators and from $700 for hedgers, because of &quot;concentration of positions&quot; in the maturing July contract, which expires Wednesday.    The more expensive cost of trading didn't seem to damp the buying ardor, though, with July the strongest contract. It rose 0.9 cent a pound to 77.7 cents, boosting its premium over the September contract 0.6 cent, to 2.6 cents. Copper for September delivery settled at 75.1 cents a pound, up 0.3 cent. Usually the more deferred contract has a premium over the near-term position.    The July contract could &quot;expire on a very strong note,&quot; said William O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc. in New York.    Open interest in the July position, which stands at about 2,400 contracts, &quot;appears to be in very strong hands,&quot; Mr. O'Neill said, with holders expected to want to receive the copper when the contract matures, rather than liquidate their positions.    Meanwhile, the market has gone through its seasonal slow period &quot;with flying colors,&quot; said Mr. O'Neill, who expects fundamental demand to resume. &quot;We have not yet seen the end of this bull market.&quot;    The rise in prices &quot;on top of the margin increase, underscores the tight supply situation,&quot; said Bette Raptapoulos, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.    Another indication of the tightness in supplies, said Fred Demler, metals economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York, is that the premium for the spot position over deferred months again increased in New York, while holding steady in London.    Global copper supplies are equal to 4.3 weeks of consumption, &quot;substantially below the more normal stable level of seven to eight weeks,&quot; Mr. Demler said.    And although Comex warehouse inventories have increased in recent weeks, London Metal Exchange supplies have continued to decline, offsetting any impact of the Comex rise.    In other futures markets yesterday:    ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices tumbled as tensions in the Persian Gulf apparently eased. Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, said his country won't fire on any ships in the gulf unless provoked by another country. The statement, coupled with smooth sailing so far by the U.S. escort of Kuwaiti tankers in the gulf, led some traders to liquidate their long, or buying, positions, analysts and brokers said. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for September delivery fell 32 cents a barrel to $21.23. &quot;There's no real incentive at this point to buy,&quot; said William Byers, futures research director at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. in New York. &quot;The clear and present danger passed&quot; when the U.S.-flagged ships weren't fired on when they passed the Strait of Hormuz Wednesday, Mr. Byers said. However, some traders and analysts said they expect prices to firm today because the Kuwaiti tankers are expected to leave the gulf sometime over the weekend, potentially exposing them to the week's biggest threat of attack. &quot;I don't want to be short over the weekend,&quot; a New York trader said.    SUGAR: Futures prices hit a life-of-contract low amid absence of fresh world demand. October sugar fell 0.29 cent a pound to 5.95 cents, after slipping to a contract low of 5.92 cents. Thailand sold 14,000 metric tons of sugar but had been looking to sell 26,000 tons, and had to sell at prices lower than it expected, an analyst said. &quot;This added a bearish note to the market, although only a small one,&quot; he said. A metric ton is equal to 2,204.6 pounds. Tunisia bought 20,000 tons of sugar, while Pakistan will be shopping Saturday for about 15,000 tons. Peru Wednesday was looking to buy 12,000 tons, with no results reported yet, and next week Egypt, Syria and North Yemen are expected to be shopping. &quot;But this is old-hat stuff, the normal routine buying in the market that is taken in stride,&quot; the analyst said. At the moment, analysts said, the outlook is for increasing world-wide surpluses of sugar instead of the deficit predicted earlier in the year. A European trade house projected that the European beet crop is doing &quot;brilliantly&quot; and is expected to produce a surplus of about 5.2 million tons instead of the tiny surplus forecast about three months ago.    LIVESTOCK AND MEAT: Falling wholesale beef prices and expectations that today's cattle-on-feed report will be bearish pushed cattle futures prices lower. Analysts estimate that the Agriculture Department's quarterly report on 13 beef-producing states, set for release after the close today, will show the number of animals placed on feedlots rose as much as 16% during the second quarter from a year earlier -- although analysts say the year-earlier figures were depressed. &quot;Last year producers were reeling from the impact of the (government's) dairy-herd reduction program,&quot; which increased beef supplies because the slaughter increased, said Dale Durchholz, an analyst at AgriVisor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill. Hog futures also finished lower as slaughter levels continued to be below those indicated by the government's June hog and pig report. Tight supplies of deliverable pork bellies, or frozen uncured slabs of bacon, lifted the July contract to a life-of-contract high.    FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Most futures prices closed higher, led by a rebound in Japanese yen futures. The yen was higher on weakness in the dollar, a rise in stock and bond prices in Tokyo and a decline in oil prices, said Anne Mills, a futures analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. Because Japan relies heavily on imported oil, especially from countries surrounding the Persian Gulf, its financial markets often are affected by that region's tide of events, and yesterday's apparent easing of gulf tensions boded well for the yen. Canadian dollar futures fell sharply, depressed by technical selling, the weaker U.S. dollar and the drop in oil prices, analysts said. A major portion of Canada's economy is tied to oil-related industries. </TEXT></DOC>
