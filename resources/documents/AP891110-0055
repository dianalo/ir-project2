But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said Thursday residentsof both places largely avoided the most common killer historicallyfrom hurricanes: the storm surge, a wall of water that builds upahead of the storm's intense low pressure.   The agency, reviewing reports by officials in 25 South Carolinacounties, said only one person died when Hugo's 17-foot storm surgeswept the South Carolina coast on Sept. 21-22 _ a 60-year-old womanin her mobile home.   No storm-surge deaths were reported when Hugo lashed Puerto Ricothree days earlier.   In Puerto Rico, most of the Hugo-related deaths wereelectrocutions among repair workers after the storm.   In South Carolina, besides the woman killed in the storm surge,five people drowned while trying to bring boats inland atCharleston, four were crushed in mobile homes, two were killed byfalling trees and one died in a house collapse.   After the storm, nine people in South Carolina were killed infive separate house fires blamed on the use of candles during poweroutages. Another four people were electrocuted during cleanup andrepair work, two were killed by falling trees and one died in achain saw accident.   Because of the South Carolina deaths, the CDC on Thursdayrecommended more efforts to educate the public in hurricane areasabout the hazards of candles, the need to evacuate mobile homes andthe hazards of boating during the approach of a hurricane.</TEXT></DOC>
