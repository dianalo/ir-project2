The decision requires importers to pay countervailing duties equal to the rates at which these products are alleged to have been subsidized.    Normally, such duties only would be imposed if the International Trade Commission found that the subsidized imports are hurting U.S. producers. But the additional finding isn't necessary in this case because Argentina isn't a signatory to the subsidies code issued by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based body regulating international trade.    The department estimated that the subsidy rates for light-walled and heavy-walled rectangular tubing from Argentina are 9.25% and 24.25%, respectively. Such tubing is used in the manufacture of farm machinery and construction and material-handling equipment.    The department assigned subsidy rates of 7.35% and 5.77% to Argentine line pipes and standard pipes, respectively. Line pipes are used to convey gas, oil and water, while standard pipes have more common applications such as plumbing and fence construction.    Imports of all these products from Argentina amounted to $16.3 million in 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
