Five of those arrested in New York were charged with conspiringto supply 1,000 M-16 military rifles to undercover federal agentsand to provide false documents so the rifles could be shipped toLibya.   The breakup of the Asian ring was the culmination of a two-yearinvestigation called Operation Bamboo Dragon that was launched whenfederal agents learned that a restaurant owner in the Chinatownsection of Washington was buying stolen firearms and distributingcocaine.   The FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the DrugEnforcement Administration and the U.S. Customs Service conductedthe investigation and law enforcement officials announced thearrests at a news conference in Washington.   Drug-importing Asian criminal gangs ``are moving in to fill thevoid'' left by the successful prosecution of Sicilian Mafia membersin the United States, FBI Director William Sessions said in astatement.   ``This gang was capable of putting enormous firepower into thehands of terrorists and drug smugglers,'' Customs commissionerWilliam von Raab said in a statement. Federal officials said thering had supplied 600 handguns, mostly to Chinese gangs.   The FBI and ATF inserted undercover operatives into the ring,including a Chinese-speaking agent who portrayed himself as a drugdealer.   The Cantonese-speaking federal agent, Frederick Yau, met withgang members in Washington and Hong Kong to negotiate the purchaseof heroin from Asia.   The heroin came from Burma and China and was transported to SanFrancisco and New York City's Chinatown. It also was distributed toNewark, N.J., Alexandria, Va., and Washington.   U.S. members of the ring were selling hundreds of stolen orillegally obtained hand- and machine guns and rifles on the streetsof New York City, usually to Chinese gangs.   Many of the firearms were obtained with fraudulentidentification documents from gun shops in Fort Worth, Dallas andHouston, Texas, the officials said.   The Chinese gangs were buying AR-15 semi-automatic rifles _ thecivilian version of the Army's M-16 rifle _ and converting theminto fully automatic M-16s.   Customs and ATF undercover agents bought 10 weapons from thefive people charged in New York City and ordered 1,000 more M-16sthat were to be delivered to Libya. Such shipments would haveviolated the Arms Export Control Act, which sets up federallicensing procedures for the sale of weapons to foreign countries.</TEXT></DOC>
