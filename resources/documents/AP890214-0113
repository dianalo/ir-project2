Department officials said in a statement that negotiators fromthe two countries had decided that illegal salmon fishing on thehigh seas by other nations represented an ``irrational and wastefulharvesting method and that all efforts should be taken to preventthe unauthorized possession, harvest, transport and sale of salmonin the North Pacific.''   American fishing groups have contended that illegal catches byforeign trawlers, sometimes under the guise of fishing for squid,have already resulted in depleted salmon runs in the PacificNorthwest and Alaska.   Soviet and U.S. negotiators, meeting last week in Washington,signed a memorandum of understanding in which the two countriesagreed to ``increase their bilateral cooperation in the field ofenforcing salmon conservation measures.''   Under the agreement, the two countries will exchange informationon illegal salmon fishing gathered by patrol vessels andsurveillance aircraft in the North Pacific and any information onthe sale, purchase and transport of such fish.   The two countries also agreed to work together on various``enforcement issues,'' though the memorandum provided no specifics.   In addition, they agreed to hold a symposium on Pacific salmonbiology in the Soviet Union.   On other topics, the negotiators reviewed measures the twocountries might take to regulate pollock fishing in an area of theBering Sea known as the ``doughnut hole.''   Both countries have previously expressed concern that expandedfishing by foreign trawlers in the ``doughnut hole'' may bedepleting stocks within the two nations' 200-mile fishing zones.   The U.S. Coast Guard and American fishing groups have alsocontended that foreign trawlers use the ``doughnut hole'' for astaging area to sneak into the 200-mile U.S. economic zone undercover of darkness or bad weather to fish illegally.</TEXT></DOC>
