Performance and costs are estimated from data on plants of varioustypes in operation in several countries or offered by makers. Size isfound to have very little influence on the specific investment cost overthe entire size range if one allows for the fact that small plants usuallycan be accommodated in existing buildings while larger plants mostlyrequire new buildings. Also maintenance costs per kWh are comparativelyinsensitive to size. Alternative projections are made regarding the salesprices for electricity from such plants at a time when the planned phaseout of nuclear power in Sweden is well on its way, and projections ofnatural gas prices at a time Denmark, Norway and Finland compete forthe Swedish natural gas market.</TEXT></DOC>
