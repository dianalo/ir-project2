Equations have been developed for the clearnessindex Ksub(T), which is the ratio of monthly average daily values ofglobal radiation to that of extraterrestrial radiation on a horizontalsurface, as a function of the ratio of monthly average daily values ofsunshine hours and day length. The extraterrestrial radiation and theday length can be calculated. The sunshine hours can be obtained fromthe meteorological station of Singapore. A reasonable estimate of monthlyaverage daily global radiation can be obtained from these equations.</TEXT></DOC>
