At least there are some unspoiled markets left, like old-fashioned auctions, where open competition sets the price. Or are there?    The Justice Department, which spent the past two years investigating antique dealers in the Philadelphia area, found that dealers routinely banded together and agreed not to bid against one another at auctions, a practice called pooling.    Only one dealer in a pool would bid. Later pool members would hold a private session, called a &quot;knockout,&quot; and re-auction the goods among themselves. The extra money paid for each item would be divided among the poolers.    In one case, Margaret Hood, a widow from Chadds Ford, Pa., watched bidders go up to $1,325 for a desk she sold at a 1984 auction. She didn't learn until much later, during one dealer's trial, that the desk brought $5,000 at the knockout session.    Twelve Philadelphia antique dealers were charged by the Justice Department with antitrust violations. Eleven pleaded guilty last fall and were fined between $1,000 and $50,000, and given probationary sentences up to three years. The 12th was found guilty by a jury, sentenced to 30 days of house arrest and fined $30,000.    Department officials believe illegal pooling is widespread in America's $100 billion-a-year auction markets. In pursuing the antique auction case, investigators picked up a trail that has led to others. Nineteen corporations and seventeen of their officials in six states have been indicted for pooling in machinery auctions. All but four individuals and four corporations have pleaded guilty or have had their charges dismissed. The others go to trial in federal court next month in Newark, N.J. Now the department is investigating jewelry and rug auctions in New York City.    Charles F. Rule, assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, says, &quot;We've only just begun. Our objective here is to stop pooling, and we will follow it into whatever industry and state it leads.&quot;    Pooling always works to shortchange the seller. &quot;Our records show that pooling antique dealers regularly paid 50% to 100% more at the knockouts&quot; than at the original sale, says Roger L. Currier, a Justice Department lawyer in Philadelphia. &quot;Auction after auction and year after year, that adds up.&quot;    Pooling has an old if not exactly honorable history in this country, dating back at least to the turn of the century. Despite scattered court cases, mostly involving auctions of tobacco, cattle, timber and other commodities, the practice has gone practically unchallenged in art, antiques and industrial products. It has been perceived in the trade as customary and sometimes as sleazy but also inevitable.    At times, dealers gathered in conspicuous clumps at auctions for rugs, jewelry and silver in New York and then were seen openly rebidding for the goods at neighborhood cafes. &quot;It was just an accepted thing, and it still goes on,&quot; says Arthur Halpern, a New York rug dealer. &quot;If they (other dealers) think you will bid against them and raise prices, they will always ask people to pool.&quot;    &quot;Dealers liked to pool because even if they didn't go home with any merchandise, at least they would leave with cash in their pockets,&quot; says Daniel Comly, an industrial auctioneer in Philadelphia. &quot;I have seen pools in burlap, scrap metal and sewing machines. You can see them form up, see them watching each other (bid). My dad used to tell stories about burlap pools during the Depression.&quot;    Pooling is less likely at big auctions of widely collected objects, where large numbers of dealers and private buyers compete. It occurs more frequently at small sales of specialized goods that attract mostly dealers. Auctioneers say there isn't much they can do to combat pooling except set a secret minimum price, called a reserve. But reserve prices aren't practical at estate and bankruptcy sales where the seller wants everything sold at once.    Auctioneer Leslie Hindman recalls the first auction of estate jewelry she held after opening her Chicago auction house in 1982. &quot;All the jewelry dealers sat together, and only one was bidding. I was 28 years old and starting out, and I was so upset,&quot; says Ms. Hindman. &quot;I had no reserves, but I just refused to sell at those prices. I called off the auction and told the executor to sell the stuff in New York.&quot;    But that countertactic isn't always possible or practical. Ms. Hindman lost her commission on a $40,000 sale.    Interviews with some of the Philadelphia dealers show just how deeply the practice is ingrained. &quot;I pride myself in being an upstanding, law-abiding citizen who pays his taxes,&quot; says Morris Finkel, a silver-haired man who runs a quilt-filled antiques shop with his daughter, Amy. Until Federal Bureau of Investigation agents marched into his shop and asked whether he pooled, Mr. Finkel says, he had no idea the practice was illegal. &quot;The day I was allowed to go into the pool&quot; -- in the late 1940s -- &quot;was a banner day,&quot; he says. &quot;If you weren't in a pool, you weren't considered much of a dealer.&quot;    Like many of his colleagues, Mr. Finkel kept meticulous records of his pooling activity and used checks to make the knockout payments; the biggest single one he ever received, he says, was for $1,250.    &quot;We weren't trying to hide anything,&quot; he says. But he says he pleaded guilty because &quot;trying to fight the U.S. government was more than I could do.&quot; His sentence included $20,000 in fines, two years of probation and 500 hours of community service. Legal fees cost him $40,000.    Dealer Ronald Pook of Downington, Pa., says he also viewed his first invitation to pool, in the 1970s, as &quot;a mark of distinction.&quot; He says that pooling comes from a tradition of business friendship, not criminal intent. &quot;If you bid against another dealer, then he won't tell you next time a great little cupboard shows up (at auction) out his way,&quot; he says. &quot;Would you go to an auction and bid against a friend?&quot;    Mr. Pook fought the Justice Department and took his case to a jury, but lost. Like the other dealers charged in the case, Mr. Pook says he has stopped pooling and won't ever do it again. But others say the practice will never be eliminated. &quot;It is unpoliceable,&quot; says Beau Freeman, owner of a Philadelphia auction house.    Mr. Comly, the industrial auctioneer in Philadelphia, agrees: &quot;Instead of quitting the practice and letting the competitive atmosphere take its course, they (dealers) are changing the routine. Maybe they will form a joint venture to buy things, which isn't illegal, and then when they sell something, they will split the profits.&quot;    But the feds will be watching. If people buy together because they can't afford something alone, as museums sometimes team up at auction, that's fine, says Mr. Currier of the Justice Department. &quot;But if they are joining together to hold down the price,&quot; he says, &quot;that is illegal and we will treat them like felons.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
