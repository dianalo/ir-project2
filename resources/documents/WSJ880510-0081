Adler (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> SCR BON </IN><G> CNG SEC </G><TEXT>   Lawyers for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. will argue that Securities and Exchange Commission rules permit its employees to purchase parts of new junk-bond issues underwritten by the firm.    Drexel stopped the employee purchases last week after congressional subcommittee members charged that the purchases were unfair to Drexel's bond-buying customers. But Drexel's attorneys at Cahill Gordon andamp; Reindel are preparing to submit a brief to the subcommittee defending the past trades, according to a securities lawyer sympathetic to Drexel.    A Drexel spokesman confirmed that the attorneys were preparing a submission but declined to comment on its contents.    At issue is SEC Rule 10B6, a complex anti-fraud provision that bars market manipulation of newly issued securities. In essence, Rule 10B6 prohibits an underwriter from purchasing one of its new issues until outside investors have had their chance to buy.    Subcommittee members have charged that Drexel sold large blocks of newly issued junk bonds to investment partnerships that included about 150 Drexel officials. In some cases, the partnerships resold the bonds within days at large profits, according to trading data released by the subcommittee. Junk bonds are high-yielding issues that are rated below investment grade.    SEC general counsel Daniel Goelzer told the subcommittee that &quot;depending upon the facts, there would be a great likelihood of violating that rule if affiliates of the underwriter were buying the securities, then turning around and selling them themselves to the public.&quot; The SEC rule is aimed at preventing underwriters from creating artificial scarcities in new issues or otherwise meddling with the market in the security.    Drexel is likely to argue in its defense that the employees' investment partnerships operated independently and were not controlled by the firm, according to the securities lawyer sympathetic to Drexel's position. Under the SEC rule, only purchases by the firm or &quot;affiliates&quot; controlled by the firm are prohibited.    If the SEC brought an enforcement action against Drexel, a key question would be whether any top Drexel executive controlled trading in any of the investment partnerships.    Drexel also is likely to maintain that junk bonds should be exempt from the rule because prices of bonds cannot be manipulated as easily as stocks. Currently, investment-grade debt -- but not junk bonds -- are exempt from the SEC rule.    Drexel's attorneys are expected to present the brief soon to the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, chaired by Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), that has been looking into Drexel's practices. </TEXT></DOC>
