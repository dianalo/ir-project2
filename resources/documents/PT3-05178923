The tubes are provided with closure means comprising multifilament, bulky      yarn interlaced along one marginal edge of the sleeving material and of      Velcro hook tape or other hook type elements disposed along the other      marginal edge. In one embodiment of the invention, the interlaced      multifilament, bulky yarn is disposed along both marginal edges with the      Velcro tape fastened to one side of the bulky yarn on one marginal edge.      Intermediate bands or rows of multifilament yarn may be provided so that      to accommodate bundles of irregular cross-sectional tape. When the      sleeving material is provided in rolls, the hooks on one side of the web      interengage with the bulky multifilament yarn surface exposed on the other      side of the web so that the web is held in rolled up form except when      deliberately unwrapped. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates to wraparound fabric sleeves formed by weaving,      knitting or braiding. More particularly, the invention relates to      wraparound sleeves having a closure device and more specifically to      wraparound sleeves for the protection of elongated articles, such as      cables wherein the sleeves are intended to provide protection from the      effects of abrasion or heat as well as to maintain the elongated articles      in a neatly bundled arrangement so that they are not damaged by moving      machinery parts or the like. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The use of flexible sleeves for the protection of cables, hoses and other      elongated articles for the purposes above noted is well known. In      addition, it is well known to secure the marginal edges of the sleeving      material together by means of zipper type fastener elements. A product for      this purpose is a sleeve formed of braided monofilament secured together      by a zipper type fastener element. Such sleeving is sold by The      Bentley-Harris Manufacturing Company under the trademark EXPANDO ZIP and      is widely used in automotive as well as other applications, for example,      for bundling cables and hoses and the like in an automobile or truck      engine compartment. Other types of sleeving available from The      Bentley-Harris Manufacturing Company are woven, knitted or braided from      materials such as monofilaments of engineered plastic materials, glass      fiber, wire and bulky yarns and combinations thereof, depending upon the      requirements of the particular application. In addition, other means of      fastening sleeves of the type disclosed are known in the art. In addition      to the use of zipper type fasteners, these include tongue and groove type      elongated flexible plastic fasteners, velcro tapes exposed along the      marginal edges of the sleeving material, tape wraps and wire or tape ties.      Despite the availability of the foregoing, the need exists for a simple      and reliable, relatively low cost system, for closure of a sleeve which      will accommodate variations in the diameter of a bundle of elongated      articles, such as cables having connectors intermediate their length,      while allowing for cable breakouts at points where a cable is required to      be connected to a particular instrument or item of equipment. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In accordance with the invention, a ribbon or web of sleeving material is      provided, the sleeving material being comprised of interlaced      monofilaments and/or multifilament material, the ribbon or web having at      least one marginal edge comprised of bulky multifilament yarn which is      exposed on both the web inner and the outer surface, and hook type      fastener elements extended along the opposite marginal edge of the web,      the hook type fastener elements being interengageable with the bulky yarn      for closure of the sleeve around the elongated articles. Advantageously,      the hook type fasteners are provided as a tape of the kind sold under the      trademark VELCRO. The tape is sewn or adhesively bonded to the web along      the edge thereof with the hook elements facing generally inwardly.      Alternatively and advantageously, the individual monofilaments comprising      the sleeve may be directly formed into individual hook elements for      interengagement with the bulky yarn. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred form of the invention, the sleeving material is formed of      woven monofilaments with at least one band or row of bulky multifilament      yarn interwoven along at least one marginal edge of the sleeve, each said      row comprising one or a plurality of bulky multifilament yarns. In yet      another form of the invention, additional rows of bulky multifilament      yarns are provided at spaced locations intermediate the marginal edges to      allow for interengagement of the hooks with a select row of yarn according      to the diameter of the articles being protected. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with the foregoing, important objectives of the present      invention include the following: </PAR><PAR>  the provision of a wraparound sleeve with fastening means formed integrally      of the wraparound sleeve material; </PAR><PAR>  the provision of fastening means for a wraparound sleeve which eliminates      the need for taping or tieing; </PAR><PAR>  the provision of a fastening means for a special tool for fastening the      sleeve edges together. </PAR><PAR>  A still further objective of the invention is the provision of a wraparound      sleeve having fastening means which allows for considerable variation in      the overall size of the elongated article or articles being protected. </PAR><PAR>  A still further objective of the invention is the provision of a wraparound      sleeve material supplied to the end user in rolls wherein the fastener      means serve to hold the web of material in rolled up form until required      for use. </PAR><PAR>  The foregoing as well as other objectives and advantages of the invention      will become apparent from the following detailed description of the      illustrative embodiment of the invention. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a schematic view showing a wraparound sleeve having      interengageable fastener elements formed according to the present      invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a view of the wraparound sleeve of FIG. 1 showing the fastener      elements interengaged; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a fragmentary view showing a modified form of the invention of      FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a view similar to FIG. 3 showing a further alternative of the      invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 illustrates a still further alternative of the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 illustrates a supply of sleeving in rolled up form ready for      installation; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 illustrates a further alternative of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 illustrates the sleeving of FIG. 7 illustrating the a cable breakout      utilizing the sleeving of FIG. 7; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a view similar to FIG. 1 illustrating a woven monofilament sleeve      incorporating the principles of the invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Referring first to FIGS. 1 and 9, a sleeving material 10 comprised of      interlaced warp and weft monofilaments 11 and 12 is disclosed. Typically,      the monofilaments are formed of an engineered plastic material.      Preferably, the monofilament used is polyester, which is economical, has      good durability and is relatively abrasion resistant, but it will be      appreciated that other members of the family of plastics known as      engineered plastics are suitable for use in sleeves formed according to      the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  Materials in the family of engineered plastics of the type referred to      herein include plastics that have a tensile modulus of greater than 50,000      psi and in the range from about 50,000 to about 200,000. Examples of      engineered plastics are the olefin polymers of which are poly 4-methyl      pentene and fluorinated polyolefins, ethylenetetrafluoroethylene      copolymers and vinylidene fluoride polymers, especially polyvinylidene      fluoride and blends thereof, for example, the fluorinated olefin blends as      described and claimed in British Patent No. 1,120,131, polyesters, for      example, polyethylene terephthalate, polytetramethylene terephathalate for      example that are treated as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,968,015,      4,073,830 and 4,113,594, polyphenyleneoxide and -sulphide, blends of      polyethylene oxide with styrene, silicone carbonate block copolymers,      polyketones, such as polyarylether ketones, for example, those described      and claimed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,953,400, 4,024,314, 4,229,564, 3,751,398,      3,914,298, 3,956,146 and 4,111,908 and in British Patent Nos. 1,387,303      and 1,383,393, polysulphones, for example, polyaryl sulphones,      polyarylethere sulphones, polyetherimides, for example those described in      U.S. Pat. No. 3,847,867, polycarbonates, especially those derived from bis      phenol-A, polyamides, especially those described and claimed in U.S. Pat.      Nos. 3,551,200 and 3,677,921 and in British Patent No. 1,287,932, poly      ether ether ketone (peek), epoxy resins and blends of one or more of the      above-mentioned polymeric materials either with each other or with other      polymeric materials. A more detailed discussion of the above materials is      found in British Specification No. 1,529,351 which is incorporated herein      by reference. It is especially preferred to use polyester as the      monofilament material. </PAR><PAR>  According to the invention, it is contemplated that the sleeves are made      from fabric in ribbon or web form by shuttle loom, needle loom, scrim,      fused lattice or braiding techniques. In addition, the objectives of the      invention may be accomplished by knitting, braiding or weaving articles in      tubular form and thereafter cutting the tube longitudinally so as to form      a web of material used for manufacturing a sleeve. </PAR><PAR>  A preferred form the of the invention utilizes sleeving material in woven      form as best illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 9. Although the invention is      illustrated in the production of sleeves having an open construction,      which allows for good air circulation, certain applications of sleeves      formed according to the invention as, for example, where insulating      capability is required, will be formed utilizing a substantially closed      construction. As is illustrated in FIG. 9, a typical construction is      comprised of single monofilament warps and monofilament wefts. The      monofilaments range in diameter from about 8 to 15 mils for typical      automotive applications. </PAR><PAR>  With reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, where a woven sleeve is disclosed, one      longitudinal edge is provided with woven bulky monofilament yarn 13      interlaced with the weft monofilaments along one edge of the sleeve.      Preferably, a plurality of multifilament yarns constitute a single band or      row extending inwardly from the marginal edge. Each multifilament band or      row may advantageously comprise 3 to 5 bulky multifilament yarns. As      illustrated in FIG. 9, five multifilament yarns are woven in a band      approximately 3/8&quot; wide in place of the monofilament warps. The      arrangement results in the exposure of the multifilament warp yarns on      both sleeve surfaces which is of advantage for reasons which will become      apparent from the following description. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, as best seen in FIGS. 1 and 9, hook means which may      advantageously be in the form of Velcro hook tape 15 is secured along the      marginal edge opposite to the edge having the woven multifilaments. As      indicated in FIG. 1, the Velcro hook tape 15 may be sewn or adhesively      secured directly to the monofilament web. Alternatively, multifilament      warp yarns may be woven into each marginal edge in the form of bands or      rows and, as shown in FIG. 3, Velcro hook tape having hooks on both      surfaces as illustrated at 16 may then be applied with the Velcro hooks on      the lower surface of the tape securing directly to the band of      multifilament warp yarns adjacent one of the marginal edges. </PAR><PAR>  Alternatively, an interlayer of tape 18 may be provided between the band of      multifilament warp yarns and the Velcro hook tape, as is illustrated in      FIG. 4. In this embodiment, the Velcro hook tape is advantageously      adhesively secured to the intermediate tape layer. </PAR><PAR>  If desired, additional bands or rows of multifilament warp yarns may be      interwoven into the sleeving material, as is illustrated at 20 in FIG. 3,      either as replacements for the monofilament warps or in bands between the      monofilament warps. The use of a plurality of bands of multifilament yarn      allows for variation in the overlap of the sleeving material so that      variations in the sizes of the substrates being protected can be      accommodated. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 illustrates a further embodiment of the present invention. According      to FIG. 5, the ends of the weft monofilaments are first cut and then      crimped or bent and heat set into a hook shaped form as at 22 thereby      eliminating the need for the separate step of application of the Velcro      hook tape. Conventional machinery for forming polyester and like kinds of      monofilament into hook type fastening elements may be used for the      fabrication of hooks along one marginal edge of the product. </PAR><PAR>  Various advantages are realized through the use of bulky monofilament yarn      extended along the same edge of the web as the hook shaped fastener      elements when the multifilament yarn is interwoven or interlaced into the      web. An advantage of this can be seen upon reference to FIG. 6 which shows      the sleeving material in rolled up form ready for use. As illustrated in      FIG. 6, when the material is rolled up, the Velcro hooks on one side of      the web interengage with the bulky multifilament yarn surface exposed on      the other side of the web, thereby yieldably holding the web in the rolled      up form except when the web is deliberately unwrapped. This feature      maintains the roll in compact form and allows for the installer to unwrap      only that amount of web material actually required for use while      maintaining the unused web in compactly wrapped up form. Another advantage      of providing the interlaced multifilament warp yarn is that the sleeving      may be fastened alternatively in the overlapping relationship shown in      FIG. 2 wherein an inside surface on one edge of the sleeve is overlapped      with the outside surface on the other edge of the sleeve as is shown in      FIG. 2. However, in some applications it may be of advantage to close the      sleeve with both inside surfaces interengaged by the fastening means so      that the sleeve in cross-section has a &quot;tadpole&quot; shape. Either arrangement      may be conveniently utilized with the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIGS. 7 and 8, there is illustrated sleeving similar to      FIG. 1 with interwoven warp yarns along one marginal edge of the sleeving      and an additional two rows of wrap yarns spaced intermediate to the two      marginal edges. Alternate rows shown at 24 and 26 are provided with Velcro      hook type tape bonded thereto. </PAR><PAR>  Utilizing the tape configuration of FIG. 7, the two marginal edges may be      separated as required by cutting the web between the intermediate rows      with a heat gun to the point where a cable breakout is required, as is      shown by the reference character 28. The wraparound sleeving of FIG. 7 is      shown as installed to accommodate a breakout in FIG. 8. </PAR><PAR>  The characteristics of the multifilament yarn may vary widely and still      accomplish the objectives of the present invention. Yarns formed of      polypropylene of a cotton count of 1.1 s have proven to be particularly      effective in applications where Velcro hook tape is employed. In general,      the Velcro hook tape adheres more readily and firmly to the yarn as the      yarn becomes more bulky. The effectiveness of any particular yarn may be      readily determined by a few field trials. </PAR><PAR>  In use in braided sleeving, additional multifilament warp yarns are      provided in addition to the braided monofilaments. Braided sleeving may be      formed on a circular braider and subsequently split lengthwise or flat      braiding techniques may be employed. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
