Radiogenic /sup206/Pb anomalies have been obtained in some waters, and were proved tobe carried mainly by the particulate phase. /sup 234/U//sup 238/U activityratios andgt; 2.5 were obtained in bicarbonated sodic reduced aquifers. Suchdisequilibria, associated with low to moderate U concentrations (1.6-32ppb), indicated that these groundwaters had been in contact with U accumulations.Oxidized waters generally show high U concentrations (up to 750 ppb)and low U activity ratios. The use of /sup 206/Pb anomalies in groundwatersfor U prospection is limited because Pb is mainly carried by the particulatephase. The search for such anomalies seems to be more promising in highlysorptive surface sediments (clays, hydroxides, organic sediments). Systematicsearch for /sup 234/U excess in groundwaters is proposed for U exploration.Such an excess corresponds to high /sup 234/U//sup 238/U activity ratios,associated with some U accumulation. 24 refs.;4 figs.;3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
