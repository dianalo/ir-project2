<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-92-0018 </DOCNO><TEXT>Commercial natural gas occurrence can be broadly classified into two categories,conventional and unconventional. The conventional category includes naturalgas found as associated and non-associated or free gases, including dissolvedor solution. The unconventional natural gas resource includes, (1) deepgas, (2) coal bed methane, (3) gas hydrates and gas in (4) shales, (5)geopressurized aquifers and tight sands. With the exception of gas hydratesvery little information for unconventional natural gas resources in Alaskais available. Most oil fields discovered in northern Alaska have associatedgas. While all have dissolved gas some have large gas caps. The productionhistories of these fields have now provided the amount of natural gasavailable and thus can be labeled as proven reserves. The current productionof dissolved natural gas from some of these fields, in processed or unprocessedform, is reinjected into the field. This analysis concludes that northernAlaska has 36.9 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of natural gas as proven reserves.Preliminary studies of gas hydrates suggest that this unconventionalresource could provide 500 TCF of gas.</TEXT></DOC>
