You're hardly unique, studies find.    Researchers at Brandeis University, analyzing census data, say only 44% of all persons aged 60 to 61 were working in 1984. Among men alone, just 54% counted themselves in the labor force. For women, the rate was 37%. Older people showed even less inclination to work. And the decision was largely voluntary. People retire when they think they can afford it, the researchers say.    But retirement may not be as abrupt as generally believed, and some retirees have second thoughts, another team of researchers concludes. A Boston University group says most workers take some form of &quot;bridge&quot; employment between their &quot;career&quot; jobs and full retirement. Often, this temporary occupation turns into a second career lasting a decade or more.    Many &quot;unretire.&quot; One in five retirees returns to work, generally within three years, Boston University says.    TITLE ME ANYTHING, but don't call me a secretary.    Kelley Cox used to be secretary to the president of Bartlett Cattle Co. Now, at her request, she's his administrative assistant. &quot;I never really felt the title secretary described what I did,&quot; she says. Deborah Dacheff, a secretary at Mercedes-Benz of North America, asserts she, too, would &quot;rather be called something else. There's a stigma that you file your nails and answer the phone,&quot; she complains.    When Katharine Gibbs School asked its students what titles they wanted, most put secretary at the bottom of the list; one indicated she was willing to be called president. But Harriet Maldonado, who's senior executive secretary to the chief executive of Vons Cos., doesn't have any problems with the simpler designation. She objects only to being called &quot;just a secretary or, God forbid, his Gal Friday.&quot; -   BE NICE to customers; they set your pay, some companies tell managers.    Rank Xerox Ltd. has informed 130 of its European executives that salary increases due in November will be based exclusively on customer satisfaction, as measured by an independent survey of client attitudes and an internal audit of repeat sales. Few other companies give customers so loud a voice in compensation deliberations. Increasingly, though, customer appraisals are being thrown into the pot, along with the traditional measures of profit and sales.    For 70 top U.S. marketing executives of Xerox Corp., Rank Xerox's American 50%-owner, 30% of their annual bonus hinges on customer satisfaction, and a third of that is linked directly to a customer poll. Ameritech, the telephone holding company, also listens to customers in setting compensation, as does BMW of North America. Management Compensation Group, a pay consultant, is so sold on the notion that it's instituting the policy for its executives and telling its clients to do the same.    But International Business Machines Corp. scoffs at surveys. &quot;We look at hard measures,&quot; a spokesman says.    THEY WOULDN'T hire them. Of 197 chief executives interviewed by recruiter Canny, Bowen Inc., 54% think that most presidential candidates since World War II haven't had sufficient managerial experience to be the nation's CEO.    SMOKE SCREEN? Fully 70% of the companies interviewed by Northwestern University have restricted smoking or are planning restraints. But only 34% of the companies tell applicants about smoking policies before they are hired, the university says.    NO CASH, PLEASE. More companies will pay their outside directors with discounted stock options instead of cash, consultant Towers Perrin predicts. Unlike cash, which is taxable immediately, options aren't taxable until exercised, which can be delayed until the director retires, earns less and falls into a lower tax bracket.    OVERWEIGHT JOB SEEKERS can expect to spend five more weeks than their trim rivals in the quest for work, say outplacement specialists Madeleine and Robert Swain. Tall candidates, they figure, have a four-week edge over short people.    LOANS AGAINST PENSIONS would be tougher and costlier under proposed rules.    The Department of Labor has stirred up a storm of controversy with proposed regulations that would govern how qualified pension plans, including 401(k) savings arrangements, could lend money to participating employees. Under the tentative rules, these loans would have to be &quot;adequately secured&quot; and carry an interest rate that professional lenders would charge.    Jeffrey Miller, a pension consultant, says the provisions would make it extremely difficult for workers to borrow money, even against their own vested benefits when the principal and interest would be paid back to their own accounts. Frederick Rumack of Buck Consultants raises the prospect that no money could be borrowed against 401(k) deposits because they may not be considered adequate security under the stiffer rules.    The regulations, if implemented, would &quot;be highly disruptive to most plans in the U.S.,&quot; Buck contends.    THE CHECKOFF: Nebraska State Penitentiary solicits free books from Kimberly Press, whose only volume, &quot;Conquering the Corporate Career,&quot; opens with a chapter titled Break Out of Your Cell. . . . Retrenchment spreads beyond Wall Street. The Directory of Personal Image Consultants counts only 290 practitioners, down from 364 two years ago. </TEXT></DOC>
