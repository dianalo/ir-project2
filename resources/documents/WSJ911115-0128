So would Aleksander Narin'yani, aRussian who has worked extensively in artificialintelligence.   But like many other East European participants at thesecond East-West High-Tech Forum here, Messrs. Batouner andNarin'yani have found themselves fighting a tide going in theother direction: Rather than looking for new products, asmany Russians and others had hoped, Western firms have cometo this fledgling computer conference mainly to find newmarkets for their products.</LP><TEXT>   No one here accuses the Westerners of imperialism. Indeed,most Easterners are falling over themselves to help bringWestern products to their countries. But there is an air offrustration among many of those who have traveled from acrossthe former Soviet empire to discuss East-West cooperation inthis emerging high-tech marketplace.   &quot;It seems that 98% of {Western firms} are selling to usand only 2% are buying,&quot; says Mr. Narin'yani, generaldirector of Intelligent Technology, a state scientific firmin Moscow. &quot;I understand this, of course, because of ourdifferent experience in the markets. It is certainly notimperialism in their minds, but it would be better if it weremore symmetrical.&quot;   Mr. Batouner, vice chairman of TOR, a cooperativeenterprise, is similarly resigned: &quot;Everyone should push hisown product; this is capitalism, yes?&quot; But he adds thatWestern firms often require East Europeans to distributetheir goods before they will even consider marketing EastEuropean products -- a bargaining tool held by only one side.   Skepticism about Western motivations doesn't stop businessfrom being done. Throughout the conference, in the back roomsof the Warsaw Marriott hotel, new distribution deals andpossible partnerships are being hammered out by the bigWestern companies such as Groupe Bull, Compaq Computer Corp.,Microsoft Corp. and U.S. computer distributor Merisel Inc.Representatives from previously anti-Western countries suchas Bulgaria were trying to forge new friendships, while thosefrom countries such as Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Polandwere trying to capitalize on older ties.   Still, the friendly atmosphere sometimes gives way totension. During a discussion here on Monday, for example,Wlasyslaw Boguchi, president of Poland's Zeto-Rodan Ltd.,asked rather testily of Western firms: &quot;Did you bringanything to this conference except this pitching ofproducts?&quot;   ---   An ironic by-product of the opening of Eastern Europeanmarkets is the arrival here of U.S. pricing on computers andsoftware, which cost as much as 25% to 50% more in London orParis than in New York. Because the average East Europeancustomer, whether an individual or a company, can't afford topay such high prices, some Western companies have decided toforgo big profits -- sometimes any profits -- in search ofmarket share.   California's AST Research Inc., for example, hasaggressively set out to capture a big chunk of the nascentmarket by pricing its personal computers low -- despite thefact that no Western concern can hope to compete with thecheap, low-quality &quot;clone&quot; computers that still dominateEastern Europe, where they are assembled with parts importedform Asia. Bigger U.S. computer makers, such as Compaq andInternational Business Machines Corp., haven't been as eagerto abandon their premium European prices, although they, too,can be flexible when negotiating sales.   The lower-price strategy may quickly spread to WesternEurope for two reasons: decreasing differences between Eastand West, which mean that different prices can't be justifiedforever; and falling trade barriers, which are alreadyallowing computers from Eastern Europe to show up in theWest. Esther Dyson, the U.S.-based industry analyst whoorganized the conference, calls this &quot;gray-market&quot; trading aform of arbitrage and predicts that it will soon forceworld-wide prices to come closer together.   Pricing information is in short supply, in large partbecause computer makers don't like to talk about such trendsin already tough times. But &quot;just now, the average price fora personal computer is much lower in Poland than it is inGermany or the U.K.,&quot; says Marek Car, editor of Boss KomputerWeekly, a Warsaw computer magazine that tracks the Polishmarket, which has emerged as a nexus of gray-market goods.   The effect on West European software prices should be lessnoticeable because programs are usually translated intodifferent languages for each market, making them much lessattractive for Western customers and allowing software makersto continue charging different prices in different markets.   ---   Any computer conference based in Eastern Europe would beincomplete without endless discussions of software piracy,the bane of this new market. True to form, the East-WestForum generated its share of such stories, includingtestimony from Stepan Pachikov, president of ParaGraph, asuccessful Russian software company, about the monumentalindifference of Soviet authorities toward the problem.   Mr. Pachikov says he complained recently to the Sovietgovernment that somebody was pirating his firm's copyrightedsoftware for profit, only to be told that nothing was wrongbecause the original software from which copies were piratedhad been bought legally. Progress is slow in Bulgaria, too.Until recently, it was illegal for more than a single legalcopy of any Western program to be imported into the country,says Vesselin Spiridonov, general manager of Interprogramma,a Bulgarian computer concern.   Perhaps most intriguing, however, were rumors fromCzechoslovakia about shadowy &quot;software police&quot; roaming thecountry, terrorizing owners of pirated programs. In a paneldiscussion, Milan Razga, managing director of Point SRO, toldof receiving a panicky call from a customer who needed legalcopies of a program sent overnight because he had heardsomeone next to him on a bus say that the software policewere coming.   Reassuringly, everyone on the panel agreed that therealmost certainly weren't any software police inCzechoslovakia. Roman Albrecht of Prague, who runs the EastEuropean operations for Autodesk Inc. of the U.S., also heardthe rumors. He theorized that they may have been the work ofa software company trying to boost sales by evoking memoriesof a darker era. Capitalism, it seems, has arrived in theEast.</TEXT></DOC>
