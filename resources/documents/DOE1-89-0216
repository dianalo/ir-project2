Air bubbling was used to enhance the separation. Chemiluminescentsignals produced from the reaction of ozone with ethylene in air werelinearly proportional to concentration of aqueous ozone from 8 ppb to9.5 ppm. The relative standard deviation (n=4) was 3.5% at 0.2 ppm. Thetime it took from starting the sample flow until the signal to reacha stable level was 1.5 min. The interference from chromium(VI), manganese(VII),chlorine, bromine, phthalate, and sulfophthalate was completely eliminated.</TEXT></DOC>
