Section 21(a) of the Sentencing Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-182,Dec. 7, 1987) authorizes the U.S. Sentencing Commission to promulgate temporary,emergency guidelines or amend existing guidelines in certain circumstances,including ``the creation of a new offense or amendment of an existing offense.''Unlike regular amendments issued pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(p), amendmentspromulgated by the Commission under this authority are not required tobe submitted to Congress for 180 days' review prior to their taking effort;nor is the Commission required to publish proposed temporary, emergencyguideline amendments prior to promulgation, though it may do so if circumstancespermit. However, section 21 emergency amendments are temporary; i.e., unlesssubmitted to Congress as regular amendments in the next regular amendmentreport, they expire upon the disposition of that report. The temporary amendments set forth below pertain to the possession of cocainebase (``crack'') and to the authority of courts to deny or terminate certainfederal benefits to defendants convicted of controlled substances offenses.Possession of cocaine base (``crack''). Section 637l of the Anti-Drug AbuseAct of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-690, Nov. 18, 1988), sets forth mandatory minimumterms of imprisonment for defendants possessing certain amounts of cocainebase (``crack''). On June 5, 1989, the Commission published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for comment three options for a proposed temporary,emergency sentencing guideline amendment incorporating the new statutorypenalties. 54 FR 24073-24074 (1989). On July 18, 1989, the Commission reviewedits proposed temporary, emergency guideline amendments on simple possessionand possession with intent to distribute. While it did not necessarilyaccept the view of some who submitted comments that the proposals wereoutside of its emergency guideline promulgation authority, the Commissiondecided to promulgate the narrow amendment set forth below as amendment1. This amendment provides that convictions for possession of cocaine base(``crack'') subject to the enhanced penalties created by section 6371 ofthe Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 are to be treated as if the conduct constitutedpossession of the controlled substance with intent to distribute. Denial of certain Federal benefits. On August 30, 1989, the President ofthe United States submitted a report to Congress concerning the implementationof section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-690, Nov.18, 1988) pertaining to denial of Federal benefits for certain drug offenders.In that report, the President ``ask[s] the United States Sentencing Commissionto assist in the initial dissemination of information to the Federal courts''regarding section 5301. Further, the report states that ``[p]rincipal responsibilitywill rest with the Sentencing Commission to disseminate all necessary informationconcerning section 5301 to Article III Judges and other appropriate Federalpersonnel.'' In response to discussions with the Office of Drug Policyand the Office of Management and Budget regarding this anticipated requestof the President, and in preparation for the submission of his report toCongress, the Commission adopted the temporary, emergency guideline amendmenton August 22, 1989, set forth below as amendment 2. The amendment informsjudges, probation officers, and all recipients of the Guidelines Manualof the availability of penalties under section 5301. New Policy Statement: Retroactive application of amendments to guidelinesentencing ranges. Section 994(a)(2) of title 28, United States Code authorizedthe Commission to promulgate policy statements regarding application ofthe guidelines or any other aspect of sentencing or sentence implementation.Unlike guideline amendments issued pursuant to 28 U.S.C. andSection; 994(p),sentencing policy statements and amendments thereto promulgated by theCommission are not required to be submitted to Congress for 180 days' reviewprior to their taking effect. Section 3582(c)(2) of title 18, United States Code provides that ``thecourt may reduce the term of imprisonment [in the case of a defendant whohas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based upon a sentence rangethat has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission] * * *if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issuedby the Sentencing Commission.'' Further, under section 994(u) of Title28, United States Code, the Commission is directed to ``specify in whatcircumstances and by what amount the sentences of prisoners serving termsof imprisonment for the offense may be reduced'' where it has lowered sentencingranges applicable to an offense or group of offenses. In furtherance ofthese statutory mandates, on September 12, 1989, the Commission adopteda policy statement concerning the retroactive application of amendmentsthat reduce guideline ranges set forth below as amendment 3. Technical revisions to the Guidelines Manual. The Commission approved severalmiscellaneous technical and clarifying revisions to the Guidelines Manualas set forth below under Miscellaneous Matters.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Section 217(a) of the Comprehensive Crime Control Actof 1984 (28 U.S.C. 994(a) and (u)) and Section 21(a) of the SentencingAct of 1987 (Pub.

Other cases for which enhanced penaltiesare provided under Section 6371 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (e.g.,for a person with one prior conviction, possession of more than three gramsof a mixture or substance containing cocaine base; for a person with twoor more prior convictions, possession of more than one gram of a mixtureor substance containing cocaine base) are to be sentenced in accordancewith andSection; 5G1.1(b).''.</ITAG><T3>Statement of Reasons:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to reflectrevisions in 21 U.S.C. 844(a) made by section 6371 of the Anti-Drug AbuseAct of 1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Amendment 2 </ITAG>The Commission has promulgated the following temporary, emergency guidelineamendment concerning the statutory authority of judges to deny or terminatecertain Federal benefits: Chapter Five, Part F, is amended by insertingthe following additional section: ``andSection; 5F1.6. Denial of Federal Benefits to Drug Traffickers and PossessorsThe court, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 853a, may deny the eligibility for certainFederal benefits of any individual convicted of distribution or possessionof a controlled substance. <ITAG tagnum="74">Commentary </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Application Note: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. `Federal benefit' is defined in 21 U.S.C. 853a(d) to mean `anygrant, contract, loan, professional license, or commercial license providedby an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the UnitedStates' but `does not include any retirement, welfare, Social Security,health, disability, veterans benefit, public housing, or other similarbenefit, or any other benefit for which payments or services are requiredfor eligibility.' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Background:</T3> Subsections (a) and (b) of 21 U.S.C. andSection; 853aprovide that an individual convicted of a state or federal drug traffickingor possession offense may be denied certain federal benefits.

Retroactivity of Amended Guideline Range (Policy Statement) (a) Where a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guidelinerange applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a resultof an amendment to the guidelines listed in subsection (d) below, a reductionin the defendant's term of imprisonment may be considered under 18 U.S.C.3582(c)(2). If none of the amendments listed in subsection (d) is applicable,a reduction in the defendant's term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2)is not consistent with this policy statement. (b) In determining whether a reduction in sentence is warranted for a defendanteligible for consideration under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2), the court shouldconsider the sentence that it would have originally imposed had the guidelines,as amended, been in effect at that time. (c) Provided, however, that a reduction in a defendant's term of imprisonment_(1) Is not authorized unless the maximum of the guideline range applicableto the defendant (from Chapter Five, Part A) has been lowered by at leastsix months; and (2) May, in no event, exceed the number of months by which the maximumof the guideline range applicable to the defendant (from Chapter Five,Part A) has been lowered.(d) Amendments covered by this policy statement are listed in AppendixC as follows: 126, 130, 156, 176, and 269. <ITAG tagnum="74">Commentary </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Application Note: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Although eligibility for consideration under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2)is triggered only by an amendment listed in subsection (d) of this section,the amended guideline range referred to in subsections (b) and (c) of thissection is to be determined by applying all amendments to the guidelines(i.e., as if the defendant was being sentenced under the guidelines currentlyin effect). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Background: </T3>Section 3582(c)(2) of Title 18, United States Code,provides: `[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a termof imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently beenlowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), uponmotion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or onits own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after consideringthe factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issuedby the Sentencing Commission.' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This policy statement provides guidance for a court when consideringa motion under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and implements 28 U.S.C.  994(u), whichprovides: `If the Commission reduces the term of imprisonment recommendedin the guidelines applicable to a particular offense or category of offenses,it shall specify in what circumstances and by what amount the sentencesof prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for the offense may be reduced.'</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Among the factors considered by the Commission in selecting the amendmentsincluded in subsection (d) were the purpose of the amendment, the magnitudeof the change in the guideline range made by the amendment, and the difficultyof applying the amendment retroactively. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The requirement in subsection (c)(1) that the maximum of the guidelinerange be lowered by at least six months for a reduction to be consideredis in accord with the legislative history of 28 U.S.C. 994(u) (formerly994(t)), which states: `It should be noted that the Committee does notexpect that the Commission will recommend adjusting existing sentencesunder the provision when guidelines are simply refined in a way that mightcause isolated instances of existing sentences falling above the old guidelinesor when there is only a minor downward adjustment in the guidelines. TheCommittee does not believe the courts should be burdened with adjustmentsin these cases.' S. Rep. 98-225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 180 (1983).''.</ITAG><T3>Statement of Reasons: </T3>The purpose of this amendment is to implementthe directive in 28 U.S.C. 994(u). <ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous Matters </ITAG>The Commission has approved the following miscellaneous, technical, andclarifying revisions to the Guidelines Manual. The number of the amendmentin Appendix C of the revised Manual containing the revision is shown followingeach revision. The following additional application note is inserted in the Commentaryto andSection; 2B3.1 to complement the addition of a specific offense characteristicsubdivision pertaining to ``an express threat of death:''<ITAG tagnum="21">``8. `An express threat of death,' as used in subsection (b)(2)(D),may be in the form of an oral or written statement, act, gesture, or combinationthereof. For example, an oral or written demand using words such as `Giveme the money or I will kill you', `Give me the money or I will pull thepin on the grenade I have in my pocket', `Give me the money or I will shootyou', `Give me your money or else (where the defendant draws his hand acrosshis throat in a slashing motion)', or `Give me the money or you are dead'would constitute an express threat of death. The court should considerthat the intent of the underlying provision is to provide an increasedoffense level for cases in which the offender(s) engaged in conduct thatwould instill in a reasonable person, who is a victim of the offense, significantlygreater fear than that necessary to constitute an element of the offenseof robbery.''.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Appendix C, amendment 110).</ITAG>A typographical error in the amended andSection; 2D1.1(c)(14) is correctedby revising ``Schedule I or I Depressants'' to read ``Schedule I or IIDepressants''. No substantive change occurs because this result would berequired by, and the intent of this subsection is clear from, the immediatelypreceding and following subsections. In addition, the Commentary to andSection;2D1.1 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amended in Note 10 by deleting``Other Schedule I or II Substances'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``ScheduleI or II Depressants'' to conform to the revision in the guideline (AppendixC, amendment 125). The Commentary to andSection; 2D1.5 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amendedin Note 2 by deleting ``if the quantity of drugs substantially exceedsthat required for level 36 in the drug quantity table,'', and by deleting``is extremely'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``was extremely''. Thisrevision conforms this Commentary to the amendment of the Drug QuantityTable in andSection; 2D1.1, which expanded the Drug Quantity Table itselfto provide higher offense levels for extremely large drug quantities (AppendixC, amendment 139). The Commentary to andSection; 2F1.1 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amendedin Note 1 by deleting ``(b)(2)'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``(b)(3)'',and by deleting ``several'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``both'' to conformto the revision of the guideline (Appendix C, amendment 156). The Commentary to andSection; 4B1.1 captioned ``Application Note'' is amendedin Note 1 by deleting ``felony conviction'' and inserting in lieu thereof``two prior felony convictions'' to make an editorial improvement (AppendixC, amendment 267).The caption to andSection; 4B1.2 is amended by deleting ``Definitions'' andinserting in lieu thereof ``Definitions of Terms Used in andSection; 4B1.1'',and andSection;andSection; 4B1.2 (1) and (2) are amended by deleting ``as usedin this provision'' in each instance to make an editorial improvement (AppendixC, amendment 268). Editorial improvements are made to the sentencing table in Chapter Five,part A, by inserting ``(in months of imprisonment)'' immediately underthe title ``Sentencing Table'', by inserting ``(Criminal History Points)''immediately following the caption ``Criminal History Category'', and byenclosing in parentheses each of the six sets of criminal history pointsdisplayed under that caption (Appendix C, amendment 270). To conform to an amendment to andSection; 5C1.1 authorizing the use of homedetention as a substitute for imprisonment in certain circumstances, andSection;5B1.1(a)(2) is amended by deleting ``or community confinement'' and insertingin lieu thereof ``, community confinement, or home detention''. The Commentaryto andSection; 5B1.1 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amended in Note 1by inserting ``, home detention,'' immediately after ``community confinement''wherever the latter appears. Chapter One, section 4(d) is amended in thethird sentence of the third paragraph by deleting ``or intermittent confinement''and inserting in lieu thereof ``, intermittent confinement, or home detention'',and in the fourth sentence of the third paragraph by inserting ``or homedetention'' immediately following ``of community confinement''. These conformingrevisions make no substantive change because andSection; 5C1.1, as amended,is controlling in any event (Appendix C, amendment 271). A revision to the amended Commentary of andSection; 5G1.3, is made to clarifythat the amended commentary recommends, rather than requires, the courtapply the methodology described. The Commentary to andSection; 5G1.3, asamended, is revised in the second sentence of the second paragraph by deleting``The court should impose'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``The court mayconsider imposing'', and by inserting the following additional sentencesat the end ``Where the defendant is serving a term of imprisonment fora state offense, the information available may permit only a rough estimateof the total punishment that would have been imposed under the guidelines.It is not intended that the above methodology be applied in a manner thatunduly complicates or prolongs the sentencing process.'' (Appendix C, amendment289). A typographical error in an amended statutory reference in the StatutoryIndex is corrected by revising ``43 U.S.C. 1773(a)'' to read ``43 U.S.C.1733(a)'' (Appendix C, amendment 298). In addition, the Commission inserted a ``Historical Note'' following eachguideline section that contains the effective date of the section and theAppendix C reference number of each amendment to the section, and has madea number of additional minor editorial changes to improve the internalconsistency and appearance of the Manual.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-25544 Filed 10-30-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 2210-40-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
