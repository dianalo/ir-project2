Japanese bosses say U.S. employees often lack loyalty andcommitment. They can't understand the American passion forbonuses that reward individuals, rather than whole teams,says Wyatt Co.'s David Crawford. Drake Beam Morin's JohnArtise says they're uncomfortable with American desires forexplicit performance reviews, which the Japanese eschew inorder to maintain harmony.</LP><TEXT>   Many Japanese companies here try to blend the twocultures. Wyatt helped one firm supplement its 401(k)retirement plan with a pension system to encourage long-termcommitment. Hitachi America is launching an incentive paysystem, but bonuses will be smaller than the American norm.Mitsubishi Bank espouses &quot;glocalization&quot; -- adopting localways in each of its global locations -- yet its New Yorkexecutives work in a Japanese-style open office.   Americans complain that Japanese deny them top jobs, butHitachi's William Tompkins counsels patience; Japanesemanagers can take 10 or 15 years to build up trust, he says.                                                                                                          MANAGING JAPANESE is no easier for American bosses.   Some U.S. companies stumble trying to transplant Americanpractices; others falter attempting to emulate Japanesecustoms. Rohm andamp; Haas Japan has switched from aseniority-based pay system to an American-style merit scheme.Thomas Nevins, a personnel consultant in Tokyo, says foreigncompanies should follow the Japanese system of fixedsalaries, but experiment with the American approach.   The variety of benefits expected by Japanese workers, suchas generous expense accounts, company housing andlow-interest loans to facilitate purchase of a home, puzzlesforeign managers. Unions are another problem for U.S. firms:Many Japanese employees, having abandoned the lifetimeemployment system to join foreign firms, take a tougherstance against management.                                                                                                          RETIREMENT PLANNING involves more than money.   To help older employees prepare for nonfinancial aspectsof retirement, Disney World offers seminars featuringdieticians, attorneys, real estate experts and retirees whodo volunteer work. The sessions are well attended, but insome other firms, there's little interest; such meetings drawonly two dozen of the 500 eligible employees at a Lockheedunit in Georgia.   Volunteer opportunities, recreational possibilities andsome jobs exist, but finding satisfying activities requiresforethought, warns Denise Loftus of the American Associationof Retired Persons. To encourage earlier planning, PepsiCo,which sponsors retirement workshops for employees over 50,considers inviting younger workers. Baxter Healthcare sendsretirees newsletters and seeks their advice.   &quot;They have a wealth of expertise,&quot; says David Wietecha, aBaxter sales manager. &quot;If we treat them like they're gone,all their knowledge, expertise and history goes with them.&quot;                                                                                                          OLDER WORKERS are cost-effective, according to an ICF Inc.study for the Commonwealth Fund. It analyzed Travelers Corp.,Days Inn and Britain's Bandamp;Q PLC and found workers over 50 areas easy to train as younger ones, are flexible aboutassignments and schedules, have lower turnover andabsenteeism and often are better at sales.                                                                                                          A JUDGE DISMISSED a suit by a woman who said she was firedafter spurning her boss. &quot;At the time of the alleged sexualadvance,&quot; wrote Alabama U.S. District Judge E.B. Haltom, thewoman &quot;wore little or no makeup and her hair was not coloredin any way.&quot; Considering the appearance of the boss's wife,he said, it is obvious the employee &quot;was not attractive&quot; tohim.                                                                                                          SHRINKING FORCE: The Labor Department predicts the youthlabor force will drop by 440,000 this summer, to 23.3million. That partly reflects the baby bust, but higherunemployment has prompted many young people to stay home.Their summer work force participation rate dropped from arecord 77.5% in 1989 to 75.2% last year and is headed lowerstill.                                                                                                          LEADERS ARE BORN, but many companies believe they can benurtured too.   The American Society for Training and Development (ASTD)estimates that 60% of the nation's largest companies nowoffer leadership training. SCEcorp in Rosemead, Calif.,offers courses to current and potential supervisors ondiscipline and managing change. It and Centex assemble groupsto work on cooperative problem-solving.   ASTD says one-third of the companies includenon-supervisors in their programs. Eastman Kodak trainsshop-level workers to develop supportive and coaching skills,its middle managers learn to empower other workers, andsenior managers engage in &quot;adventure learning,&quot; taking ontough outdoor activities to explore how to perform underpressure or as part of a team.   One common theme: learning to foster team spirit.&quot;Managers manage numbers,&quot; says Brinker InternationalChairman Norman Brinker. &quot;Leaders lead people.&quot;                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: Who needs money?
