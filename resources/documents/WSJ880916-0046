That was then.    Now Chevy is stripping both its name and familiar bow-tie logo from its Japanese-pedigree cars, and is preparing to launch GM's first new nameplate since 1926: Geo. Billed as a &quot;family&quot; of vehicles &quot;aimed at attracting import buyers,&quot; Geo will eventually include new and renamed versions of the Nova, Sprint and Spectrum, along with a new Jeep-like &quot;sport utility&quot; vehicle. The Chevy Nova, for example, becomes the Geo Prizm, and like the others it will be sold exclusively through about 80% of Chevrolet's 5,000 or so U.S. dealers.    The introduction of the Geo line marks the most ambitious attempt ever by Detroit to succeed at something that has largely eluded the Big Three for 30 years: marketing so-called captive imports -- vehicles made by a foreign company and sold through domestic dealerships.    Besides being an abrupt flip-flop for Chevrolet, the creation of a separate Geo nameplate is arousing some skepticism in the industry. &quot;You're really trying to fool people to a certain extent&quot; by presenting the cars &quot;as a completely independent product,&quot; says Philip E. Benton Jr., who heads Ford Motor Co.'s world-wide auto business. Mr. Benton concedes that Ford is trying the same tactic by selling West German-made cars in its Lincoln-Mercury dealerships under the Merkur marque, but he adds that the Merkur name hasn't boosted the lackluster sales of those cars.    Chevrolet officials counter that the Geo name will simply give the cars a needed distinct identity. &quot;When you see the advertising, you'll see: 'Geo, sold by your Chevy dealer,' &quot; says Michael H. Erdman, general marketing manager. &quot;So we aren't trying to hoodwink anybody.&quot;    The Big Three have recorded an almost continuous chain of captive-import failures stretching back to the late 1950s. That's when GM shipped in small, British-made Vauxhall cars to help its Pontiac division fight back against the Volkswagen Beetle.    Captive imports, traditionally single models used temporarily to plug holes in a product line, have typically been the orphans of the showroom. Their smaller profit margins and lower sales volumes have often precluded much advertising.    What's worse, salesmen more comfortable with American cars have sometimes refused even to drive the captives, let alone learn how to sell them. Most import shoppers concluded they would buy their car in an import showroom.    The few models that successfully drew import buyers into domestic showrooms -- such as the West German-made Capri that Ford sold through most of the 1970s -- were largely unique products with a small but loyal following. &quot;There really haven't been any major successes,&quot; says Christopher Cedergren, an auto-industry analyst with J. D. Power andamp; Associates, a California market-research firm.    The times are forcing a change, however. Increasing competition and cost pressures have made some captives permanent family members. Chrysler Corp. has been selling Mitsubishi Motors Corp. vehicles in the U.S. for almost 20 years.    Meanwhile, the industry's shift toward globalism is blurring old distinctions. Ford's sporty new Probe, for example, is technically a captive because it's made by Japan-based Mazda Motor Co. But Mazda builds the Probe in Flat Rock, Mich., making it a &quot;transplant&quot; in current car-industry slang. The Chevy Nova, designed by Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. and built in California as a joint venture with GM, is even more of a mongrel.    &quot;As we move into a world market, GM, Ford and Chrysler are going to have to learn how to make these product lines successes,&quot; says Mr. Cedergren. &quot;Their captive-import strategy is going to become more important.&quot;    One of the biggest challenges for Chevrolet will be creating a unique identity for Geo, not only among its proliferating competitors but also within itself. The reason for Geo, Mr. Erdman says, is to attract &quot;people out there who absolutely will not walk into a Chevy dealership.&quot;    Thus, many Chevy dealers will have an entirely separate showroom for Geos. Those who don't will have special Geo signs and a special Geo space in their existing facility. &quot;We may do it with banners and flowers and potted trees and so on,&quot; says Andrew Hall, a Milwaukee Chevy dealer. &quot;But when somebody comes into my showroom, they will know that Geo is different from Chevrolet.&quot;    Chevrolet acknowledges the risks in its plan. Just developing awareness and recognition of a new nameplate is difficult, as some dealers are already discovering. &quot;People ask me all the time, 'What do the letters G-E-O stand for?'&quot; says John Delorme, an Inglewood, Calif., Chevy dealer. &quot;They stand for absolutely nothing, I tell them. That's just the name.&quot;    To accommodate production schedules, Chevrolet is introducing Geo vehicles piecemeal. Initially, only 10,000 Trackers -- the new compact utility vehicle -- will be available, so they will be sold only in certain launch areas. In contrast, the Metro (a redesigned Suzuki Sprint) will be available in all launch locations immediately. The Prizm won't go on sale until next March or April.    Mr. Erdman says Geo will try to avoid supply problems with a regional phase-in of the new line, starting in the top import-sales areas (mainly on the East and West coasts). Dealer groups in each area will market, with Chevrolet's help, only the products they have to sell.    Although Geo is hoping to attract people who buy imports, its advertising won't emphasize the vehicles' ancestry -- except on the import-dominated West Coast, where foreign roots are a plus. This is partly because customers would likely be confused by the fact that some of &quot;GM's import vehicles,&quot; as Chevrolet calls them, will come from California. (Starting next year, some will come from Canada as well, when Suzuki Motor Co. opens a plant there that will produce some Geo vehicles.)    Despite all its efforts, Chevrolet expects Geo sales of only about 220,000 vehicles in the first year, compared with a peak total of about 330,000 Sprints, Novas and Spectrums in 1986 and 272,000 last year.    Still, without the special attention, sales of the three cars so far this year have plummeted almost 18% below last year's levels. And Mr. Erdman says the expected decline next year will be due to the &quot;slow acceleration period&quot; of the launch. &quot;It wouldn't surprise me,&quot; he says, to see Geo eventually sell &quot;400,000 vehicles a year.&quot;    It might, however, surprise Bennett E. Bidwell, co-president of Chrysler, which is shifting to a strategy of integration rather than separation for its captive and transplant vehicles. That's partly because it is trying to launch its own new nameplate, Eagle, with cars having French, Japanese and Canadian ties. &quot;They're going to find it's damn hard,&quot; Mr. Bidwell says. &quot;How long does it take you to make your zoo of different animals from different parts of the world catch on? I don't know.&quot;    ---                     Domestic or Foreign?   The following are the Big Three auto makers' captive imports and transplant vehicles. Captive imports are made overseas and sold in domestic dealerships. Transplant vehicles are made in the U.S. in partnership with a foreign auto maker.
