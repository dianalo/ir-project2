But a fast-growing population, a large budget deficit and a weak tax system pose serious challenges for the new government that will be elected Nov. 16.    The big question is whether the new administration will make the hard choices put off by the 11-year authoritarian regime of the late President Mohammed Zia-ulHaq, or whether it will try to cement its popularity with heavy spending that the economy can't afford.    &quot;The people in Pakistan are doing pretty well,&quot; says a Western diplomat here. &quot;The problem is the government is poor.&quot;    Gross domestic product, which measures the value of a nation's goods and services minus foreign income, grew 5.8% in the fiscal year ended June 30. Gross national product, which includes income from abroad as well as goods and services, rose 4.9%, reflecting a 12% drop in remittances from Pakistanis working overseas. Per-capita GNP now stands at $394, considerably higher than that of India ($280) or Bangladesh ($150).    &quot;Both our growth and the remittances from abroad have raised the living standards of our people,&quot; says Finance Minister Mahbub-ul Haq. &quot;People have nutrition and they don't go around in bare feet. You don't have to be an economist to see that we've had real economic progress. You can see it with your own eyes.&quot;    But there is a complex mix of cultural and political problems threatening future economic growth, problems compounded by short-sightedness on the part of the government and its economic planners.    The No. 1 problem is the booming birthrate. The population is growing at a rate of 3.1% a year, one of the highest levels in the world. But the government considers birth control too delicate a topic to deal with seriously.    When the population growth is factored in, the country's economic growth looks much less buoyant. Last year's 5.8% growth in GDP translates into only 1.8% real growth in per-capita terms, according to the government. And income distribution is getting progressively less equitable.    The second major problem is that the government is spending much more than it earns, and the deficit is starting to damage the economy. During the year ended last June, the budget deficit hit 58.6 billion Pakistani rupees ($3.2 billion at current exchange rates), 25% higher than a year earlier.    The government admits the deficit is too high and has promised the International Monetary Fund that it will scale it back to 41 billion rupees in the current fiscal year. &quot;It's borrowed prosperity,&quot; says Mr. Haq, the finance minister. &quot;We are running out of options on this.&quot;    The government claims the deficit isn't crowding out private business from the credit market, but the deficit is fueling inflation. In July and August alone, consumer prices jumped 5.2%, compared with 6.3% for all of fiscal 1988. &quot;This is exclusively as a result of the deficit,&quot; a government economist in Karachi says.    Pakistan's budget problems are a direct extension of its political woes. The military regimes that have run the country for most of its history never had the political franchise required to reform the country's rudimentary tax system. To avoid angering the people, they relied on customs duties and indirect taxes for revenue -- and ran progressively larger deficits.    The military regimes also allowed rampant tax evasion. Until June, Pakistanis with incomes of more than $5,000 a year never had to worry about a tax audit as long as they paid 20% more tax each year -- on any base income they cared to declare.    In its final years, the Zia government tried to resolve some of the basic problems confronting the economy. In the budget unveiled in June, the Finance Ministry announced a sales tax that will probably be expanded into a value-added tax. Prices of sugar, cement and vegetable oil have been deregulated and a system of subsidized domestic trade has been dismantled.    Deregulation has come to the energy industry and, to a lesser extent, the financial sectors. In June, Mr. Haq announced a four-year tax holiday for all new private investments. </TEXT></DOC>
