The agreement, reached at a two-day meeting of alliedofficials here, authorizes a major liberalization oftechnology-trade restrictions to the East. All export curbswill end for most Western personal computers and othercommonly available technology products. More important, theallies agreed to greatly reduce restrictions on sales ofmainframe computers, telephone exchanges, machine tools andother more-sophisticated products.</LP><TEXT>   The accord, based on a Bush administration proposalannounced May 2, opens the door to East-West trade in a widerange of technology products. As one indication of theaccord's importance, U.S. officials said the productsinvolved currently make up about $45 billion, or 30%, ofannual U.S. technology exports around the world. The Easthasn't enough hard currency to place orders anywhere nearthat volume. But Western businesses expect the accord toallow a gradual rise in direct sales to the East, and animmediate surge in East-West technology joint ventures.   Many Western businesses cheered the accord, even thoughsome had urged even greater liberalization. &quot;We are verypleased,&quot; said a spokesman in Armonk, N.Y., for InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. &quot;This represents substantialprogress.&quot; An official of the West German Industry Federationcalled the accord &quot;a step forward&quot; in East-West trade.   The pact also was attacked by some U.S. conservatives.This &quot;ill-advised&quot; accord will &quot;enable the Soviets for farless {effort} to field far more capable military forces inthe future,&quot; said Frank Gaffney Jr., a former Pentagonofficial who heads the Center for Security Policy, aconservative Washington think tank.   Before sales can begin, the agreement has to beimplemented by laws or rules in each of the 17 countriesparticipating in the trade organization, called theCoordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, orCocom. The 17 countries are the U.S., Japan, Australia, andall of the West European countries except Iceland that belongto the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who helped craft theU.S. proposal to Cocom, said the U.S. strategy of&quot;differentiation&quot; prevailed over West European plans to treatthe Soviet Union and the East European countries essentiallythe same way. Cocom's decision to reward the more-democraticEastern European countries with higher technology couldinduce the Soviets to &quot;move towards the same direction,&quot; hesaid.   Mr. Mosbacher said he expects both the former East blocnations and U.S. companies to take advantage of theopportunities being opened. &quot;American companies are going toleap into Eastern Europe,&quot; he predicted. And their presencecould help to &quot;jump-start&quot; those nations' economies.   The success of the Paris meeting proves that Cocom is&quot;very much alive,&quot; he said. Cocom will have to closely watchhow the special provisions for East Germany work, but afterthe two Germanys unite they will be &quot;treated like any otherCocom member,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
