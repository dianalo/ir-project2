Police declined to discuss the searches, saying the investigation would continue. Toshiba Machine is one of the world's largest machine-tool makers.    Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, said it had lodged a complaint with police against Toshiba Machine on Tuesday for allegedly violating a decree that bans the export of 178 high-technology, strategic items to the Soviet Union and other communist countries.    The decree is in line with an agreement with the Paris-based Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, whose members include the U.S. and Japan.    As previously reported, the Pentagon is investigating reports that Toshiba Corp. and a Norwegian intermediary were involved in selling the Soviets sophisticated metal-working machines that could be used to make Soviet submarines harder to detect. Senate aides have identified the Norwegian company as Kongsberg, a state-owned arms maker.    The Pentagon praised MITI and law-enforcement agencies for taking &quot;vigorous&quot; action to investigate Toshiba's suspected role in the Soviet sale. &quot;This is positive evidence that Japan views this problem with the same seriousness as we do,&quot; said Stephen Bryen, deputy undersecretary of defense for trade security policy.    A U.S. lawyer following the Pentagon investigation said the shipments would give the Soviets the ability to produce submarine propeller blades whose movement through the water can't be easily detected with existing U.S. anti-submarine technology.    According to a Japanese police announcement, Toshiba Machine exported four computerized milling machines and a computer program to the Soviets between December 1982 and June 1984. In Washington, the Senate aides said they suspected the shipments were made in 1985.    The police announcement said it is suspected that Toshiba Machine misrepresented the machines' capabilities in obtaining export permission from MITI.    Without government permission, the announcement added, the company provided the Soviets with a computer program allegedly intended to control and operate machines used in propeller production.    MITI said the government acted against Toshiba Machine &quot;in order to prevent the case from arousing possible mistrust at home and abroad against the government's control on export of strategic technology.&quot;    A convicted violator of Japan's export decree is subject to a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a fine of as much as the equivalent of $7,100, said Hiroyuki Fukano, a MITI official.    Mr. Fukano said the ministry lodged the complaint after a series of investigations by ministry officials that began last year following an official U.S. inquiry into the case. </TEXT></DOC>
