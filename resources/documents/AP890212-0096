The dollar opened at 128.60 yen, up 0.95 yen from Friday's closeof 127.65 yen.   A rise in prime lending rates by many American commercial banksand the news of a higher-than-expected U.S. producer price index forJanuary, both announced on Friday, combined to spur the dollar'srally, said a dealer from the Bank of Tokyo.   The dealer, who spoke anonymously, said the report showing thenation's producer price index for finished goods rose 1 percent lastmonth was ``stunning news.''   Also Friday, numerous banks in the United States raised theirprime lending rates from 10.5 percent to 11 percent.   The rate is closely watched because bankers use it as a basis forcalculating interest on corporate loans and for determining varioustypes of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, including homeequity loans.   Higher U.S. interest rates tend to make the dollar moreattractive to foreign investors.
