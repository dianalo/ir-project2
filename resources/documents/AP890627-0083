What we've gained is, China has a much more open economicsystem than when the Shanghai communique was signed quite a fewyears ago. What we've gained is 30,000 students right this minute, Ithink the figure is, studying in the United States. Chinese kidsgoing back there with a sense of what freedom and democracy is allabout. What we have gained is helping China move out of a period ofCultural Revolution isolation. And this relationship is important.And I can continue to express my outrage about what happened inTiananmen Square. But _ and I will _ but I am determined to do mylevel best to keep from injuring the very people that we're tryingto help, and I'm talking about the Chinese people generally.   So we've gained a lot from this relationship, and so have they.And I still think that it is in the strategic interest of the UnitedStates. I'm not talking about the old adage of playing the Chinacard or something of that nature, or playing the Soviet card. But ifyou look at the world and you understand the dynamics of the Pacificarea, good relationships with China are in the national interest ofthe United States. Now, it's hard to have them. It's impossible atthis moment to have what I would say are normalized relations, forvarious, very obvious reasons. But I am going to do my level best tofind a way to see improvement there that will help the Chinesepeople.   Q. If I could follow, sir.   A. Please.   Q. It's your personal relationship with China's leaders that I'mspeaking of. I'm looking for the benefit when you cannot evencomplete a phone call to Deng Xiaoping. I'm wondering if thepersonal relationship is...   A. The benefit is, I understand the situation. That's thebenefit. And leaders are changing all the time over there, so _ Imean recently _ so we've got to deal with who is there. We don'tdictate to China about their leaders. We express our concerns, asother leaders have. But let me be very clear. In my view, the UnitedStates has been out front, we've been out front on the steps we'vetaken. And I am very pleased that there has been broad support forthe position I have taken. And I heard it just today from the primeminister of Australia, one of the most knowledgeable men aboutChina. The Australians, you see, have always had a _ they've had,been a little out front. They've had relations before we did. Andthey have a rather, almost a unique standing in China; they've donea lot of business with China. They've worked _ they've had a lot ofexchanges with China. Bob Hawke feels that he knows most of theChinese leaders, the ones that we had been dealing with. And to hearhim say _ be as supportiv as he was today _ was very reassuring tome.   Yeah?   Q. Mr. President, how concerned are you...   A. Yes, Jesse, you're next.   Q. How concerned are you that the retreat _ the political retreatthat we've seen in China in recent weeks _ could be duplicated inthe Soviet Union?   A. Well, I did not predict what would happen in Tiananmen Squareand I don't know of any China expert, scholar or otherwise, whopredicted that. And I guess the lesson is go forward as best youcan, keep your eyes open, hold high the banner of values that webelieve in the United States. We have a special responsibilityaround the world in terms of human rights and democracy, freedom.But keep your eyes open. That's what I've learned from this.   Q. Have you had any communications with Secretary Gorbachev onthe situation in China?   A. Not on China. Maybe others in the administration _ notGorbachev personally, but I've followed carefully the statements outof there and, obviously, the Soviet Union has tried to, withGorbachev's visit to China, tried to improve relations. But I thinkthat's on a little bit of a hold, although maybe they're moreaccommodating than we are right now.   Yeah, Jessica?   Q. Mr. President, women's groups have been very pleasantlysurprised and saluting you for your statements yesterday aboutviolence, crimes against women and spousal abuse. And a couple haveasked the question whether you will be willing to take that messageto men's groups _ one said those ``macho groups'' _ such as the NRA,the American Legion, the Police Chiefs of America, and ask them tostop _ to get the word out to stop beating their wives and stopbeating _ the generic thing, not specific.   A. Hey listen, I'm a member of the NRA. You're hurting myfeelings, as they say in China.   Q. And the question is whether you will take the message to men'sgroups, instead of to the American Association of University Women.   A. Jessica, I hope that the message that _ because of the line ofwork you all are engaged in _ I hope that message got to everygroup. But I don't want to single out or acquiesce in a hypothesishere and..   Q. But you did say...   A. Say that the NRA is against women or the other groups yousingled out?   Q. But you spoke _ you talked about...   A. Come on, Jessie.   Q. But you talked about it to women who are very well aware ofthe problem. Your staffers here say they move their cars closer tothe White House after dark and have someone walk out with them. Sowomen know about the problem. My question is whether you will go andtake the message to men's groups and ask their help in eradicatingthe problem.   A. I'm trying to take the message to the whole country. That'swhat our whole crime package is about _ absolutely, anybody thatwants to listen.   Q. Now, you said also that you wanted to...   A. This is a follow-up, yes.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
