King Hussein cut short an overseas trip and headed home fromthe United States.   Eight people have been killed in the violence that beganTuesday, and the presidents of Jordan's professional associationscalled on Hussein to withdraw the armed forces from towns andvillages to prevent further bloodshed.   They said in a statement that the government had set a badexample in implementing austerity measures and called for electionsfor a new government.   Hussein will return to the worst unrest in his country since hisarmy put down violence by Palestinian guerrillas in 1971.   The rioting began Tuesday in the south, the bedrock of hissupport, in response to price increases of 10 percent to 50 percenton gasoline, cigarettes, heating oil and other commodities.   By Thursday night the violence had spread to the north.   On Friday, rioters in the northern town of Salt threw rocks atpolice and looted buildings. They shouted support for Hussein, butcalled for the ouster of Prime Minister Zaid Rifai, whom they blamefor austerity measures and declining living standards.   After the rioting, children played inside shattered offices, andhundreds of people milled around on the glass-strewn streets in thecity of 100,000 about 10 miles north of Amman. No injuries werereported in today's riots.   ``We are fed up with this government. They have stolen all ourmoney,'' said a man in his 60s who refused to give his name. Hesaid demonstrators ``trust the king's leadership and we know hewill respond.''   King Hussein, who was on a state visit to Washington, canceledhis trip to Britain that was set for today and because of therioting instead will return home, the Jordanian Embassy in Londonsaid.   The first riots occurred in the southern city of Maan, where thegovernment said four civilians and one police officer were killed.Three other people were reported killed in Mazar, 55 miles south ofAmman.   On Friday, troops banned Moslems from attending weekly prayersin mosques in Maan and other southern cities in an attempt toprevent more unrest.   Cancellation of Friday prayers is highly unusual in an Islamiccountry. The Koran, Islam's holy book, calls on Moslems toparticipate in the ceremony, and most take it as a binding duty.   State-run Jordan Television broadcast an appeal to Jordanians onFriday night to end the violence, and for the first time showedpictures of smashed buildings and destroyed vehicles.   ``These are the services which the government tried to providefor the whole country, and we paid with our tears and with oursweat and with our blood to have them built,'' said Mohammed Amin,the Jordan Television director who narrated the 20-minute program.   ``These were destroyed by a bunch of terrorists.''   Amin said the damage only would add to Jordan's economicproblems ``because now we have added pressure.''   The government announced the price increases Sunday as part ofan agreement with the International Monetary Fund to rescheduleJordan's $6 billion foreign debt. They came on top of risingunemployment and soaring inflation.   Israeli radio and TV reported the difficulties ``to instigateproblems,'' Amin said, and ``news agencies are exaggerating thepicture of the situation.''   Government officials earlier hinted that Moslem fundamentalistshad inflamed the unrest. Most of the rioting has involved nativeJordanians, not the Palestinian half of the population.</TEXT></DOC>
