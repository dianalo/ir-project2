Details of the two-year funding agreement weren't disclosed.    Diasonics, a maker of medical equipment, said Toshiba scientists will participate in the research, and the Japanese electronics giant will share the rights to non-patentable technology resulting from the joint effort. Any patents stemming from the research would go to Diasonics, the company added.    Magnetic resonance is a diagnostic method that uses computers, radio waves and magnetic fields to create images of internal organs. Diasonics said it is exploring the possibility that much higher magnetic fields may allow physicians to observe changes in an organ's cellular makeup, rather than structural changes in the organ.    Such high-field spectroscopic applications could lead to identification of disease conditions far sooner than they can be detected with current methods, Diasonics said. An official emphasized that the research with Toshiba involves &quot;exploring the viability of the concept,&quot; rather than near-term clinical applications.    Diasonics said Toshiba last year signed a five-year licensing and technology-exchange agreement under which it acquired certain Diasonics technology for the production and sale of magnetic-resonance-imaging systems in Japan and Western Europe. </TEXT></DOC>
