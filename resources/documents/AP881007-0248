The strategy _ which has forced the price of oil dramaticallylower _ will enable the Saudis and other members of the 13-nationOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stake outpositions prior to key meetings expected to be held this month andnext, the analysts said.   ``The lower prices get, the better it is,'' said Lucy Mullins,an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. ``It will force(the OPEC nations) to realize they have to take some kind ofdefinite action.''   Pierre Terzian, editor of the Paris-based oil publicationPetrostrategies, agreed.   ``The way things are being done is excellent,'' he said.``Unless there is enough pressure on ... the market, the cheatersin OPEC will never learn their lesson.''   World oil prices have plunged recently amid reports ofburgeoning supplies and persistent discord in OPEC. Prices havebeen running more than $5 a barrel below the cartel's benchmark of$18 for a 42-gallon barrel.   In New York trading Friday, the benchmark U.S. crude, West TexasIntermediate, closed at $12.94 a 42-gallon barrel, up 28 cents fromThursday.   Oil prices took a steep dive early in the week after SaudiArabia, the world's largest oil exporter, warned it will continueproducing more than its OPEC-set limit unless other cartel membersstick to their quotas.   Analysts estimated Saudi Arabia has recently pumped some 5.7million barrels a day, topping its 4.3 million-barrel quota.   ``It's an attempt by Saudi Arabia to crack the whip,'' said NickAntill, an oil analyst with the London brokerage County NatWest.   Added Terzian, ``If the Saudis continue the pressure on themarket, that's the only way an agreement can be reached.''   OPEC Secretary General Subroto warned recently prices couldplummet to $5 a barrel if the Saudis exploited their productioncapacity to force other cartel members to observe their quotas.   The bickering in the cartel precedes a joint meeting of two OPECcommittees. OPEC has not yet announced the date or place, butanalysts say Oct. 20 is likely, possibly in Madrid.   The talks will bring officials of Iran and Iraq to their firstOPEC meeting since an August cease-fire in their nearly 8-year-oldwar.   With the former enemies at the bargaining table, the officialswill likely discuss ways to shape a pact on production limits thatwill bring Iraq back into the quota system and discourage cheatingamong other members.   Both Iran and Iraq want to export more oil to pay for enormousprojects needed to rebuild their war-damaged economies.   Iraq refused to go along with its quota of 1.5 million barrels aday during the war and demanded a share equal to Iran's 2.4 million.   But analysts said Iraq has been pumping well above that level,averaging about 2.7 million barrels a day, and could reach 3.7million by mid-1989 with completion of a new pipeline through SaudiArabia to the Red Sea.   Iran's output has been estimated at less than 2 million barrelsa day.   The United Arab Emirates also has exceeded its ceiling of948,000 barrels. Oil minister Mana Saeed Otaiba has set the limitat 1.5 million barrels.   Analysts said the upcoming discussions will lay the groundworkfor a meeting of all 13 oil ministers scheduled to begin Nov. 21 inVienna, Austria.   Antill suggested the oil producers might settle on a productionpackage that would set a cartel ceiling of about 18.5 millionbarrels a day. The current level is a bit more than 15 millionbarrels, without Iraq.   The International Energy Agency estimated in its Monthly OilMarket Report that OPEC production, including Iraq, soared to 20million barrels a day in September, up from 19.8 million in August.   Under Antill's scenario, Iran and Iraq each would be assigned aquota of 2.7 million barrels a day and the United Arab Emirateswould be given several hundred thousand barrels a day more.   Ms. Mullins said the ministers also may consider lowering theirbenchmark price from $18 a barrel to $15. The current target, shesaid, ``is completely impossible.''   But Terzian noted the desire of both Iran and Iraq for moremoney and argued that keeping a fairly high target would help OPECwrite a new production accord.   The price evolution committee, one of the two panels meetinglater this month, is made up of Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria,Indonesia and Venezuela.   The other panel, the long-term strategy committee, includesIraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Venezuela.   The other members of OPEC are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar andthe United Arab Emirates.</TEXT></DOC>
