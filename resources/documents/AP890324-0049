PAULSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A sheriff who had written a position paper againstsemiautomatic weapons found his fears borne out hours later when aman went on a rampage with an assault gun, killing two people andwounding three, including two deputies.   In the paper, Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat Sullivan said lawsshould be tightened to control who can buy such weapons, and if theycan't be controlled, he urged the Colorado Legislature to ban theirsale.   On Thursday, 20-year-old Eugene Thompson Jr. used a MAC-11semiautomatic pistol to kill two women and shot the others,including two of Sullivan's deputies, before killing himself,authorities said.   ``Everything I say in this position paper is true. Our officersare out-gunned by these weapons of war. These guns are designed tokill and maim people,'' he said.   Sullivan said the MAC-11 can hold 32 rounds, and fire 10 timesfaster than the standard .38-caliber pistol issued to all sheriffs.   ``I am a western Coloradan who enjoys big game hunting and Idon't want to see anything that would hurt sport hunting,'' Sullivansaid in the position paper he wrote Wednesday. ``But we have to dosomething about these weapons of war.''   In the paper, Sullivan cited the January shootings in Stockton,Calif., in which five school children were killed and 29 pupils anda teacher were wounded by a man carrying a semiautomatic gun knownas the 56S, a copy of the Chinese-made AKM-47.   ``This tragic event has stimulated city, county, state andfederal legislative efforts to control or ban these weapons ofwar,'' Sullivan said.   The California Assembly has approved a ban on 40 types ofassault-type weapons, and similar bills are pending in other states.The Bush Administration temporarily has banned the import ofsemiautomatic assault rifles. The MAC-11 used by Thompson would nothave been affected because it is American made.   Sullivan said that although the Constitution gives citizens theright to import, manufacture, sell and possess semiautomaticweapons, there is also ``a burden to place some reasonable controlson these weapons of war without abridging the sportsman's right tolegitimate sporting rifles.''   Ted Strickland, president of the state Senate, said things mightnot be so easy.   ``What happens in the land of the fruits and nuts is notnecessarily applicable here,'' Strickland, a Republican, said. Hesaid the tragedy undoubtedly would trigger emotional reponses onboth sides.   But as with previous gun-control measures, he said, ``there willbe an awful lot of heat generated, not much light and very few mindschanged.''</TEXT></DOC>
