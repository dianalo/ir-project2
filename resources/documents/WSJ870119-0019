Lawyers say the move may be the first step toward consolidating all lawsuits here.    The court also appointed a plaintiffs' investigative committee, which will begin sifting through the wreckage tommorrow for evidence. Wendell Gauthier, a New Orleans attorney and member of the legal committee, said the group agreed to limit the number of expert witnesses to 38.    Less than three weeks after the tragedy, which killed 96 and injured 140, lawsuits demanding more than $64 million already have been filed. More suits are predicted. But it isn't clear who all the defendants will be because ownership of the hotel is in doubt.    Lawsuits are expected to be filed against other companies, such as contractors and building-material suppliers. And some lawyers are contemplating claims against the local Teamsters union, two members of which have been charged with deliberately setting the blaze. Teamsters officials have said the union leadership isn't responsible. </TEXT></DOC>
