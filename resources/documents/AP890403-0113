Anger builds steadily in many of the soldiers _reserves called up from civilian life _ and the order comes todrive them off. Then comes the guilt, the guilt that some of theIsraelis will carry with them perhaps for life. An Associated Presscorrespondent talked to Israeli veterans of the Arab uprising inthe occupied territories. This is her report.</TEXT><NOTE>By ALLYN FISHER</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In hot pursuit of a stone thrower, an Israelilieutenant charged into an Arab home and and began bashing hisnight stick down on beds to rouse a suspect. A tiny quiver underone bedcover suddenly stopped him.   Trembling, the officer pulled back the cover and lifted a babyboy from the bed. He gently cuddled the infant and handed him tohis frightened mother.   Then he bolted out the door.   ``He went crazy thinking that if he hadn't stopped banging thatstick in time, he would have killed that baby,'' said Moshe Golan,a reserve paratrooper who was with the officer named Itzik duringthe angry search for a young Palestinian stone thrower who hadinjured a fellow soldier.   Nearly a year later Golan recalls Itzik's words as they left thehouse in the occupied West Bank.   ``Moshe, hold me before I collapse. You don't know what I almostdid.''   The encounter was one of dozens occurring daily as the Israeliarmy tries to halt the Palestinian uprising in the occupied WestBank and Gaza Strip. Fifteen months after the revolt began, somesoldiers have begun questioning their role in putting down thecivilian rebellion.   The questions have surfacd in letters to newspapers and tomembers of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, and in one angryexchange with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir when he visited reserveparatroopers in the West Bank.   More than 100,000 Israeli soldiers have served in the occupiedterritories and the reactions are mixed.   Some feel guilt over harsh methods used against youthful stonethrowers, some in their pre-teens. Others feel the army has anundeserved mean image, that in fact soldiers' moral scruples get inthe way of effectively halting the revolt.   Many feel ambivalent about their actions. Soldiers tell of beingdemoralized by confrontations with Arab youths who curse them andhurl stones even under gunfire, making troops feel they arefighting a losing battle. The frustration often makes them losetheir tempers.   Combat training, they add, has left them unprepared to fightcivil insurrection, where soldiers must hesitate to open firebecause their enemies don't use guns. Some soldiers were sent toquell protests while still in basic training.   Golan, who served two months in the West Bank, was amongsoldiers and army officials interviewed by The Associated Press onthe troops' feelings about their role in the occupied lands.   ``I feel constant conflict,'' he said. ``After all an Arab is ahuman being. But even the most moderate guys tend to get thisfeeling they have to grab the first Arab and take out all theiranger on him, to beat him or break his bones.''   Golan now is a nature guide.   Doru Ehrlich, a 36-year-old reserve artilleryman, said hisservice in the West Bank town of Qalqilya left him with the sameconfusion.   ``I have a guilty conscience ... about doing things like goinginto homes to arrest people.'' he said. ``You go to conduct anarrest. They're all sleeping on the floor. A small boy wakes upwith your gun in his face. I think of my own son.''   But Erhlich added that he thought the army had no choice indoing what it has been doing and perhaps should try even strongermeasures.   ``I've gotten to the point where I'm sick of it all. We have tomake a decision. Either get an order to open up machinegun fire onthem or to the contrary. But just to get this over with.''   Erhlich described an instance where he lost his temper aftergiving some youngsters candy, then spotting the same childrengathering to throw stones at his patrol.   ``I wanted to slam somebody I was so angry. It makes you feellike doing things you don't want to do. They get you into such amood that even if you want to remain human, they don't let you.''   Ehrlich said he searched an entire week for one of the boys.   ``Finally I found him. I found out where he lived. I even founda hatchet in his house. That kid, when I caught him, I just bashedhim in the head. Even if you love children, at that same momentyou're going to hit him. It's just because you're there.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
