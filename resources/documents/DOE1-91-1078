The IR-MCFC system utilizes hydrocarbonfuels, such as methane, directly in the fuel cell, thus eliminating mostof the external fuel processing equipment and other support systems requiredby conventional fuel cell systems. The initial study established a simple,environmentally-benign, power plant design capable of a low heat rate(6500 Btu/kWh) at a capital cost of about $1200/kW for a complete powerplant. It is anticipated that such a simplified dispersed generator systemwill have potential applications for utility, institutional, and lightcommercial or industrial power supply systems. Advantages over conventionalpower generators include high efficiency, extremely low emission levels,and potential for cogeneration. The objective of the extension studywas to refine the development targets established in the previous work.This objective was met in two steps. Parametric studies of fuel cellstack design and operating parameters were performed. Changes to thepower plant process configuration were then studied in order to enrichthe fuel and oxidant streams and to relax fuel cell technology developmentconstraints. The starting point for these activities was the baselinesystem design established in the previous work. The busbar cost of electricitywas used as the determinant in assessing the impact of various changesto design parameters and to the system configuration. The combined resultsfrom these two steps suggest boundaries for the development of the IR-MCFCsystem.</TEXT></DOC>
