This new development in the Bloch case came after officialsdisclosed in Washington that Bloch got recent merit raises totalingmore than $13,000 for work ``well above average.''   Bloch's reported admissions came in his one brief interview withthe FBI on June 22, the newspaper said, citing an ``officialinvolved in the case'' as its source.   Informed of this report, three administration sources familiarwith the Bloch case said in Washington Thursday night they had notbeen informed of such admissions.   But The Associated Press learned from a congressional sourcethat the FBI believes Bloch was recruited by the KGB, the Sovietintelligence service combining the functions of the FBI and theCIA, during service at the U.S. Embassy in East Berlin 14 years ago.   Block reportedly refused to discuss with the FBI any possiblespying activities or his motives.   The newspaper said the FBI received information that promptedmajor interest in a trip the diplomat was making to Europe. Theagency notified foreign intelligence services and congressionalcommittees, and somehow the information got out, leading to thepreviously reported overhearing of a Soviet agent telling Bloch,``A bad virus is going around and we believe you are now infected.''   Bloch got a raise of $4,500 for fiscal year 1983-84; $4,000 for1984-85 and $4,800 for 1985-86, said a U.S. official who spoke onlyon condition of anonymity.   The pay increases were given to Bloch while he served as thedeputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, where he wasposted from 1980 to 1987. Recommendations for the merit awards weremade by, among others, the U.S. ambassador to Austria who has beenpublicly critical of Bloch's performance, said the official.   The ambassador to which the official referred was Helene VonDamm.   The State Department calls such raises performance pay awards,granted only to those whose work is deemed ``well above average,''said another official, who also insisted on anonymity.   Government sources have said Bloch was videotaped in Parishanding a briefcase to a Soviet agent. He has not been charged witha crime, but his diplomatic passport and State Departmentcredentials have been revoked.   Agents are engaged in what is expected to be a lengthy _ andpossibly futile _ search for the specific evidence required tocharge Bloch under the Espionage Act, including what secrets, ifany, were compromised. Government sources have thus far beenunwilling to say when they believe Bloch began spying for theSoviets.   In other developments:   _President Bush added his voice to those advocating improvedU.S. counterintelligence efforts since disclosure that diplomatFelix S. Bloch is under investigation as a possible Soviet spy.   _Government sources familiar with the case said that the54-year-old State Department official could remain free for a longtime while FBI agents try to identify specific secrets, if any,that he may have turned over to the Soviets.   _Bloch ended a three-night stay at his father's East Side co-opin New York City. Trailed by FBI agents and reporters, he drove tohis daughter's house in Chappaqua, N.Y., north of the city.   The ambassador during most of Bloch's tenure in Vienna wasHelene Von Damm, who was a senior White House secretary to formerPresident Reagan before being appointed to the Vienna post.   Von Damm, who left during a social flap involving her marriageto an Austrian, was replaced by Ronald Lauder, now a Republicancandidate for the mayor's job in New York City.   Lauder has said he did not like or trust Bloch, and asked forhim to be recalled. But State Department officials have said it wastime for Bloch to come home anyway, after seven years in Vienna.   Merit raises in the Senior Foreign Service are sometimes givento diplomats who are eligible for more senior postings but cannotget them because of a shortage of vacant slots.   Raises in the Senior Foreign Service can go as high as $9,000 ayear, one official said.   Bloch was put on paid leave by the State Department June 22 andis under no travel restrictions. He makes about $80,000 a year,according to officials speaking on condition of anonymity.   Bush, at a photo session in the Oval Office, told reporters,``The question is: Can we improve our counterintelligence? Wealways ought to be striving to do that. Can embassy security beimproved? We go through this periodically and the answer is, I'msure it can.''   In Vienna, Friday's editions of the Neue Kronen Zeitung said anFBI team had arrived to assist in the investigation there. FBIspokesmen in Washington would not confirm that, but Vienneseofficials had said earlier in the week they were searching for aprostitute who they said had a relationship with Bloch while he wasthe No. 2 officer in the U.S. Embassy there.   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov saidthe Soviet Union has no connection with Bloch. Gerasimov said hemade inquiries about Bloch's activities. ``The name of Bloch wasnot familiar. We have no connection with him. We have nothing to dowith him.'' he told a regular news briefing. ``It is lamentablethat the U.S. press fans such hysteria.''   U.S. government sources have said Soviet officials in the UnitedStates, who must use autos with license plates coded by country,took the unusual step of watching Bloch's apartment and followinghim and the FBI in an auto caravan from Washington to New York onSaturday.   Retired deputy FBI counterintelligence chief James Nolan said,``I've never heard of that before in 20 years. Normally they stayas far away from these cases as possible.''   The American Civil Liberties Union on Thursday ``condemnedgovernment officials who have made statements, publicly and off therecord, suggesting that Felix S. Bloch is guilty of a crime eventhough he has not been indicted.'' U.S. law entitles Bloch to apresumption of innocence, the group said.</TEXT></DOC>
