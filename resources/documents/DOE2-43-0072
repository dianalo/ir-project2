<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-43-0072 </DOCNO><TEXT>The problems of the Bauff lectures are summarized. The study of the (e,e'p)reaction for small values of the photon four-momentum has led to strongconstraints on the D and /sup 3/He wave function up to momentum of theorder of 500 MeV/c. The two-nucleon correlations in the (e,e'pp) reactionare considered. Selection rules strongly suppress the two-body currentsin the transverse cross sections. Two-body correlations provided thatfinal state interactions are carefully taken into account. 7 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
