BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Donald Trump's proposed $7 billion buyout of AMRCorp., already surrounded by skepticism, was placed in furtherdoubt Friday by a stock market drop blamed in part on problems inanother airline buyout, analysts said.   ``This seems to poison the atmosphere, at the very least, forairline buyouts involving a lot of debt,'' said one industryanalyst who asked not to be named.   The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks fell 190.58 pointsafter a management-pilot group said it could not obtain financingfor a $6.75 billion buyout of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines.   Trump has proposed a $120-per-share buyout of Fort Worth-basedAMR, the parent of American Airlines, but the company has notresponded beyond a promise that it will consider the offer,although it prefers to remain independent.   Trump has said he will include $1 billion of equity in hisoffer, but has provided no other financing details, leading toskepticism over his ability to complete the deal.   AMR's stock price slippped to $98.62{ Friday in compositetrading on the New York Stock Exchange, before trading halted inthe mad sell-off during the last hour of business. Trading wasstopped because of an imbalance of orders for AMR, with many moresellers than buyers.   Although the close was down just 12{ cents from Thursday, itrepresented a $4.62{ drop during the day. AMR had climbed to$103.25 before its slide began in early afternoon.   The close was also the stock's lowest price since Trump's offerwas disclosed Oct. 5. Analysts expect the stock to continue totrade far below the level of Trump's offer until there is asignificant move by either side.   AMR officials would not comment on Friday's market developments;Trump officials in New York did not return telephone calls.   Analysts said Trump will have to lower his price if he expectsto pull off the deal.   ``If you look at history's precedents, those situations thatwere in an arbitrage environment were materially altered (by marketswings) on the downside,'' said airline analyst Kevin Burke inCharlotte, N.C.</TEXT></DOC>
