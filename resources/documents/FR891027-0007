These Advisory Notes describe items that are more likelyto be approved for export to destinations in the Soviet Bloc. This finalrule makes conforming changes related to the eligibility of such itemsfor export to certain free world destinations under General License GFW.Section 771.23 of the Export Administration Regulations permits exports,under General License GFW, of certain low level commodities to destinationslisted in supplement Nos. 2 and 3 to part 773, except Ethiopia, Lebanon,and Nicaragua. Items eligible for export under General License GFW aredescribed in certain Advisory Notes for Country Groups QWY. When a CCLentry contains items that are eligible for export under General LicenseGFW, the ``Controls for ECCN'' section in that entry will include a ``GFWEligibility'' paragraph identifying the Advisory Notes that describe theeligible items.This rule does not amend any of the Advisory Notes that describe itemseligible for export under General License GFW_it merely revises or eliminatesa number of ``GFW Eligibility'' paragraphs to conform with recent revisionsto the Advisory Notes. Accordingly, the ``GFW Eligibility'' paragraphsfor Export Control Commodity Numbers (ECCNs) 1501A, 1510A, 1531A, 1533A,1537A, 1555A, 1558A, 1565A, and 1567A are revised and the ``GFW Eligibility''paragraphs for ECCNs 1091A, 1519A, 1548A, 1549A, and 1754A are removed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule is effective October 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Willard Fisher, Regulations Branch,Bureau of Export Administration, Telephone: (202) 377-3856.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. This rule complies with Executive Order 12291 and Executive Order 12661.2. This rule does not involve a collection of information subject to thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruledoes not impose a new control. Further, no other law requires that a noticeof proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given forthis rule.Therefore, this regulation is being issued in final form. Although thereis no formal comment period, public comments on this regulation are welcomeon a continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Willard Fisher,Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration,Department of Commerce, P.O.
