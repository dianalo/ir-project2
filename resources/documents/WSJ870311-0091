They said the U.S. didn't threaten any immediate action in the wake of the South Korean decision, but it was clear that Washington would continue to press the issue.    Mr. Baker began prodding South Korea and Taiwan last July to let their currencies rise. He was acting partly in response to complaints from U.S. businessmen and lawmakers that the Treasury's broader efforts to drive down the value of the dollar weren't having any impact against newly industrializing countries.    Since the dollar generally peaked against most currencies in February 1985, it has plunged an average of 40% against the currencies of industrial countries, making imports from those countries less competitive and U.S. exports to them more attractive. Until last July, however, the U.S. currency's value hadn't fallen substantially against those of countries such as South Korea and Taiwan -- and America's trade position with those countries has continued to worsen.    Since the U.S. that month began pressuring the two countries, both have cooperated some in allowing their currencies to rise. But they've kept a low profile, contending it would be politically unpopular at home to admit that they've been acceding to U.S. demands.    South Korea initially permitted its won to appreciate fairly rapidly, but more recently it declared it would allow only enough appreciation to keep the exchange rate stable after accounting for inflation. The U.S., in its latest push, had sought to persuade South Korea to return to the previous pace of appreciation.    Even now, South Korea projects that its trade surplus with the U.S. will soar to between $8 billion and $10 billion this year, from $4.3 billion in 1986.    U.S. officials called Seoul's current stance disappointing. The South Korean won rose 3.26% against the dollar from last July to last month, while the new Taiwan dollar has risen 8.7%. Most analysts believe that the Taiwanese currency was decidedly more undervalued.    Washington has been trying to deal with the issue quietly for fear of setting off a public squabble that could prove politically counterproductive. U.S. economists say the issue is mainly a political one. Even if both countries did exactly what Washington requested, the U.S. trade deficit with them is a relatively small part of this country's overall $170 billion trade deficit.    A solution has proven elusive partly because South Korea and Taiwan compete with each other in exporting to the U.S. Each fears it will lose out against the other if it allows its currency to appreciate more rapidly against the U.S. dollar. </TEXT></DOC>
