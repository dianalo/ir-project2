Greenspan told the Senate Finance Committee that restrictingdeductions for interest paid on high-yield bonds and other debt tofinance leveraged buyouts, takeover defenses and corporaterestructuring ``would create adverse secondary consequences.''   In response to questions, however, Greenspan said it is notpossible to ``figure out in advance'' what the consequences oftax-law changes would be and acknowledged, ``If it were done over along period of time, I suspect the market implications would not belarge.''   Greenspan's comments conflicted with comments by Bush and Reaganadministration officials who have put part of the blame for theOctober 1987 stock market crash on an aborted attempt then by theWays and Means Committee to modestly restrict interest deductions ondebts incurred in corporate restructurings.   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman David Ruder warnedthe Finance Committee on Wednesday that tampering with the tax codecould create another panic in a ``skittish and nervous'' stockmarket.   Both the Finance and Ways and Means committees are re-examiningleveraged buyouts in the wake of the pending $25 billion purchase ofRJR Nabisco Co. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. and the $13 billionbuyout of Kraft Inc. by Phillip Morris Co. last year.   Those were the biggest two of more than 300 leveraged buyoutstotaling nearly $100 billion in 1988.   Two weeks before he took office, President Bush, in discussingbuyouts, left open the possibility of changing the way the tax lawstreat dividends and deductions for interest payments on junk bonds.   A leveraged buyout is similar to a person buying an automobile oncredit with a very small down payment. In the case of the autopurchase, a three- to five-year loan is secured by the value of thecar being bought.   With a leveraged buyout or restructuring of a corporation,high-interest junk bonds secured by the company's assets are issuedto buy stock from shareholders at premiums 45 percent or more aboveits market price beforehand.   To cover the interest payments, the new owners often have to cutback on research, sell off some assets or divisions, close stores orplants, lay off workers or cut their pay and and reduce pensioncontributions.   Congress in 1986 voted to gradually end the tax deductions forinterest paid on car loans and other consumer credit purchases, butleft in place deductions for home mortgages and virtually allcorporate debt.   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland told the committee that Congressshould make ``similar discriminations with regard to thedeductibility of interest on the various types of corporate debt.''   Kirkland estimated that mergers, takeovers and leveraged buyoutsthis decade have directly cost 90,000 union workers their jobs andforced thousands of others to suffer cuts in their wages andbenefits.   ``While the rest of the industrialized world soberly invests inthe future, our financial elite _ with the complicity of majorbanks, brokerage firms, investment house and prestigious law firms _is engaged in drunken short-term speculative revels,'' Kirkland said.   ``The government should not be subsidizng these questionabledeals by providing tax subsidies, but this is precisely what the taxcode does,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
