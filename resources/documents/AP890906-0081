The police official also confirmed front-page reports carried bythree major dailies saying that investigators have found no evidenceto support suspicions that the Israelis trained assassins for druglords in Colombia.   The six Israelis have said they were training farmers to defendthemselves against attacks by leftist guerrillas.   Trying the officers would be an unusual crackdown by the defenseestablishment on Israelis involved in overseas weapons deals. Oftensuch officers are protected by their reputations as wartime heroes.   News of the army officers' alleged involvement caused a publicuproar, partly out of embarrassment over allegations of their linkswith the Medellin drug cartel and its assassination campaign inColombia.   The investigation of six Israelis of the security firm HodHahanit, or Spearhead, began Aug. 27 after an American televisionnetwork showed a uniformed man speaking Hebrew during a trainingsession of supposed drug assassins.   The senior police official said the investigation should becompleted early next week.   Israeli reports said Colombian police have failed to give theIsraelis any evidence of narcotics-related crimes. The investigatorshave questioned the suspects about their involvement and questioneddefense officials on licensing regulations. Their informationindicates the suspects violated Israeli law by failing to obtain alicense before holding military training courses overseas, thepolice officer said.   The charge carries a maximum punishment of seven yearsimprisonment. A lesser charge could be brought following expectedplea bargaining, the police official said.   Yediot Ahronot newspaper identified the Israelis likely to standtrial as three reserve officers, Yair Klein, Amatzia Shoali andAvraham Zadaka, as well as their associates Teddi Melnick, Dror Eyaland Yitzhak Shoshani-Mariot, who mediated the deals in Colombia. Allsix have been questioned by police.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has said he denied the officers alicense to train gunmen in Colombia.   Klein, a lieutenant colonel in the reserves, has argued he didnot need a license because he was training cattle farmers, notofficials. He also has denied having anything to do with drugdealers.   Asked about rpeorts he will stand trial, Klein told Hadashotdaily: ``This is a technical violation. When it reaches the court,I'm sure I will be acquitted.''   Klein commanded an infantry batallion in Israel's 1982 Lebanoninvasion and began his career in weapons dealing by selling arms tothe Christian Phalange militia in Beirut after completing activemilitary duty in 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
