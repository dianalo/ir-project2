Copies of the tape were delivered to two Western news agenciesin Beirut four days after Anderson, 41, spent a fourth birthday incaptivity. They were accompanied by a statement in Arabic fromIslamic Jihad, which holds Anderson.   In Los Angeles, President Regan denied his administrationimpeded the release of the hostages.   ``I don't think that was Terry speaking,'' Reagan said of thevideotape. ``I think he had a script that was given to him.''   He president added: ``We have been doing everything we can forthe release of the hostages, and the very simple answer is, forthose people, to let them go.''   Reagan's chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the kidnapperswere trying to influence the U.S. election.   ``This is a cynical attempt to use the hostages to influencepublic opinion and the only real answer is for them to release thehostages immediately,'' Fitzwater said. ``It's not clear what theyare trying to achieve, but its's obviously meant to influence the(U.S.) election.''   Anderson began his message, which lasted two minutes and 35seconds, by identifying himself and saying the date was Oct. 30.   ``Once again I have been given the chance to speak to mygovernment, my family and my people,'' said the chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press.   ``I love you, I miss you very much. I know of your continuedstrong efforts for me,'' he told friends and family.   ``I have been very close to being released several times overthe past three years, but each time it seems that the U.S.government uses its influence to stop any agreement and I don'tunderstand this.   ``I am not asking Reagan to deal with terrorists, although Mr.(George) Bush did so in the Iran-Contra affair and TWA hijacking.''He did not elaborate.   Bush, the Republican candidate for president, has not previouslybeen named as a negotiator in the 1985 jet hijacking, in whichShiite Moslems demanding freedom for Shiite prisoners held 39Americans for 17 days. Israel released 766 prisoners.   Fitzwater said today that Anderson's statement about Bush was``totally incorrect, wrong.''   The vice president has said he was not a key player in the saleof arms to Iran and was unaware of details and planning of it. Thedeal became known as the Iran-Contra affair when it was revealedthat money for the arms was funneled to Contra rebels in Nicaragua.   ``Our problem could have been solved a long time ago withoutsuch complications as arms deals,'' Anderson said.   He urged the administration to negotiate his release andappealed to the new U.S. president to end the plight of thehostages. The Reagan administration has said it won't negotiatewith terrorists.   It was the third videotaped message from Anderson since hisabduction in Moslem west Beirut on March 16, 1985. The other tapeswere released Oct. 3, 1986, and Dec. 24, 1987.   Anderson is the longest-held foreign hostage in Lebanon. Thereare 14 captives, including nine Americans.   Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, said in an accompanying statementthat it provided the videotape ``on the occasion of TerryAnderson's birthday and in response to your letters, and accordingto his desire to send you a recorded message.''   Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, 56, of Fort Collins,Colo., acting dean of agriculture at American University in Beirut.He was kidnapped June 10, 1985.   The group is demanding, among other things, freedom for fellow``holy warriors'' from all foreign jails and withdrawal of Israeliforces from south Lebanon. It repeated those demands in a statementOct. 23.   Anderson appeared relaxed as he read from the preparedstatement. He was cleanshaven and wore eyeglasses. His hair was cutshort and neatly combed. He was shown from the waist up, wearing astriped gray sweater.   ``I am well and being well treated and I received your birthdaygreetings and as always I thank you very much,'' he said.   Letters from family members and colleagues appeared in Beirutnewspapers last week, and state-run television broadcast aone-minute film Thursday of Anderson's 3-year-old daughter, Sulome,singing ``Happy Birthday.''   Anderson said: ``As my fourth birthday in captivity passes andthe end of my fourth year in captivity approaches, I find itdifficult to keep my hope and courage high.   ``The news I hear tells me that I have not been forgotten andwill not be, but the difficulty seems enormous.''   ``I heard on the radio of the generous and ambitious efforts tofree three trapped whales a few days ago and the president's thanksto the Soviet Union for its help. It is a warming story,'' he said.``That kind of cooperation and spirit is absolutely necessary tobring this situation to an end.''   To his family, he said: ``Peg, Madeleine and Dad, kiss mydaughters for me. Keep your spirits up and I will try to do thesame and one day soon, God willing, this will end.''   The reference to ``Dad'' indicates Anderson does not know hisfather died in 1986. ``Peg'' is Peggy Say, Anderson's sister, and``Madeleine'' is Sulome's mother.   Islamic Jihad has freed three Americans in the last three years_ the Rev. Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian minister, the Rev. MartinLawrence Jenco, a Roman Catholic priest, and David Jacobsen, formerdirecter of the American University Hospital in Beirut.   Jacobsen's release Nov. 2, 1986, was connected to the shipmentof U.S. arms to Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
