 At a the meeting inParis earlier this month, the group decided to revise the controlledtechnologies list, removing 38 items from 116 listed categories.andP;  At thecentre of the controversy are the &quot;dual-use&quot; technologies which covercomputers, machine tools and telecommunication technologies.andP;  It is arguedthat such technologies though ostensibly sought by Eastern Europe forcivilian purposes could be used by the military.andM;US intransigenceandM;For this reason the US government in particular has been jumpy about easingsuch restrictions, while Western Europe has been far keener to startmarketing products to its Eastern half.andP;  Indeed, in February CoCom talksground to a halt largely because of US intransigence on the issue.andP;  However,since then, according to the International Herald Tribune, the mood in the UShas changed to the extent that its House of Representatives has passed &quot;TheExport Facilitation Act of 1990&quot; which proposes to free controls on goods andtechnologies to most countries, reduce the role of the Department of Defensein determining which technologies are militarily significant, and decontrolany items after further technological advances are made in their fields.andO;While the Act has not yet been debated in the Senate and so is not binding,it nevertheless marks a significant change in US attitudes.andP;  All of which isgood news for vendors in the information technology sector represented byCoCom where, by and large, technological advance is being driven by thecivilian rather than the military industry.andP;  As from July 1 printed circuitboards manufacturing equipment, telemetering and telecontrol equipment foruse with aircraft, space vehicles or weapons, semiconductor diodes andtransistors are among the 30 items deleted from the Industrial List.andO;Furthermore, from that date the following seven items will be liberated up tothe level currently allowed only for exports to China: equipment to makespecial electronic devices or magnetic recording media, robots, electronictesting equipment, assemblies of electronic components, analogue to digitaland digital to analogue converters, cameras and fibrous and filamentarymaterials.andP;  In other words, these items will be covered by Open GeneralExport Licences.andP;  Moving specifically to how this relaxation from July 1 willeffect computer sales, CoCom says that most personal computers up to the80386 level will be eligible for export with hardly any restrictions.andP;  Memorysizes of up to 32Mb will be allowed and the only restriction will be on itemssuch as graphic workstations designed for high-end computer-aided design andmanufacturing applications.andP;  Similar relaxations will apply to items such asmagnetic disks, tapes, communication channels and local area networks.andP;  Theagreement suggests that in certain cases (depending on end use andgeographical destination) very high grade computers may be allowed to beexported as part of another system.andP;  Peripheral equipment such as graphicinput devices and digitising equipment, image scanners, optical markrecognition equipment, all printers (unless embargoed by IL1572), graphicdisplays for signature and security checking, light gun devices (or manualgraphic input devices) and CD-ROMs will all become decontrolled.andP;  Theprocessor data rate relating to the above equipment has been set at 275M-bitsper second which means that machines like IBM's AS/400, DEC's MicroVAX 3000,Hewlett- Packard's HP3000 series and Control Data's Cyber 840 will all bedecontrolled.andP;  As for equipment shipping on its own and not as part of asystem most disk drives with capacity up to 165Mb, write-once drives up to3.2Gb, RAM stores up to 2Mb, magnetic tape drives up to 6250 bits per inchand streamer tapes with transfer rates up to 16 million bits per second willall become decontrolled.andP;  Also communication channels will be free fromexport control up to 9,600 bits per second, and displays or monitors up to1,280 by 1,024 resolution with a maximum of 256 colours or shades of grey.andO;Local area networks up to 20m bits per second with no inter-network gatewayswill also be allowed.andP;  On top of these relaxations, companies will also nowbe able to request licences to export computer systems with processing datarates of up to 1,000M-bits per second - this includes IBM 3090Es, ICL 3980s,DEC 8830s and 80486-based personal computers.andP;  According to Computer SystemsNews, some East European countries that have agreed to prevent the re-exportof computers (Poland, Hungary and Czechoslavakia) will get favourableconsideration to import systems up to 2,000M-bits per second.andM;Favoured countriesandM;CoCom lifted controls on most exports to East Germany pending politicalunification with West Germany.andP;  Again such favoured countries will getdifferent treatment as regards exports of telecommunication equipment -enabling them to buy common channel signalling equipment, Integrated ServicesDigital Network facilities and optical fibre systems up to 156M-bits persecond not eligible for export to countries such as Romania, Bulgaria and theUSSR.andP;  However controls on larger PABXs, as well as for cellular serviceswill have a blanket relaxation.andP;  In fact the Herald Tribune says the US isnot at all happy about the relaxation of telecommunications equipment to anyEast European country on the grounds that its National Security Agency wouldfind it harder to listen in on conversations in these countries.andP;  This hasresulted in the US government blocking a proposal by US West Inc to build a$500m fibre optics line across the USSR.andP;  A less advanced system proposed byCable andamp; Wireless has also been stopped by the UK Government.andO;Telecomunications companies aiming for a worldwide digital network would findit far less expensive to lay a line across mainland Russia than have tocircumvent it.andP;  As ever the fight is on between commerce and politics.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
