With an increase in the national debt limit needed next week tostave off a default by the Treasury, Senate Minority Leader BobDole, R-Kan., told Democrats that Republicans would agree to limitamendments to the debt-ceiling legislation to those repealing aMedicare tax to finance catastrophic illness coverage and a taxprovision opposed by business.   ``No capital gains amendment will be offered,'' he said on theSenate floor minutes after a meeting with top White House officialsincluding Chief of Staff John Sununu, Treasury Secretary NicholasBrady and budget director Richard Darman.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who metThursday evening with House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., andother Democratic leaders, said afterwards they were ``heartened bythe statement made by the president.''   Mitchell said he would make a counter-offer to Dole and ``we'renot rejecting anything.'' He declined to offer details.   Democratic sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, saidthey found the GOP proposal attractive. They wanted, however, tomake sure the Republicans would end ``back-door'' attempts to winapproval of a capital gains tax cut, such as a pending amendment toattach it to a bill providing aid to Poland and Hungary.   A White House statement said Bush's primary interest was inreducing the federal deficit and preventing Democrats from addingcostly new programs.   Republicans have been trying for weeks to break a Democraticblockade of their plan to cut the capital gains tax. Democrats havecalled the tax cut a giveaway to the rich and accused Bush and theRepublicans of sacrificing other priorities in their pursuit of thetax cut.   ``I deeply regret the tone of partisanship that has entered theeconomic policy debate,'' Bush said in the statement. ``I wouldvery much have preferred a fair and balanced debate _ and vote _ onthe merits. But the congressional process has bogged down.''   The stalemate has delayed the legislative agenda to the pointwhere the government is threatened with default next week becausethe Treasury's $2.8 trillion debt limit has not been raised.   By attaching the popular tax repeal measures to the debt-ceilingbill, Republicans would take away from the Democrats the mostattractive features of a separate tax and entitlement bill nowbeing negotiated between the House and the Senate. Democrats wouldlose leverage for their sometimes costly initiatives in that bill,including expanding health care benefits for the poor.   The tax and entitlement bill's underlying purpose is to reducethe federal deficit selectively and thus cancel $16.1 billion inspending cuts that took effect Oct. 1 because Congress and thepresident had failed to meet the goals of the Gramm-Rudmandeficit-reduction law.   Republicans said that their move was designed to force Democratsto pass a ``clean'' deficit-reduction bill or face the prospect ofleaving the Gramm-Rudman cuts in place.   ``If the Congress cannot agree upon a clean (deficit-reduction)bill that fully meets the test of fiscal responsibility, we areprepared to manage the government under'' the Gramm-Rudman cuts``for as long as it takes to reach agreement on a fiscallyresponsible bill,'' said the White House statement.   Before Democrats could consider the offer, Republican Sen. SteveSymms of Idaho blocked Senate action on a bipartisan plan to raisethe minimum wage for the first time in eight years. Symms refusedto allow debate unless he were given a chance to add amendments oncapital gains and repealing catastrophic illness coverage and thebusiness tax rule known as Section 89.   Adopted by Congress last year but not yet put into effect by theInternal Revenue Service, Section 89 would deny tax breaks tocompanies that do not offer the same health benefits to all levelsof employees.   Democrats on Thursday said Republican suggestions that theautomatic cuts remain in place were ``the irresponsible approach.''   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House BudgetCommittee, said the Gramm-Rudman cuts would cancel the plannedincrease in fighting illegal drugs, cost one million students theircollege grants and hurt the Pentagon, veterans and the homeless.   ``It is really a coward's approach to deficit reduction,'' hesaid.   Dole said supporters of reducing the capital gains tax wouldcontinue to pursue their goal on other bills by ``redoubling ourefforts.'' Senate rules, however, appeared to reduce their chancesof success.   Rep. Robert Michel, R-Ill., the House minority leader, said hewas willing to live with the automatic cuts for a while, but heconsidered the increase in the debt ceiling crucial.   ``We can't let the government topple on that (capital gains)issue, at least the government's ability to pay it's bills, honorits commitments,'' said Michel, who also attended the meeting.   The congressional Republicans indicated there was frustration onthe part of the White House.   ``We have to keep telling the governor (former New HampshireGov. Sununu) from time to time it's not quite like dealing with thelegislature, because the president doesn't have line-item veto(power) and some other things like that,'' Michel said.</TEXT></DOC>
