(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The countdown began early today for aMonday launch of space shuttle Discovery on a flight its commandersays will demonstrate ``we're a space-faring nation again.''   The launch will be the third for the shuttle program since theChallenger disaster more than three years ago, and the first ofseven flights scheduled this year as NASA moves toward its target ofsafe, routine, once-a-month missions by 1992.   ``The countdown started right on time,'' said NASA spokeswomanLisa Malone. The ambitious 1989 schedule is getting a late start,with Discovery's flight delayed nearly four weeks so faulty orsuspect engine parts could be replaced.   The countdown clock began ticking at 12:01 a.m. after testconductor Jerry Crute issued the traditional call to stations thatsummoned members of the launch team to their posts. The initial taskwas to electrically activate the spaceship's systems.   Charles Henschel, chief of test operations at the Kennedy SpaceCenter, told reporters today the early hours of the count hadprogressed well and that some checks were running ahead of schedule.   He reported gusty winds at Launch Pad 39B were delaying someengine closeout and other work but that this should have no impacton the countdown. He said the weather forecast for a Monday launchwas ``looking good.''   Liftoff is set for 8:07 a.m. Monday.   The five astronauts for the five-day mission were to arrive thisafternoon from their training base in Houston to make final flightpreparations.   The commander, Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats, said in a recentinterview that the first two post-Challenger missions, flownsuccessfully last September and December, ``were important to showthat we could fly the space shuttle again after the catastrophe.   ``The next step,'' he said, ``is to prove that we can do it on aregular basis, that we're back in the business of space, to showwe're a space-faring nation again.   ``It was very frustrating for us in the space program the lastthree years to watch the Russians set new flight time records and doall the things in space with their shuttle while we've beengrounded,'' Coats said.   Flying with Coats will be Air Force Col. John E. Blaha, thepilot; Marine Cols. James F. Buchli and Robert C. Springer, and Dr.James M. Bagian, a medical doctor.   Bagian and Springer are to release a $100 million Tracking andData Relay Satellite six hours after liftoff. The satellite is tojoin two identical satellites to form a global network fortransmitting communications among ground stations, the shuttle andseveral other satellites.   Once the new satellite is operational, NASA will begin closingdown six of its shuttle ground stations.   Following deployment of the satellite, the astronauts will settleinto four days of science and medical experiments.   The Discovery is scheduled to touch down March 18 at Edwards AirForce Base in California.</TEXT></DOC>
