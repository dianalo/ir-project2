It was believed to be the first triple-barreled transport actionsince the 1926 general strike, according to British Rail and LondonUnderground.   Careful planning and bright skies made it less nightmarish thancommuters expected, however.   London hotels were full of employees spending the night in thecity to beat the strike. Many companies hired fleets of buses, andThames River passenger ferries reported business was booming.   Some judges at the Old Bailey Central Criminal Court spent thenight in their offices, and hundreds of judges, lawyers and jurorswalked or cycled, enabling 17 of the 19 courtrooms to functionnormally. An early shortage of stenographers forced some judges totake their own notes as hearings got under way.   Senior prosecutor John Bevan cycled for several miles throughslow-moving traffic, carrying his gown in a bag on his back, and hesaid he wouldn't like to repeat the experience.   ``My nerves are shattered,'' he said. ``It really is a mostdangerous occupation.''   ``I saw a car with three bikes on the roof, two in the back, andfive people in the car. I guess they just drive as far as they canand get on their bikes,'' said Patrick Gilligan of London Bicycle Co.   Forewarned by police to drive only if necessary, motorists setout two or three hours early. ``Traffic was in fact quieter thannormal on most of the motorway routes around London,'' said theAutomobile Association.   Manchester, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Glasgow also reportedearlier rush hours, with traffic little worse than normal.   ``It looks as if motorists have been sensible, going in earlierand car-sharing,'' said the AA in Glasgow.   London parking garages were packed, and police refused to easeparking restrictions, saying it would encourage more people to driveinto the capital. However, free parking was set aside for busesbringing in commuters.   Evangelist Billy Graham also laid on extra free parking atCrystal Palace in south London, where he was preaching Wednesdaynight.   Overcoming traditional English reserve, many suburbanites sharedcars or were seen hitchhiking to work.   Travelers using London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports were urgedto use buses rather than taxis. Gatwick's express train to centralLondon was idled, as was the subway line to Heathrow.   On strike were 75,000 rail workers, 18,500 operators of London'sred double-decker buses and 10,500 subway workers, leaving only someprivate suburban bus routes operating in London.   It was the seventh subway strike in London in 11 weeks, but onlythe first by rail workers since 1982. London's buses and subwaysystem carry more than 3 million passengers a day and British Rail'snational network carries 2 million daily.   The rail unions are rejecting state-owned British Rail's offer ofa 7 percent wage increase, and their tempers have been inflamed bythe employer's unsuccessful attempts to block the strike in thecourts.   The National Union of Railwaymen says it scrupulously followedPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher's union-curbing laws, which requireunions to poll their members secretly and obtain a 55 percentmajority for a walkout.   The bus workers have rejected an increase of 8 percent or 9percent and want 14 percent. The subway workers want a $99 weeklyincrease to operate without a guard. Management is offering $46 plus14 days extra annual vacation, but is tying the raise to increasedproductivity.   Mrs. Thatcher, displaying her deep dislike for the unions thatdominated British life until her Conservative Party took office in1979, on Tuesday denounced the railway workers as ``typicallyselfish ... deliberately causing massive inconvenience to those whohave to work.''   The transport strikes, coupled with a surge in inflation to 8.3percent and interest rates at 14 percent, have taken some of theshine off Britain's economic recovery under Mrs. Thatcher, and areseen as one of the reasons for the rout of the Tories in last week'selections to the European Parliament.</TEXT></DOC>
