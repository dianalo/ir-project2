The contract to supply computer systems and service to theU.S. State Department and affiliated agencies represents abig boost for Wang, which has struggled to reverse hugelosses and declining sales.</LP><TEXT>   In American Stock Exchange trading, Wang's deeplydepressed Class B common stock soared $1.125, to close at$4.50.   Analysts applauded the contract, but some cautioned thatbig government sales can be fickle sources of profit. &quot;It'soften very difficult to say whether all that money willactually be spent, and at what level of profit,&quot; said JohnLevinson of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.   A Wang spokesman said the $841 million contract value isan estimate by the State Department of what it expects tospend. Like many federal procurements, however, it isformally considered an &quot;indefinite delivery, indefinitequantity&quot; purchase agreement.   Richard W. Miller, Wang's president, hailed the newbusiness as a vote of confidence in the company's stayingpower. &quot;A single contract, even one of this size, isn'tenough to carry a company. But it's evidence of ourcustomers' confidence in Wang,&quot; he said.   Since the former General Electric Co. executive joinedWang as its president, a year ago this week, the company hassold off assets to slash bank debt from $575 million to $12million, and reduced the work force from 28,000 last year toabout 19,500 today.   In an interview, Mr. Miller repeated that he expects thecompany to post a profit in the current year, ending June 30.He called the State Department contract &quot;a real morale boost.This has been a rough year, but we're a lot stronger now andour financial problems are behind us.&quot;   For the year ended June 30, Wang reported a $715.9 millionnet loss, or $4.35 a share, including restructuring chargesof $388.3 million and losses from discontinued operations of$87.3 million. Revenue, restated to reflect the sale ofoperations, declined 14% to $2.5 billion. A year earlier,Wang reported a net loss of $424.3 million, or $2.59 a share,including restructuring charges of $142 million and lossesfrom discontinued operations of $100.1 million.   Under the contract, the Lowell, Mass.-based computer makerwill supply its flagship VS line of minicomputers, personalcomputers and related equipment, software and trainingsupport over the next five years, with extension options fora total of 11 years. Included in the contract are suchapplications as word processing, image processing, electronicmail and messaging and database management.   Wang said one of the factors that worked in its favor inlanding the contract was its experience in building &quot;secure&quot;computer systems that resist electronic eavesdropping. Wanghistorically has had a big presence in the so-called Tempestor secure system market.</TEXT></DOC>
