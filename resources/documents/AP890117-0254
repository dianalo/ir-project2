Rothschild Quits As Primary Dealer</HEAD><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co. Tuesday said it voluntarilydecided to quit as a primary dealer in U.S. government securitiesand to discontinue most trading of the securities because theactivities have not been profitable enough.   The company said in a statement ``the return on capital devotedto its government securities operations was insufficient to warrantcontinuation of the business.''   Rothschild said it had ample capital to satisfy new guidelinesannounced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last November andthe decision was made purely on profitability grounds.   The guidelines announced by the New York Fed Nov. 17 doubled theminimum capital required for securities companies who have thecoveted title of primary dealer. The minimum was raised to more than$50 million.   Primary dealers can buy and sell U.S. government securitiesdirectly from the New York Fed. Through the buying and selling ofthe securities, the Federal Reserve System seeks to influenceinterest rates.   Therefore, financial firms with primary dealer status have aninsight into government interest rate policy. Also, primarydealership is sought-after because some big institutional investorsprefer to conduct their business exclusively through primary dealers.   The L.F. Rothschild move, which will result in the loss of about50 employees' jobs, curtails all of the company's sales and tradingactivities of U.S. government securities except for proprietarytrading, meaning for its own account. The company had been acting asa primary dealer for about two years.   From now on, Rothschild's operations will consist of fixed-incomesecurities sales and trading as a dealer in mortgage-backedsecurites, as well as corporate and high-yield securities. It willalso continue to operate in the investment banking field.   The withdrawal of L.F. Rothschild, a unit of Franklin SavingsAssociation based in Ottawa, Kansas, reduces the number of primarydealers to 44.   On Friday, County NatWest Government Securities Inc. announcedits departure from the exclusive group. County NatWest, a subsidiaryof Britain's largest bank, National Westminster Bank PLC, had beenunder pressure from the New York Fed to boost its capital.</TEXT></DOC>
