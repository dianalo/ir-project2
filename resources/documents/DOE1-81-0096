These calculations are used to determine the effect thatan assumed time scale for the thermal quench phase of the disruptionhas on the calculated plasma current decay rate, the partitioning ofthe plasma thermal energy, the predicted surface erosion of plasma interfacecomponents, and the predicted induced forces in structural components.Since the severity of the disruptive event can be compounded by a verticalinstability, the calculations have also been used to consider the caseof a disrupting plasma that simultaneously undergoes a vertical instability.</TEXT></DOC>
