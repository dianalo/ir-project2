(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 10-year-old boy has gone on trial inopen court for selling crack cocaine, despite his lawyer's pleasthat the case be closed to the public, as is the case in most FamilyCourt proceedings.   Suffolk County Family Court Judge Donald Auperin cited society'sconcern over drug abuse in ruling Tuesday that the case should betried before the public.   ``This is a tragic story of a young boy who may have been at thewrong place at the wrong time,'' the boy's Legal Aid lawyer, DouglasO'Connor. ``It wasn't his fault that he lives in a place where thesetypes of things take place. He did not choose the place where helives.''   The boy, whose name the judge asked the press to withhold, liveswith his family in a poor neighborhood in Wyandanch, a suburban LongIsland community about 20 miles east of New York City.   The 5-foot-tall defendant appeared bored and at times sleepy asfour Suffolk County police officers took the stand to describe theevents that led to his arrest Jan. 15.   Two officers testified that they saw the boy and his 14-year-oldcompanion selling crack from a BMX dirt bike that they rode up anddown Straight Path in Wyandanch, an area known for drug-dealing.   When police moved into arrest them, an officer testified, the10-year-old threw away a brown paper bag that was found to containthree plastic bags of crack, worth $20 each. The two boys were foundto be carrying $226. The older boy is being tried seperately.   During an intermission in the two-hour proceeding, he began tocry. A court officer asked his mother to comfort him, and she walkedover and patted him on the shoulder, which seemed to calm him.   When Tuesday's session was over, O'Connor asked if the childcould go home for the night, but the judge refused and ordered himtaken to the Nassau County Children's Shelter, where he has beenheld for the past two weeks.   As the child was handcuffed and led out, he called out in achoked-up voice, ``Mommy, are you coming back tomorrow?''   His mother called back, ``Yes, yes.''</TEXT></DOC>
