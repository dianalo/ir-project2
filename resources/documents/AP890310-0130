Secretary of Security Geoffrey Barnes, speaking upon his returnfrom an international meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on theregion's flood of asylum-seekers, said Vietnam has agreed to acceptanother 150 Vietnamese who have volunteered to go home after fleeingto Hong Kong by boat.   Hong Kong adopted a tough policy to treat all Vietnamese boatpeople arriving after June 15 as illegal immigrants subject torepatriation unless they can prove they fled persecution.   About 11,000 Vietnamese have sailed into this British colonysince then, and some have decided they would prefer to return toVietnam than face an uncertain future in crowded Hong Kong camps.   A group of 75 Vietnamese flew to Hanoi on March 2 in the firstlarge-scale repatriation of boat people.   Barnes quoted Vu Khoan, the leader of the Vietnamese delegationat the Malaysian conference, as saying he hoped to see another groupof Vietnamese return home soon.   ``He (Vu) also said he would like to see a larger group goingback than last time,'' Barnes said.   Barnes said he expected the next repatriation would take place inApril. ``In the meantime of course we'll try to encourage more to goback voluntarily,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
