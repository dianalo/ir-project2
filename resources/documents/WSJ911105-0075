Heroicmeasures to close his wounds and megadoses of antibioticskept him alive for two days. But by the third, his fallingblood pressure and temperature signaled that the 21/2-year-old was dying of septic shock.   In desperation, the hospital called Centocor Inc., makerof an experimental drug called Centoxin. With regulators'consent, some was flown to Pittsburgh and given to Steven.Within three hours his blood pressure was recovering, and inthree days all his vital signs were stable.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I try to be objective,&quot; says Adrian Dana, director ofinpatient pediatrics at Allegheny General Hospital, &quot;but theresults were pretty spectacular. I have to say that in myheart of hearts, this drug saved his life.&quot;   Hardly anyone is objective about Centoxin. For just aslofty as its life-saving potential is the price it is likelyto cost once it's approved for marketing: $3,000 to $4,000 adose. What's more, for every success story like Steven's, twoor three other patients won't be helped. But doctors won'tknow which ones until they give the costly drug. Thus, sincethe U.S. has 400,000 annual cases of sepsis infection,hospitals face the theoretical possibility of having to buy$1.5 billion of the drug -- knowing in advance that more than$1 billion of it wouldn't do any good.   No wonder that Centoxin, before it is even on the U.S.market, is being decried by some as a budget-buster -- and isreshaping the debate over the costs and benefits of medicaltechnology. In a market crowded with expensive treatments,few have spotlighted so starkly the host of thorny clinical,economic and ethical issues facing the U.S. health-caresystem.   &quot;This drug forces you to address the inherent conflictbetween doing what's best for an individual patient and doingwhat's best for a population of patients,&quot; says Richard E.Ward, assistant director of clinical effectiveness at HenryFord Health System in Detroit.   The issue is put in concrete terms by B. Robert Meyer,chief of clinical pharmacology at North Shore UniversityHospital in Manhasset, N.Y.: &quot;City hospitals are closingtheir pharmacies and people can't get a blood-pressure drugthat costs 60 cents,&quot; he says. &quot;We can't pay for universalvaccinations for children. How do we integrate a drug thatcosts $3,000 into that system?&quot;   Moreover, most of the patients who would be treated withthe new drugs for septic shock are very sick and likely todie before long, even if they get over septic shock. At thesame time, doctors who decide against using an available drugmight face legal liability.   With Centoxin widely expected to win regulatory approvalby year end, and a similar drug from Xoma Corp. movingforward too, hospitals are bracing for 20% rises in pharmacybudgets. That would be enough, they say, to send hundreds ofinstitutions into the red. Teams of doctors are combingmedical journals and analyzing past experience with septicshock to develop guidelines for which patients should receivethe drug. Researchers are devising models that expressCentoxin's value in terms of the cost per year of life itmight save. As a result of these and other restraints,initial sales of Centoxin -- Centocor's first therapeuticproduct -- won't be anywhere near the theoretical maximum,though they're still projected at a huge $200 million to $400million a year.   All of this portends a turbulent reception for a richpipeline of other new products, especially frombiotechnology, expected to reach the market in the 1990s.Centoxin is among 21 biotech products awaiting approval atthe Food and Drug Administration. Twenty-five more are nearthe end of clinical trials. Most represent important advancesfor heart disease, cancer, neurological diseases or otherailments, with a half-dozen aimed at septic infections. &quot;Thisis just the tip of the iceberg,&quot; says Dr. Meyer.   Already this year, Amgen Inc.'s Neupogen and ImmunexCorp.'s Leukine -- blood growth factors used in cancertreatment -- have arrived with sticker-shock price tags.Ondansetron, an anti-nausea drug (though not a biotechproduct) from Glaxo PLC, costs 20 times standard therapy.Studies show all three medicines significantly help somecancer patients. The worry is that doctors will try them on arange of other ailments where benefit is possible, though notproven, and where standard therapies are adequate.   &quot;The public wants everything that provides a benefit, butthey don't want health costs rising as fast as they are,&quot;says Earl Steinberg, director of medical technologyassessment at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions inBaltimore. &quot;Someone has got to make a value judgment aboutwhether the benefits are worth the cost.&quot;   Biotechnology companies say they're ready for thechallenge. &quot;The use of good drugs is the most cost-effectiveway of using the health-care system,&quot; says Elizabeth E.Tallett, president of Centocor's pharmaceutical division.&quot;It's expensive to have people in the hospital, and it'susually cheaper to treat people with drugs than withsurgery.&quot;   Centocor, based in Malvern, Pa., hasn't disclosed U.S.pricing plans. But it is already selling Centoxin in theNetherlands and Britain at the equivalent of $3,800 a dose;the U.S. price is expected to be in the same range.   Xoma's Xomen E5 could present Centoxin with competition,but it recently stumbled in regulatory proceedings and itsoutlook is uncertain. Xoma says its discussions with the FDAare moving forward satisfactorily. Assuming it reaches themarket, E5 would raise similar cost and efficacy issues.   The two companies are involved in a patent dispute. Afederal jury found last week that Centoxin infringes onXoma's patent -- although days earlier, Centocor received itsown patent. While the tiff may affect the companies'financial fortunes, most observers don't think it will keepCentoxin off the market.   Centocor says it has spent at least $250 milliondeveloping Centoxin, the first genetically engineered humanmonoclonal antibody to reach commercial development. Amongthe costs: expensive clinical trials and invention of aprocess to manufacture a human antibody in commercialquantities. The company says other widely used treatments,ranging from organ transplants to long-term use ofhypertension medicine, are at least as expensive whenmeasured by such standards as the years of life they save.&quot;We're not ashamed of the price,&quot; says Ms. Tallett. &quot;You'redoing what the health-care system is in business to do, whichis save lives. You have to find a way to fund that.&quot;   Many hospitals think that much of the load will fall onthem. Most patients who would be candidates for Centoxin areelderly, but the federal Medicare program isn't expected toincrease reimbursement to accommodate the drug soon. Theability to pass costs on to the private sector isincreasingly limited as companies and insurers negotiatetheir own contracts and more hospital care is paid for inadvance. &quot;This will punch big holes in hospital budgets,&quot;says Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New YorkHospital Association. &quot;You're talking about dropping $4million, $5 million off the bottom lines of some hospitals.&quot;   Septic infection kills 100,000 U.S. patients a year,making it the leading cause of death in hospitalintensive-care units and 13th on the list of killers of U.S.citizens. The infections generally piggyback on otherconditions, like surgery complications, urinary-tractinfections, pneumonia or trauma from car accidents or gunshots. The elderly and cancer patients taking chemotherapyare particularly vulnerable.   Between 30% and 40% of sepsis cases and 70% of the deathsare caused by organisms called gram-negative bacteria. Ifthey get into the bloodstream, they release endotoxin, apoison that in turn dispatches agents called cytokines on asearch and destroy mission aimed at lungs, kidneys, otherorgans and the blood itself. Respiratory and kidney failureoften follow quickly.   Even the most powerful antibiotics have failed to stem thedeath toll, in part because in the case of gram-negativesepsis, the bacteria release endotoxin as they die. Startedtoo late, the antibiotic itself can fuel the chain of events.   Centoxin binds to endotoxin and neutralizes it before itcan do its deadly work. An antibody such as it or Xomen E5represents &quot;the first agent we've ever had that may be ableto stop endotoxin in its tracks,&quot; says Roger Bone, chairmanof medicine at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center inChicago. &quot;The promise is rather profound.&quot;   Among 200 sepsis patients in a clinical trial, 49% ofthose who got a placebo died within 28 days, compared withonly 30% of those who got Centoxin -- a 39% difference. Buttheir infections were all due to gram-negative bacteria.Centoxin has no effect on other agents that provoke sepsisinfection. When all 543 patients in the clinical trial weretaken into account, the death rate was 39% among those on thedrug and 43% on placebo -- statistically, a wash.   Tests can show whether or not someone's infection is dueto gram-negative bacteria, but current tests take two orthree days. &quot;By that time, the patient may be dead or too faralong,&quot; says Dr. Bone. So &quot;the doctor has to give the drug toa lot of patients who don't need it in order to hit one ortwo who might.&quot;   Further confounding the issue is the fact that themajority of septic-infection patients are elderly and alreadydesperately ill from other diseases. An analysis of 100gram-negative sepsis patients at Henry Ford determined that80 would have died within a year of their underlyingdiseases.   Finally, the clinical trial of Centoxin found that it hasessentially no side effects -- no harm that might givedoctors pause before recommending its use. The risk of usingit is almost nil, and the risk of not using it is death. &quot;Theonly downside,&quot; says Henry Ford's Dr. Ward, &quot;is the resourcesused for these patients that we can't use for someone else.&quot;   All these factors, along with the expected high price,threaten to pile up the problems of the health-care system atthe patient's bedside. Should the terminally ill be treatedwith a $3,000 or $4,000 drug even if they're likely to diewithin a few months? Would withholding Centoxin treatmentrisk a malpractice suit? Would money for Centoxin be betterinvested in childhood vaccinations? Or in efforts to preventseptic infections, which often result from surgicalcomplications or other in-hospital sources?   &quot;The question is how do we allocate technology dollars,&quot;says John Popovich, chief of pulmonary and critical care atHenry Ford and head of its biomedical ethics committee.&quot;That's a very important question that belongs in the publicarena. It doesn't belong at the patient's bedside. Asphysicians, we can't let costs deter us if we believe theseagents are in the best interest of our patients.&quot;   Absent broad public policy, doctors and hospitals aretaking varied stances. &quot;To me, it's throwing money away,&quot;says Harry B. Peled, director of critical care at FHPHospital in Fountain Valley, Calif. He intends to useCentoxin only in &quot;extremely limited situations.&quot; At OhioState University Hospitals in Columbus, officials establishedtwo new positions for a pharmacist and a fellow to monitoruse of the drug.   At Henry Ford, a model Dr. Ward developed to evaluate thedrug in terms of cost per life-year saved provoked anemotional meeting among doctors. The cost ranged from under$10,000 to nearly $1 million per life-year, depending onwhich groups of patients were considered. The hospital'sCentoxin policy team is recommending that physicians&quot;strongly consider not using the drug&quot; for patients likely todie anyway within three to six months, Dr. Ward says. Doctorswould fill out a form estimating life expectancy for eachpatient getting the drug. Such a guideline would call intoquestion many treatments given to patients during the lastfew weeks of life.   Henry Ford doctors have also discussed trying to negotiatea reduced price with Centocor, arguing that the drug isn'tcost-effective at the anticipated price. But, Dr. Ward says,&quot;that would force us to define our cutoff more specificallythan we feel comfortable doing.&quot;   Centocor argues that hospitals will have already investedtens of thousands of dollars of intensive-care treatment inmost patients at risk of sliding into septic shock. Thecompany's chairman, Hubert J.P. Schoemaker, says Centoxinrepresents an &quot;incrementally small additional investment&quot;that could increase chances of the patient coming out alive.   Researchers at George Washington University have developeda computerized system that can help physicians predict anintensive-care unit patient's chances of dying. It's a toolthat, if accepted by the medical community, could be used indecisions involving Centoxin.   Other than price, what could change the economics would bea way to tell quickly which patients can benefit from thedrug -- that is, which are infected with gram-negativeorganisms. At least one company has a test under development,but it isn't clear how soon it might reach the market. In themeantime, doctors will have to decide whether to use thecostly drug before they know if it will help.   &quot;People get the idea that Centoxin is a life-saving drug,&quot;says R. Michael Massanari, director of hospital epidemiologyat Henry Ford. &quot;But is it life-saving in terms of longevityand quality of life? No one's attempted to look at thatissue. These are all questions that come into the treatmentdecision. We just don't have the answers to them.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
