A man wearing a topcoat, a business suit and a brown tweed hatjumped into banker John Grundhofer's Mercedes Benz as he arrivedfor work at First Bank System Inc. shortly after 8 a.m., said FBIspokesman Jeff Jamar.   The kidnapper, armed with a handgun and knife, then ordered himto drive out of the city, Jamar said.   Authorities provided only sketchy details about the kidnappingand did not reveal a motive.   They said Grundhofer escaped after about two hours when he wasleft unattended in a wooded area in western Wisconsin. He latercalled for help from a nearby farmhouse.   The kidnapper made a ransom demand, which Grundhofer relayed tothe bank from his car phone, but the banker escaped before stepswere made to pay it, said Minneapolis Police Chief John Laux.   The size of the ransom request was not disclosed. Grundhofer'scar was not immediately recovered.   ``I'm OK,'' Grundhofer told a news conference later. ``I have noidea why this took place this morning. I'm very grateful to thegood Lord for me being here.''   Grundhofer, 51, was vice chairman and senior executive officerfor southern California at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bankbefore hired as chairman at First Bank in January.   The abductor, described as 50 to 60 years old and more than 6feet tall, did not appear to be a professional criminal, Jamarsaid.
