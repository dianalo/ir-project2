 Thankfully, for the most part,we're beyond the branches of low-level connectivity, such as cabling andadapter cards.andP;  Upwards, we see sweeter fruit: interoperability for networkoperating systems, higher-level communications protocols, and evenapplications.andP;  So fill your backpack with food, grab your climbing tools, andget ready for the ascent.andP;  Bring a map; many trails awaits you.andM;Too Many TrailsandM;One of the nearer peaks is reliable end-to-end communications betweenprograms running on dissimilar computers.andP;  It's not that we can't achievethis goal.andP;  We can, with Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP), supported now on nearly evey major system, and with Open Systemsinterconnection (OSI) protocols, which will eventually be supported on everymajor system.andM;We can also achieve communication with IBM's Advanced Program-to-ProgramCommunications, which has been implemented by a variety of LAN vendorsincluding IBM, Novell, 3Com, and Apple.andP;  With Portable NetWare, we're evenstarting to get reliable end-to-end communications between dissimilarmachines using Novell's internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) and SequencedPacket Exchange protocols.andP;  LAN Manager for Unix offers a similar capabilitywith named pipes on top of NetBIOS.andM;The problem is not a lack of reliable end-to-end communicationsinterfaces--the problem is having too many of them.andP;  We can't settle on onebecause different protocols are like knives, forks, and spoons: they're goodfor different things.andP;  For example:andM;* Novell's IPX is the fastest protocol for local-area communication onNetWare LANs, but it's not optimized for wide-area communications.andP;  It's notan option for communications within most LAN Manager networks (through 3+Openclients can use IPX to access NetWare Servers using 3+Open Connection forNetWare.)andM;* NetBIOS, in its various vendor-specific implementations, allows programs torun with all sorts of LAN operating systems, but it's seldom supported onminicomputers or mainframes.andM;* TCP, of TCP/IP fame, is supported in more environments, including LANs,minicomputers and mainframes, than any other transport protocol; however,it's optimized for wide-area rather than local-area communications.andM;* TP4, the OSI transport protocol, may eventually be more widely supportedthan any other transport protocol, but it won't be as efficient as currentimplementations of TCP/IP for some time.andP;  And it may never be as fast asnative protocols within the LAN.andP;  Thus, while Banyan (Westboro, Mass.)andO;intends to eventually substitute TP4 for its own VINES IP, Novell's currentplans position TP4 as an internetworking standard while the speedier IPXremains supreme within each NetWare LAN.andM;Because different protocols have different strenghts and weaknesses, LANusers and programmers will have to cope with multiple protocols for a longtime.andP;  These get in the way, however, because programs using differentprotocol stacks can't talk directly; they need an interpreter, or gateway,which degrades performance.andM;One way out of this dilemma, says Jim Herman, a principal with NortheastConsulting Resources (Boston, Mass.) is for vendors to supportinteroperability standards like TCP/IP and OSI.andP;  That solution, he says, isbetter than &quot;pair-wise sets of bilateral agreements--for example, one to getSuns to interoperate with IBM mainframes, another to get 3Com to interoperatewith Novell, and so on.andP;  In the long run, the advantage of a standard is thatyou don't have a tangle of pair-wise solutions.andP;  It's a more strategicapproach.&quot;andM;Another alternative is to write programs that can use many differenttransport interfaces, as is possible with an Application ProgrammingInterface (API) that provides transparent access to multiple transports.andO;With such an API, though we still use knives, forks, and spoons, all thehandles are the same.andP;  Unfortunately, a universally acceptable handle doesnot yet exist.andM;Herman also points out that a common API would be useful even if protocolswere standardized.andP;  Standard protocols don't guarantee standard APIs, henotes.andP;  While standard protocols reduce the complexity of networks--and thusthe costs of managing, tuning, debugging and supporting them--common APIs canbring that sam simplicity to the programming level and shield applicationsfrom whatever complexity remains.andM;&quot;A standard transport layer interface is needed,&quot; says Stephen Kanzler,product manager for Lan Manager at Microsoft (Redmond, Wash.).andP;  &quot;No industrystandard for a transport layer interface currently exists.&quot;andP;  NetBIOS is theclosest thing we have at present, he adds, but it's limited mostly to PCLANs.andP;  &quot;We may need to expand the NetBIOS interface to make it more capable,or support a yet-to-emerge standard transport layer interface.&quot;andM;One candidate is the Transport Level Interface (TLI).andP;  TLI is a standard partof ATandamp;T Unix and is also supported in DEC's Ultrix and IBM's AIX.andP;  NetWare386 currently supports TLI, and Banyan has promised TLI support for VINES,which runs under ATandamp;T System V.andP;  According to NCR (Dayton, Ohio), it willship Tower NetWare, its implementation of Novell's Portable NetWare, with TLIthis fall after receiving the necessary Portable NetWare updates from Novell.andM;Now, if only Microsoft would join the party, we might have an industrystandard.andP;  However, Microsoft &quot;hasn't made a decision yet on an appropriatetransport layer interface,&quot; says Kanzler.andP;  Even if TLI is not adoptedindustry-wide, every serious networking environment will need something likeit to allow a single program to load multiple protocol stacks, eitherconcurrently or consecutively, and to talk to programs elsewhere on thenetwork.andM;Protocol PeaksandM;Reliable end-to-end communications are nice, but they're a lot nicer if eachend is saying something the other end understands.andP;  Thus, a peak just beyondreliable end-to-end communications is getting network servers to understandone another's service protocols, the language LAN clients use to get whatthey want from servers.andM;Novell's NetWare for Macintosh, released in early 1989, was one of the firstproducts to use service protocols for interoperability.andP;  It uses a gatewaythat translates between the AppleTalk Filing Protocol and the NetWare CoreProtocol.andP;  As a result, Macintoshes can access the NetWare file server, whichtreats them like DOS clients.andM;More recently, Banyan implemented the Server Message Block (SMB) serviceprotocol, used by MS-Net and LAN Manager servers, in its VINES clientsoftware.andP;  VINES clients now look like MS-NET or LAN Manager clients to thesefile servers.andM;Farther up the trail, Novell will implement an SMB service for NetWare 386.andO;NetWare 386 will also get NetWork File System, a standard service protocol onTCP/IP networks (especially in Unix environments) allowing different systemsto read each other's files.andM;The final peak in the service protocol range?andP;  &quot;Seamless access from withinstandard client software and operating systems to all enterprise computingresources,&quot; says David Thacher, Microsoft senior product manager for LANManager.andP;  In other words, any two machines would be able to find a commonservice protocol, so everybody can use everybody else's services.andP;  We'restill a long way from this utopian height, but the technology to reach it iswell understood, and the trend is in that direction.andM;Just One of the GUIsandM;Service protocols are nitty-gritty stuff.andP;  In general, users don't know aboutthem and don't care.andP;  What they do know about is the user interface.andP;  Usersmay become very attached to sophisticated graphical user interfaces (GUI)such as the Macintosh GUI, Microsoft Windows, Presentation Manager, orX-Window-based GUIs such as Motif.andM;The ability to work on other systems without sacrificing the familiar userinterface is important.andP;  It's not just an aesthetic question, either; a GUI'sconsistency makes working with unfamiliar applications much easier.andM;In most PC LAN environments, nothing stops developers from writingapplications that can clothe themselves in the native GUI of a number ofdifferent terminals or workstations.andP;  The dominant LAN operating systemsdon't offer much to encourage developers to try this difficult stunt,however.andP;  Yet the most common paradigm for client-server computing allowscore application processing on a specialized server while client machineshandle the GUI--a design that allows applications to move to larger orsmaller servers as necessary without having to retrain users.andM;The X-Window System illustrates how operating systems could give strongersupport to programmers who want to split the GUI from the application andpotentially connect the two across a network.andP;  Under X Window, an applicationrunning on one machine sends packets in X-Window format to another machinethat handles the display functions.andP;  The X-Window interface shields theapplication from the network; the programmer doesn't even have to knowwhether the two halves of the application are running on the same machine.andM;The X-Window standard leaves a lot of freedom for the workstation to displaydata with its own widgets, or predesigned window elements such as dialogueboxes, list boxes, and input buttons.andP;  Thus, a program performing the samefunction on two different workstations could look quite different whileremaining within the X-Window standard.andP;  The power of this approach isillustrated by the Common-X Interface (CXI), developed by Microsoft andHewlett-Packard.andP;  CXI provides the look and feel of Presentation Manager inan X-Window environment.andM;In most X Window environments, the application host runs Unix of one varietyor another.andP;  However, DEC has implemented strong support for X Windows underVAX/VMS, as well as under Ultrix and DOS.andM;On the user-workstation side, the dominant machines are X-Window terminalsand Unix workstations.andP;  However, DOS-based X Windows is available fromvendors such as Graphic Software Systems (Beaverton, Ore.) with PC-Xview;Locus Computing, (Inglewood, Calif.) with PC X Sight; and Interactive Systems(Santa Monica, Calif.) with its 386ix X11 Windowing System.andP;  Public domainsoftware supplied by the X Consortium runs on the Macintosh II, the IBM RT,and the IBM RISC System 6000, as well as on Unix systems from Apollo, DEC,HP, and Sun.andP;  PC-Xview runs in PC LAN environments such as NetWare and LANManager, according to Russ Sprunger, sales director of Graphic SoftwareSystems.andP;  Later this year, Quarterdeck Office Systems (Santa Monica, Calif.)andO;will release DESQview/X, which will bring X Window to DOS in the multitaskingDESQview environment.andP;  X Windows for OS/2 workstations is probably just amatter of time, say Herman and Sprunger.andM;DOS users tend to see X Window as a way of running Unix or VMS applicationsin a windowing environment without sacrificing DOS.andP;  But X Window, orsomething like it, could play an expanded role, providing a general mechanismto allow applications to run under various workstation and network operatingsystem without worrying about the underlying network technology.andP;  Withoutsuch a standard, many programmers, like most users, may remain squinting upat the pinnacles of SQL and client-server programming with no clear trail insight.andM;What's in a Name?andM;In most LAN environments, another major stumbling point in the struggletowards interoperability is the lack of a global, distributed naming anddirectory service that would help users find services in geographicallydispersed networks.andP;  Such a service would also allow users to find oneanother for communications, such as electronic mail.andM;Banyan has led the way in this arena with its StreetTalk naming and directoryservice for VINES.andP;  StreetTalk is a global service, as it automaticallypropagates information needed to find items (such as users, services, andservers) to every server in the network.andP;  StreetTalk is alsodistributed--naming and directory information can be divided up among severalservers.andM;In VINES, a user who needs access to an item requests it via its StreetTalkname, which includes an item name, a group name, and an organization name(John Smith@accounting@corporate).andP;  If an item moves from one server toanother, only the server that manages that item has to be updated manually.andO;Other servers either consult that server or maintain their own directoryinformation, which is automatically updated.andM;If John Smith moves from Chicago to Los Angeles, for instance, but remains amember of the corporate accounting staff, he can still be managed by theserver in Chicago.andP;  The Chicago server will know that John is physically inLos Angeles.andP;  Other than registering the change at the server in Chicago, nomore work is necessary to allow users or applications to find him.andM;In early versions of VINES, only information about the location of groupscould be replicated.andP;  Every server knew which server managed each group, butservers did not know the locations of items outside their own groups.andP;  Thislimited information led to some inefficient and expensive exchanges.andP;  Forinstance, the server in Los Angeles would have to call the server in Chicagojust to find out that John Smith was in Los Angeles.andP;  With v4.0 of VINES,Banyan introduced StreetTalk Directory Assistance, which allows replicationof all StreetTalk information or any portion of it, enabling a server to findany StreetTalk item without consulting another server.andM;In contrast to VINES, NetWare has never had a global naming service.andO;Instead, each NetWare server manages its own users and services.andP;  Informationnecessary for finding servers is propagated throughout a single internetwork.andO;For networks not currently connected, however, NetWare provides no way ofaccessing or maintaining directory or naming information.andM;Thus, if John Smith is in Los Angeles, his user ID will be registered at aserver in Los Angeles.andP;  But NetWare provides no service that would allowanother server, even on the internetwork in the Los Angeles office, todetermine where John Smith is registered.andP;  Servers in Chicago, unless bridgedto the Los Angeles internetwork (a feasible, though costly, option), don'teven know John Smith's server exists, much less that his user ID isregistered there.andM;Without naming and directory services, users get the data through variousforms of static information.andP;  For instance, under NetWare, an administratorwho knows which users and services reside on each server can build batchfiles.andP;  A batch file might log into a particular server and allow access to adatabase there.andM;However, if the database is moved to a different server, the batch file mustbe changed.andP;  When a service such as a database moves from one server toanother on a NetWare LAN, instead of updating information at a single server,hundreds of batch files all over the network may have to be changed.andM;Applications can implement their own global naming schemes.andP;  They may have aparticular need to do so in environments like NetWare that lack globalnaming, but applications may also create their own naming schemes forportability across multiple environments.andP;  For instance, Novell's MessageHandling Service has a naming scheme that allows users to address mail to auser consistently, no matter where the user resides physically on thenetwork.andP;  Information about where the user resides has to be updated only inone place.andM;However, the value of a naming and directory service is directly proportionalto the number of items (users, services, servers) it lets you access; thedisadvantage of having multiple naming schemes for multiple applications isthat each scheme only gives you access to a limited number of items.andP;  Thefewer naming and directory services, the better.andM;Novell has announced the NetWare Name Service for NetWare v2.15 and NetWare386, scheduled for release in mid-1990.andP;  Version 1.0 of the Name Servicerepresents a cautious first step toward a global distributed-naming anddirectory service.andP;  NetWare Name Service is not a directory service, however,as it provides no lookup function.andP;  Neither is it global--first, because itapplies only to servers and users not to services such as electronic mail,databases, or communications links; and second, because servers share naminginformation only within a domain, or group of servers, not across the entirenetwork.andP;  (The entire network can be defined as a single domain if it has 400or fewer servers.)andP;  Nor does the Name Service have anything to do withdirectory-access rights, which still must be administered on aserver-by-server basis.andM;NetWare Name Service allows users to log into a domain rather than to anindividual server; it allows administrators to create, delete, and modifygroups for a domain rather than server by server; and it allowsadministrators to maintain login scripts for groups of servers rather than byindividual servers.andP;  For example, if a user needs access to six servers on aNetWare network without the Name Service, the administrator must define theuser on all six servers.andP;  If an individual login script is required, theadministrator may have to create six separate individual login scripts--onefor each server--even though all six scripts may accomplish exactly the samething.andP;  The alternative is to make sure the user always logs into the sameserver before attaching to the others.andM;A system login script, which contains login commands common to all serverusers, may help simplify or even eliminate individual login scripts.andP;  Theuser on a pre-Name-Service network must log in to one of the servers,triggering execution of a system login script specific to that server and anindividual login script specific to that user ID on that server.andM;Thus, if 10 users access six servers, the administrator may have to maintainup to 66 login scripts.andP;  With NetWare Name Service, the six servers can begrouped into a domain.andP;  All servers within a domain have access to the samenaming information, so the user can log in from any point within the domain,at which time a domain login script executes.andM;Servers and users can be further linked by profiles.andP;  Each profile includes alist of up to eight servers, a list of users who can use those servers, and aprofile login script.andP;  When a user logs in using a profile, that profilelogin script executes.andP;  If it's sufficient for all users of that profile, noindividual login scripts are required, but system and individual loginscripts are still supported.andM;LAN Manager OEMs, such as 3Com, have implemented global naming and directoryservices for existing versions of LAN Manager.andP;  In addition, Microsoft hasannounced a naming service for LAN Manager 2.0 for release later thisyear--another small step toward a complete global, distributed naming anddirectory service.andM;Like NetWare Name Service, the first version of the Microsoft service willoperate only within a domain or group of servers, not globally across anetwork.andP;  A limited directory service allows users to list users or groups,the two types of objects currently recognized in Microsoft's domains.andP;  Theadvantages of Microsoft domains are similar to those of the NetWare NameService.andP;  Users can be defined across an entire domain, rather than server byserver, and all servers in the domain have the same naming information.andM;Over the coming months and years, fledgling naming and directory serviceswill improve.andP;  More important, they will link up with each other through theOSI X.500 international directory services standard, forming a global namingand directory service.andP;  X.500 will not replace proprietary directories, butwill provide a common language that will extend the user's reach to otherdirectories.andM;For instance, all LAN operating systems will eventually offer directoryservices so users can query the name database (as in, &quot;Show me all users with'Jones' as part of their name.&quot;)  Through X.500, users will be able to querydatabases on dissimilar LANs, minicomputers, and mainframes in the same way.andO;Proprietary systems will add more objects and more ways of describing them.andO;For example, directories will contain not only users, groups, and servers,but applications, printers, and communications links.andP;  The directory willlist location, phone number, communications parameters, hours ofavailability, and so on, as appropriate to each type of object.andP;  ThroughX.500, such information will be available across dissimilar LANs and frommainframes and minicomputers.andP;  X.500 systems will also be able to provide thenetwork address of any named object, and routing instructions for sendingmessages to that object.andM;Standard transport protocols and APIs, support for multiple service protocolsin clients or servers, transparent support for various GUIs--all easeinteroperating with users, files, e-mail, disks, printers, applications, anddatabase and communications servers on various dissimilar systems.andP;  X.500adds a critical element: the ability to find those resources, wherever theyreside on the network.andP;  It places signposts along the trails that lead towardhigher levels of interoperability.andM;Michael Hurwicz is a consultant and freelance write specializing in networks.andO;He is based in Eastsound, Wash.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
