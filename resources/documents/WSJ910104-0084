That was before environmental absolutistswere in a position to stop popular exploitation of thebluffs. Hyatt Corp. was not as fortunate.   It has spent more than 11 years trying to get approval tobuild a 400-room hotel on a onetime oil field four miles upthe coast from UCSB. A group called Citizens of Goleta Valleywas determined that, nothwithstanding a gamut of officialapprovals, the project not be allowed. But now, with a rulingon New Year's Eve by the reconstituted California SupremeCourt, Hyatt should be able to proceed.</LP><TEXT>   These days, gaining approval from the layers of plannersfor a major development in areas such as Santa Barbara is nomean feat. Hyatt long ago accomplished that in a process thatincluded 1,000 pages of environmental analysis and publicconsideration of alternative sites for the hotel. But thelocal activists persuaded lower courts to require more studyof locations that Hyatt didn't own and that weren't evenzoned for such visitor use. Clearly, the intent was not tohave the lodging shifted but to have it stopped.   In one of their first significant property-rights casessince the removal of Rose Bird and her allies from the highcourt, the California justices said this was ridiculous. &quot;Wecaution that rules regulating the protection of theenvironment must not be subverted into an instrument for theoppression and delay of social, economic or recreationaldevelopment and advancement,&quot; the court ruled.   This is heady stuff, and could signal a return to economicrights by the California court. The same philosophical trailleads to a stance against unlawful &quot;takings,&quot; an issue theU.S. Supreme Court has made a muddle of, but which may be themost promising means of protecting property owners.   The California justices in another recent case upheldtheir prerogative to apply constitutional protections on&quot;independent state grounds.&quot; Doing so in the &quot;takings&quot; areawould put them at the vanguard of jurisprudence, where thestate's court historically likes to be. This week's decisionalready reinforces the judicial legacy of outgoing GovernorGeorge Deukmejian, something to consider now that hissuccessor, Pete Wilson, has appointed a former official ofthe Sierra Club to be his resources secretary.   And it will even give some fathers and mothers of UCSBstudents a place to stay when conducting those periodic,anxious visitations.</TEXT></DOC>
