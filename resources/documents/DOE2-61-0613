For tissue characterisation and determination of theextent of the disease, combined use of T/sub 2/-weighted multiecho sequencesand plain and contrast examinations with T/sub 1/-weightened spin-echosequences are superior to CT. CT must be used, however, to demonstratebone changes. Endocranial tumour extension can be demonstrated more preciselywith magnetic resonance than with CT.</TEXT></DOC>
