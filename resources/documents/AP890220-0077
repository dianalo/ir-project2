The Fed's credit tightening efforts have been blamed for sendinga variety of interest rates, including mortgage rates and banks'prime lending rate, higher.   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and other Fed officialsargue that the central bank has no choice but to move to dampendemand in an effort to keep the aging recovery from over-heating.   However, critics, including the new president, contend that theFed is overreacting to inflationary fears. Some analysts believe ifthe central bank does not soon relent, it will topple the countryinto an economic downturn.   Greenspan will get a chance to respond to the critics Tuesdaywhen he presents his semi-annual report to Congress on monetarypolicy.   The testimony, before the Senate Banking Committee, will comejust one week after the Fed embarked on another round ofcredit-tightening following a government report that showedinflation at the wholesale level took an unexpectedly sharp jump inJanuary, rising at an annual rate of 12.7 percent.   The Fed responded by pushing short-term interest rates higherthrough a behind-the-scenes process that siphons off available bankreserves. With the supply of money lower, the cost of that money _interest rates _ increases.   Banks on Feb. 10 hiked their prime lending rate, the benchmarkrate for many business and consumer loans, to 11 percent, thehighest the prime rate has been since the end of 1984. Mortgagerates have been climbing as well, with fixed-rate mortgages nowaveraging above 10.5 percent.   The latest round of credit tightening comes at a sensitive timefor the new Bush administration. Higher interest rates boost thecost to the government of bailing out insolvent savings and loanassociations, a cost already put at $126 billion over the nextdecade.   The higher rates will also undermine the new president's pledgeto lower the budget deficit without raising taxes because higherrates raise the cost of government borrowing to finance the debt.   The Fed launched its credit tightening last spring and has beenpushing rates higher, off and on, since that time.   Richard Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,said that the early credit tightening was appropriate, but thecentral bank now has gone too far and is running a high risk ofharming the economy.   ``Federal Reserve policy at the moment is misguided,'' he said.``If they keep it up, they could push us into a recession and thatwill make us worse off and end up increasing the federal budgetdeficit substantially.''   However, other economists say the Fed really has no choice but tokeep tightening in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures, evenat the risk of a downturn in the economy.   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with the New York brokerage firm ofMerrill Lynch, said he expected the Fed would keep pushing interestrates higher until summer.   Steinberg said the economy would probably topple into a mildrecession in the second half of this year, caused in part by the Fedtightening moves. He based this prediction in part on a belief thatmany consumers will cut back on spending as they are forced to makehigher payments on adjustable rate home mortgages.   Bush said last week he did not believe inflation was a sufficientproblem at present to warrant higher interest rates, but thepresident tried to play down suggestions of a rift with Greenspan.   ``Maybe we'll get into a fight down the road, but I don't thinkit's at hand, and I don't think Greenspan and I are far apart,''Bush told reporters.   Steinberg said that Greenspan would probably be doing theadministration a favor by sending the country into a brief recessionearly in Bush's first term.   ``If you postpone the day of reckoning, it will still come and itwill be a lot harsher,'' he said. ``If inflation rises significantly... then interest rates would have to go much higher and thenegative effects would be that much greater.''   That is what occurred in the last downturn in 1981-82 whenthen-Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker pushed the prime rate upto a high of 21.5 percent and sent the country into its worserecession since the Great Depression as the Fed struggled to containthe country's steepest inflation since the Civil War.   In addition to revealing the Fed's money growth targets for 1989,Greenspan will also reveal the central bank's economic outlook forthe current year during his congressional testimony. That outlook isexpected to differ markedly from the Bush forecast.   The administration hopes to reduce the budget deficit to $91.1billion for fiscal 1990, down from an expected $163.3 billiondeficit in the current fiscal year.   But those hopes are based on the assumption that the economy willgrow at a rapid 3.2 percent annual rate through 1990.   While that would be down from the 3.8 percent increase in thegross national product for 1988, the best in four years, it would bestill be well above growth levels that Greenspan and other Fedofficials have indicated are sustainable.   The Fed has argued that much slower growth is needed so thatincreases in demand can be accommodated by an economy already facingtight labor markets and high factory operating rates.</TEXT></DOC>
