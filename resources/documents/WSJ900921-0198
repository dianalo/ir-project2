The sale helped double Minorco's year-end cash andshort-term investment holdings to $1.76 billion from $871million and sent income on financial operations up 42% to$236 million from $166 million.   Minorco also said Chester Crocker, former U.S. assistantsecretary of state for African affairs, has joined its board.   Profit after taxes and minority interests fell 18% to $229million from $280 million, hurt by a sharp fall inundistributed earnings on investments to $12.9 million from$124 million a year earlier, when the holding in Gold Fieldswas included. Earnings per share fell 18% to $1.35 from$1.64.   Net profit attributable to shareholders, however, nearlytripled to $784 million from $280 million, boosted by a $555million extraordinary gain, representing profit on the GoldFields stake minus restructuring costs at its Engelhard Corp.affiliate and a write-down of its interest in Western GoldExploration andamp; Mining Co. A year earlier, Minorco had a$100,000 extraordinary gain.   Sales were boosted by Minorco's higher income fromfinancial operations as well as the inclusion of $28.9million in sales from Independence Mining Co., a U.S. goldmining group that Minorco bought for $705 million in March.</TEXT></DOC>
