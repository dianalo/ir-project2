Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> DES MOINES, Iowa  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, running with dogged determination against South Korean automobiles, is showing pace here in Iowa.    &quot;I think now we're going to do very well,&quot; says William Carrick, Mr. Gephardt's campaign manager. &quot;But I can tell you it took a lot of self-discipline.&quot;    A month ago, Mr. Gephardt had sunk so low in the public-opinion polls that people had begun to write him off. Some of his most ardent supporters, including top campaign contributors, were urging him to change his tactics and particularly to abandon his tough talk on trade. &quot;December,&quot; says Richard Moe, one of Mr. Gephardt's senior advisers who didn't advocate such a change, &quot;was a bad month. Everybody was writing us off. I was blue. Most of us were discouraged. But Dick was never shaken.&quot;    Mr. Gephardt says he was never worried back in those dark December days because he didn't believe the polls were very accurate. But yesterday afternoon, cheers swept through his Des Moines headquarters as the latest results of the University of Iowa poll were shouted above the din.    Among voters likely to go to the Iowa Democratic caucuses on Feb. 8, the poll shows 31% now favor Mr. Gephardt, up a surprising seven points since the last Iowa survey only four days earlier. In second place is Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts at 20%, followed by Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois at 16%.    An extraordinarily self-possessed man, Rep. Gephardt now does concede it feels better to be ahead.    His is a simple message and a simple strategy designed to tap populist sentiment.    Mr. Gephardt argues that Americans are beginning to sense that their economy is in decline and that their destiny is in the hands of someone else, be it big corporate interests at home or foreign powers. He argues it's time someone did something about it.    The message is targeted at blue-collar workers, farmers in trouble and older people worried about Social Security. His campaign managers figure there are enough of these Iowans to vote for him in sufficient numbers so he can execute his &quot;early breakout&quot; strategy. He has always wanted to win here, to break out of the pack early and roll on to the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 16 and the 20-state Super Tuesday contests on March 8.    Mr. Gephardt's luck began to change with his TV campaign. The paid ads went on the air quietly Dec. 26. &quot;We didn't tell hardly anyone in the campaign we were going on the air the day after Christmas,&quot; says Robert Shrum, the campaign's TV producer. &quot;We wanted it to be a surprise, and we kind of hoped we would have it all to ourselves.&quot; For a week, the Gephardt ads were on the air without any competition from any of the other candidates. And the snowstorm helped; it kept Iowans at home. &quot;The ads made a real difference in this race,&quot; says Mr. Shrum.    The Iowa poll indicates just how powerful Mr. Gephardt's TV message has been. Before the TV ads, 15% of the voters in the sample said they thought Mr. Gephardt was a &quot;strong leader.&quot; In the latest poll, 47% considered him a strong leader. &quot;That's a huge surge,&quot; says Arthur Miller, an Iowa political scientist. &quot;Gephardt is coming across on TV as a competent leader willing to stand up for America in a patriotic way. It's working. The result is people are leaving Simon for Gephardt.&quot;    One ad, lasting 30 seconds, proved especially successful.    In it, Mr. Gephardt says Americans work hard every day &quot;to turn out a good product at a decent price. Then the Korean government slaps on nine separate taxes and tariffs. And when that government's done, a $10,000 Chrysler K car costs $48,000 in Korea.&quot;    Mr. Gephardt's solution: a trade bill that he says would force this country's trading partners to open their doors to American products the same way the U.S. opens its doors to theirs. He says his proposal, the Gephardt amendment, calls on the president to negotiate for six months with countries behaving the way Korea is. If, in the South Korean example, its government doesn't back down in that time, the president could begin to impose penalties on Korean exports to the U.S. &quot;How many Americans are going to pay $48,000 for one of their Hyundais?&quot; he asks.    He poses the same question on the stump. Bearded young auto workers and leathery old farmers respond with rousing cheers.    It's a controversial plan, endorsed by the AFL-CIO, opposed by many Democrats as an invitation to a global trade war, a violation of international law and spur to inflation.    His farm proposal -- calling for mandatory controls for agricultural production if a majority of the farmers approve -- is also controversial. Mr. Gephardt concedes it would drive up food prices for the consumer but says it's the only way to save the small family farm.    Like his trade policy, it sells well to many voters in Iowa, which has gone through a long farm crisis (Mr. Gephardt regularly attacks this newspaper for writing that the worst of the farm crisis is over).    His final pitch is pensioners. He says he would remove social security from the budget process, where it can be mutilated, and place it for safe keeping in the hands of an independent agency. His secret weapon with the older voters is 87-year-old Claude Pepper, one of more than 70 House members who have endorsed Mr. Gephardt's candidacy.    The message is clear and simple -- critics would call it simplistic -- and the candidate is dogged and extraordinarily energetic in pounding it home day after day, month after month. Rep. Gephardt isn't eloquent, he isn't always clever, but he is always tenacious.    Another break for Mr. Gephardt came when former Sen. Gary Hart, driven out of the race earlier by reports of his marital infidelity, jumped back in. &quot;Hart had a disastrous effect on (Sen. Paul) Simon.&quot; says Mr. Carrick. &quot;We had 10 days of Hart-mania, all the cards were thrown in the air, and they landed in different places. The Iowa campaign changed in important and mysterious ways, and Paul Simon was the loser.&quot;    Mr. Hart surged and then he began to collapse. Sen. Simon, so far, has been unable to regain the momentum he lost to Mr. Hart.    Some other politicians contend that Mr. Gephardt's strategy is very short-run and that he'll be seen as someone who panders to special interests and flip-flops on issues. Mr. Gephardt concedes he has changed his position on some issues, ranging from abortion to economics: &quot;All of us in public life have to be willing to look at policies as we go along and to re-examine them.&quot;    With 10 days to go, most analysts think the Iowa Democratic race remains up for grabs. But the Gephardt camp believes it's in increasingly better shape, feeling that their previous main rival, Sen. Simon, is slipping and that they're moving ahead of their closest competitor, Gov. Dukakis.    And when a candidate is hot, it's reflected in the video images. Mr. Gephardt, who turns 47 years old on Sunday, arrived here yesterday for the home-stretch drive as the self-professed anti-establishment candidate -- accompanied by 42 of his colleagues from the House of Representatives. They posed together on the steps on the state capitol in what is surely the season's most impressive photo opportunity to date. </TEXT></DOC>
