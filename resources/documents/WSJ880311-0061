The negotiated agreements, resolving two lengthy and complex investigations, underscore the government's current strategy of seeking cash settlements from military contractors rather than pursuing time-consuming criminal prosecutions.    Both cases began as criminal fraud investigations, after Pentagon auditors concluded that the companies improperly charged the Army for certain labor costs going back to the early 1980s. In addition, Pentagon officials alleged that Textron's Bell Helicopter division billed the government twice for certain helicopter parts.    Defense Department officials said the government today will announce terms of the civil settlement with Providence, R.I.-based Textron, under which the company doesn't acknowledge any impropriety and won't be subject to criminal charges.    The alleged mischarges by Textron stem from a complicated accounting system by which the company kept track of hundreds of parts for Army helicopters.    Pentagon officials said other contractors have used similar inventory-accounting systems, but the Defense Department has been pressing companies to switch to simpler, more precise methods.    Government officials said that in addition to the $69 million payment, Textron agreed to provide the Army with certain parts currently held in inventory, and to forgo some payments withheld by the Pentagon during the course of the investigation. Overall, Defense Department officials value the settlement, first disclosed in the Washington Post, at about $90 million.    In Fort Worth, Texas, a spokesman for Bell Helicopter said the $90 million figure &quot;is really high, but I can't get into any more than that until we get a settlement.&quot; He added that the settlement &quot;won't have any material effect on Bell in 1988.&quot;    Details of the tentative settlement agreement with Motorola won't be announced until next week at the earliest, but officials familiar with the matter said the company has agreed to plead guilty to some criminal overcharges.    In Schaumburg, Ill., a spokesman said the company will pay fines, penalties and restitution to the government as part of a plea agreement to settle the previously reported grand jury inquiry. He declined to comment on the size of the settlement.    According to a Pentagon official familiar with the case, Motorola is accused of shifting labor charges from fixed-price contracts, where the government won't pay contractors above certain cost ceilings, to so-called cost-plus contracts, which require the U.S. to reimburse contractors for nearly all costs incurred. In addition, the Pentagon officials asserted that Motorola overstated its labor costs when it negotiated certain Army contracts.    A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. But when the company disclosed last July that it was under criminal investigation, it said it expected to be indicted or to plead guilty to submitting improper bills to the government.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing the same month, Motorola said it already had &quot;voluntarily made some refunds and contract adjustments.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
