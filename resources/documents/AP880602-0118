Gorbachev badefarewell at the Kremlin today, concluding a summit long on goodwill but short of achievement. Gorbachev said they had movedsuperpower relations ``from a dangerous track to a safer one'' andReagan expressed hope for ``an era of peace.''   Ending the first visit to the Soviet Union by an Americanpresident in 14 years, Reagan said he had been moved by thereception he got in Moscow. Gorbachev took the occasion to prodReagan to move faster on the issues facing the two superpowers.   The talks completed the most frequent superpower summits inhistory, four in just 30 months, underscoring the dramaticturnaround in U.S.-Soviet relations since the first meeting in1985. Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon each had three summitswith their Soviet counterparts.   Air Force One took off from Vnukovo Airport in a light drizzleat approximately 11:15 a.m. local time. Reagan arrived at London'sHeathrow Airport just after 11:30 a.m. local time. The presidenthad meetings scheduled there with British Prime Minister MargaretThatcher. Gorbachev faces, by month's end, the convening of thefirst Communist Party Conference since 1941.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who flew separately toBrussels, Belgium, to brief America's NATO allies, called the talks``a good, realistic, businesslike summit meeting.'' And DefenseSecretary Frank Carlucci flew to Tokyo. An unnamed Japanese DefenseMinistry official quoted Carlucci as saying the United States hadasked the Soviets to urge North Korea to exercise restraint duringthe upcoming summer Olympic Games in Seoul.   The meetings here produced renewed vows by leaders to improveEast-West relations and put into force the first-ever treaty toeliminate nuclear weapons. But tensions over regional conflictslingered, and Reagan and Gorbachev did not advance prospects for along-range missile treaty in any substantive fashion.   The Reagans said goodbye to the Gorbachevs in the same Kremlinhall where America's first couple was greeted on Sunday. Walkingalong the same red carpet in the Hall of St. George after briefremarks, the four chatted amiably and then parted company a momentlater.   Raisa Gorbachev presented Nancy Reagan a bouquet of roses inwhat perhaps will the last encounter for two first ladies whoserelationship never was warm.   ``This is an emotional moment for Mrs. Reagan and me,'' thepresident said, telling the Gorbachevs he had seen and learned muchabout ``this Moscow spring.''   Reagan said he was impressed with the Soviet people heencountered.   ``At first they were curious faces, but as time went on, thesmiles began and then the waves,'' he said, ``And I don't have totell, you, Nancy and I smiled back and waved just as hard.''   Gorbachev thanked Reagan for ``cooperation, openness and abusinesslike approach to the talks that we have had here.''   But the Communist Party general secretary also said there weremissed opportunities at the Moscow summit.   ``Our dialogue has not been easy,'' Gorbachev said, ``but wemustered enough realism and political will to overcome obstaclesand divert the train of U.S.-Soviet relations from a dangeroustrack to a safer one. It is, however, so far, been moving much moreslowly than is required... .''   . ...''   As Reagan traveled to Great Britain, White House chief of staffHoward Baker told reporters aboard Air Force One that Gorbachev hadchallenged the president at their windup summit meeting over thewording of the final communique.   Baker said the two leaders were ``going at it pretty heavy untilthe end.'' Among other things, the U.S. side disagreed with somelanguage in the communique that was used in the context of abroader embrace by both countries of the concept of ``peacefulcoexistence.''   Baker said he had hoped the two sides could have gone further onarms control, but said, ``We came out just about where it waspredicted we could come out. It would have been nice if we couldhave gone any further, but nobody expected us to go any further.''   In an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' Shultzsaid, ``We had lots of things that were worked out, and we've hadsome very realistic, strong discussion, where we didn't agree, andthat's in the nature of this case. ... I think it's a sign ofmaturity and perhaps greater stability, that we can wrangle onthese things and agree on other things.''   Their work done, on their final night in Moscow, the Reaganswent to the Bolshoi Ballet with the Gorbachevs and dined privatelywith their hosts at a dacha in the countryside outside Moscow.Then, the Reagans took an impromptu stroll through Red Square,which was brightly illuminated by mobile floodlights brought in bynetworks to provide a backdrop for their evening newscasts.   ``I didn't want her to miss it,'' Reagan said, holding handswith Nancy.   Reagan and Gorbachev actually concluded their formal talksWednesday _ reporting scant progress on arms control and none onhuman rights disputes.   After five days in Moscow, Reagan will have tea with QueenElizabeth II at Buckingham Palace and dine with Mrs. Thatcher atNo. 10 Downing Street. On Friday, Reagan will deliver a post-summitspeech summing up East-West relations, then return to Washington.   On his arrival at Heathrow Airport, Reagan was greeted byForeign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe and a light drizzle fromovercast skies. After shaking hands and waving to a small crowdunder the watchful eyes of police guards armed with submachineguns, the Reagans boarded a helicopter and flew to the WinfieldHouse residence of U.S. ambassador Charles H. Price II in Regent'sPark.   Despite the lack of major agreements, Gorbachev called theirmeetings a ``blow to the foundations of the Cold War.'' Reagan wentto extraordinary lengths to praise the Soviet leader, seeminglyabsolving the Kremlin leadership for erecting barriers toemigration. He blamed the emigration walls on the Sovietbureaucracy, saying any government has that kind of problem.   Arriving today at Winfield House in London, the 35-room mansionwhere he will stay, Reagan was asked what he meant in Moscow whenhe seemed to blame the bureaucracy for restricting emigration.   ``I don't think I made it that definite, but that is some of theproblems there, just as there are in our country,'' he replied. ``Iwas answering a question, a specific question, that is not to saythat it was not all just a bureaucracy.''   Asked whether Gorbachev, himself, might be responsible for therepressive laws, Reagan responded, ``I was trying to put out thatsometimes cases of that kind do not get that far up the ladder.''   While the two leaders deepened their relationship, thelong-rumored feud between their wives flared into the open.   Mrs. Reagan and Mrs. Gorbachev dropped all pretense of thehand-holding relationship that had been portrayed earlier in theweek and competed for the spotlight in a duel that Mrs. Reagan saidended in ``a Mexican standoff.''</TEXT></DOC>
