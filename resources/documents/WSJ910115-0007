At the same time, companies found a tighter, moredifficult market for insurance policies that protect againstliability in such litigation. As a result, corporateofficials are becoming increasingly exposed to personalliability in cases that allege poor performance ornegligence.</LP><TEXT>   In the banking and thrift industry especially, manydirectors and officers are finding so-called Dandamp;O insurancepolicies unavailable, too limited or prohibitively expensive,according to a survey by Wyatt Co., a Chicago-basedconsulting firm. Wyatt sampled returns from 1,442 surveyparticipants, mostly publicly traded companies. The surveyedcompanies had median assets of $400 million to $600 million.   &quot;All industries are having much more difficulty obtainingadequate director and officer liability insurance for areasonable premium,&quot; says Kenneth S. Wollner, a riskmanagement consultant at Wyatt. &quot;That trend is certainly ledby banks, but it's a trend that's prevalent regardless ofwhat kind of company you have.&quot;   Directors or officers at 26% of the companies surveyedsaid they were sued last year, up from 22% in 1989. Thecompanies hardest hit are those with assets over $1 billion,according to the survey. Companies under that size have seenthe frequency of lawsuits against directors and officersdiminish, while larger companies have seen the rate grow &quot;ata compound annual rate of 10% and 20% a year&quot; since 1980.   Stockholders were most likely to sue last year, accountingfor 51% of 852 claims analyzed by Wyatt. But the mostfrequent claim in suits against directors and officers waswrongful termination, which occurred in 12% of the cases.Overall, employee claims generally were responsible for 23%of claims, the second-largest category of suits, the surveyfound.   About 40% of banks surveyed reported one or more suitsagainst their officers and directors in 1990. That figurereflects the worsening economic and legal climate for failedsavings and loan associations and the weakening bankingindustry.   Prior studies have noted that problems in obtaining suchinsurance have made it harder to attract officers anddirectors, said Mr. Wollner. Based on the most recent surveyresults, that trend is likely to intensify, he added.   ---   CITICORP TIGHTENS the reins on its major law firms.   As part of his effort to centralize control of Citicorp'slegal work, Executive Vice President John J. Roche hosted anunusual meeting for about 10 large law firms that representthe bank. The meeting brought together in one roomrepresentatives from Shearman andamp; Sterling, the bank'straditional outside counsel, and from other law firms that inrecent years have competed for pieces of the bank's business.   Theodore Bajo, a vice president of the bank, said the goalwas to organize the bank's relationship with its outsidelegal vendors and to improve efficiency. &quot;We're trying tomanage better the relationship between the inside and outsideand how we ultimately deliver legal services to theinstitution,&quot; he said. Mr. Roche could not be reached forcomment.   Among the topics discussed, according to lawyers whoattended, were how cases are being staffed, how frequentlythe firms were sending Citicorp their bills and whetherstrategies could be developed earlier in potential legalmatters.   The law firms that were represented included Weil, Gotshalandamp; Manges and Milbank, Tweed, Hadley andamp; McCloy from New York;Latham andamp; Watkins, based in Los Angeles; and Kirkland andamp; Ellisand Sidley andamp; Austin of Chicago.   Some participants came away with the message thatCiticorp's lawyers would not be immune from the bank'sinstitution-wide cost-cutting efforts. The point of thetalks, said Robert H. McKinnon, a partner at Shearman andamp;Sterling, was &quot;improving relationships to contain costs.&quot;   ---   JOURNALISTIC PRACTICES are scrutinized closely by U.S.Supreme Court.   The justices heard arguments on whether and under whatcircumstances an allegation that quotations were made up oraltered may serve as the basis of a libel lawsuit. CharlesMorgan, a San Francisco lawyer for psychoanalyst JeffreyMasson in his lawsuit against writer Janet Malcolm and NewYorker magazine, argued that evidence of altered quotationsshould almost always be enough to create a presumption oflibel and to allow the case to go to a jury.   But some justices appeared skeptical of this broadapproach, as well as whether Dr. Masson's reputation wasactually injured by the quotations that he alleges werechanged or made up by Ms. Malcolm in writing a profile ofhim. Ms. Malcolm denies any misquotations.   Instead of going to a jury, Mr. Masson's charge wasdismissed before trial by a federal judge in San Francisco.The judge ruled that he failed to present evidence of actualmalice, meaning that the writer acted with knowledge offalsity or with reckless disregard of truth or falsity. TheSupreme Court has said that the First Amendment requirespublic figures who file libel suits to prove actual malice.   Bartow Farr, a Washington lawyer who argued for the NewYorker, said there may be a basis for a finding of actualmalice only if a writer &quot;knowingly misrepresented thesubstance&quot; of statements, not merely changed words. That,too, left a number of justices appearing doubtful.   &quot;Why should the intentional alteration of my words be atmy risk?&quot; asked Justice Antonin Scalia. &quot;It seems to me youshould be at risk.&quot;   ---</TEXT></DOC>
