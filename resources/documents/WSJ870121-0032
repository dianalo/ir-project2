Despite the substantial loss, the company expressed optimism that its outlook is brightening -- something it has said in the past, only to have things get worse.    The maker of office computer systems had forecast a loss. But the actual loss was slightly wider than expected, and included a $37 million charge related to inventory write-downs and the consolidation of manufacturing operations. Wang earned $21.7 million, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue declined 2% to $668.9 million from $679.5 million.    The poor results notwithstanding, Frederick A. Wang, president, said that the company is &quot;increasingly optimistic&quot; about its prospects because it booked $763.3 million in orders in the second quarter, with orders for its high-end computers particularly strong. This was a 9% increase from the first quarter's record level, and 12% more than the year-earlier second quarter. Those orders should be reflected in higher sales starting in the current quarter, he said. &quot;We are targeting close to break-even performance in the third quarter and solid profitability in the final quarter,&quot; Mr. Wang said.    Mr. Wang said the company would have achieved its second-quarter goal of reducing its operating loss from the first quarter's $30 million were it not for production problems stemming from the consolidation of the company's two major manufacturing plants.    Some analysts, however, were skeptical about the company's optimistic forecasts. &quot;We'll just have to wait and see,&quot; said Frederic Cohen, an analyst at L.F. Rothschild Unterberg, Towbin. &quot;They have made statements in the past about turning more profitable . . . and it didn't turn out that way. Outside of the promises, I see nothing concrete in terms of product introductions and asset management that a major turn is upon us.&quot;    Thomas Willmott, a consultant with International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass., added: &quot;The real question for the future is, will Wang's new products be successful enough and will its reduction of expenses be enough to reposition Wang in fiscal 1987? My view is, probably no.&quot;    In response, Mr. Wang said, &quot;Watch what we'll do in the third and fourth quarters and that will resolve the skepticism.&quot;    Wang Class B shares closed yesterday at $14.375, up 25 cents, in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange.    During the computer slump, Wang has fared worse than many competitors because of delays in delivering promised computers and software, complaints about service, and growing competition in the office-automation market from larger rivals like Digital Equipment Corp.    Trying to put its difficulties behind it, Wang has solved problems with some of its software, and introduced new minicomputers and made numerous management changes. In addition, it has cut costs by laying off workers; it expects to have 29,900 employees world-wide at the end of March, down from a peak of 32,600 in June 1985.    For the first six months, Wang had a loss of $108.6 million compared with a profit of $28.7 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2.1% to $1.27 billion from $1.24 billion. The company said that operating losses associated with new communications and sevice businesses were $10 million for the second quarter and $21 million for the six months. </TEXT></DOC>
