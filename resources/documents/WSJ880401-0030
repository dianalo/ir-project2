Workers &quot;stand crowded next to one another, work on slippery floors in cold temperatures, and are required to make precision cuts with razor sharp knives -- as many as five cuts in 15 seconds at different angles,&quot; the report said. The Dakota City, Neb.-based meatpacker is 51%-owned by Occidental Petroleum Corp.    The committee said the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration should abandon its practice of exempting a workplace from a full inspection if the plant's own records don't show an above-average level of illness and injury. OSHA officials said last week that the agency is changing its procedures to require investigators to inspect &quot;high hazard&quot; areas of a plant regardless of what the employer's log shows.    The yearlong investigation was conducted by a Government Operations subcommittee headed by Rep. Tom Lantos (D., Calif.). The report, which focused primarily on IBP, based its conclusions on Labor Department data and descriptions of working conditions by employees and union leaders, as well as the testimony of officials from IBP and other companies at congressional hearings held last year.    IBP was harshly critical of the report, charging that the portions referring to IBP are &quot;filled with innuendo and gross overstatements&quot; and that the hearings were held &quot;to serve the egotistical needs of Congressman Lantos.&quot;    &quot;The report isn't even-handed or factual,&quot; IBP said in a prepared statement. It said the congressman and his aides visited no IBP meatpacking plants, where IBP said they would have seen &quot;clean, well-organized and excellent places to work.&quot;    Responding in turn to IBP, Mr. Lantos said, &quot;Ad hominem attacks are the usual response of someone who can't deal with the substance of the issue. Our report received the bipartisan support of all members of the committee. I stand by the report.&quot;    The committee also looked into whether IBP officials lied when they testified at congressional hearings last year saying they didn't keep two sets of injury records to mislead OSHA investigators. While charging that the company's explanation of its actions &quot;raised serious questions,&quot; the committee report said there isn't enough evidence to prove that IBP officials intentionally gave false testimony.    The report also recommends that OSHA set minimum training standards for meatpacking workers. It said that some workers at IBP operate machines that lack safety guards. General conditions are such that workers are sometimes hit by falling sides of beef, the study said.    The American Meat Institute, a trade organization representing meatpackers, issued a statement saying the industry &quot;has not ignored worker safety.&quot; It said the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported meatpacking plants have reduced injury rates 23% from 1979 to 1985.    The institute also blasted Rep. Lantos for holding the hearings in response to promptings from unions that were engaged in bitter labor disputes at the time. &quot;This atmosphere was not conducive to obtaining either an objective look at our industry or the safety issue,&quot; the trade group said.    An OSHA spokesman said the agency's officials deny that its practice of basing some inspections on injury logs encourages under-reporting of illnesses and injuries. The report confirms that meatpacking is hazardous and meatpacking employers need to do a better job of protecting employees, the spokesman added.    ---   Marj Charlier in Dallas contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
