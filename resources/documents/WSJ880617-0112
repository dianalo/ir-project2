That's the message dozens of Bankers Trust New York Co. employees have been getting lately as the bank, in an effort to cut costs and reduce its work force, has quietly been selling several departments to Xerox Corp.    Companies commonly go outside to contract for such things as cafeteria and security guard services. But sales of entire departments -- Bankers Trust officials call them &quot;vendings&quot; -- extend directly into the operations of the nation's eighth-largest bank.    About 125 former Bankers Trust employees in the payroll, accounts payable, personnel and other departments are still doing the same job in the same place, but are working -- or soon will be working -- for a division of Xerox, the giant Stamford, Conn., office equipment and financial services company. Some 70 Bankers Trust workers were told June 2 that their jobs would shortly be transferred to Xerox, a spokesman for the bank said.    Weighted down with billions of dollars of shaky Third World loans, and facing enormous competition in financial markets in the U.S. and abroad, New York banks are under huge pressure to cut costs and trim staff. In recent months most big banks have made big reductions in staff by firing people or eliminating jobs through attrition. But vending, which seems to be unique to Bankers Trust among New York banks, has gathered steam at the institution only in the past year.    &quot;Basically {big banks} realize their earnings aren't going in the right direction, and the easiest way to cut expenses is to have fewer people hanging around,&quot; says Cheryl Swaim, an analyst at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., a securities firm.    At Bankers Trust, other recent transfers of staff to Xerox include all the telephone operators at Bankers Trust's headquarters here, workers responsible for the bank's new-employee orientation, and the bank's employee records center. Bankers Trust also contracts out to Xerox its mail room and printing services.    For Xerox, taking over departments at Bankers Trust offers new fee-earning opportunities. A division, Xerox Reproduction Centers, offers services to &quot;document-intensive concerns,&quot; says company spokesman Peter Hawes.    Xerox doesn't yet provide services on a similar scale to other banks but would be interested in such business, says Robert Fries, a regional manager at Xerox Reproduction. Xerox began running Bankers Trust's printing department in July 1986, then took on the mail room and has since expanded into other departments at the bank, he and Mr. Hawes said. &quot;Sometimes we can find efficiencies in these businesses because they are our specialty,&quot; Mr. Hawes added.    For Bankers Trust, vending has saved the bank $5 million over the past four years in the New York metropolitan area, said Charles Nobs, senior vice president for corporate operating services. &quot;These are the kind of lower-order functions,&quot; which might be done more profitably by others, he added.    But this cost-cutting doesn't always thrill past and present Bankers Trust employees. On occasion, employees have only been given a week to decide whether or not to transfer to Xerox, try for another Bankers Trust job or leave, according to a former employee.    Benefits can suffer, too. Under Xerox's savings-incentive plan, the company contributes 25 cents for every dollar saved by an employee, up to 1% of salary. But Bankers Trust puts in $2 for every dollar an employee contributes, up to 6% of salary.    But Bankers Trust officers say that while some benefits might suffer in the short term, an employee's career prospects could be improved by a transfer to Xerox, which has more experience and opportunity in certain areas of employment. </TEXT></DOC>
