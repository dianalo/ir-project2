(Fiber Distributed DataInterface)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Darrow, Barbara.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Many industry observers expect Fiber Distributed Data Interface(FDDI) data transmission to become more widespread and affordablein the 1990s with the growing use of graphical applicationsdemanding high bandwidth.andP;  FDDI offers 100M-bps transmission overshielded twisted-pair cable for distances of up to 100 metersStandard office applications are becoming more graphical, makingnetwork bandwidth an issue as end users demand enough data flowbetween workstation and server to support real-time graphics.andO;Nearly all new or renovated buildings are equipped with fiber, andintegrating FDDI with unshielded twisted-pair wiring may befeasible.andP;  Some are skeptical about the ability of suchimplementations to meet FCC regulations.andP;  An inherent advantage offiber is its immunity to electromagnetic interference.andP;  Potentialapplications include multimedia, electronic publishing andscientific visualization.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Fiber OpticsFiber Distributed Data Interface StandardBandwidthLocal Area NetworksTrendsCommunications Industry.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
