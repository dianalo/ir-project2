George Theodorovich, 66, withdrew his appeal of a deportationorder with immigration authorities after obtaining a visa to travelto Paraguay, the department said.   The retired meat cutter, who went to Paraguay two months ago, wasordered deported in 1987 by an immigration judge after the JusticeDepartment produced reports that he had written to account forbullets he used to shoot Jews.   The Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations chargedthat Theodorovich, a member of the Ukrainian police during Nazioccupation in the city of Lvov, had concealed his activities when heentered this country after the war.   The immigration judge had found that Theodorovich ``did assistand otherwise participate in the persecution of Jews in Lvov during1942-1944.''   ``He was a Ukrainian policeman for two years when Lvov went froma city of 160,000 Jews to a mere handful,'' U.S. Immigration JudgeJohn F. Gossart Jr. said in his order.   Theodorovich was ordered deported to Argentina but the case wasbefore the Board of Immigration Appeals when Theodorovich fled toParaguay on Dec. 18, 1988.   The Justice Department was not notified that Theodorovich hadfled the country until this week when it received papers filed byhis attorney with the immigration appeals board.   ``The evidence in this case, particularly the important documentskeeping track of the bullets expended by Theodorovich in killingJews, showed his direct role in the destruction of one of thelargest Jewish communities in Europe,'' Neal Sher, the JusticeDepartment's chief Nazi hunter, said in a statement.   Theodorovich is the second former member of the Ukrainian policeto flee from this country to Paraguay following Justice Departmentefforts to obtain deportation, according to department records.   Sergei Kowalchuk fled to Paraguay in 1987 after the JusticeDepartment initiated deportation proceedings, alleging he servedwith the Ukrainian police in Poland during Nazi occupation.</TEXT></DOC>
