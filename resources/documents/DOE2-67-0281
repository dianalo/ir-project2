The initial iteration is complete with sixfull length model magnets and a thermal model having been built and tested.This initial experience along with the evolving SSC Magnet System Requirementshave resulted in the second generation magnet cryostat design. It isthis configuration that will be employed for the near term ongoing magnetic,thermal, string and accelerated life testing and will be the design consideredfor Phase I; i.e., Technology Orientation, of the SSC Magnet IndustrializationProgram. 5 refs., 7 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
