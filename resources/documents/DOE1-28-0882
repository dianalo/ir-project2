The crystal structure was determined from single-crystal intensitydata obtained by means of an automated four-circle diffractometer andrefined to the conventional values R = 0.050 and R/sub w/ = 0.059 for1498 observed reflections. The structure is characterized by a three-dimensionalnetwork of Bi{sub 2}O{sub 10} units and VO{sub 4} tetrahedra. A Bi{sub2}O{sub 10} unit is formed by two BiO{sub 6} octahedra sharing an edge.K{sup +} ions occupy three different crystallographic sites. One of themhas a high thermal vibration which could reflect ionic mobility. Theionic conductivity highly increases at 790 K. DSC measurements show areversible transition at this temperature. One K atom, and only one,can be substituted by one Na atom to give NaK{sub 2}Bi{sub 2}(VO{sub4}){sub 3}; this substitution improves the conductivity.</TEXT></DOC>
