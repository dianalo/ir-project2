Considerable research has indicated that the huge size ofthe cohort born between 1946 and 1964, plus the recession ofthe early Reagan years, have depressed the boomers' earningscompared with those of earlier groups at similar ages. But, anew analysis argues, that's just part of the story.   Richard Easterlin and Christine Macdonald of theUniversity of Southern California and Diane Macunovich ofWilliams College agree the earnings picture isn't too good.Their data show that average real earnings of young menbetween the ages of 20 and 40 in 1987 were lower or justbarely above the earnings of men in that age range in 1974.For example, men 30 to 35 in 1987 had average earnings $2,300a year less than the comparable age group in 1974.   But the researchers maintain that the boomers madelife-style adjustments giving them a higher economic standardof living than the earnings figures imply. They continued tolive with parents, cohabited or doubled up with other adults,stretching their buying power. They postponed marriage andchildren until they were older and making more money. Wiveswent to work and then kept on working after having kids.   The Easterlin team calculates an &quot;average income per adultequivalent,&quot; a figure that takes into account the number ofadults and children sharing each household's income andeconomies of scale; they conclude that this figure wassharply higher for young people in 1987 than for comparableage groups in 1974. In 1987, for instance, the average annualincome per adult equivalent for men between 30 and 35 isfigured to be $2,700 higher than it was for those 30 to 35 in1974.   &quot;For the baby boom generation,&quot; the analysis says,&quot;altered demographic behavior has been the key totransforming adverse labor market conditions into favorableliving levels.&quot;                                                                                                          Parents' Relationships   Shape Sexual Attitudes                                                                                                          PARENTS' MARITAL history influences their children'sattitudes toward sex and marriage, a University of Michiganprofessor reports.   Arland Thornton drew on a large sample of white Detroitfamilies who had children in July 1961, interviewing themothers repeatedly between 1962 and 1985 and interviewing thechildren when they were 18 and again when they were 23. Hefound that children whose mothers had married young generallyhad more accepting attitudes toward premarital sex thanchildren whose mothers married older. They also tended toenter more quickly into cohabitation or marriage.   Children whose mothers were pregnant before marriage weresubstantially more sexually active themselves than childrenconceived after marriage.   Parental divorce and remarriage had similar impact. Youngpeople whose parents divorced during the years they weregrowing up were substantially more likely to have extensivepremarital sex and to cohabit before marriage. Thecohabitation rate among children whose childhoods were markedby family disruption was more than double that for childrenfrom intact families.   &quot;One particularly interesting finding,&quot; Mr. Thornton says,was that children whose mothers divorced and remarried werefar more sexually active than those whose mothers didn'tremarry.                                                                                                          Non-Traditional Homes   Can Hurt Kids' Health                                                                                                          FAMILY STRUCTURE has much to do with children's health anddevelopment, a new survey documents.   With so many more children living in single-parent orstepparent families, the subject takes on new urgency.Deborah Dawson of the National Center for Health Statisticsexamined a 1988 government survey of the health and emotionalstatus of some 17,000 children ranging in age from infancy to17.   After adjusting for the children's age, sex, race, familyincome, whether the mother worked outside the home and otherfactors, she found that on a series of health tests, childrenliving in non-traditional families had substantially greaterproblems than those living with both natural parents.   For example, the risk of having had an injury or accidentduring the year before the survey was 20% to 30% higher forchildren living with a mother and stepfather or with adivorced mother only; peculiarly, children living with anever-married mother had no higher injury rates. Children inmother-headed families, whether never-married or previouslymarried, were 50% more likely to have asthma.   Children living in mother-headed families or with mothersand stepfathers were anywhere from 40% to 75% more likely tohave had to repeat a grade in school than those living withboth biological parents. Children from disrupted marriageswere over 70% more likely to have been suspended or expelled,and those living with never-married mothers more than twiceas likely.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          MEN MADE UP 73% of the full-time faculty in U.S. highereducation in 1988 and 56% of the part-time faculty, accordingto the Department of Education. Whites accounted fornine-tenths of all faculty members, while 4% were Asian, 3%black, 2% Hispanic and 1% American Indian. . . . Morearrestees in the Northeast test positive for multiple druguse than in any other part of the U.S., National Institute ofJustice researchers report. Compared with males, femalearrestees show as high or higher multiple drug use in everysection of the country.</TEXT></DOC>
