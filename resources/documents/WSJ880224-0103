Mr. Reuter emphasized that Daimler-Benz has its own problems as it continues a transition from being a maker of luxury cars to a diversified technology group. The three major aerospace and technology companies it acquired since 1984, he said, have yet to be fully integrated into management's groupwide &quot;synergy&quot; concept.    &quot;In 1988, we're facing more problems, and I would personally be very glad if we again could reach the same level of profits we showed in 1986 and will show for 1987,&quot; Mr. Reuter said in an interview with U.S. journalists.    Bonn and a collection of state governments, looking for solutions to West Germany's loss-making Airbus operation, have been urging Daimler-Benz to assume managerial control of the state-controlled aerospace group Messerschmidt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b.H. The group, known as MBB, owns Deutsche Airbus G.m.b.H., which represents West Germany's 37.5% stake in Europe's Airbus aircraft-building consortium.    Mr. Reuter acknowledged that Daimler-Benz was in talks with MBB management as well as with federal and state government leaders regarding Daimler-Benz's possible participation in restructuring West Germany's splintered aerospace industry. &quot;We have one big problem in those talks,&quot; he said. &quot;We are by no means keen and we are by no means ready to get ourselves mixed up in the Airbus business.&quot;    He said that, in its current form, at least, Germany's involvement in Airbus &quot;can't be economically viable before the end of this century.&quot;    Mr. Reuter suggested that the Airbus interests be broken out of the MBB group and reorganized into a profit-oriented private company. Then, he said, MBB's non-Airbus operations would fit in nicely with Daimler-Benz's new units: the AEG AG technology group, the aerospace company Dornier G.m.b.H., and Motoren andamp; Turbinen Union G.m.b.H., a jet-turbine maker.    Daimler-Benz's liquid assets of 11 billion marks ($6.47 billion) would make it a natural choice to take over a streamlined MBB. &quot;We didn't empty our war chest&quot; in spending 2.6 billion marks on recent acquisitions, Mr. Reuter said. Indeed, the company's cash reserves actually rose from eight billion marks in 1984.    As reported, the additions to Daimler's traditional automotive business helped it post a 2.3% rise in 1987 group sales, to 67 billion marks. Mr. Reuter said group earnings were little changed last year from 1986's 1.7 billion marks.    He rejected suggestions that the company had overextended itself with its expansion into aerospace and technology, saying such speculation was based on faulty expectations that it would achieve a sharp improvement in its performance. </TEXT></DOC>
