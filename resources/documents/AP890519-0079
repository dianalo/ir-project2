Dissidents charge the government is trying to cover up policeinvolvement in the death of 24-year-old Lee Chol-kyu, whose bodywas found in a reservoir near the southern city of Kwangju on May10.   Lee's death has inflamed radicals and heightened tension inKwangju, a stronghold of anti-government sentiment where thousandsof dissidents and radical students have staged anti-governmentprotests for the past eight days. The protests there and aroundKorea are to mark the annniversary of a 1980 civil uprising inKwangju that left at least 192 people dead.   Anti-government rallies to mark the uprising were expected tocontinue through the weekend, and police units were on top alert.   ``Oust the Roh Tae-woo regime which tortured Lee to death,''yelled 400 students at the National Polytechnic University in Seoulwho marched through the streets today. About 400 riot policefollowed but did not intervene.   The United National Democratic Movement, the nation's leadingdissident group, said that if the government does not conduct asecond autopsy it will ask doctors from Amnesty International to doso.   The government has said a second autopsy is unnecessary, butdissidents want an independent investigation to check their chargesof torture and police involvement.   The government says troopers chased Lee when he was stopped at aroadblock but deny police were responsible for the death. Officialssay an autopsy performed earlier this week indicates Lee drowned,and they speculate he slipped and fell into the reservoir whilerunning away from police.   ``How could it be drowning as the government claims?'' Lee'smother, Hwang Jung-ja, said today during an emotional meeting withthe provincial police director in Kwangju, according to Yonhap, theSouth Korean news agency.   Yonhap said Lee's mother, accompanied by 30 women who aremothers of political prisoners, visited director Paik Hyung-jo athis office to protest the government's ruling that Lee drowned anddemand a police investigation.   In Seoul, relatives of victims of the nine-day Kwangju uprisingcalled today for an end to political exploitation and demanded thegovernment provide compensation to families of those killed.   ``We have suffered enough, mentally and physically,'' said ParkChan-bong, spokesman for the Family Association of Victims ofKwangju's Pro-Democracy Movement. ``We must not be exploitedanymore for political purposes.''   Roh was a senior army general when townspeople and studentsseized a government armory in Kwangju May 18, 1980 and took controlof the city. Troops were sent in to suppress the uprising nine dayslater after talks failed.   Government reports said 192 people were killed and hundredsinjured in the uprising. Opposition groups claims the governmentcovered up many more deaths.   Dissidents and radical students have been calling for theoverthrow of the Roh government, but they lack public supportbecause of their violent tactics and extremist views.</TEXT></DOC>
