The lobbyist needn't have worried. The sad shape of U.S. savings institutions is such a complicated and alarming topic -- and the solutions so unpleasant -- that neither George Bush nor Michael Dukakis has wanted to seriously discuss it in the presidential campaign.    But one of these men will be the next president and will have to confront the problem head-on. The bankruptcy of more than 400 savings and loans represents one of the most serious financial problems the nation faces. Taxpayers are going to have to finance a savings-institution bailout &quot;that goes far beyond anything that the government has ever had to deal with,&quot; predicts Frederick Wolf, who audits the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. for the General Accounting Office, Congress's watchdog arm.    Closing or rescuing insolvent thrifts will cost $45 billion to $50 billion, on top of the more than $20 billion the FSLIC has spent this year, Mr. Wolf says. And while the Reagan administration continues to insist that the Sandamp;L industry can pay for any bailout on its own through increased insurance premiums paid to the FSLIC, most private analysts doubt the insurance agency can foot such an enormous bill. Thus there seems to be little doubt, analysts say, that taxpayers will have to foot a big chunk of it.    But both Republicans and Democrats know that they can be blamed for allowing the crisis to develop. So they aren't eager to talk about it in the campaign.    &quot;The issue tars all incumbents, so it is easy for the two parties to agree, 'Let's not make it an issue,'&quot; says Edward Kane, a finance professor and deposit-insurance analyst at Ohio State University. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas acknowledges: &quot;There's plenty of blame to go around.&quot;    There is another reason for both Republican presidential nominee Bush and Democratic nominee Dukakis to tread lightly on the thrift crisis. If they harp on the problem, they will be asked for their solution. And, campaign aides privately acknowledge, they haven't any easy answer to offer voters.    Indeed, that appears to be the reason Mr. Dukakis hasn't dwelled on the savings-and-loan mess after making one brief campaign foray into the topic late last month. The Massachusetts governor blasted Vice President Bush for failing to address the thrifts' woes when he was chairman of a Reagan administration task force on financial regulation from 1982 to 1984.    Mr. Bush's &quot;inattention&quot; to the problem &quot;will cost tens of billions of dollars,&quot; Mr. Dukakis charged. The vice president &quot;walked away from a ticking time bomb,&quot; Mr. Dukakis added.    Even less-partisan analysts agree that the Reagan administration may bear some responsibility for the crisis. Danny Wall, the Republican chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, has blamed most of the thrift crisis on deregulation of the industry without adequate supervision by the government. It was the Reagan administration that, after pushing legislation to loosen regulations on Sandamp;Ls, cut the Bank Board's staff of supervisors and examiners.    But Bush partisans have counterattacked by blaming the Democratic-controlled Congress, and particularly House Speaker James Wright of Texas, for delaying and trimming the Reagan administration's request for funds to patch up and close sick thrifts.    Congress approved $10.8 billion in borrowing authority for the FSLIC in mid-1987, though the administration had asked for $5 billion more 18 months earlier. &quot;If they had passed the full amount we asked for in 1986, we wouldn't have the problem we have today,&quot; argues Robert Zoellick, issues director for the Bush campaign.    And Bush defenders note that the vice president's financial-regulation task force did recommend some steps to shore up thrifts, like higher capital requirements and linking their insurance rates to the riskiness of their portfolios.    Still, Mr. Dukakis plans to occasionally raise the thrifts problem as part of &quot;our litany of George Bush's failed missions,&quot; says Christopher Edley, Mr. Dukakis's issues director. But the thrift crisis hasn't become a big Dukakis theme. And even the small flurry of campaign oratory has focused on finger-pointing rather than a discussion of solutions.    That doesn't mean solutions aren't available. Brainstorming is under way throughout government regulatory offices, inside investment-banking firms and even among former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker's students at Princeton University.    For starters, it's likely that the new president will have to find a way to pay for closing or merging into stronger hands about 400 thrifts that clearly are insolvent. One method -- the least-palatable politically -- would be a direct appropriation from Congress to close the thrifts and pay off depositors.    Alternately, the federal government could indirectly help the FSLIC do the bailing out by guaranteeing all its debts, helping pay interest on its bonds or paying it interest on deposits that financial institutions have to maintain at the Federal Reserve banks. (Those deposits currently don't collect interest.) Industry contributions to the FSLIC could be boosted, or a small tax could be assessed on first mortgages to raise funds.    The FSLIC also could be merged with the stronger Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the bank-insurance fund, but many banks would oppose this. And the FDIC is somewhat shaky itself. Its reserves are expected to drop below $16 billion this year, so they alone wouldn't solve the FSLIC's $50 billion problem.    In addition, both Sandamp;Ls and banks in the Southwest want some kind of government corporation to take over and hold bad loans and foreclosed real estate in the oil-region states. They don't want assets dumped on already-weak markets, furthering the downward economic spiral in the region.    Beyond such short-term steps, economists say, the deposit-insurance system will have to undergo fundamental changes to ensure that massive failures don't recur.    Industry analysts suggest subjecting thrifts to tougher capital and accounting standards, forcing them to regularly reprice assets to market value, and closing them before they become insolvent. Some call for indexing insurance fees to the riskiness of a thrift's loans and investments, narrowing the coverage of deposit insurance or requiring that insured deposits be invested only in safe investments such as Treasury bills.    However, all these are thorny items for the two presidential candidates to discuss. Many require stepping on the toes of powerful interests in the financial industry, and some cost money. &quot;It will require taxpayer money, so neither one of them wants to talk about it in any detail,&quot; says Robert Litan, a Brookings Institution scholar on financial matters and an adviser to the Dukakis campaign.    Some of Mr. Bush's supporters warn against a rush to action. Some have talked of obtaining advice from a proposed bipartisan thrift-study commission. But in the end, the administration encouraged Republican lawmakers to kill the commission proposal, leaving the administration's own FDIC and Treasury Department studies to forge the leading government proposals.    &quot;For the long run, we need to improve financial supervision and thrift regulation,&quot; says Richard Breeden, a private attorney and a Bush adviser on the issue. &quot;However, any change to the system should be carefully and thoroughly addressed by experts in the field, and it should not be dealt with superficially or in unnecessary haste.&quot;    Mr. Breeden needn't worry about unnecessary haste on the part of Mr. Dukakis or Mr. Bush. Neither candidate is dealing seriously with the thrift issue.    ---                        Rescue Cost    Current estimates of the prospective cost of restoring solvency to all FSLIC-insured thrifts, in billions of dollars.
