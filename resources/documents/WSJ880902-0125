The tender offer, which is valued at about $500 million for the shares Mark IV doesn't already own, had been scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m. EDT tomorrow.    Earlier this week, Mark IV said it would be willing to increase its offer to $46 a share if the New Haven, Conn.-based auto-parts concern would agree to a &quot;mutually satisfactory&quot; merger pact. However, Armtek said yesterday in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that Mark IV rejected Armtek's offer to provide confidential information in exchange for an agreement governing the use of such information.    Generally, such an agreement calls for a hostile bidder to stop soliciting shares of the target company. But Armtek yesterday wouldn't confirm that it sought such a standstill agreement. Nor would Armtek comment on Mark IV's proposal to increase its bid.    Armtek disclosed in its SEC filing that directors voted to sweeten the contracts of 11 top executives, and to make it more difficult to terminate nonofficer, salaried employees.    As previously reported, Mark IV, a West Amherst, N.Y., holding company, already holds about a 14.9% stake in Armtek. It originally offered $40 a share, but when Armtek directors said the price was too low, Mark IV sweetened it to $44 a share.    Armtek responded by announcing that it would seek a suitor for a friendly merger. Mark IV then filed suit against Armtek directors, claiming they had breached their fiduciary duty.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Armtek shares closed at $46.50, down 25 cents a share. </TEXT></DOC>
