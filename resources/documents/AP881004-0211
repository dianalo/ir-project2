At least eight loud explosions were heard in the capital city ofSantiago moments after the outage hit at 10:30 p.m. (9 p.m. EDT),but police spokesman Luis Retamal said no immediate reports came inof damage or injuries.   The indication was that the later explosions may have beencaused by explosives intended to produce noise but do little damage.   Retamal, in an interview broadcast by Radio Mineria of Santiago,said he could not confirm the cause of the blackout. But policesources said terrorist bombs toppled at least three powertransmission towers.   Cities from Tal Tal, 690 miles north of Santiago, to PuertoMontt, 650 miles to the south, were hit by the outage, authoritiessaid. Some communities in between were unaffected or suffered onlya flickering of lights. In some sectors of Santiago power wasrestored in a half hour. Other areas remained without power an hourlater.   A similar blackout struck Chile Saturday night and also wasaccompanied by explosions that caused no apparent damage orinjuriees. The government blamed that outage on bombing of threepower towers by leftist terrorists, even though Chile's smallleftist urban guerrilla groups have declared a unilateral ``truce''until after the referendum.   Voters declare on Wednesday whether they want Pinochet aspresident for eight more years, and his opponents predict thedecision will be no. Authorities say they will keep strict order.   Alberto Cardemil, an Interior Ministry undersecretary, dismissedfears expressed by the political opposition and Roman CatholicChurch officials of violence by Pinochet supporters on election day.   He accused the opposition of spreading ``unfounded rumors'' andtold a news conference any violence would be organized by theextreme left.   Opposition leaders, the church and the U.S. State Departmentsaid Monday they had information that pro-government provocateursmight carry out attacks to create a pretext for declaring anemergency and curfew, perhaps with the goal of annulling theresults.   Cardemil said there were no plans to declare an emergency or, assome people fear, to require that television and radio stationsbroadcast only official information, but he added: ``I can't makeany assurances.''   Pinochet, the 72-year-old army commander who seized power inSeptember 1973, trails in most polls.   His name is alone on the ballot. Chile's 7.4 million registeredvoters are asked to respond ``yes'' or ``no'' to a proposal by thegeneral and other military chiefs that he remain in power until1997.   If a majority says yes, Pinochet will begin a new eight-yearterm in March. If the result is negative, an open election is to beheld next year, with power being turned over to the winner in March1990.   On Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador Harry Barnes was summoned for aprivate meeting with Foreign Minister Ricardo Garcia, who wasevidently angered by a newspaper article in which Barnes was quotedas saying he prefers an opposition victory in the referendum.   The embassy issued a statement denying that Barnes publicly tooksides in the vote, saying Barnes reiterated in the article ``thewish of the United States for a rapid return to democracy as wellas its firm support for basic human rights.''   Neither Barnes nor Garcia commented publicly after the meeting.   The New York Times on Tuesday quoted Barnes as saying in aninterview in Santiago: ``I look forward to coming back in March1990, when the first democratically elected President would beinaugurated if the ``no'' wins, rather than having to wait until1997.   ``At this point I think the `no' will win, if the processdoesn't get interrupted,'' Barnes was quoted as saying.   Congressional elections are planned for 1990, whatever thereferendum's outcome. The last legislature was disbandedimmediately after the military ousted the elected government ofPresident Salvador Allende, an avowed Marxist who died during thecoup 15 years ago.   The new congress will be virtually powerless to amend Pinochet's1980 constitution, which gives the military both autonomy and asupervisory role in making national policy, because of provisionswritten into the charter.   Patricio Aylwin, president of the centrist Christian DemocraticParty and spokesman for a 16-party opposition coalition, said thereferendum was certain to go against Pinochet.   ``We are going to vote and we are going to win,'' he toldreporters.   Polls open at 8 a.m. (7 a.m. EDT) and close at 5 p.m. (4 p.m.EDT), but will be allowed to stay open longer to accommodate linesof voters.   Both the Interior Ministry and the opposition coalition plan tomake unofficial tallies, but the official count by the nationalelection board is not expected until Friday.   Wednesday has been declared a holiday and sale of alcoholicbeverages will be prohibited.</TEXT></DOC>
