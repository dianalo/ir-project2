In particular, the Commission is consideringwhether to amend the rule's earnings claim and preemption provisions (16CFR 436.1(b)-(e) and 436.3 (Note 2) to reduce the costs and burdens arisingfrom the present provisions. The Commission invites written public comments concerning possible amendmentsto these provisions, and announces that until further notice, franchisorsusing the Uniform Franchise Offering Circular (``UFOC'') for compliancemay continue to follow either the Item 19 earnings claim requirements inthe September 1975 UFOC Guidelines or the revised Item 19 requirementsin the UFOC revision of November 21, 1986. The extension is necessary toavoid inconsistent state and federal compliance obligations. In all other respects franchisors will be required to comply with the requirementsof the 1986 UFOC revision, as previously announced (52 FR 22686); namnely,the provisions of revised Item 20 that require new disclosures about formerfranchisees. In general, the obligation to comply with the revised UFOCrequirements takes effect on the earliest date after December 31, 1988,on which an annual revision, an amendment to reflect a material changeor a quarterly update is required to be provided to prospective franchiseesby the rule or state law. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Written comments will be accepted until April 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Written comments should be addressed to the Secretary,Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20580.All comments should be captioned: ``Comment of Advance Notice of ProposedRulemaking-Franchise Rule, FTC File No. R511003.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Craig Tregillus, Franchise RuleCoordinator, PC-H-238, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580.(202) 326-2970.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background </ITAG>On December 21, 1978, the Commission promulgated a trade regulation ruletitled ``Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchisesand Business Opportunity Ventures'' (``Franchise Rule'' on ``Rule''). \1\<NOTE/> After the issuance of Final Interpretive Guides (``Guides'')on August 24, 1979,\2\<NOTE/> the Franchise Rule took effect on October 21, 1979. The statutoryauthority for promulgating and amending the Rule is provided by Section18 of the Federal Trade Commisison Act, 15 U.S.C. 57a, as amended. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 43 FR 59617 (Dec. 21, 1978). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 44 FR 49966 (Aug. 24, 1979). The Franchise Rule requires franchisors, as defined by the Rule, to givepre-sale disclosures to prospective franchise buyers at least 10 businessdays before they pay any money or sign a legally binding agreement in connectionwith the purchases of a franchise. The disclosures provide material informationabout the franchise, the franchisor and the franchise relationship, andare designed to give potential investors the information they need to makea well-informed investment decision about a franchise offer. The Guides to the Rule authorize franchisors to comply with its requirementsby using disclosures in the format prescribed by the Rule or by the UniformFranchise Offering Circular (``UFOC'') Guidelines issued on September,1975.\3\<NOTE/> The UFOC is a disclosure format prepared by the administratorsof the state franchise registration and disclosure laws to permit franchisecompanies to use a single disclosure document to comply with the differingstate disclosure requirements. The Commission determined that use of theUFOC would be sufficient for compliance with the Rule because, in the aggregate,the UFOC provides protection to prospective franchisees that is equal toor greater than that provided by the Rule.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ 44 FR 49970.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Id. On November 21, 1986, the North American Securities Administrators' Association(``NASAA'') adopted revisions to two provisions of the UFOC, Item 19 andItem 20, and requested Commission approval of the continued use of theUFOC, as revised, to comply with the Rule. On June 9, 1987, the Commissionauthorized franchisors using the UFOC for Rule compliance to use eitherthe original or revised UFOC until December 31, 1988, but only the revisedUFOC after December 31, 1988.\5\<NOTE/> This phase-in of the revised requirements was provided toallow adequate time for the states to implement the UFOC changes in theirjurisdictions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ 52 FR 22686 (June 15, 1987). Two states did not formally implement the Item 19 UFOC revision by thedeadline.\6\<NOTE/> Item 19 requires franchisors that make claims about actual,average, projected or forecasted sales, profits or earnings to includethose claims in the UFOC, together with specified substantiation for them.The revised substantiation requirements now required for UFOC compliancewith the Rule appear to ease compliance costs and burdens substantially,and differ significantly from the original Item 19 requirements. Thus,in the states that continue to require the original Item 19 disclosures,franchisors that wish to provide earnings information to prospective franchiseescan no longer do so without violating either the state or federal disclosurerequirements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The same problem has not arisen with respect to the Item20 revision, which requires expanded disclosures about franchise failures.The alternative of using the Rule's disclosure format in these states maynot be a viable one for many franchisors. While some of the 13 states withfranchise disclosure filing requirements will accept the Rule's disclosureformat for filing, many have failed to authorize its use. Thus, nationalfranchisors that sought to use the Rule's disclosure format to avoid theItem 19 problem in one state would violate the laws of other states ifthey tried to use the same disclosures everywhere.In short, parallel federal and state regulation of the sale of franchisesnow clearly imposes inconsistent obligations on franchisors. The pre-saledisclosure requirements with which franchisors must comply at their perilwill no longer permit the use of uniform disclosures in all states unlessaction is taken at the state or federal level to resolve the inconsistency.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Extension of Time</ITAG>In the interests of promoting uniformity, and minimizing burdens on thesale of franchises, the Commission has decided to grant a temporary extensionof the time during which franchisors may continue to comply with the Ruleby using disclosures that meet either the original or revised UFOC Item19 requirements. The extension will remain in effect during the pendencyof the proposed rulemaking proceeding that is the subject of this AdvanceNotice of Proposed Rulemaking, or until further order of the Commission.In all other respects, franchisors must comply with the requirements ofthe revised UFOC as of January 1, 1989, as the Commission previously announced,if they wish to use the UFOC for Rule compliance.\7\<NOTE/> In particular, they must comply with revised UFOC Item 20.The Item 20 revision has been implemented uniformly by all the states withfranchise disclosure laws.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ 52 FR 22686.The obligation to comply with the revised UFOC requirements is incurred,in a state with a registration or disclosure law, on the first date afterDecember 31, 1988, that the state law requires a franchisor to providepotential investors with an annual disclosure renewal or an amendment toreflect a material change in prior disclosures. The obligation is incurredin states without such franchise laws on the same date as the franchisoris first required, after December 31, 1988, to provide a disclosure renewor amendment by a registration or disclosure law in a state in which itis selling franchises. If a franchisor does not sell franchises in anystate with a registration or disclosure law, the obligation to comply withthe revised UFOC requirements is incurred on the first date after December31, 1988, on which an annual revision or quarterly update is required bythe Rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Amendment Proceeding</ITAG>The Commission now proposes to begin a rulemaking amendment proceedingfor the limited purpose of reexamining the Rule's provisions concerningearnings claims and preemption. To assist in developing possible alternativesto these requirements that would reduce the costs and burdens of the presentprovisions, the Commission invites interested parties to address the issuesoutlined below in written comments filed in response to this advance noticeof proposed rulemaking.In the proceeding, the Commission plans to reconsider only the earningsclaim and preemption provisions of the Rule, and none others. During theproceeding, all of the Rule's provisions, including the earnings claimand preemption provisions, will remain in effect.A. Earnings ClaimsIn promulgating the Franchise Rule's earnings claim requirements in andSection;436.1(b)-(e),the Commission attempted to strike a balance between the protection ofpotential investors from deceptive claims and the costs, burdens and potentialentry barriers that overregulation may produce. The Commission's primarygoal in establishing the requirements, as in issuing the Rule, was to enhancethe availability of reliable information in the marketplace to permit potentialinvestors to make informed investment decisions.Nonetheless, the Rule's earnings claim requirements are extensive. Franchisorsthat wish to make claims about actual or potential sales, profits or earningsmust provide detailed disclosures mandated by andSection;436.1(b)-(e) ofthe Rule.Section 436.1(b) enumerates the requirements for claims based on projectionsor forecasts; andSection; 436.1(c), for claims based on actual operatingresults; and andSection; 436.1(e), for claims that appear in media advertising.The franchisor must have a ``reasonable basis'' for all such claims, theymust be ``geographically relevant'' to the potential franchisee's marketarea, and if they are based on operating results, must be prepared in accordancewith generally accepted accounting principles.The franchisor must also give a separate earnings claim disclosure documentto any potential investor to whom such a claim is made. The earnings claimdocument must contain a cover page specified by andSection; 436.1(d); a fullstatement of the basis and assumptions for the claim; prescribed cautionarylanguage that depends on the type of claim made; a notice that substantiatingmaterial is available for inspection by investors; a disclosure of thenumber and percentage of the franchisor's outlets that have achieved thesame or better results; and certain additional information that dependson the type of claim made.The earnings disclosure requirements of the Rule, in effect, place a minimumstandard on the quality of information that a franchisor must possess beforemaking an earnings claim. If potential investors are well informed aboutthe Rule, then they may perceive earnings claims as more reliable thanif there were less stringent standards.\8\<NOTE/> In addition, franchisors that do not make earnings claimsmay still be providing potential investors with relevant earnings information.the absence of earnings claims may indirectly express the fact that thefranchisor does not have adequate information to make a claim, or doesnot wish to reveal poor results.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ On the other hand, investors may place too much relianceon earnings claims that meet such quality standards, and fail to investigatevariables unique to their proposed locations.Studies of federal and state franchise disclosure requirements raise significantquestions about whether these requirements are enhancing the availabilityof reliable earnings information in the marketplace. A 1984 study of theimpact of the Rule on franchisees and potential investors first raisedthe issue of whether earnings claim disclosure requirements were inhibitingfranchisors from making claims or driving such claims underground.\9\<NOTE/> The study found that:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Audits andamp; Surveys, Inc., A Study of the Impact of theFranchise Disclosure Rule on Franchisees and Potential Investors (1984).<ITAG tagnum="21">Only a minority of franchisors made earnings claims, and it is notentirely clear that those who did backed up the claims with Earnings ClaimsDocuments [required by the Rule]. Respondents by and large, were desirousof more information on sales or profit***.\10\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 42.Although the study went on to find that most potential franchisees whosought earnings information were successful in obtaining it, over halfof the information was conveyed orally, only 27 percent was in writing,and only 5 percent was provided in connection with the required earningsclaim documentation.\1\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 33.A 1985 survey of the Rule's economic impact on franchisors suggested somepossible explanations.\1\\2\<NOTE/> Almost two-thirds of the franchisors surveyed agreed withthe view that:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ Opinion Research Corp., Final Report of a Survey toEvaluate the Economic Impact on Franchisors of the FTC Trade RegulationRule Entitled ``Disclsoure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchisingand Business Opportunity Ventures'' (1985).<ITAG tagnum="21">Present disclosure regulations make it difficult to make earningsclaims, and this, in practice, ultimately hurts prospective franchiseesmore than franchisors.\1\\3\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ <T3>Id. </T3>at I-6.In addition, franchisors regarded information on franchisee sales, profitsor earnings as one of the five most important disclosures, yet almost halfidentified this information as one of the five disclosures most costlyto provide.\1\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ <T3>Id. </T3>at I-5.Most recently, a 1988 study found that only 64 (or 11.5 percent) of allfranchisors registered to sell franchises in Maryland under the State franchiselaw made earnings claim disclosures.\1\\5\<NOTE/> Although the study found no consistent relationship betweenfranchisors making earnings claims and their net worth, years in businessor number of outlets, the data show that 24 percent of the franchisorsranked by <T3>Venture </T3>magazine as the fastest growing made earnings claims,and that franchisors listed in the top 500 in the industry by <T3>Entrepreneur </T3>magazine were four times more likely to make suchclaims than those that were not listed.\1\\6\<NOTE/> While Maryland registrants may not be representative of allU.S. franchisors, the author concluded that:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ W. Lewis, Earnings Claim Study: A Study of FranchisorsRegistered with the Securities Division of the State of Maryland, 17 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\<T3>Id. </T3>at 9-10, 22 and 23.<ITAG tagnum="21">In the absence of a requirement that written earnings claims be made,the vast majority of franchisors do not make them. The reasons most oftenstated for not making written earnings claims are that federal and stateregulations make the claims too difficult and expensive to prepare, thatthe claims might be used by disgruntled franchisees in future lawsuits,and that there is no ``reasonable basis'' for a claim due to factors suchas too few outlets, inadequate operating histories or geographic variancesin performance.\1\\7\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 4.These studies suggest that the earnings claim disclosure requirements ofthe Rule and state franchise laws either may be reducing the availabilityof relevant information, or assuring that it is provided, if at all, inunder-the-table circumstances that cast doubt on its accuracy and reliability.If that is so, the earnings claim requirements may be having the unintendedeffect of reducing the availability of reliable information in the market.The fact that NASAA has responded at the state level by simplifying theearnings claim requirements in Item 10 of the UFOC indicates that considerationof similar revisions to the Rule's earnings claim requirements may be desirable.NASA's action suggests that simplification that reduces compliance costsand burdens may be possible without any real diminution in investor protection.Accordingly, the Commission invites submission of evidence and the viewsof interested parties concerning whether or not the Commission should amendthe Rule's earnings claim disclosure requirements. In the amendment proceeding,the Commission will consider possible alternatives to the requirements,including: (1) Amended requirements similar to those of revised UFOC Item19; (2) amendments substituting the abbreviated requirements for advertisedclaims in Part 436.1(e) of the Rule for the more extensive requirementsfor other claims; (3) amendments excluding analyses of costs and break-evensales figures from the earnings claim requirements in limited circumstances;(4) amendments providing presumptions of satisfactory compliance if relevantaccounting standards have been met, both for claims based on actual operatingexperience and forecasts or projections; (5) amendments to the manner inwhich required disclosures must be made; and (6) amendments to other Ruleprovisions that may reduce the need for extensive earnings claim requirements.The Commission will be particularly interested in receiving evidence andcomment on the following questions:(1) What is the extent to which franchisors are currently complying orfailing to comply with the earnings claim requirements of: (a) Item 19of the UFOC; and (b) the Rule? (Please provide, to the extent possible,information about the number or percentage of firms making earnings claims,any statistical or financial information about the size and type of firmsmaking such claims, and the geographic areas in which the claims are made.)(2) To what extent have franchisors that did not previously make earningsclaims been prompted to make such claims by the revised UFOC Item 19 requirements?(3) What are the costs and benefits of compliance with: (a) The Rule'searnings claim requirements; (b) the original UFOC Item 19 requirements;and (c) if known, revised UFOC Item 19? What specific provisions of theserequirements, if any, have prevented or inhibited franchisors from makingearnings claims? What other considerations, if any, have inhibited franchisorsfrom providing earnings information?(4) How and to what extent have the requirements of revised UFOC Item 19increased or decreased the costs and benefits of earnings claims comparedto the costs and benefits of: (a) The original UFOC Item 19 requirements;and (b) the Rule's requirements?(5) Should the rule be amended to limit the disclosure requirements forall earnings claims to a statement of the number and percentage of franchiseeswho have achieved the sales, income or profits claimed, if all claims are:(a) Subject to a ``reasonable basis'' requirement; or (b) not subject tosuch a requirement? What are the costs and benefits of such an amendment?Are there circumstances in which such an amendment should not apply, orwhich warrant limitations on its applicability?(6) Should a presumption of a reasonable basis be provided for historicalearnings claims based on actual operating experience if they are preparedin accordance with applicable accounting standards; and if so, would sucha presumption be likely to encourage the availability of reliable earningsinformation? What are the costs and benefits of such an amendment? Arethere circumstances in which such an amendment should not apply, or whichwarrant limitations on its applicability?(7) Should the Rule be amended to provide a presumption of a reasonablebasis for earnings forecasts or projections prepared in accordance withthe Statement on Standards for Accountants' Services on Prospective FinancialInformation issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,notwithstanding the fact that they do not require use of the most probableresults; and if so, would such a presumption be likely to encourage theavailability of reliable earnings information? What are the costs and benefitsof such an amendment? Are there circumstances in which such an amendmentshould not apply, or which warrant limitations on its applicability?(8) How should ``reasonable basis'' be defined so that franchisors areencouraged to provide earnings information to prospective franchisees?What are the costs and benefits of such a definition? Are there circumstancesin which such a definition should not apply, or which warrant limitationson its applicability?(9) Should the Rule be amended to exclude cost analyses and break-evensales data from the Rule's earnings claim requirements: (a) Under all circumstances;or (b) subject to specified conditions (<T3>e.g., </T3>if profitability cannot be computed from the figures provided)?What are the costs and benefits of such an amendment?(10) Should the Rule be amended to require earnings claim disclosures inthe basic disclosure document required by andSection; 436.1(a) of the Rule,rather than in a separate earnings claim document? What are the costs andbenefits of such an amendment? Are there circumstances in which such anamendment should not apply, or which warrant limitations on its applicability?(11) Should the Rule be amended to require that the basic disclosure documentinclude a statement of whether or not the franchisor makes such claimsand is required to provide separate earnings disclosures? What are thecosts and benefits of such an amendment? Are there circumstances in whichsuch an amendment should not apply, or which warrant limitations on itsapplicability?(12) Would amendment of other Rule provisions, such as the addition ofthe new disclosure required by revised UFOC Item 20 to Part 436.1(a)(16),reduce the need for extensive earnings claim disclosures or requirements?What are the costs and benefits of such an amendment? Are there circumstancesin which such an amendment should not apply, or which warrant limitationson its applicability?(13) What other amendments to the Rule or its earnings claim requirementswould be likely to increase the availability of earnings information inthe marketplace? What are the costs and benefits of such an amendment?Are there circumstances in which such an amendment should not apply, orwhich warrant limitations on its applicability?B. Inconsistent State RequirementsThe Rule currently preempts inconsistent state laws only to the extentof the inconsistency. Note 2 to the Rule provides that a state law or regulationis not inconsistent with the Rule ``if the protection such law or regulationaffords any prospective franchisee is equal to or greater than that providedby'' the Rule. State requirements that provide equal or greater protection,and therefore are not considered inconsistent with the Rule, ``includelaws or regulations which require * * * the disclosure of more completeinformation to the franchisee.''The Commission invites submission of evidence and the views of interestedparties concerning whether or not the Commission should amend Note 2 tothe Rule. Alternatives the Commission may consider include: (1) ModifyingNote 2 provide that state disclosure requirements particularly earningsclaim requirements, that are more restrictive or burdensome than the Rule'srequirements are inconsistent with the Rule; (2) adding to the Rule a stateexemption petition provision similar to andSection; 453.9 of the Commission'sFuneral Industry Practices Trade Regulation Rule (16 CFR Part 453) or andSection;444.5 of the Credit Practices Trade Regulation Rule (16 CFR Part 444);or (3) making no change in Note 2.The Commission will be particularly interested in receiving evidence andcomment on the following questions:(1) Are there perceived inconsistencies or conflicts among the variousstate laws and regulations, or their interpretation, that govern the saleof franchises? Are state laws or regulations, or their interpretation,inconsistent or in conflict with the Rule?(2) To what extent have such inconsistencies or conflicts, if any, imposedcosts on the sale of franchises or burdens on the dissemination of materialinformation about franchises, particularly earnings information, to potentialinvenstors? Please describe and quantify those costs. Have those costsor burdens, if any, been offset wholly or in part by benefits? Please describeand quantify any benefits, and identify the beneficiaries.(3) To what extent have such inconsistencies or conflicts, if any, affectedthe availability of: (a) Material information about franchises, particularlyearnings information; or (b) the availability of franchises? Please indicatehow and where.(4) What is the likelihood that inconsistencies or conflicts, if any willcontinue to exist, increase or decrease?(5) Are there now any effective public or private mechanisms for resolvingany such inconsistencies or conflicts, or are any such mechanisms likelyto exist in the near future? (6) Are the inconsistencies or conflicts, if any, caused by state disclosurerequirements or state registration reguirements? Does the Commission havethe authority to preempt inconsistent conflicting disclosure laws or registrationlaws? If so, should the Commission exercise that authority?(7) Should the Rule be amended to prevent inconsistencies or conflicts,if any? If so, how?<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Economic Impact</ITAG>When it promulgated the Franchise Rule, the Commission found that the earningsclaim disclosure provisions would benefit consumers by eliminating deceptiveclaims in the marketplace. It found that the requirements would preventone of the most frequent abuses in the sale of franchises by insuring thatconsumers have an opportunity to understand and evaluate claims that couldotherwise lead to misguided investment decisions.\18\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ 43 FR 59684.In fashioning the earnings claim provisions, the Commission attempted toselect the least restrictive alternative for providing essential informationand protection to the consumer considering a franchise investment. Thus,the Commission allowed for the use of earnings forecasts or projectionsby new entrants to avoid erection of a regulatory entry barrier to newfranchise companies.\19\<NOTE/> The Commission also reduced the requirements for use of earningsclaims in advertising, in order to minimize their intrusion on advertisingspace, cost and time.\20\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ 43 FR 59685.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ 43 FR 58689.The Commission was no less concerned about the potential costs and benefitsof parallel state and federal regulation of franchise sales. The Rule wasdesigned to minimize interference with existing state franchise laws, whileestablishing a uniform nationwide standard for investor protection. Inadopting the Final Interpretive Guides to the Rule, the Commission alsosought to encourage consistency and uniformity in state and federal disclosurerequirements by interpreting the preemption standard so as to permit useof the UFOC for Rule compliance.Notwithstanding the Commission's determinations based on the previous rulemakingrecord, the Commission now is interested in examining further the impactof the Rule's earnings claim and preemption requirements, and the impactof possible less burdensome or restrictive alternatives to those requirements.Therefore, the Commission invites written public comment on these issues,with emphasis on the specific issues raised by Section 22 of the FederalTrade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 57b-3, and by section 3(a) of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603.Under section 22 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, when the Commissionpublishes a notice of a proposed rulemaking, it must issue a preliminaryregulatory analysis relating to the proposed rule or amendment. The Commissionneed not issue a regulatory analysis in connection with an amendment proceeding,however, unless the Commission: (1) Estimates that the amendment will havean annual effect on the national economy of $100,000,000 or more; (2) estimatesthat the amendment will cause a substantial change in the cost or priceof goods or services which are used extensively by particular industries,which are supplied extensively in particular geographic regions, or whichare acquired in significant quantities by the Federal Government, or byState or local government; or (3) otherwise determines that the amendmentwill have a significant impact upon persons subject to regulation underthe amendment and upon consumers.Under section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, when the Commissionpublishes a notice of proposed rulemaking, it also must prepare and makeavailable for public comment an intitial regulatory flexibility analysisunless the Chairman certifies that the proposed rule or amendment willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. This analysis must describe the impact of the proposed rule oramendment on small entities. Among other things, the initial regulatoryanalysis also must contain a description of the small entities to whichthe proposed rule or amendment will apply and, where feasible, an estimateof the number of such small entities; an estimate of the classes of smallentities which will be subject to any reporting, recordkeeping or othercompliance requirements of the rule for amendment; and an identification,to the extent practicable, of all relevant federal rules which may duplicate,overlap or conflict with the proposed rule or amendment.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Questions for Comment</ITAG>The Commission invites written public comment from interested parties withrespect to the proposed amendment proceeding, including any suggestionsor alternative methods for achieving the objectives discussed in part III,``Amendment Proceeding,'' <T3>supra.</T3>The Commission also invites written public comment with respect to allissues raised in part IV, ``Economic Impact,'' <T3>supra. </T3>Specifically, the Commission is interested in receivingwritten public comment on the impact of the Rule's earnings claim requirements,and on possible alternatives to those requirements, including, but notlimited to, amended requirements adopting the revised UFOC Item 19 provisionsor Part 436.1(e) requirements for all earnings claims, abbreviated disclosuresor disclosure language, and possible changes in the manner in which requireddisclosures must be made. The Commission is also interested in receivingwritten public comment on the impact of the Rule's preemption provisions,and on possible alternatives that would reduce disclosure burdens.The Commission further invites written public comment concerning what ``smallbusinesses'' would be affected for purposes of the regulatory flexibilityanalysis. The Commission is particularly interested in receiving commentsconcerning what impact, if any, the earnings claims disclosures originallypromulgated in the Rule, and the revised UFOC Item 19 or any other alternativesto those requirements, would have on small businesses and on consumers.In addition, the Commission solicits written public comment concerningwhat issues, if any, should be designated in the amendment proceeding asdisputed issues of material fact.The Commission will accept written public comment and evidence on all issuesand questions raised in this advance notice of rulemaking until April 17,1989. Comments should be identified as ``Comment on Advance Notice of ProposedRulemaking_Franchise Rule, FTC File No. R511003,'' and two copies shouldbe submitted if possible.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 436</ITAG>Franchising, Trade practices.<ITAG tagnum="21">By direction of the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donald S.
