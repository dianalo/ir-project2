With U.S. interest rates sinking, the dollar has slumped5% the past month against the yen and 3% against the mark.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. currency may have farther to fall, economistssay. But they don't expect the dollar's troubles to hurt theU.S. stock and bond markets.   In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar was quotedat 151.67 yen. That was up 0.87 yen from Tuesday's level, butdown substantially from the 12-month high of 159.79 yenearlier this spring. The dollar inched downward to 1.6455marks from 1.6465 marks the day before. Sterling was quotedat $1.6805, up from $1.6740 Tuesday.   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency wasquoted at 152.23 yen, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of151.95 yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6415marks.   &quot;The dollar continues to be vulnerable against the yen,&quot;says Robert Chandross, an economist at Lloyds Bank PLC in NewYork.   Like most traders and economists, Mr. Chandross isfocusing on inflation-adjusted, &quot;real&quot; interest rates in theU.S. and other big industrial nations. By that analysis, thedollar has become a lousy resting place for global investors'cash.   After allowing for inflation, U.S. long-term interestrates of 8.8% currently provide investors with a 3.6% realreturn. That's about the lowest real return of the U.S.'smajor trading partners. By comparison, Japan's real interestrates are about 4.5%, France's are 6.3%, and West Germany'sabout 6.2%.   &quot;This unfavorable real yield comparison is the main factorbehind the weakening of the U.S. dollar,&quot; says Hung Tran, aresearch director at Deutsche Bank AG's New York office.   Earlier this year, the dollar had strengthened onexpectations that the Federal Reserve would raise U.S.interest rates to fight inflation. But the Fed in recentweeks has indicated that it isn't likely to tug rates upward.That has left traders and economists convinced that thecurrent global interest-rate gaps are likely to last awhile.   &quot;All the central banks are on hold,&quot; says David Germany,an economist with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;Nothing tells me thatthe dollar's sag will be interrupted short-term.&quot;   Longer term, though, Mr. Germany sees the dollarrebounding on the strength of growing exports, a healthydomestic economy and an eventual boost in U.S. interestrates.   The dollar's latest jitters have reminded some marketparticipants of the 1985-87 period, when sudden drops in thedollar repeatedly led to brief plunges in U.S. stock and bondmarkets. At those times, Japanese and other foreign investorsstopped buying U.S. securities.   But economists aren't biting their nails now. &quot;I wouldn'texpect any movement out of the dollar to be of a magnitudethat would cause a panic or an abandoning of U.S. financialassets,&quot; says Mr. Tran.   Japanese investors, in particular, simply aren't ascrucial to the U.S. securities markets anymore. Last year,Japanese investors bought $3.3 billion of U.S. stocks,according to the Securities Industry Association, down from arecord $11.3 billion in 1987. They bought $2.3 billion ofTreasury bonds last year, down from a record $21.8 billion in1988. Stocks and bonds both gained anyway in 1989, without amajor Japanese boost.   &quot;Foreign investors -- led by the Japanese -- have shiftedfrom being portfolio investors in U.S. stocks and bonds tomaking direct investments in the U.S.,&quot; says Deutsche Bank'sMr. Tran. For the first half of 1989 alone, Japan investedmore than $9 billion in U.S. plants and equipment, realestate, corporate acquisitions and other forms of directinvestment, according to the Bank of Japan. Such assets, Mr.Tran observes, aren't likely to be sold quickly just becauseof a short-term drop in the dollar's value.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold forcurrent delivery settled at $369 an ounce, down $1.90.Estimated volume was a light 1.8 million ounces.   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $369.25 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
