Juanito Lirios, deputy director of the Philippine Atmospheric,Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, gave thetestimony at the opening of a government hearing on the sinking ofthe Dona Marilyn.   The Maritime Industry Authority, which conducted the hearing,said it would order owners Sulpicio Lines to show cause why itshould not lose its franchise because of the disaster, the secondwithin 10 months involving a Sulpicio passenger ship.   Officials say 161 passengers and 39 crewmen have been rescued sofar from the Dona Marilyn. At least 76 people are confirmed dead.   On Wednesday, President Corazon Aquino said she was suspendingSulpicio's passenger service indefinitely.   But Sulpicio Vice President Vicente Gambito said Friday he hadreceived no such order and service was continuing. Philip Tuazon,chief of maritime authority, said the suspension meant all Sulpiciovessels would be held in port until they and their crews passedinspection.   Lirios said the weather center issued 21 advisories on theapproach of Typhoon Ruby starting Oct. 23, the day before the DonaMarilyn sailed from Manila to Tacloban on Leyte island.   The first bulletin warned the typhoon was threatening the easternVisayas islands, where the vessel sank, he said.   The advisories go to the center's 64 coastal radio stations,which relay them to ships at sea.   ``It is the duty of the captain to monitor the weather,'' Liriossaid.   Coast guard officials said they cleared the Dona Marilyn forsailing because weather in Manila was good.   On Thursday, shipowners appealed to Mrs. Aquino to reconsidersuspending Sulpicio, the country's largest domestic shippingcompany. It operates 22 passenger and cargo ships which carry 20percent of domestic traffic among the country's 7,200 islands.   ``We would like to caution the government against taking hastydecisions,'' said Pacencio Balbon, president of the Conference ofInterisland Shipowners and Operators.   Figures on the Dona Marilyn's casualty toll vary widely becauseof conflicting reports on the number aboard. The skipper, Capt.Eliodoro Salgado, is among the missing.</TEXT></DOC>
