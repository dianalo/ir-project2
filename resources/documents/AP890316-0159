Some countries did comparatively well. Chile, where the WorldBank put the average income as $1,310 in 1987, and Ecuador, wherethe average had dropped to $1,040, both reported growth of 6 percentin 1988. That left them still far behind the United States, wherethe average citizen earned $18,430 in 1987, according to World Bankfigures.   The worst drops _ more than 3 percent _ were in Guayana,Nicaragua, Panama, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago.   Growth was slow in the countries with the biggest economies, andthe biggest debts: Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. In Brazil, Mexicoand Peru, where three out of every five Latin Americans live,average incomes were down.   ``The debt overhang continues to sap the economic strength of theregion, undermining its ability to import more and invest more,''the report said.   Latin American countries have debts abroad of more than $400billion dollars.   Lower Latin American imports make for less business and fewerjobs in the United States and other industrial countries. Lowerinvestment means a lower standard of living for the next generationof Latin Americans.   The report was issued the same day that David Mulford, assistantsecretary of the Treasury, announced the Bush administration opposescreation of an international debt management authority as proposedby Congress and Latin American leaders.   He also opposed proposals that the fund use its gold or issue``special drawing rights'' to help debtor countries, or that theWorld Bank tap assets that are not now out on loan.   Mulford leaves Friday to represent the United States inAmsterdam, where the report will be discussed at the annual meetingof the 44 governments in the Inter-American Development Bank.   He is expected to announce the end of a three-year disputebetween the United States and other donor countries on one side, andLatin American borrowers on the other, over power to delay loans bythe bank.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, then secretary of theTreasury, asked last year for a change in the bank's voting systemto allow the United States, when it could get Canada's support, todelay a loan for as long as two years, thus virtually killing it.   Long negotiations gave the United States much less _ a maximumdelay of 12 months, with the need of additional votes beyond its ownand Canada's to get even that, according to informed sources whodeclined to be further identified. The agreement cleared the way tomake another $22.5 billion available to the bank over the next fouryears.   The United States, which has 34.57 percent of the shares, wouldsupply $7.8 billion but only about $350 million would have to bepaid in.   Last year the bank approved $1.7 billion in new loans tomodernize industry, farms and tourist enterprises, improve roads,increase electric power, build health centers, clean up water andtreat sewage.   The report called attention to the growth of new exports fromLatin America: soy beans, fish, fresh fruit.   ``Exports of Chilean table grapes alone reached an estimated $500million in 1988,'' said the report -- prepared well before therecent discovery of cyanide in a shipment to the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
