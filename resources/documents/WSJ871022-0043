Mr. Baker suggested that the revenue increases might come from asset sales, user fees and other areas without raising taxes, White House officials said. However, President Reagan and White House aides continued to hold the door open to tax increases if necessary to reach a credible deficit reduction package, and congressional aides said they understood that tax increases would be a major part of the mix.    The president reiterated that all the deficit-reduction options were on the negotiating table, though he said he would argue against a tax increase in the coming budget talks with Congress because he thinks one would be counterproductive.    Howard Baker, the White House chief of staff, indicated in a talk to the Economics Club of New York last night that the president is ready to deal with Congress on closing the budget deficit, even if it means raising taxes. &quot;The president is willing to pay a price for a bipartisan solution&quot; to the budget impasse, Mr. Baker said. &quot;Just exactly what price, I am not prepared to say, because that would give away all of our bargaining leverage with Speaker Wright,&quot; Mr. Baker added.    Yesterday, officials held a preliminary round of meetings following President Reagan's decision to negotiate on a possible deficit reduction compromise. In those talks, a tentative agreement was reached that a task force of congressional leaders and top-level Reagan administration aides would begin more detailed negotiations soon, that the president would be involved in them, though not immediately, and that Social Security benefits wouldn't be trimmed as part of any eventual agreement.    The president is expected to be asked about the budget talks at a news conference tonight at 8 p.m EDT, the first formal, prime-time news conference he has held at the White House in more than seven months.    Despite assertions by Speaker Wright, a Texas Democrat, that the talks should produce deficit reductions of $40 billion to $50 billion, the implicit goal of the negotiations appeared to be a reduction of $23 billion or so. That's just enough to avert the automatic across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.    The talks were precipitated by the crash of the stock market Monday and a subsequent clamoring in Congress Tuesday for an economic summit to address the budget deficit issue. Asked if there is a preliminary deficit-reduction plan in the works, Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) replied: &quot;The plan is to get the market up.&quot;    Secretary Baker and White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker met privately with top Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress yesterday. These talks were preliminary and designed to show that the White House was serious about the negotiations, White House aides said.    At one point, Secretary Baker told Speaker Wright that they had &quot;common ground&quot; in working on a 50-50 package of spending cuts and revenue increases, according to both White House and congressional aides.    White House and congressional aides later suggested that Secretary Baker's comment was more an indication of the seriousness of the Reagan administration effort to reach a compromise rather than the specifics of a compromise package.    At an address yesterday to the Council of Better Business Bureaus, White House Budget Director James Miller said he didn't believe the president would accept a tax increase. But when the president was asked about the budget director's statement, Mr. Reagan said: &quot;Does it make you mad that somebody else is guessing what I think?&quot;    Nevertheless, in an interview later in the day Mr. Miller again repeated his contention. &quot;It's my judgment he will not take a tax increase,&quot; he said.    The exchange seemed to represent confusion in the administration following the president's announcement Tuesday. But the differences may partly be a matter of semantics. Mr. Miller has said in the past that he wouldn't regard certain revenue raisers, such as user fees or even an increased tax on tobacco, as &quot;taxes.&quot; But the budget director's comments also suggest that there is still no clear sense within the administration as to what the president will or won't agree to.    The president repeatedly refused to take the reporters' bait yesterday when they asked him whether he ruled out tax increases as he has in the past. Instead, he appeared to leave the door open, even though he said he didn't believe increased taxes would help ease the deficit. &quot;I will listen to what they have to say if they will listen to what I have to say about the fact that raising taxes has always resulted in a lowering of the revenues,&quot; Mr. Reagan said.    In the meantime, the House and Senate plan to move ahead with their own deficit-reduction plans, which have been crafted largely without Republican input. The House package, which contains a tax increase of $12 billion this year and more than $50 billion over three years, is scheduled to come to a vote next week.    ---   Alan Murray contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
