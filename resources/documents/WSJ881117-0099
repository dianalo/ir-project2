Rose (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> NAV GOVMT LABOR ENVR </CO><IN> FND TRA </IN><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge found Navistar International Corp. liable for unfunded pension obligations of its former Wisconsin Steel unit, even though it didn't own the business when the pension fund was terminated.    The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal agency that brought the landmark case, said federal Judge James B. Moran found that Navistar sold Wisconsin Steel to avoid paying pension benefits.    The agency had sued Navistar to hold the truck maker responsible for about $146 million for the underfunded pension plans, a figure that includes interest since 1981. It said the actual damages will be determined by Judge Moran in a supplemental proceeding.    Roxanne Decyk, Navistar's senior vice president for administration, said the company hopes it can overturn the decision on its liability in an appeal. She said that even though damages haven't been determined, the company &quot;is in a very sound financial position, and we have plenty of cash.&quot;    The company disputed the $146 million figure cited by the pension agency and added that Navistar was confident it &quot;will have no liability when the legal standards are resolved on appeal.&quot;    Ms. Decyk also said the company was pleased that the judge found Navistar wasn't liable for pension liabilities after the 1977 sale of Wisconsin Steel, and that he denied claims Wisconsin Steel made against Navistar.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Navistar shares fell 25 cents to $4.875. The decision was announced after the close of trading.    The case marks the first time the pension agency sought to hold a company liable even though it didn't own the business when the pension plan was terminated.    The agency asserted that Navistar, then known as International Harvester, fraudulently tried to avoid or minimize the cost of vested pension rights by selling the unit to Envirodyne Industries Inc. in 1977.    Wisconsin Steel later entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, under which a company seeks protection from creditor lawsuits while it seeks to work out a plan for paying its debts.    The agency alleged that Navistar knew Envirodyne wouldn't be able to obtain sufficent credit and capital to operate Wisconsin Steel profitably.    Gary Ford, general counsel of the agency, said the case shows that it &quot;will move decisively on what we view as abusive transactions, and we will stick to it as long as it takes.&quot; He added that the agency is &quot;monitoring&quot; several other companies. &quot;I hope it's a signal to them that if they attempt schemes that abuse the pension-insurance system, we will hold them accountable,&quot; he said.    Mr. Ford declined to identify the companies the agency is watching for possible abuses, but added: &quot;If you look at the business pages, you might find some candidates.&quot;    The pension agency originally brought two suits against Harvester in 1981 and 1982 and they were later consolidated into one action.    The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. was created in 1974 to guarantee payment of basic retirement benefits earned by workers in defined benefit pension plans. Such plans promise to pay specified amounts to retirees after a set number of years at work. </TEXT></DOC>
