He hit a 20-to-1 slot machine payoff.;   &quot;This is neat,&quot; he said.;    Jim Sweet, a boatyard and restaurant owner fromRapids City, Ill., also played the slot machines. He said Iowa's $5-a-betlimit and $200 loss limit per excursion could hurt the state's gamblingindustry in the long run.;    &quot;My hat's off to anyone who tries a totallyuntested venture. It's gutsy. We'll see about longevity,&quot; Sweet said.;   About 100 miles upriver in Dubuque, gamblers were awaiting the arrival of theDubuque Casino Belle. The riverboat got a late start from a Florida shipyardand then was delayed by high water levels on the Mississippi.;    The CasinoBelle was expected to take its first gambling cruise later in the day. And ThePresident was due to leave from Davenport later this morning.;    Stateofficials expect the riverboats -- which offer blackjack, roulette, craps andslot machines -- will generate about $11 million in annual tax revenues.;   The wagering is strictly low stakes, with bets limited to a $5 maximum, soofficials are counting on the opulent riverboats themselves to provide much ofthe attraction.;    Hundreds of riverboats plied the Mississippi and otherMidwest rivers in the 19th century and were the focus of many songs, storiesand legends.;    &quot;It's going to give a little more dazzle to the area,&quot; saidLarry Reed, executive vice president of the Davenport Chamber of Commerce.&quot;It's going to tell the world we're not all hicks in bib overalls that growcorn and pigs.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Bettendorf, Iowa  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910401  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  357  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday April 1, 199100092008,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
