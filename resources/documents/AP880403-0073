Republican Pat Robertson, whose candidacy is all but derailed byVice President George Bush's march to the nomination, said he has amandate from God and won't stop until he is president of the UnitedStates.   Saying he would run again in 1992, Robertson told about 3,000people at Denver's Happy Church that ``I am not going to quit ...That is His plan for me and for this nation.''   But with Bush's nomination virtually assured, the 1988 focus isnow on the Democrats.   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, who has staked hopes ofreviving his trailing campaign with a good showing in Wisconsin onTuesday, picked up the endorsement this weekend of the MilwaukeeJournal.   The newspaper cited Gore's ``impressive record'' in armscontrol, military reform and environmental protection, cand calledhim ``one of Congress' best informed members on the future ofscience and technology.''   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who shares frontrunnerstatus with Jesse Jackson, was asked by reporters outside aMilwaukee church if he shared the view of some Democrats thatJackson is not electable because he his black and too liberal.   ``I don't think there is any way of knowing,'' Dukakis said.   Democratic Party Chairman Paul Kirk also sidestepped thatquestion Sunday when interviewed on ABC-TV's ``This Week With DavidBrinkley'' program.   ``We haven't nominated anyone yet,'' he said. ``The DemocraticParty will do its best to nominate, I hope, the most electablecandidate in order to win in November.''   Jackson on Sunday showed no concern about reports ofconsternation among Democrats over his recent momentum.   Speaking to overflow crowds at two Denver churches, he continuedto hammer home the themes that have brought a burgeoning responseto his campaign.   At the First Baptist Church, where 1,500 people jammed insideand at least as many listened to him on loudspeakers outside,Jackson said:   ``I sense as I travel around the nation something is going on.There are several thousand people outdoors _ something is going on.   ``From Aspen to Alabama _ something is going on ... Hope hasbeen unleased.''   Later, in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood, people linedthe street for a block to see Jackson arrive at Our Lady ofGuadalupe Catholic church.   Jackson's success in the primaries and caucuses _ including avictory over Dukakis in the Virgin Islands on Saturday _ hascreated a sticky issue for Democrats bent on picking a nominee whocan secure the White House.   His campaign chairman, California Assembly Speaker Willie Brownsaid Sunday that the margin of Jackson's successes has surprisedeven him. But he said that even if Jackson gets the most delegatesby the end of the primary season, that doesn't mean he should getthe nomination.   ``You can have a plurality of the delegates and still not beable to reach the 2,082 required to secure the nomination,'' Brownsaid on ``This Week With David Brinkley.''   ``I only believe he's entitled to the nomination if we succeedin producing the appropriate number of delgates that GeorgeMcGovern got, that Fritz Mondale got, or that Jimmy Carter got,''Brown said.   But Brown also raised the possibility of the Jackson forcesinstigating a rules fight at the convention this summer if thedelegate race does not play out as they think it fairly should.   Jackson himself downplayed the possibility it would come to that.   ``We're certainly going to stand for fairness, but I hope itwon't come to a fight. I think that most Demcrats are going tostand for that which is fair and that which is right,'' he said ashe campaigned in Colorado.   It appears unlikely any Democrat will have enough delegates inhand to secure the nomination at the end of the primary season inJune. The nomination thus will lie in the hands of the so-calledsuper delegates, who are automatically delegates by virtue of theirposition as party leaders or elected officials.   Dukakis so far has won 653.5 delegates to Jackson's 646.5 andGore's 381.8, according to The Associated Press tally.   Democratic leader Kirk on Sunday appeared to moderate hissuggestion that his party should rally behind whoever is thefrontrunner at the end of the primary season.   Kirk said that a candidate who emerges with the most delegates,but shy of the needed 2,082, should not automatically get theparty's nod.   ``That's not what the rules say. The rules say that the personwho attains a majority of delegates will be the party's nominee,''he said.   He said that when he earlier had talked about getting partyleaders together to solidify support for a frontrunner, he meantthat if anyone gained ``a very very substantial plurality ofdelegates and someone has the nomination within virtually withinhis grasp, that the party ought to sit down'' and talk aboutgetting behind that person.   Under questioning, he refused to say what would consistute asubstantial plurality.   Spokeswoman Julie Anbender later said Kirk's views on the matterhave not changed.   ``Kirk has not altered his position about rallying behind theclear-cut frontrunner. He continues to believe that at the end ofthe process, one of our candidates will clearly emerge from thepack and Kirk will at that point encourage the party to rallybehind its inevitable nominee,'' she said.   Brown noted that the Jackson campaign is actively seeking outsupport among the superdelegates and the uncommitted delegates,particularly members of Congress who represent districts whereJackson has run strongly.   As if the Jackson forces would, as they did at the 1984convention, challenge any rules on how delegates are selectedshould Jackson fail to bring many uncommitted delegates on board,Brown said.   ``I think if the rules need to be challenged we will do so.''   Jackson previously has said he has no plans to raise ruleschallenges at the summer convention in Atlanta. But he has alsosaid he expects the party to treat him fairly.</TEXT></DOC>
