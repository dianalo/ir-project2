Soviet diplomat Gennady Tarasov, who later flew to Syria,described the talks with Christian commander Gen. Michel Aoun as``useful.'' An Aoun spokesman characterized the talks as positive.   Also Friday, French radio said vessels from the U.S. 6th Fleetwere anchored 50 miles off Lebanon, and that a Soviet missilelauncher was heading toward the Mediterranean to join other shipsalready there.   The Soviet government denied the report.   At the Pentagon, Cmdr. Mel Sunden said it was likely the Iowa andanother 6th Fleet vessel, the Coral Sea, both were in the easternMediterranean Friday. But he said the U.S. activity was routine andthe nations were not combining forces.   Police said at least three people were killed and eight woundedin clashes in Beirut Friday, in which Syrian gunners also launchedscores of rockets and mortar rounds at a 28-mile coastal stretch inthe Christian heartland.   The new casualities brought the overall toll to 794 people killedand 2,222 wounded since fighting broke out March 8 between Christianforces and Moslem-allied Syrian troops.   The Syrians, who have 40,000 troops in Lebanon, control all landexits from the Christian enclave and shell the coastline regularlyto prevent resupplies from reaching Christian units of commanderGen. Michel Aoun.   The Soviet envoy crossed Beirut's dividing Green Line forseparate meetings Friday with the Maronite Catholic patriarch,Nasrallah Sfeir, north of Beirut, then with Aoun, in the bunker ofthe devastated Presidential Palace in suburban Baabda.   On arrival for the meeting with Aoun, Tarasov, who heads theMiddle East department at the Foreign Ministry, had to abandon hiscar 500 yards from the palace and walk up a driveway blanketed withdebris and glass shards.   Aoun has been living in the heavily fortified bunker under thetwo-story palace for five months while Syrian gunners shell thecompound daily.   Talking to reporters after his two-hour session at Baabda,Tarasov said: ``We have just completed a useful exchange on thesituation in Lebanon.''   The Soviet government, he told reporters, was ``deeply concernedabout the suffering of the Lebanese people, the loss of human lifeand the material damage.''   ``Of course we view his proposals positively,'' an aide to Aounsaid, refusing to give details.   Tarasov earlier met in west Beirut with acting Prime MinisterSalim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who heads a Syrian-backed Cabinetcompeting for legitimacy with Aoun's government. The Soviet envoylater left for Damascus.   Syria is the Soviet Union's chief Arab ally, although the twocountries often differ on Middle East politics. Tarasov's meetingwith Aoun defied Syria's rejection of Aoun as the voice ofChristians and a negotiating partner. Moscow had cautioned Damascusin 1976 against intervention in Lebanon. But Syria considers itseastern neighbor within its sphere of influence and vital to itssecurity.   Beirut sources said the Soviet proposal calls for ``stabilizingthe security situation by halting Syrian-Christian clashes.''   One source said it includes reviving the Arab committee onLebanon, which suspended its mediation effort last month, blamingSyria for the lack of progress.   Meanwhile, Sheik Sobhi Tofeili, a senior official in Hezbollah,or Party of God, said the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group was ``in astate of war with the French forces.''   A previously unknown group, calling itself the Organization forthe Defense of the Oppressed pledged to ``confront the flagrantFrench military intervention in the internal Lebanese affairs.''   The group, in a hand-written statement delivered to a Westernnews agency in Beirut, said its ``mujahideen (holy fighters) areready to carry out God's verdict in striking at Western interests,topped by French interests.''   France has said its six ships off Lebanon, led by the aircraftcarrier Foch with about 2,000 marines aboard, is on a``humanitarian'' mission to help evacuate the estimated 7,000 Frenchnationals living in Lebanon if the situation deteriorates.   Moslem leaders accuse France, who governed France until 1943, offavoring Christians in the conflict and that the warships are postedto protect them.   Meanwhile, the Vatican said it was trying to arrange a visit byPope John Paul II to Lebanon soon, but that it could not yet set adate. Syria's Moslem allies already have accused the pope of biastoward the Christians.</TEXT></DOC>
