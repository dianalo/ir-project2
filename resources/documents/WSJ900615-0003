When current Chairman Stephen M. Wolf signed on inDecember 1987, UAL paid him $5.7 million to cover stockoptions he lost when he left Tiger International Inc., inaddition to his $575,000 annual salary at UAL. The companyalso paid him $35,000 in relocation fees and $8,000 for&quot;financial planning.&quot; Finally, Mr. Wolf received stockoptions for 250,000 UAL shares, now worth considerably morethan three years ago.</LP><TEXT>   Hertz Corp. Chairman Frank A. Olson, who preceded Mr.Wolf, received a $1 million bonus in addition to a $616,000salary for serving just six months as UAL's interim chairmanin 1987, as well as serving as chairman of Hertz, a unit ofUAL at the time.   But the sweetest deal of all is going to former ChryslerCorp. Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald, who stands to becomeUAL chairman if United's three unions succeed in taking overthe airline. Mr. Greenwald was paid a $5 million fee just tosign on last month with the union's buy-out effort.   If the buy-out succeeds, he will receive an annual salaryof $1.2 million for five years in addition to bonuses of $1.2million a year. The unions also agreed to give him theequivalent of a 1.5% stake in UAL. If the buy-out fails, Mr.Greenwald is guaranteed a $4 million fee, in addition to the$5 million he has already received, and a portion of his $1.2million salary.   The unions say they had to compensate Mr. Greenwald forbenefits, including stock options, he lost by leavingChrysler. But Mr. Greenwald appears to stand to gain far moreat UAL than he left behind at Chrysler, where he earned $1.1million last year. That's because the Chrysler stock optionshe has received over the past three years were at pricesabove the company's current share price.   &quot;It doesn't seem like he walked away from much atChrysler,&quot; said Mike Halloran, an executive compensationspecialist at Towers Perrin, a New York consulting firm.   Mr. Greenwald disputed that he was giving up substantiallyless at Chrysler than he was gaining at UAL. He said he andthe unions worked out a compensation plan that took intoconsideration what he earned over the past five years atChrysler and what he could &quot;reasonably expect to earn in thenext five years&quot; as the probable successor to Chairman Lee A.Iacocca. He added that any valuation of his stock options noware invalid because most of the options run for 10 years andno one can predict what the stock will be worth at a latertime.   UAL's unions agreed they took into account more than justthe compensation Mr. Greenwald was receiving from Chryslerbefore he left. His UAL package, one official said, reflects&quot;what he realistically was giving up over a five-yearperiod.&quot; As heir apparent to Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca,Mr. Greenwald was able to argue that his compensation waslikely to increase greatly at Chrysler over the next fiveyears.   Mr. Greenwald's retirement package at UAL is also reportedto be far better than his Chrysler plan. Mr. Greenwald willreportedly receive $750,000 a year after retiring from UAL.According to this year's Chrysler proxy, when the 54-year-oldexecutive left the auto maker, his accumulated pensionbenefits would have totaled about $250,000 a year. If he hadstayed on the job another five years, he would have received$500,000 a year in retirement.   Mr. Greenwald said that in devising the retirement plan,he took into consideration what his pension would be if heretired as late as age 65, not what it would be in fiveyears. He said he would also have been eligible for agenerous supplemental pension plan at Chrysler. However, hedeclined to estimate specifically what his pension would havebeen at the age of 65 if he had stayed at Chrysler.   Mr. Greenwald also lost three potential grants ofso-called performance shares when he left Chrysler. Theproxies don't disclose the size or value of those grants,which were to have been made through 1992. But based on areading of the compensation plan's intent, a Towers Perrinanalyst said &quot;it's unlikely&quot; the grants would have totaledmore than $1.5 million.</TEXT></DOC>
