But a guerrilla spokesman in Islamabad said the insurgents wouldkeep fighting in the 10-year war, rendering the truce meaningless.   ``All sections and divisions of the republic's military forceshave been given an order to observe a cease-fire from Jan. 1 inconditions in which the opposite side will refrain from directattack,'' the official Soviet news agency Tass quoted Najib assaying on Afghan television.   Afghan government radio said Moslem insurgents will be given fourdays to accept the truce. If they refuse, government troops willstart shooting again, said Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad.   The truce was dismissed by Masood Khalili, a spokesman for theJamiat-e-Islami guerrilla group. Its leader, Burhanuddin Rabbani,met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov in SaudiArabia last month.   ``We did not start our fight because he asked us to, and we won'tstop because he asked us to,'' Khalili said. ``He won't have anycease-fire because mujahedeen (holy warriors) won't stop fighting.''   Soviet troops marched into Afghanistan in December 1979 to helpthe communist government fight the guerrillas.   In April, Moscow signed a U.N.-brokered accord providing for thewithdrawal of more than 100,000 Red Army soldiers by Feb. 15, 1989.Half had left by Aug. 15.   Soviet officials say the withdrawal was halted because ofcontinuing U.S. and Pakistani aid to the guerrillas.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a speech to the UnitedNations on Dec. 7, proposed that a cease-fire begin in Afghanistanon Jan. 1 and that all military supplies be cut off.   The seven-party Afghan guerrilla alliance headquartered inPakistan rejected the cease-fire.   Najib also declared a cease-fire that began Jan. 15, 1988, butthe insurgents ignored it and the fighting continued.   Khalili said the fighting won't stop until Najib and his rulingMarxist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan leave Kabul.   Vorontsov also has met former Afghan King Zaher Shah in Italy todiscuss a plan for convening a council of 50 to 60 politicians orprominent public figures to create a new government.   Khalili said Moscow has escalated the fighting inside Afghanistanwithin the past two weeks. He said the Panjshir Valley commanderAhmad Shah Masoud reported civilian casualties were heavy afterbombing raids in the northern Takhar provincial capital of Taloqan.   There also were indications the guerrillas planned to step uptheir offensive.   Leaders of the Pakistan-based Afghan guerrilla alliance leftTehran on Friday after apparently working out a joint strategy withIranian-backed rivals aimed at toppling the Kabul regime andinstalling an Islamic government, Iran's official Islamic RepublicNews Agency said.   IRNA, monitored in Cyprus, said the Pakistan-based guerrillas,led by Rabbani, were seen off at Tehran's Mehrabad airport byMohammad Karim Khalili, a leader of the Iran-based coalition.   The two guerrilla groups declared Tuesday, the ninth anniversaryof the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, that they will not accept anycease-fire until all the Soviets have left and Najib's governmenthas been toppled.   The eight-party Iran-based group is Shiite Moslem, like mostIranians; and the Pakistan-based alliance is Sunni Moslem. Shiitesmake up about 20 percent of Afghanistan's 13 million people.   In the past, the radical Shiite factions have largely operatedseparately from the Pakistan-based groups and taken a more extremistIslamic position about the role of religion in any future Afghangovernment.   The Iranians, who are improving relations with the Soviets afteryears of strain, have been trying to reconcile the two guerrillacoalitions in the hope of producing an Afghan government dominatedby the Moslem insurgents.   The Soviet withdrawal has been hampered by unremitting attacks bythe estimated 200,000 Mujahedeen.   The 50,000-60,000 Soviet troops still in Afghanistan are believedto be concentrated in two evacuation corridors in the east and westwhile the guerrillas battle against the increasingly demoralizedAfghan army in worsening winter conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
