Furnace Sorbent Injection (FSI) is an emerging technologypredicted on the ability of calcium-based sorbents to scavenge sulfurfrom flue gas. This study is a theoretical and experimental effort thatdelineates some of the causal relationships involved in the complex sulfationprocess. A model is proposed which accounts for time-varying structuralchanges within the sorbent particle as a result of simultaneous calcination,sintering, and sulfation. Macroscopic properties of porosity, specificsurface area, and conversion are obtained by following the evolutionof the pore size distribution using the method of moments. Kinetic parametersfor the calcination, sintering, and sulfation processes were evaluatedusing experimental data obtained with a high-temperature entrained-flowreactor system. These values were then introduced into the model forverification using extensive parametric experimental testing. Data acquiredin this study and in other investigations show excellent agreement withthe mathematical model predictions.</TEXT></DOC>
