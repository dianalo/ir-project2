Next, the construction of the Alberta-CaliforniaPipeline Project is described. This was the first large internationalgas pipeline that opened the way for U.S. -Canadian natural gas tradeand it remains a vital element in the planning of future Canadian frontier,as well as Alaskan, gas resources. Thereafter, the effects of PGandE'sgas market of the U.S. natural gas shortage experienced during the late1970s and the role of Canadian gas in mitigating these effects is discussed.Canada has proven itself to be a reliable supply source. The energy priceshock and the regulation of the Canadian border price is then reviewed,focusing on the U.S. regulatory response and the cumulative effects ofthis interaction on PGandE's Canadian gas purchase contracts and purchasingpolicies. The market response and actions the Canadian government andgas producers took to remain competitive in the declining and increasinglyprice sensitive market in the U.S. are then outlined. Finally, it isconcluded that Canadian, as well as U.S. natural gas suppliers must remaincompetitive if they are going to retain their position in the marketplace-- at least in the California markets served by PGandE.</TEXT></DOC>
