Ms. Bhutto, who campaigned for a decade to free Pakistan frommilitary rule, has been forced to call out the army in Sindh, hernative province in southern Pakistan.   No one knows who is killing whom. Private armies, drug gangs andethnic militias operate at will. Kidnappings, indiscriminateshootings and armed robbery are commonplace.   Police have arrested more than 3,300 people in a weeklong sweepof Sindh province, the heart of the country's financial andindustrial base.   Critics and supporters agree a lasting solution depends on Ms.Bhutto's ability to make peace with an ethnic political movementthat nearly brought down her government last year by withdrawingits support.   ``Her long years of trials ... have conditioned her to thinkinvariably in terms of `them' and `us,''' a government officialsaid on condition of anonymity.   ``She has to stop playing party politics. She has to stop actingmerely as the leader of the Pakistan People's Party and start beingthe prime minister of Pakistan. If she can't, she'll be lucky tolast six months.''   If Ms. Bhutto fails, observers say, more than her 18-month-oldcivilian government will be in danger.   Pakistan has spent more than half its 43 years under militaryrule and concern is growing that the army will feel it necessary totake over again.   At center stage in the bloody drama are the Mohajirs, MoslemIndians who moved into Pakistan during the 1947 partition thatended British colonial rule of the subcontinent and made twonations.   Most of the Mohajirs settled in Karachi and Hyderabad, the twolargest cities of Sindh province. They were poor and landless, butwell-educated, and soon got the best jobs.   Although they make up only 6 percent of Sindh's 20 millionpeople, they dominate the cities and control the labor unions ofthe highly industrialized region.   Native Sindhis were increasingly shut out politically andeconomically, and their resentment led to street fighting.   Violence increased in the early 1980s because of the``Kalashnikov and heroin culture,'' a reference to the automaticrifles that entered the country during the war in Afghanistan andthe growth of the drug trade.   On May 27, now called ``Black Sunday,'' police tried to flushout Mohajir militants holed up in the old walled section ofHyderabad. The operation turned into a bloodbath that cost 180lives and set off a five-day wave of terror in Karachi that tooknearly 200 more.   Ms. Bhutto faced accusations from all quarters that she had donetoo little to stop the bloodshed, and called out the army.   Military officers agreed to arrest the troublemakers and seizetheir weapons regardless of ethnic or political affiliations. Theyinsisted there be no interference from the provincial government,which is led by the prime minister's party.   Sources said the army also was pressing for military, notcivilian, courts to decide punishment.   In 1958 and 1977, the military justified coups on groundspoliticians were corrupt and more interested in outmaneuvering eachother than serving Pakistan.   Most observers agree a coup against Ms. Bhutto is unlikely.Since taking office in December 1988, she has built good relationswith the army and its chief of staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg.   Many officers also believe ruling the country corrupted the armyand led to the involvement of some officers in the narcotics trade.   ``People are asking me, `Why doesn't the army take over and saveus from slaughter?' But I say that is the job of the presentgovernment,'' Beg said. ``We can control the situation in threedays, but that may not be a lasting solution. Martial law is not apermanent solution.''   If the violence does not abate in a few months, however, manyfear the army will have no choice.   ``Even talking about martial law, given the abysmal track recordof military rule in Pakistan, is a poor reflection of thedisappointing performance of Ms. Bhutto's party, a disappointmentthat seems to have shaken the confidence of even its most ardentsupporters,'' said political analyst Mushahid Hussain.   Ms. Bhutto and the Pakistan People's Party blame the currentviolence on the Mohajir Qami Movement, a small party that formerlysupported her government.   Its leaders said her party treated them shabbily during the10-month alliance and withdrew support last November, forcing ano-confidence vote in Parliament that Ms. Bhutto barely defeated.   Analysts, critics and supporters agree an understanding betweenMs. Bhutto and the Mohajir Qami is the only way to resolve thecrisis.   That does not appear likely for the moment. The Mohajir Qami,which is believed to have armed up to 30,000 members and sent themunderground, has shown no desire to talk.</TEXT></DOC>
