Stevens and Andy Pasztor   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/20/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C8</SO><CO>   GQ WNEWS</CO><IN>AEROSPACE (ARO)</IN><LP>   John O'Brien resigned unexpectedly as chairman, chiefexecutive officer and president of Grumman Corp.   The Bethpage, N.Y., aerospace concern said Mr. O'Brien, 60years old, resigned for personal reasons. The company namedRenso Caporali to succeed him while it &quot;considers candidatesfor these positions from both inside and outside thecompany.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Caporali had been vice chairman, technology, in chargeof the office of corporate technology; he was responsible forresearch, development, engineering and advanced systemsfunctions.   Grumman's announcement included no comment on Mr.O'Brien's record as the company's top executive, leaving theimpression that the departure was on less than cordial terms.The announcement followed Grumman's monthly board meetingyesterday.   Mr. O'Brien, who joined the company in the mid-1950s, wasnamed chairman two years ago. He was selected as presidentand chief operating officer in 1986 and as chief executive inearly 1988.   His resignation comes as the company is struggling to copewith the impact of Pentagon spending cuts. Last month,Grumman announced it would offer early retirement incentivesto 6,000 employees, or 21% of its work force, to cut costs.Acceptance of the offer by half the eligible employees wouldsave $100 million, the company said.   Jerry Cantwell, a securities analyst at Wertheim andamp; Co.,New York, speculated that Mr. O'Brien's sudden departure maybe a bad omen. &quot;The implication is clearly that there is somedamaging news coming,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm really sad to see thishappen. I think he was doing a really terrific job with thecompany.&quot; Mr. Cantwell's recommendation on Grumman stockremains neutral, he said.   Senior Defense Department officials also didn't have anyadvance warning of the resignation, which prompted a flurryof speculation inside the Pentagon.   Grumman had surfaced in two federal criminalinvestigations into possible Pentagon procurement fraud andillegal document-swapping, but none of the company's topofficials have been identified as targets of those inquiries.   In March, the company pleaded guilty to illegally usingPentagon budget documents and paid $2.5 million in fines andpenalties. Also this year, a former Grumman aide pleadedguilty to fraud-related charges stemming from his dealingswith a Long Island, N.Y., political action committee underinvestigation for allegedly funneling illegal campaigncontributions to lawmakers. A federal grand jury in New Yorkcontinues to investigate Grumman's involvement with thatcommittee.   Grumman's sales have been sluggish in recent years,totaling between $3.38 billion and $3.65 billion annually inthe past four years, including $3.56 billion in 1989. Netincome in 1989 was $67.3 million, or $1.91 a share, down from$86.5 million, or $2.50 a share, a year earlier. At year-endits backlog totaled $6.89 billion, down from $7.25 billion ayear earlier.   In May, Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its ratingson $525 million of Grumman debt and preferred, citingunfavorable conditions in the defense industry and highdebt-service costs. Interest expense totaled $105 millionlast year, up from $84.9 million a year earlier and $59million in 1987.   Mr. Caporali, 56, joined Grumman in 1959 as a structuralflight test engineer, and from 1968 through 1973 he heldvarious positions in the F-14 aircraft program; he waselected a vice president in 1980 and was named vice chairmanof corporate technology in mid-1988. He holds two mastersdegrees and a doctorate in aeronautical engineering fromPrinceton University.   Grumman's announcement said that Mr. Caporali, speakingfor the board, intends to continue restructuring the companyinto a &quot;more efficient and cost-competitive form&quot; whilecontinuing to &quot;develop the technologies that make sense forour rapidly changing markets.&quot;   Grumman said Mr. O'Brien resigned from the board &quot;but willbe available to help achieve an orderly transition.&quot;   Besides the abruptness of Mr. O'Brien's departure,Wertheim's Mr. Cantwell said Grumman's handling of the matterleaves him with the impression that there was some trouble.Grumman's investor relations staff, he said, which is&quot;normally pretty cooperative,&quot; was anything but thatconcerning the resignation. &quot;All they'll do now is read thepress release,&quot; he said.   Other analysts also praised Mr. O'Brien's performance aschairman.   Weyman B. Jones, Grumman's vice president of publicaffairs, said &quot;there's no limitation on&quot; Mr. Caporali'stenure as chairman, even though the board will be consideringother candidates for the top job. He added that Mr. Caporali&quot;is obviously an inside candidate&quot; to fill the positions.</TEXT></DOC>
