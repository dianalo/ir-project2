After all, the foot's onthe other neck now.;   What's most revealing, however, is the lack of sympathyfrom people who used to be part of the team -- a fairly long list after theoff-season's Plan B atrocities.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  49ERS LOSING HEAD GAMES  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     It's not just reporters who think the organization is paranoid, it's former49ers. &quot;Paranoid&quot; isn't my word, it's theirs.;   What that means is that the49ers' executives, coaches and players keep worrying about the wrong thingsand making the wrong decisions. The franchise's state of anxiety has becomeits signature, its trademark, and it has been communicated from top to bottom,overwhelming and defeating the team more powerfully than any opponent.;  Former 49ers guard Randy Cross, the CBS analyst whose bluntness was soimpressive during Sunday's 49ers telecast, pointed Monday to the perceptiblestrain on quarterback Steve Young.;   &quot;If there was one thing on offense you'dtry to improve,&quot; Cross said, &quot;it would be Steve Young not feeling like he hasto win the game and do everything himself. I get the feeling he feels theweight of the world on his shoulders.&quot;;   SOME problems just aren'tcorrectable at this stage of the season. For example, the 49ers have beendevoid of a meaningful running threat for quite a while, but as one formerinsider put it, &quot;they've been collecting defensive linemen as if they don'twant anybody else to have any.&quot;;   They could have fixed that by trading forDenver's Bobby Humphrey, but they didn't. Some critics believe there wouldn'teven be a problem if the 49ers had kept Roger Craig, but given his14-yards-and-another-big-fumble performance for the Raiders on Sunday, that'sprobably an unfair shot. It just feels like the 49ers deserve it, anyway.;  The defensive backfield may be the biggest weakness of all, and Ronnie Lott'sname wouldn't keep coming up if the 49ers had any good choices right now.;  So, what can the 49ers do?;   First and foremost, they can collect themselvesemotionally and mentally and concentrate on bolstering one another's spirits,on rallying to the support of Young, and on making sure they salvage as muchof the season as possible instead of letting it turn into a long, corrosiveslide.;   SECOND, they need a leader who can establish the right attitude onthe field and in the locker room. Its absence so far has been more conspicuousthan blown coverages.;   &quot;That's an intangible,&quot; Cross said. &quot;Sometimes you'vegot it and sometimes you don't. But it's up to the players -- it's not thecoaches' responsibility. The coaches are not in charge of that. There havebeen players who have taken it upon themselves.&quot;;   It doesn't usually comefrom a wide receiver, but I nominate Jerry Rice, one of the non-talkers in thewake of Sunday's loss. If he wants more stature as a personality, if he wantsmore recognition from the media and Madison Avenue, the ideal opportunity haspresented itself.;   He spoke up about the need to throw the ball deep afterthe loss to the New York Giants, and that helped. He's arguably the bestreceiver in NFL history, and he could be a voice of authority as well as aleader by example.;   He also could take the burden of explaining each gameoff Young, who then won't have to apologize constantly for not being perfect.;  Every crisis provides a cue for greatness. It's always fascinating to seewho responds, if anyone.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mike Antonucci column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911015  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  596  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, October 15, 199100289104,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
