Bush's statement followed scattered reports that some Sandamp;Ldepositors had withdrawn their money after hearing news accountsthat the Bush administration is considering imposing a 25-cent feeon every $100 in federally insured accounts in federally insuredthrifts, banks and credit unions.   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House BankingCommittee, said in a statement, ``In checking with regulators, ...my staff was told that savings and loans are receiving a heavy runof calls from depositors who are confused and concerned about thereports of a new tax on their deposits. In some areas there havebeen higher than expected withdrawals of funds.''   At the news conference, Bush sidestepped questions about whetherhe will propose the deposit insurance fee, an idea floated by theTreasury Department.   Bush stressed that a deposit fee is only one option beingexamined, not a formal proposal, and has not yet reached his desk.But he declined to rule it out.   ``There seems to be some controversy around it, but that doesn'tmean that any thinking along those lines should cease,'' thepresident said.   Asked whether the fee would violate his ``no new taxes'' pledge,Bush said, ``I've been around for a long time. I don't rememberhearing people talk about the fee that went into the FDIC or FSLIC(deposit insurance funds) as a tax.''   Meanwhile, the agency regulating Sandamp;Ls, the Federal Home Loan BankBoard, surveyed thrift institutions Thursday night and found,according to spokesman Karl Hoyle, ``no outflows of any significancethat we can attribute to anything that's been said.''   M. Danny Wall, bank board chairman, said in an interview Thursdaythat although no institutions are in trouble as a result of nervousdepositors, ``There have been cases where they say, `I don't likewhat I heard on TV; I'm taking my money out.'''   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House BankingCommittee and frequent critic of the bank board, said, ``There is nodoubt that Congress and the administration will insure everydepositor up to $100,000 no matter what else happens. I don't knowof a single congressman or senator or regulator who has evenentertained the notion of not backing the insured deposits 100percent.''   The bank board reported earlier this month that a record $7billion in net withdrawals were made from savings and loan accountsin November, the seventh consecutive month of deposit drains.   However, it said this is a normal development during a period ofrising interest rates and not necessarily attributable to customers'concerns over the safety of their money. When interest rates rise,money flows out of Sandamp;L and bank accounts because yields on uninsuredinvestments, such as money market mutual funds, typically risefaster.   The Treasury Department is due to present a proposal to Bush onSandamp;Ls next week and department officials have been briefing membersof Congress on some of the options under consideration in additionto a deposit fee.   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., a senior member of the bankingcommittee, said Treasury is talking about borrowing about $45billion, roughly the amount needed over and above the $38 billioncommitted last year, and is examining the full range of options forhow to pay it off.   The laundry list includes using interest on Federal Reserve fundsthat is now paid into the general fund, or tapping the retainedearnings of the industry-owned regional Federal Home Loan Banks.   Options in the reform package that will accompany any new moneyinclude an administrative merger of the fund that insures commercialbanks with the Sandamp;L fund, as well as additional control by federalregulators over risky activities undertaken by state-chartered Sandamp;Ls,Parris said.</TEXT></DOC>
