The case of Freedom National, a minority-owned bank in NewYork City, has emerged as a symbol of regulatory inequitybecause it highlights that depositors in small banks oftenget less protection than those in big banks.</LP><TEXT>   When large banks fail and threaten to set off financialshockwaves, the FDIC protects all deposits, including thosethat exceed the federal insurance limit of $100,000 andaccounts in foreign branches outside the umbrella of federalinsurance. But when small banks fail, the agency often paysdepositors only up to the $100,000 maximum, althoughdepositors with larger accounts may get additional paymentslater.   Freedom National's failure cost several dozen churches andnonprofit organizations, such as the National Urban League,millions of dollars in unreimbursed deposits. After a lengthyreview, the FDIC's board concluded that the agency actedcorrectly under current law. FDIC Chairman William Seidmansaid, &quot;As unfair as that decision might seem, . . . the FDICcan only administer the laws, not make the laws.&quot;   The agency said it's prepared &quot;to work with Congress tocorrect apparent inequities regarding large and small bankfailures.&quot; Such efforts will certainly be part of a broadattempt to restructure the nation's deposit-insurance systemthis year.   In addition, the agency said it's trying to determinewhether certain uninsured deposits, especially those ofcharities, could be fully protected under the law if theyqualify as charitable trusts.</TEXT></DOC>
