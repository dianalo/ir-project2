Determination To Issue an Interim Regulation  </ITAG><T3>FAC 84-46, Item I. </T3>A determination has been made under the authorityof the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of General Services, andthe Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationto issue the regulation in FAC 84-46, Item I, as an interim regulation.This action is necessary in order to implement section 2443 of the MultilateralExport Control Enhancement Amendments Act (Pub. L. 100-418), enacted August23, 1988, and Executive Order 12661, dated December 27, 1988. However,pursuant to Pub. L. 98-577 and FAR 1.501, public comments received in responseto this interim rule will be considered in formulating a final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Background  </ITAG><T3>FAC 84-46, Item I. </T3>The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) hasbeen revised by adding new Subpart 25.10, Sanctions for Violations of ExportControls, and related coverage in Part 52, Solicitation Provisions andContract Clauses. This revision is necessary in order to implement theprocurement and contracting provisions of section 2443 of the MultilateralExport Control Enhancement Amendments Act (Pub. L. 100-418), and ExecutiveOrder 12661, dated December 27, 1988. <T3>FAC 84-46, Item II. </T3>This final rule is issued by the Departmentof Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration to make revisions to the debarment and suspensionprocedures in the FAR. Among other things, the revisions require a certificationof eligibility prior to contract award, render contractors ineligible foraward Governmentwide upon issuance of a notice of proposed debarment, andestablish the policy that contractors must make compelling reason determinationsprior to awarding subcontracts to contractors debarred, suspended, or proposedfor debarment. <ITAG tagnum="84">C. Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG><T3>FAC 84-46, Item I. </T3>On December 27, 1988, the President signedExecutive Order 12661 imposing the sanctions referred to in section 2443of the Multilateral Export Control Enhancement Amendments Act (Pub. L.100-418). This interim rule implements these provisions in the FederalAcquisition Regulation. This interim rule may have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. The actual impact isnot known. Current guidance requires that a regulatory flexibility analysisbe prepared if the interim rule will have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Accordingly, an Initial Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis has been prepared in accordance with the Regulatory FlexibilityAct of 1980, Pub. L. 96-354 is on file in the FAR Secretariat and willbe submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration.Publication as an interim rule will afford the public the opportunity tocomment on its economic impact on small entities, and such comments willbe considered in the formulation of the final regulatory flexibility analysisand the final rule. Comments must be submitted separately and cite 89-610pertaining to Item I of FAC 84-46. <T3>FAC 84-46, Item II. </T3>The proposed rule published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 31, 1987 (52 FR 28642) contained an InitialRegulatory Flexibility Analysis. A Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas been prepared and is on file in the FAR Secretariat. The Final Analysiswill be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration.<T3>FAC 84-46, Item III. </T3>A full, final regulatory impact and regulatoryflexibility analysis was prepared by the Department of Labor (DOL) anda summary was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 27, 1983 (48 FR 49758) when DOL publishedits regulation. The revision to FAR 22.10 is an implementation of the policyand the regulation published by DOL and other agencies. DOD, GSA, and NASAcertify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because it merely codifies inthe FAR (48 CFR), for the convenience of contractors and Government contractingpersonnel, regulations issued by DOL and codified in 29 CFR for which commentswere requested and considered. <ITAG tagnum="84">D. Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG><T3>FAC 84-46, Item I. </T3>The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96-511)does not apply because this interim rule does not impose any reportingor recordkeeping requirements or collection of information from offerors,contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of OMBunder 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. <T3>FAC 84-46, Item II. </T3>The information collection requirements containedin this FAR revision were approved by the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 9000-0094. Due to the reductionin the paperwork burdens resulting from the change in the requirementswith, respect to subcontracting, a revised Paperwork Reduction Act Analysishas been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for expeditedreview pursuant to 5 CFR 1320.18. The Annual Reporting Burden is estimatedas follows: Prime Contracts_respondents, 414,767; responses per respondent,3; total annual responses, 1,244,301; hours per response, 5 mins.; andtotal response burden hours, 103,692. Subcontracts_respondents, 500; responsesper respondent, 1; total annual responses, 500; hours per response, .50;and total response burden hours, 250. Public comments concerning this requestshould be submitted to OMB, Ms. Eyvette Flynn, FAR Desk Officer, Room 3235,NEOB, Washington, DC 20503 by May 30, 1989.<T3>FAC 84-46, Item III. </T3>The information collection requirements containedin this regulation were approved by the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) and have been assigned OMB Control Numbers 1215-0017 and 1215-0150.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Public Comments </ITAG><T3>FAC 84-46, Item II. </T3>On July 31, 1987, a proposed rule was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 28642). Thirty-nine responses were received.Thirteen of these respondents either concurred or recommended no change.Four other respondents indicated no comment. The comments of the remainingrespondents were considered by the Councils in developing the final rule.In addition, the Councils considered the recent initiatives regarding self-governancein developing the final rule. As a result of the public comments, the rulenow limits certification to prime contractors and requires prime contractorsto make compelling reason determinations and so notify the contractingofficer prior to entering into a subcontract with a contractor that hasbeen debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment. In addition, administrativechanges to Subparts 9.1 and 9.4 have been made to reflect a change in thename of what was formerly designated as the Consolidated List, and to providethe public with information for obtaining a copy of the list. <T3>FAC 84-46, Item III. </T3>On February 26, 1988, a proposed rule andnotice of availability was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 5928).

Within 30 days of receipt of the request,the Wage and Hour Division will (1) approve, modify, or disapprove therequest when the parties are in agreement or (2) render a final determinationin the event of disagreement among the parties. If the Wage and Hour Divisionwill require more than 30 days to take action, it will notify the contractingofficer within 30 days of receipt of the request that additional time isnecessary.
