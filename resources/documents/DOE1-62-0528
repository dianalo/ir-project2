This result is reproduced bya 2-D MHD model of the SOL where particle sources coming from neutrals,which are released from the limiter, are essential. By using the profilemeasurements, a particle flux balance can be calculated for radial diffusion,toroidal flow and recycling of neutrals which confirms the picture.</TEXT></DOC>
