Consumers have been snapping up the cars as bargain-pricedalternatives to expensive new models. But yesterday morning,Ford Motor Co., citing &quot;growing concern&quot; about all thelow-mileage, four-month-old cars flooding onto dealer lots,said that starting with cars built after April 30 it willrequire rental car agencies to keep their Ford cars for atleast six months or 15,000 miles.</LP><TEXT>   In response to Ford's announcement, a General Motors Corp.spokesman said the No. 1 auto maker also plans to require itsrental car agency customers to hold GM cars longer.Currently, rental car companies can sell cars back to GMafter as little as four months. The spokesman didn't say howlong GM will make its rental car customers keep cars, butdealers said they expect a strategy similar to Ford's.   For consumers, the moves will mean fewer sweet deals onlightly used former rental cars. Shoppers will still be ableto find cars that are less than a year old on dealer lots.But there will probably be fewer of them, and they will havemore wear and tear.   The moves also indicate that one of the auto makers' majormarket-building strategies is backfiring and posing a threatto their new car marketing and pricing. Last year, the BigThree, and some Japanese auto makers, pushed a million carsand trucks into rental car agency fleets, largely as a way tomaintain market share and keep factories running profitablyin a soft market. Over the past four years, to guaranteetheir markets, GM acquired stakes in Avis Inc. and NationalCar Rental System Inc.; Ford took financial positions inHertz Corp. and Budget Rent A Car Corp.; Chrysler Corp.acquired Thrifty Rent A Car System Inc., Snappy Rental Inc.and Dollar Rent A Car Systems Inc.; and Mitsubishi MotorsCorp. bought Value Rent A Car Inc.   But as the economy faltered late last year, rental carcompanies began taking advantage of promises by GM and Fordto repurchase 100% of their rental cars within four months.The result: Thousands of 1990 and 1991-model cars floodedinto auto auctions, and then on to dealer lots. Many hadfewer than 15,000 miles on their odometers.   For consumers, this meant a bonanza of bargain-pricedcars. Many dealers cut orders of new cars from the factoryand bought nearly new cars instead because selling a formerrental car usually yielded more profit than selling ahigher-priced new car.   What's more, nearly new cars made a mockery of new carpricing. At Fort Wayne Lincoln-Mercury in Fort Wayne, Ind.,for example, general sales manager Richard Franke can offershoppers a 1991 Mercury Grand Marquis with 8,500 miles on theodometer and a full array of features for $16,900 -- $4,600less than the price of the same model new. On the same lot,Mr. Franke has a 1991 Lincoln Town Car with just 15,000 milesof use listed for about $23,000. The new model lists for$32,500.   &quot;Many people, regardless of their financial situation, arebuying these cars because they see it's a very good bargain,&quot;Mr. Franke says. Sales of nearly new cars account for 35% to40% of the dealership's business, he adds.   But Ford executives and some dealers see the situationdifferently. &quot;We saw this trend toward {rental} cars notstaying in service much beyond four months,&quot; says Robert L.Rewey, Ford's vice president for sales operations. &quot;The lessmileage and the newer the car is, the more susceptible itmight be to substitute for a new car&quot; sale.   Mr. Rewey says Ford figures that 25% to 33% of nearly newcars sold to consumers represent lost new car sales. At GM,internal studies indicate that up to 40% of the buyers ofnearly new cars would have bought a new car otherwise.   Ford and GM probably won't be alone in trying to curtailthe nearly new car market. Mitsubishi Motors officials saythey cut back sharply on sales to rental fleets in the firstquarter, in part to protect their new car sales later in theyear. A Chrysler spokesman declined to say whether thecompany would change its policy, which also requires rentalcar companies to keep its cars for only four months.   It isn't clear how much of a dent car makers will put inthe nearly new car market, which is expected to hit 1.4million vehicles this year. &quot;Sure, they're looking at ways tokeep volumes down,&quot; says Bob McDevitt, vice president forsales and marketing at Anglo American Auto Auctions, a majorreseller of former rental cars. But car makers could stillexpand the number of cars sold to rental fleets if consumerdemand remains soft, he says.   Some dealers are hailing the Ford move. &quot;It's the firstintelligent step I've seen from any of the manufacturers,&quot;says Fred Ricart, owner of Ricart Ford, a high-volumedealership in Columbus, Ohio. Mr. Ricart sells nearly newcars. But he says he's curtailing that side of his business.   &quot;It'll ruin a dealership,&quot; Mr. Ricart says. Given a choicebetween selling a nearly new car -- with a larger profitmargin and thus a bigger commission -- and working topersuade a customer to pay extra for a brand new car withnarrower margins, sales people will push nearly new cars, Mr.Ricart says. &quot;You're training them to take away the magic ofa new car.&quot;   The plans of Ford and GM appear to threaten efforts byrental car companies to offer consumers fresher cars. Butofficials at Budget Rent A Car in Chicago say they aren'toverly concerned.   Ford's major concern &quot;is mileage,&quot; says Thomas Hawkes,Budget's senior vice president for field operations. &quot;A carthat gets up to 15,000 miles isn't as apt to substitute for anew car&quot; once it's resold to a dealer.   Budget currently tries to keep cars in its 130,000-vehicleU.S. fleet for an average of just 4.8 months, says WilliamPlamondon, the executive vice president and general managerfor North America. While Ford supplies a majority of Budget'scars in the U.S., Mr. Plamondon says the No. 2 auto maker'sdecision shouldn't have a &quot;significant impact&quot; on that goal.The average age of Budget's cars may go up slightly, he says,&quot;but it's not going to go from 4.8 months to seven months.&quot;   At Hertz, Ford's No. 1 rental car fleet customer, aspokesman said the company didn't have any comment on thedecision.   Meanwhile, consumers looking to land a nearly new carbargain still have time to shop. By making its plan effectivefor cars built after April 30, Ford effectively excluded thebulk of 1991 models sold to rental fleets. That means thereshould be former rental cars with less than six months'service coming to dealer showrooms throughout the summer.   There's a hitch, however. So many car dealers havediscovered the nearly new car market in recent months thatthey're bidding up prices of former rental cars by as much as$1,000 a car over levels last fall.   That means at Delaware Ford Lincoln-Mercury in Delaware,Ohio, sales manager Eric Clauburg is running out of the$17,995 nearly new Lincoln Town Cars he was displaying at thefront of his dealership's lot last November. Now, similarTown Cars cost him about $17,500 and sell for about $19,000.   &quot;The good things never last forever,&quot; Mr. Clauburg says.   ---                     Auto Alliances                                                                                                          Here are major links between auto makers and rental carcompanies:                                                                                                                         GENERAL MOTORS CORP.                                                                                                        -- Avis Inc.
