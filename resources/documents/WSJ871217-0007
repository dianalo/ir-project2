Mount Pleasant Savings, a state-chartered mutual association with three offices, had $25.4 million in assets and $29.4 million in liabilities. Sulphur Springs Loan, also a state-chartered mutual association, had $71.1 million in assets before the merger.    To facilitate the merger, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. advanced Sulphur Springs Loan $3.7 million in cash and pledged to cover a share of acquired-loan losses, saying that would be less costly than a liquidation of Mount Pleasant Savings.    Mount Pleasant Savings was the 38th troubled thrift in the country to be merged, acquired or liquidated with FSLIC help this year. </TEXT></DOC>
