The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Indicators rose 0.5percent in August and 1.5 percent in June but fell 0.7 percent inJuly.   Economists believe this rollercoaster performance is a signalthat the economy, which was expanding at a robust pace in the firstsix months of 1988, is slowing down.   Indeed, overall economic growth as measured by the grossnational product dropped to an annual rate of 2.2 percent from Julythrough September and many analysts believe that this modest pacewill continue in the current quarter and for most of next year.   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., said theleading index was signaling a welcome slowdown, which would givethe economy breathing room and lower inflationary pressures builtup by heavy demand and tight labor markets.   ``We are seeing a pretty sluggish leading indicator and that isconsistent with where the economy is going,'' he said. ``We arelooking for an economy that is slowing but not stopping.''   He predicted the GNP would grow 2.3 percent for 1989, down froman expected 3.8 percent GNP growth rate for all of 1987.   In a second report today, the Commerce Department said thatconstruction spending rose 0.6 percent in September to an annualrate of $403.4 billion as strength in housing and governmentconstruction offset a decline in office building.   The 0.1 percent decline in the leading index was a bit weakerthan expected. Many private forecasters were calling for a 0.2percent rise. The August index, however, was revised upward to showa 0.5 percent gain instead of the originally reported 0.4 percentincrease.   The index, by focusing on forward-pointing business statistics,is designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months intothe future.   Many economists, who had at one time been fearful that the nextpresident would face a recession in his first year in office, haverevised that view and now believe the next downturn will not comeuntil 1990.   But the leading index is signalling slower growth. For the last12 months, it has risen just 0.7 percent, compared to an increaseof 6.7 percent in the previous 1-month period.   For September, the biggest factor holding the index back was adrop in plant and equipment orders, followed by a fall in buildingpermits. Other factors depressing the index were a decline in rawmaterials prices and slower growth in the money supply. Fallingprices are viewed negatively as a sign of lower demand.   In all, five of the available nine indicators made positivecontributions. The biggest positive force came from an increase inthe average workweek. Other positive factors were a fall in initialunemployment claims, a rise in stock prices, a slowdown in fillingorders and a rise in orders for consumer goods.   The various changes left the index at 193.3 percent of its 1967base of 100.   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said he ispredicting GNP growth of just 2 percent next year, reflecting aslowdown of the export boom which accounted for half of this year'sgrowth.   ``The export boom is clearly gone, capital spending has tailedoff and consumers haven't been too eager to spend either,'' saidEvans. ``That is basically the whole economy.''   But Beryl Sprinkel, the president's chief economic adviser, saidin a speech last week that there was no reason for a recession tooccur anytime soon.   ``Recessions don't just happen. They are caused by policymistakes,'' he said.   If a recession does occur next year, many analysts are fearfulthat it will be triggered by the Federal Reserve pushing interestrates too high in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures.   Fed policymakers were meeting behind closed doors today, butanalysts did not expect the session to result in any dramaticchanges. However, they said the Fed is likely to begin pushingrates higher early next year as signs of inflation re-emerge.</TEXT></DOC>
