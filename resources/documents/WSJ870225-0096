The House Agriculture Committee's wheat, feed grains and soybeans subcommittee approved by voice vote a bill, offered by Rep. Glenn English (D., Okla.), that would give wheat growers 92% of their usual income-protecting &quot;deficiency payments&quot; if they decide to plant little or no wheat in 1987.    This would cover spring wheat, normally planted in the spring for fall harvest, and winter wheat, which would be planted next fall for harvest in the spring or summer of 1988. The size of the payments would be based on the amounts over the previous five years.    The bill would also give the same benefits to farmers who couldn't plant winter wheat last fall because of drought, flood or other weather problems. Thus, the provisions would match some forms of disaster-relief aid for grain growers affected by last year's Southeast drought and other difficulties. And the bill would extend the same assistance to corn growers who can't seed their crop this spring because of lingering effects of 1986 weather difficulties.    As part of its recently announced, but still not introduced, package for trimming farm-subsidy costs, the Reagan administration is urging Congress to adopt the pay-as-you-don't-plow plan for wheat, corn and other feed grains, through 1990. Under that plan, grain growers could collect 92% of their usual income-support payments without planting their usual crop, and would be prohibited from planting any other crop.    The plan is aimed at saving government costs in acquiring, owning and storing surplus grain. Many farmers who hold federal crop loans elect to default on those loans and forfeit the grain to the government, rather than sell the grain at depressed market prices.    Staff members of the panel estimated that if wheat growers under the program let three million acres lie fallow, representing about 7% of winter-wheat production, that would slice about $132 million from the federal farm budget. But they also suggested most farmers would ignore the plan, because it's more lucrative to keep growing and reaping grain.    Deputy Agriculture Secretary Peter Myers plumped for a broader plan that would include corn and other feed grains, noting that the government faces a much larger surplus for corn than for wheat.    But Rep. Dan Glickman (D., Kan.), the subcommittee chairman, replied that the panel needs in-depth hearings to produce the &quot;intellectual framework&quot; for deciding on any more-general &quot;decoupling&quot; plan than the &quot;pilot&quot; project approved yesterday.    As for the bill approved yesterday, &quot;It's a little like chicken soup -- it may not help, but it can't hurt,&quot; Mr. Glickman said.    If the full committee and House were to adopt Rep. English's plan, it would have to be reconciled with a measure recently passed by the Senate. The Senate bill provides only for disaster relief for 1986-1987 winter-wheat farmers, without such provisions to pay farmers for keeping land fallow. </TEXT></DOC>
