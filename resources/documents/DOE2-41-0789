As the results, boththe vacuum stability tests and the isothermal storage tests revealedthat the larger the grain of peroxidicarbonate was, the more active itwas, but the more instable thermally and timewise it was. The adiabaticstorage tests did show no difference in the heat generation rate. (5figs)</TEXT></DOC>
