The additional constraints of today's aerodynamic requirements,especially high strength-to-weight ratios for engineering components,have increased the necessity for detailed information of the environmentaleffects on material properties. The MTS system designed and is in theprocess of manufacturing a test system for NASA-MSFC to evaluate theeffects of high pressure, high temperature hydrogen gas on the materialproperties of metals. The design process for the system is discussedwith a presentation of the system's final configuration.</TEXT></DOC>
