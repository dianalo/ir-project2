Bush accused Dukakis of demagoguery on Social Security, sayinghis Democratic rival supported a move to curtail cost-of-livingbenefits in 1985 _ the very step that the vice president has beencriticized for by the Democrats.   Dukakis acknowledged Thursday night that at a National GovernorsAssociation meeting in 1985, he first voted to drop Social Securityfrom a list of programs to be covered by a proposed one-year freezein cost-of-living increases. Dukakis said he lent his support forthe overall freeze after the attempt to protect Social Securityincreases was voted down.   The Massachusetts governor said in Dallas that he cast the vote``as a general expression of my concern for the deficit, but I madeit very, very clear that I was opposed to cutting cost-of-livingincreases for Social Security recipients.''   ``There were a great many of us (governors) who opposed any cutin Social Security, but we at least wanted to give theadministration a message that we were concerned about thedeficit,'' he said.   Dukakis stood with actor and environmentalist Robert Redford athis side as he attacked Bush as a man whom polluters should love.``Calling George Bush an environmentalist is like calling DanQuayle a statesman,'' the Democrat said in a two-sided attackagainst both members of the Republican ticket.   Bush came to the youthful Quayle's defense and then got off adouble-edged attack of his own when he scoffed at Dukakis' claimsof being tough on crime. ``If you believe that, he's got somebottled water from Boston Harbor he'd like to sell you,'' the vicepresident said in a crack about Massachusetts own pollutionproblems.   Quayle was in Washington getting ready for next Wednesday'snationally televised debate with Democratic vice presidentialcandidate Lloyd Bentsen.   Bentsen campaigned in Tennessee, where he had hoped to watch thelaunch of the space shuttle with a group of schoolchildren. TheTexas senator left before the delayed blast-off, but said later,``It was a spectacular takeoff. OK, Russians, we're back.''   Politicians love to bask in the glow of favorable news, and forDukakis and Bush _ as for Bentsen _ the successful launch of theshuttle Discovery more than two and a half years after theChallenger disaster was irresistible.   Bush had concluded his speech to a campaign crowd in St.Charles, Mo., when he learned from aides the shuttle had beenlaunched. He returned to the platform to tell cheering supporters,``We're going to keep the edge in space. We're back. America'sback.''   Bush said he hoped to attend the shuttle landing next week inCalifornia. Asked at a news conference if he would invite Dukakisto share the moment with him, the vice president said, ``That wouldbe making a political event of it _ the two of us there. Icertainly have no plans to do that, gracious though it may be.''   Dukakis offered similarly upbeat sentiments about the shuttle inNew Jersey, opening his speech on the environment by saying it wasa ``very successful morning. As all of you know, the space launchwas successful. We're very proud of the astronauts.''   So much for the nice talk.   Dukakis collected endorsements from several environmental groupsand had sure-fire crowd pleaser Redford at his side as hecriticized the environmental record compiled by the Reaganadministration and pledged to step up the pace of toxic wastecleanup.   He said that in Bush's role as chairman of a task forceconcerned with government regulation, the vice president hadblocked proposals to reduce lead in the air and to clean up toxicwastes. He said that in eight years, the administration has beguncleanup efforts at only 137 of 1,200 toxic waste sites identifiedas national priorities.   ``For the foot-draggers and chronic polluters, I have just onemessage. You better vote for Mr. Bush, because if I'm elected thegame is over _ no more sweetheart deals and delayed cleanups andhalf-baked compromises that we've seen over the past seven and ahalf years.''   Dukakis also tried to blunt the Republicans' attack on pollutedBoston Harbor, contending he had fought the Reagan administration``every inch of the way'' in trying to clean it up.   Bush said that Dukakis in a vote in the National Governors'Conference supported ``exactly the same thing he was attacking meon the other night (in their debate). So I wanna keep that SocialSecurity trust fund sound and I will do that and I will not permitit to be raided for social spending programs.''   Dukakis said during Sunday night's debate that Bush would raidthe Social Security trust fund to help reduce the deficit.   Dukakis' own running mate voted twice for Democratic-sponsoredbudget plans that would have temporarily frozen benefits. Hesupported a plan in May 1984 which would have delayedcost-of-living increases for one year. A year later, in May 1985,he supported a six-month delay in the COLAs.   Bentsen, joining Dukakis for a fund-raiser in Dallas, said hewas eager to debate Quayle next week and characterized the Indianasenator as having ``a far-right agenda'' out of the mainstream ofAmerican voters.   ``And believe me, if the radical right gets its way, we'll beliving in the 19th century instead of aiming for the year 2000,''he said.   For his part, Bush sought to shield his running mate fromDemocratic attack, saying it was ``rather demeaning'' for Dukakisto criticize the Republican vice presidential candidate. He said it``shows a certain insecurity, a certain weakness'' on his rival'spart.   Bush, firing a barrage of scathing one-liners as he campaignedthrough Midwestern battlegrounds of Missouri and Michigan, againcriticized Dukakis' plan to crack down on tax cheats.   ``I just don't agree with his vision of America where thegovernment has a hand in every pocket and a tax agent in everyhome,'' he said.   Dukakis campaign officials say the governor's plan to collectdelinquent taxes would require a 6 percent increase of IRS agents ayear, far less than the doubling that Bush cited.</TEXT></DOC>
