Hutton Group Inc. chairman Robert Fomon relinquished his management functions at the securities firm but intends to remain chairman and a director, the firm said.    &quot;This is a face-saving transition,&quot; said one Hutton official, who noted that Hutton's new management team no longer will have to keep Mr. Fomon appraised of day-to-day decision making. Hutton's president and chief executive officer, Robert P. Rittereiser, now will be able to &quot;move more quickly&quot; on management initiatives, the Hutton source said.    Last November, Mr. Fomon formally surrendered the chief executive's title to Mr. Rittereiser after Hutton rebuffed an informal takeover overture from American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. unit. For some time before that, Hutton sources have said, Mr. Fomon has been relegated to a largely advisory role, while Mr. Rittereiser effectively ran the company.    Mr. Rittereiser strongly opposed the Shearson offer, according to Hutton sources. Mr. Fomon, however, is thought by Hutton management to have favored a Shearson bid, even though Mr. Fomon &quot;never admitted that&quot; to management, the Hutton official said. Mr. Fomon &quot;always said it was up to us,&quot; the Hutton official added. Mr. Fomon's loss of power stems directly from Hutton's guilty plea to 2,000 counts of federal mail and wire fraud in connection with a large-scale check-kiting scheme. Following the guilty plea in May 1985, Mr. Rittereiser was brought in from Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. to strengthen management controls.    Mr. Rittereiser has since built a new management team that has been anxious to remove Mr. Fomon from its deliberations. The transition of power to Mr. Rittereiser had to be accomplished slowly, according to the Hutton official, because of Mr. Fomon's long ties to the firm. He has been with Hutton since 1951 and has been its chief executive since 1970.    Last week, Hutton's vice chairman, Scott Pierce, resigned, saying the management realignment had limited his role at the firm. Mr. Pierce's resignation surprised other Hutton executives, while Mr. Fomon's announcement of yesterday didn't. Mr. Fomon and Mr. Rittereiser were said to have met yesterday at a location away from Hutton's new pink-marble, midtown Manhattan headquarters to discuss Mr. Fomon's decision.    Mr. Fomon, who couldn't be reached for comment, said in a prepared statement: &quot;With the election of Robert Rittereiser as chief executive officer, the transition in leadership that I initiated almost two years ago is substantially complete. It is time to shift the reins entirely to the new team.&quot;    Mr. Rittereiser, who also couldn't be reached, said in a statement that he was &quot;delighted&quot; that Mr. Fomon was remaining as chairman. </TEXT></DOC>
