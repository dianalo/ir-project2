It was synonymized under <T3>Actinonaias ligamentina</T3> by Call in 1895 (Harris and Gordon 1988).In 1900, Simpson placed it in the genus <T3>Lampsilis</T3> (Simpson 1914). The species has been overlooked by anumber of authors in reviews of Arkansas mussel fauna, including Burch(1975), Gordon, et al. (1980) and Gordon (1980). Johnson (1980) in hismonograph, Stansbery (1983), and Gordon and Harris (1985) all consider<T3>L. powelli</T3> as a valid species. Reported collections of <T3>L. powelli</T3> from the Spring and Neosho Rivers, Kansas, and theBlack River, Missouri, are misidentifications.The shell of the Arkansas fatmucket is generally of medium size, but itoccasionally exceeds 100 mm in length. It is ellipticial to long obovatewith subinflated valves. The umbos are moderately full and project slightlyabove the hinge line. The shell surface is generally smooth with a shinyolive brown to tawny periostracum and lacks rays. The nacre is bluish whiteand iridescent. There is sexual dimorphism (Johnson 1980).The Arkansas fatmucket prefers deep pools and backwater areas that possesssand, sand-gravel, sand-cobble or sand-rock with sufficient flow to periodicallyremove organic detritus, leaves and other debris. It is not generally foundin riffles nor does it occur in impoundments. It is frequently found withislands of <T3>Justicia americana </T3>(water willow) where substrate is typicallydepositional and water depth is about 1 meter (Harris and Gordon 1988).The Arkansas fatmucket is known to exist in the Ouachita, Saline and CaddoRiver systems. In the Ouachita Basin, this species occurs in the OuachitaRiver upstream of Lake Ouachita in Montgomery and Polk Counties, and inthe South Fork Ouachita River upstream of Lake Ouachita in Montgomery County.In the Saline River Basin, the species occurs in Alum Fork, the MiddleFork, and the North Fork above their confluence with the Saline River,and in the Saline River from its formation downstream to about the FallLine. The species does not occur in the South Fork of the Saline or inHurricane Creek, a major tributary, but it probably did historically. Inthe Caddo River, the Arkansas fatmucket is known from three locations,all of which are in the mainstem.Collection records on which to base historical distribution of this speciesdo not exist. However, some assumptions can be made by examining the currentdistribution, current habitat types, and alterations to habitat that haveoccurred for various reasons. The probable historic range of this specieslikely included the Caddo River from Norman downstream to the OuachitaRiver, including at least the lower reach of the South Fork Caddo River.It seems likely that the species occupied the Ouachita River from Malvernupstream to the species' current known range, and the South Fork OuachitaRiver for its entire length. In the Saline River drainage, the Arkansasfatmucket likely occurred in all four forks and the mainstem from the FallLine upstream to the extent of permanent flowing water, and in HurricaneCreek upstream of the Fall Line. Archeological records of other Ozarkianmussels indicate these species may have historically occurred throughoutthe entire drainage of those systems rather than being restricted to theheadwaters as they are at present.Land use in the basins where this species occurs is predominantly silviculturewith lesser amounts of crop lands, grass land and urban development. Mostof the forest land is owned by timber companies, although a small portionof the species' range lies within the Ouachita National Forest. The remainderof the land is privately owned in relatively small tracts (Harris and Gordon1988).The only previous Service action on this species was its inclusion in anotice of review on January 6, 1989 (54 FR 579), where it is listed asa category 2 species, i.e., a species whose listing as endangered or threatenedmay be appropriate, but for which more data are needed for a final determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered orthreatened species due to one or more of the five factors described insection 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the Arkansas fatmucket<T3>(Lampsilis powelli) </T3>are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification or curtailmentof its habitat or range. </T3>The range of this species has been curtailedand continues to be threatened by impoundments, channel alteration, graveldredging, sedimentation and water quality degradation. On the OuachitaRiver, the range of this species has been reduced by the construction ofLake Ouachita, Lake Hamilton and Lake Catherine and the hypolimnetic waterreleases from these impoundments. On the Caddo River, the impoundment ofDeGray Reservoir and resulting hypolimnetic water releases have impactedwhat was probably the uppermost historic habitat for the species in thissystem. A part of the Ouachita River Basin Comprehensive Study by the U.S.Army Corps of Engineers includes a feasibility study for one or more impoundmentsfor flood control and other purposes on the Saline River near Benton (Harrisand Gordon 1988). The Soil Conservation Service has constructed one impoundmenton a tributary of the South Fork Ouachita River, has another under construction,and plans a third impoundment on the mainstem South Fork Ouachita River(Harrris and Gordon 1988). While these Soil Conservation Service impoundmentswill not directly inundate known populations of this species, there areimpacts occurring during the construction and possibly during the operationof these impoundments. During construction there is increased threat fromsilt and sediment, and after completion, the control of water flows duringlow flow periods could expose the mussel and also result in lowered dissolvedoxygen. Harris and Gordon (1988) list 16 existing impoundments, 1 underconstruction, and 1 planned within the known range of this mussel thatundoubtedly have already impacted its existence or will in the future.In the South Fork Ouachita River, there is evidence of adverse impactsto a population of the Arkansas fatmucket from channel alteration as aresult of highway repairs occurring in 1984-85. The existing channel isfilling with organic debris, and flows are apparently inadequate to flushthe area. Channel modification is common at highway crossings, and habitatfor this species undoubtedly has been impacted by the many road crossingswithin its range.Small gravel operations are common within the range of this species, andmany streams are impacted by the removal of preferred substrate and bythe resulting downstream sedimentation. The Saline River downstream ofBenton is severely impacted by gravel dredging (Harris and Gordon 1988).A large majority of the watershed in rivers where this mussel occurs isin timber production, with the next most common land use being agriculturalproduction_primarily livestock and broiler chickens. Silviculture practicesin the area have contributed to significant sedimentation problems. Inthe Alum Fork and Middle Fork Saline Rivers, where the best populationand habitat occurs, an estimated 214,300 tons of sediment are transportedannually (Harris and Gordon 1988). The majority of this erosion is sheetand rill, with road- and stream-bank erosion accounting for most of theremainder.Water quality degradation apparently is responsible for the absence ofthe Arkansas fatmucket from a significant area within the species' probablehistoric range. The South Fork Caddo River receives runoff from a baritemining operation. Prairie Creek, a tributary of the Ouachita River, receivesimproperly treated municipal waste (Harris and Gordon 1988). HurricaneCreek and Lost Creek of the Saline River drainage receive acid mine runofffrom bauxite mines. Additionally, non-point source pollution occurs fromfeedlot runoff, timber harvest, road construction, and fertilization foragriculture in all three river basins where this species is found.Existing habitat in the Ouachita and Caddo Rivers is marginal at best.In a 1987-1988 survey of the mainstem Ouachita River, involving some 54river miles of potential habitat, only 5 individuals of the Arkansas fatmucketwere collected (Harris and Gordon 1988). In the Caddo River, the streamgradient upstream of DeGray Reservoir is such that habitat is marginaland the two known populations of this species may be in jeopardy. The onlyknown population in the Caddo River below DeGray Reservoir may be impactedby hypolimnetic water releases.The probable historic range of this species has been reduced by over 40percent (138 river miles), and the optimum habitat and good populationscurrently occur in only about 20 percent (62 river miles) of the totalestimated area of historic habitat. These calculations are based upon thehistoric range as described in the Background section. If habitat losswere based upon the range that is indicated by archeological records, thepercentage would be much greater.B. <T3>Over-utilization for commercial, recreational, scientific or educationalpurposes. </T3>This species has not been collected for scientific purposesand does not seem to be in jeopardy from over-collecting. However, thiscould pose a threat to the limited populations occurring in the Ouachita,Caddo, Saline or the North Fork Saline Rivers, should someone decide tocollect in these areas. C. <T3>Disease or Predation. </T3>There are no known diseases or predatorsfor this species. Muskrats have not been observed to use the species forfood. D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3>The State ofArkansas requires a scientific collector's permit prior to taking any speciesof mollusc. However, this is an almost unenforceable regulation becauseof limited law enforcement personnel and more urgent priorities. Otherenvironmental regulations will not give priority to this species unlessit is listed. E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>The life history requirements for this species, including the fishhost, are unknown, making it impossible to evaluate potential impacts inthis regard. The remaining populations of the Arkansas fatmucket are somewhatisolated from each other, which can lead to a loss of genetic diversityand difficulty with reproduction, especially in those streams where thepopulation is very low. The good population in the South Fork OuachitaRiver (9 percent of existing habitat) is isolated from all other populationsby Lake Ouachita, as is the very sparse population in the mainstem OuachitaRiver. The Caddo River populations are isolated from each other by DeGrayReservoir and from the Saline River populations by some 200 river miles.The Saline River drainage populations are isolated from the other populations,but they are not isolated from each other by any obvious natural barriers.However, if the fish host is not migratory, the exchange of genetic materialbetween these populations would be a very uncommon event. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the Arkansas fatmucket as threatened ratherthan endangered. Threatened status was chosen because the species stilloccurs in good numbers in the headwater streams of two river systems. Thisdistribution makes it unlikely that all populations would be effected bya simultaneous action. Critical habitat is not designated for reasons discussedin that section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a speciesthat is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for this species at this time owing to lack of benefitfrom such designation. No additional benefits would accrue from a criticalhabitat designation that do not already accrue from the listing. Preciselocality data are available to appropriate agencies through the Serviceoffice described in the ADDRESSES section. All involved parties and landownerswill be notified of the location and importance of protecting this species'habitat. <ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingand harm are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect alisted species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agencymust enter into formal consultation with the Service. Protection needs of the Arkansas fatmucket should be considered duringthe following potential involvement by Federal agencies: The EnvironmentalProtection Agency_pesticide registration and waste management actions;Corps of Engineers_project planning and operation, and during the permitreview process; Soil Conservation Service_construction and operation ofimpoundments; Federal Highway Administration_bridge and road constructionat points where known habitat is crossed; and possibly the Farmers HomeAdministration_various loan programs that may be associated with furtherurban development within the species' range. The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 and 17.31 setforth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to allthreatened wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for anyperson subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take (includesharass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, or collect; or toattempt any of these), import or export, ship in interstate commerce inthe course of a commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstateor foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess,sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has beentaken illegally. Certan exceptions would apply to agents of the Serviceand State conservation agencies. Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingthreatened wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23 and 17.32. Such permits are availablefor scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of thespecies, and/or for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawfulactivities. For threatened species, there are also permits for zoologicalexhibition, educational purposes, or special purposes consistent with thepurposes of the Act. In some instances, permits may be issued during aspecified period of time to relieve undue economic hardship that wouldbe suffered if such relief were not available. However, since the Arkansasfatmucket is not known to be involved in any commercial activity, no requestsfor relief under such a permit are expected. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited </ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposal are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning: (1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to this species; (2) The location of any additional populations of this species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by section 4 of the Act; (3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thisspecies; and (4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on this species. Final promulgation of the regulation on this species will take into considerationthe comments and any additional information received by the Service, andsuch communications may lead to adoption of a final regulation that differsfrom this proposal. The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of theproposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to FieldSupervisor (see <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section). <ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). <ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Burch, J.B. 1975.
