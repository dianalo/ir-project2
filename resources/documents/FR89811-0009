By this notice a finalrule is adopted wherein the longstanding requirement of United States citizenshipis further defined.The final rule shall become effective August 11, 1989. At that time theAgency will begin to review files of designated organizations and ask everydesignated organization to submit documentation that it is in compliancewith this rule. Failure to come into compliance within 90 days of receiptof such request will result in withdrawal of the designation.

It appeared at 22 CFR 68.1 (b)as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">As used in this part, the term ``sponsor'' means any existing reputableUnited States agency or institution, public or private, which makes application,as hereinafter prescribed, to the Secretary of State for designation ofa program under its sponsorship as an ``Exchange-Visitor Program.''</ITAG>The regulation was intended to mean and was interpreted to mean organizationsof United States citizenship. The definition has been modified over theyears, but the requirement that the sponsor be a United States agency orinstitution remained. (The only exception in the definition, which wasinserted subsequently, is an international organization of which the UnitedStates Government is a member, e.g. the United Nations.) While it has cometo the Agency's attention that a few administrative errors were committed,and that some non United States organizations were designated, for themost part, the requirement that sponsors be United States organizationwas honored. The Agency began to review its regulations shortly after the passage ofthree new immigration statutes in November, 1986: The Immigration Reformand Control Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-603; The Immigration Marriage FraudAmendments of 1986, Pub. L. 99-639: and The Immigration and NationalityAct Amendments of 1986, Pub. L. 99-653.Upon reveiw of the exchange visitor regulations, the Agency found thatthere was no requirement that Responsible Officers of designated organizationsbe United States citizens. Additionally, because the definition of sponsordid not specify what was meant by United States organization, the Agencyfound that there was some confusion. Consequently, on May 29, 1987 theAgency published a notice of proposed rulemaking setting forth the followingproposed definitions and seeking public comment:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Responsible Officer'' means the official of an organization sponsoringan Exchange-Visitor Program who has been listed with the agency as beingresponsible for administering the program and carrying out the obligationswhich the organization assumes in undertaking to sponsor a program (SeeandSection; 514.14). The designation of an Alternate Responsible Officeris permitted and encouraged. The Responsible Officer and all AlternateResponsible Officers must be United States Citizens. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``Sponsor'' means any reputable U.S. agency or organization or recognizedinternational agency or organization having U.S. membership and officeswhich makes application as hereinafter prescribed to the Director for designationof a program under its sponsorship as an Exchange-Visitor Program and whoseapplication is approved. Other corporations or organizations which arenot incorporated under United States law may not be designated as a sponsor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">The Comments </ITAG>The Agency received nine coments from the public. A list of the partiesis found in appendix A. All comments were carefully considered, however,not all comments are specifically discussed. Comments received from theDepartment of State and the Immigration and Naturalization Service supportthe proposed modification. All of the other comments oppose either oneor both of the provisions. For the most part those opposing the requirement that only United Statescitizens be Responsible Officers argue that the sponsoring organizationshould have the right to appoint whomever it so chooses, and that thisis especially important because the Responsible Officer often has dutiesunrelated to the exchange visitor program. Further, they assert that noncitizens understand the exchange visitor program and can administer it.The National Association for Foreign Student Affairs (NAFSA) suggests thatthe proposal is unconstitutional. It also asserts that the Agency mustdocument actual examples of problems arising because a Responsible Officeris a non citizen. One party states that there is no objection to the requirement,but suggests that it be amended to (1) allow permanent residents to serveas Responsible Officers, and (2) allow the Responsible Officer to appointan alternate, who may be (and who, in many cases, is) stationed in a foreigncountry. Several parties point out that Agency's reference to ResponsibleOfficers being agents of the United States Government is incorrect. Theypoint out that the Responsible Officers are, in fact, employees and agentsof the sponsoring organization. In the words of the University of Coloradoat Boulder: ``We are employed to protect the interests of our institutions,and it is our professional responsibility to serve our institutions, notour government.'' The University of Colorado at Boulder also objects to the requirement thatorganizations be incorporated in the United States as being impossibleor redundant. First, it points out that corporations are incorporated understate laws not United States law. Second, some organizations, such as theuniversities, are not incorporated but chartered or established by stateconstitutions. One party contends that none of the other business visas,such as the E (Treaty Traders and Treaty Investors), H (Temporary Workersand Trainees), and L (Intracompany Transferees) require foreign corporationswith a U.S. presence to be incorporated in the United States. It arguesthat foreign entities should qualify as sponsors if they have a bona fideU.S. presence. It asserts that failure to allow foreign entities to sponsorexchange visitors may conflict with numerous treaties of Friendship, Commerceand Navigation which were established to provide for reciprocal benefitsto nationals of each country who invest in the other country or who conducttrade between the countries. Further, it argues that the modification wouldundermine public and foreign policy goals of the United States Government.It suggests that the test of whether an organization should be designatedshould be whether it is subject to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts, taxlaws, is stable, is registered to do business, and has bona fide officesin the United States. Additionally, this party asserts that designationis an ``entitlement.''The Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of Statesupport the proposed modification. However, the Department of State pointsout that the modification, as proposed, will not necessarily achieve itsaim. It stated: ``It has been the Department's experience that a corporationor other organization incorporated in the United States may, not infrequently,be controlled or wholly owned by foreign persons or entities.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>The statutory basis under which the United States Information Agency candesignate programs as sponsors for a J-visa classification is found in8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(J). That subsection was added to the Immigration andNationality Act in 1961 by section 109 of the Mutual Educational and CulturalExchange Act of 1961. By placing the provision in the Immigration and NationalityAct, Congress intended to make it part of the overall statutory scheme.Consequently any interpretation of that section, must harmonize with thatstatute as a whole. No interpretation or application can be given whichwould undermine or circumvent the Immigration and Nationality Act, takenas a totality.According to the legislative history (1961 U.S. Code Cong. andamp; Admin.News, p. 2774) the new subsection ``creates and incorporates into the basiclaw a special new nonimmigrant visa designed to serve solely the purposesof the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961.'' The purposeof that Act is to strengthen international understanding. The exchangeprogram is an instrument of foreign policy. Decisions as to which exchangeprograms should be pursued is a foreign policy determination. Accordingly,it is not an ``entitlement'' program as alleged, but rather, subject tothe Agency's discretion in its implementation of foreign policy. The exchangeprogram was set up in the Department of State and later in USIA in order``to provide coordination with U.S. foreign relations'' (1961 U.S. Cong.Code andamp; Admin. News 2760). That the decision regarding the designationof exchange organizations is a foreign relations decision should be intuitivelyobvious, since the task has been conferred upon a foreign affairs agency.<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs has been setup in the Department of State to provide coordination with U.S. foreignrelations. (1961 U.S. Cong. andamp; Admin. News 2760).</ITAG>Congress determined that:<ITAG tagnum="21">In modern international relations a positive U.S. Government programpromoting educational and cultural cooperation is essential to the welfareof the American people. (1961 U.S. Cong. Code andamp; Admin. News 2760.)</ITAG>See also the testimony of Walter Laves, Chairman of the Department of Governmentof the University of Indiana, (Hearings before the Committee on ForeignRelations, United States Senate on S. 1154, March 29 and April 27, 1961p. 74.) wherein he stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * the area which encompasses education, science, culture, knowledge,skills, technical assistance, and information * * * how significant thisbig area of foreign relations really is, and to what extent our welfareas a nation * * * may depend upon the effectiveness with which this aspectof our foreign relations is conducted.</ITAG>Additionally, the exchanges (which are not conducted on a strictly reciprocalbasis) are to be undertaken ``only when it is considered that they will`strengthen international cooperative relations'.'' (Senate Report o. 372,Report from the Committee on Foreign Relations to accompany S. 1154, June1961, p. 8) Consequently, all persons entering the United States on A J-visamust enter pursuant to a program, the purpose of which is to strengtheninternational understanding and cooperation_as determined by the Agency.The Agency, in fulfilling its foreign relations obligations, is to promoteexchange activities, when the exchange activities coincide with foreignrelations determinations.8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(J) merely refers to the designation function of theAgency by describing an exchange visitor as a ``participant in a programdesignated by the Director of the United States Information Agency.'' Nocriteria are set forth requiring the Agency to designate certain programs.The criteria are left to Agency discretion. Because of the nature of foreignrelations, the agency has been given broad authority to implement its legislation.The courts have found that this authority is_broader than that given todomestic agencies. Promulgation of regulations consistent with the Actand its legislative history are not considered an abuse of agency discretion.(See <T3>Zemel</T3> v. <T3>Rusk</T3>, 381 U.S. 1 (1965) and <T3>Haig</T3> v. <T3>Agee</T3>, 453 U.S. 280 (1981). See also <T3>Slyper</T3> v. <T3>Attorney General</T3>, 827 F.2d 821, 823 (D.C. Cir. 1987) wherein thecourt stated: ``The statute contains no standard or criterion upon whichto make or withhold a favorable recommendation. This broad delegation ofdiscretionary authority is `clear and convincing evidence' of congressionalintent to restrict judicial review in cases such as those we now face.'')The Agency, in the exercise of its discretion, has determined that noncitizensshould not be given excessive authority in making the foreign relationsdetermination coupled with the strong visa issuance recommendation (whichis inherent in the responsibility for filling out the IAP-66 forms) asto which aliens should be exchange visitors. The Agency has several reasonsfor its determination. First, the Agency believes that United States citizensare best equipped to further the purposes of the governmentally authorizedexchange program. They are in a better position than aliens to understandand represent the United States and to ``generat[e] goodwill for the UnitedStates abroad'' (H.R. Rep. No. 130, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 61, reprintedin 1983 U.S. Code Cong. andamp; Admin. News 1484, 1544).\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Even where the Agency's formal decision making processincludes noncitizens, such as in a binational board, there is always representationof American citizens in an at least an equal number on the board. Furthermore,such input is undertaken only pursuant to a government to government agreement.The responsibility for signing the IAP-66 forms rests with the USIS officersat the Agency Posts abroad.Second, United States citizens owe allegiance to the United States. Noncitizensdo not owe allegiance to the United States. While the comments point outthat sponsors and responsible officers are not agents of the United StatesGovernment, they are in the position of carrying out United States foreignpolicy in selecting individual participants in the exchange visitor programin the place of the Agency making the appointments. Additionally, theyare in the position of signing a United States Government document. Theact of signing that document confers on them a shared responsibility withthe Agency in carrying out its foreign relations obligations. As the Universityof Colorado at Boulder stated: ``* * * it is not the job of a ResponsibleOfficer to protect the interests of the United States Government. We areemployed to protect the interests of our institutions, and it is our professionalresponsibility to serve our institutions, not the government.'' Since ResponsibleOfficers are not serving the interests of the United States Governmentbut rather their institutions, and the interests of the institution maynot always coincide with the interests of the United States Government,indeed may sometimes conflict, and these Responsible Officers are entrustedwith review of participants in a foreign relations program to ensure thatthe selection conforms with the designation, the Agency must impose certainrestrictions on the programs. Where the organization is foreign, the Agencyruns too high a risk that the interests of the organization are not inconcert with those of the United States Government, and that individualsselected to participate in exchange programs are not in keeping with theintent of the program, but rather that the participants are selected tofurther the interests of the foreign organization. With regard to ResponsibleOfficers who are citizens, and who owe allegiance to the United States,the Agency believes that they are more likely than aliens to weigh theiractions carefully when their employers' interests conflict with those ofthe United States Government.Third, the designation of a sponsor confers a grave responsibility on thatsponsor. Upon designation, the sponsor is issued blank controlled UnitedStates Government forms. The forms in the hands of the wrong persons cando great damage to the interests of the United States. Moreover, the schemeset forth in the Immigration and Nationality Act expresses the intent ofCongress that it would define who could come to the United States, andunder what circumstances. Because Congress provided that different termsand conditions would apply to the different visas, it is important thatthe Agency administer the exchange program in such a way as to limit itsaccess to only those aliens Congress intended to be included in the program.The Agency believes it can best ensure the integrity of the program andthe proper use of the forms if access to the forms is confined to UnitedStates citizens.The assertion that the Agency's proposal is inconsistent with other visasused for business purposes is inapposite. The J visa is not a businessvisa. It is not to be used for business purposes. It is a visa exclusivelyfor educational and cultural exchange. Furthermore, to qualify for thevisas to which the party refers, the E, L, and H, the prospective sponsormust petition directly to the Immigration and Naturalization Service onbehalf of the individual alien. The alien in possession of a form IAP-66,stating that he/she is eligible for a J visa is not subjected to the strenuousscreening applicants for the other named visas are subjected. In the othervisas, for example, each petition by a sponsor on behalf of an alien isput through several levels of review, on a case by case basis, in the UnitedStates before the alien abroad is issued a document which can be presentedto the Consul abroad. In the exchange program, only the sponsor makes thedetermination prior to presentation to the Consul abroad. Consequently,a higher standard of review must be applied to the sponsor at the outset.Thus this assertion that the proposal will jeopardize other treaties is,again, inapposite. The referenced treaties are related to business andcommerce. There are adequate visas for implementation of these treaties.The J visa implements educational and cultural agreements.The Agency is concerned about preserving the integrity of the J visa programand maintaining control over the program itself, the sponsors, and theforms. The Agency apprehends that if certificates of eligibility for Jvisas are controlled by aliens who are in turn subject to control by aliensin other countries, the Agency will experience considerably diminishedeffective control over the administration of its exchange programs andover compliance by sponsors, their responsible officers and even exchangevisitors with U.S. labor and immigration laws. The Agency questions whetherthe alien responsible officers and other officials of foreign corporatesponsors will be adequately motivated to observe the purpose and intentof the Exchange Visitor Program. Consequently, the Agency is persuadedthat there exists a legitimate governmental purpose in restricting bothsponsorship and the control of certificates of eligibility to Americancitizens.Some parties argue that such a proposal is unconstitutional. In order topass constitutional muster, the proposed regulation must meet two tests:USIA may exclude noncitizens from designations as sponsors and ResponsibleOfficers if (1) the justification for such an action is rationally relatedto a federal interest, and (2) that federal interest is properly the concernof the USIA. (See <T3>Mathews </T3>v. <T3>Diaz</T3>, 426 U.S. 67 (1976); <T3>Chevron U.S.A. </T3>v. <T3>Natural Resources Defense Council, </T3>467 U.S. 837, 865 (1984); <T3>Hampton</T3> v. <T3>Mow Sun Wong, </T3>426 U.S. 88 (1976); and 2 R. Rotunda, J. Nowak andamp;J. Young, Treatise on Constitutional Law: Substance and Procedure section18.12, at 481 (1986). The justification is rationally related to a federalinterest. The Agency has shown that the involved decisions are the implementationof foreign policy. Foreign policy is indeed a federal interest. Further,that federal interest is properly the concern of the USIA. Under the MutualEducational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 the Agency is required tostrengthen international cooperative relations, by educational and culturalexchanges. Thus, the Agency has shown that the federal interest is properlythe concern of the USIA. Accordingly, the Agency must exercise its discretionin determining ``who'' will best assist in its mission. Further, the Agencyhas given a rational basis for its decision to exclude aliens from designations.Consequently, the Agency believes its decision is constitutional.This situation is distinguishable from that in <T3>Hampton </T3>v. <T3>Mow Sun Wong, </T3>96 S.Ct. 1985, 1910 (1976) wherein the Court stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">It is the business of the Civil Service Commission to adopt and enforceregulations which will best promote the efficiency of the federal civilservice. That agency has no responsibility for foreign affairs, for treatynegotiations, for establishing immigration quotas or conditions of entry,or for naturalization policies. Indeed, it is not even within the responsibilityof the Commission to be concerned with the economic consequences of permittingor prohibiting the participation by aliens in employment opportunitiesin different parts of the national market. On the contrary, the Commissionperforms a limited specific function.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">On the contrary, the Agency does have responsibility for foreign affairs,for treaty negotiations, for establishing conditions of entry for participantsin the exchange program. Indeed, it is even within the responsibility ofthe Agency to be concerned with the economic consequences of permittingor prohibiting the participation by exchange visitors in employment opportunities.Accordingly, the Agency believes it has met the test as to the protectionof a national interest within the realm of the Agency's responsibility.In researching the discover precedents to help the Agency define with greaterprecision what it means by the term ``United States citizen,'' the Agencydiscovered the following definition in the Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C.1301 (13)):<ITAG tagnum="21">(13) ``Citizen of the United States'' means (a) an individual whois a citizen of the United States or of one of its possessions, or (b)a partnership of which each member is such an individual, or (c) a corporationor association created or organized under the laws of the United Statesor of any state, territory, or possession of the United States, of whichthe president and two-thirds or more of the board of directors and othermanaging officers thereof are such individuals and in which at least 75per centum of the voting interest is owned or controlled by persons whoare citizens of the United States or of one of its possessions.</ITAG>This definition responds closely to the Agency's perceived needs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Conclusions</ITAG>For the reasons stated above, the Agency finds that the exclusion of noncitizensfrom serving as sponsors and responsible officers is rationally relatedto a federal interest and that the federal interest is properly the concernof the USIA. Furthermore, the agency has determined that such exclusionis necessary to ensure the integrity of the exchange visitor program. Accordingly,the Agency is modifying the definition of citizen found in the FederalAviation Act and inserting the modification into the Agency's regulations.This decision does not significantly affect the quality of the human environmentand is not a major or regulatory action under the Energy and ConservationAct of 1975.This rule does not constitute a `major rule' as that term is defined insection 1 (b) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulations issued by thePresident on February 17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates that itdoes not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State of local government agencies or geographic regions;or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation or on the ability of the United States-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersignedhereby certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Information collection requirements contained in this regulation have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions ofthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 3501-3520) and have beenassigned OMB Control Number 3116-0009.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 514</ITAG>Cultural exchange programs, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, 22 CFR part 514 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 514_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
