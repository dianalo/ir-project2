The Democratic Front and the rightist National Action Party arebattling the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in theHouse of Deputies, which is sitting as an electoral college tocertify the election by a Thursday deadline.   The opposition parties claim the PRI won both the presidentialelection and many house seats by fraud.   The Democratic Front was a disparate group that joined inopposition to the PRI for the July 6 elections. Along with theMexican Socialist Party, it includes the Authentic MexicanRevolutionary Party, the Popular Socialist Party and the CardenistFront.   The parties support a larger government role in the economy anda moratorium on payments of Mexico's $104 billion foreign debt, butbeyond that their roots and interests differ.   The Cardenas Front was created by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a formerPRI state governor and senator, and includes many former members ofthe PRI, especially from the PRI's so-called Democratic Current,which sought a party primary before the presidential election.   The Authentic Revolutionary Party was founded in 1954 bymilitarist members of the PRI who were dissatisfied with theirmarginal position in the party.   The Popular Socialist Party was founded in 1929 and advocatespushing the government gradually toward socialism.   The Mexican Socialist Party, last to join the front, includeswhat was once the Mexican Communist Party and has the most radicalagenda. Its presidential candidate, Herberto Castillo, announcedhis candidacy but withdrew in favor of Cardenas, who ran as thecandidate of the united left-wing opposition.   The other candidates were Carlos Salinas de Gortari, whoaccording to official returns won with 50 percent of the vote _ thefirst time a PRI candidate finished under 70 percent in officialtabulations since the party was founded in 1929.   Cardenas took 31 percent but claims fraud robbed him of victory;National Action Party candidate Manuel J. Clouthier received 17percent.   ``The main challenge facing the Democratic Front is to form areal political party,'' said a PRI official who spoke on conditionof anonymity. ``They got together for the elections, but that wastactical.''   PRI doesn't believe the four parties can continue to worktogether, party officials said. They also said the opposition'svictory in Mexico City made party members realize they had to workharder.   Before the end of the year, that determination will be tested as11 of Mexico's 31 states have gubernatorial elections. In fivestates _ Jalisco, Guanajuato, San Luis Potosi, Nuevo Leon andTabasco _ the PRI's winning margins on July 6 were thin.   The PRI has not lost a governorship since it was founded, butNational Action spokesman Ricardo Garcia Cervantes said the partyhoped to break that string in December in Jalisco, which the PRIwon with a plurality of 42 percent in July.   ``The Federal Election Commission only gave us eight of the 14districts (out of 20) that we actually won in the state. If they'dgiven us all 14, you would see how strong we really are there,''said Garcia. ``We're going after the governorship.''   Jardon said the Democratic Front would run a single candidatefor the governorship in the state of Tabasco, where Cardenas didwell.   And unity is not evident in Veracruz, on the Gulf of Mexico,where municipal elections are due Oct. 2.   About 550 candidates are registered for the elections, accordingto state election commission official Anastasio Reyes Marquez.</TEXT></DOC>
