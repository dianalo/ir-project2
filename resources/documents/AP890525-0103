Earlier today, more than 100,000 workers and intellectualsmarched to join students in demanding Li's ouster. An intense powerstruggle within the political leadership appeared unresolved.   Li's statement on state-run television broke a silence thatbegan Saturday, when he imposed martial law in Beijing.   He said the army had not yet entered the city because ``ourgovernment is a people's government and our army is a people'sarmy.''   Over the weekend, tens of thousands of people built streetbarricades to stop the army's advance on students occupying centralTiananmen Square.   The television news quoted Li as saying that the thousands oftroops surrounding Beijing would only enter the city once localcitizens understand their purpose.   He denied claims the army was called in to crush the monthlongstudent movement, the largest in communist China's 40 years.   A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman denied today that eitherCommunist Party chief Zhao Ziyang _ who had shown sympathy for thestudents' cause _ or Li had lost their posts. She refused tocomment on strife within the leadership.   In a defeat for Zhao, long a rival of Li, state-run radioreported that 27 of 29 provinces have backed the martial law order.   The State Council, China's Cabinet, issued a circular sayingstudents had forced their way onto trains to Beijing, hinderingefforts to end turmoil in the capital and disrupting railwayoperations, the official Xinhua News Agency said.   The circular said local police and governments should use``forceful measures'' to stop the students, but it did not explain.   Today's marchers converged on Tiananmen Square, China's symboliccenter of power, two days after an estimated 1 million people helda similar protest demanding Li's ouster.   The banner-waving procession chanted, ``We won't stop until LiPeng steps down!'' They also demanded the resignation of seniorleader Deng Xiaoping, believed to have been behind Li's crackdown.   ``This is the first time I've demonstrated in my life,'' saidZhang Ciling, 54, a composer. ``But today I have to express myfeelings. My country is facing a crisis.''   Some marchers were led by the newly formed Independent Union ofBeijing Intellectuals: teachers, researchers and artists joingingcivil servants from city offices and the ministries of Railways,Forestry and Foreign Affairs.   Another procession was led by the Beijing Independent Workers'Union, a new group challenging government bans on non-officialtrade unions.   ``The movement no longer belongs to the students,'' a machinefactory worker said. ``Intellectuals and workers must unite andcarry it on.''   The marchers, cheered on by 100,000 onlookers, proceeded aroundthe square, which has been occupied since May 13 by tens ofthousands of students, who are pressing for reforms including afree press and an end to official corruption.   China's leaders were believed to be holding secret meetings todecide how to cope with the government's worst crisis since the1966-76 Cultural Revolution.   Western diplomats said today that Zhao, a relative liberal, hadbeen strongly criticized in recent meetings of the party's rulingPolitburo and was in danger of being publicly humiliated.   The diplomats said Li is following the lead of Deng, who hadurged putting Beijing under martial law and having troops crush thestudent movement.   A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Li Jinhua, insisted at a weeklybriefing that there had been no leadership changes.   She said that ``because of the new arrangements of his work''President Yang Shangkun was postponing a Latin American visit nextweek. She refused to answer questions about the Politburo orwhether Zhao was under fire.   Because of his decision to try to end the upheaval, Premier Lihas been the target of demonstrations that have spread to Shanghaiand dozens of other Chinese cities in the past few days.   Early today, an effigy of him lying in a tomb was hung in frontof the Great Hall of the People next to Tiananmen Square. Somepassers-by laughed and clapped.   The military has not tried to push through the barricades set upby city residents, and some senior officers have called for an endto martial law.   But it appeared Wednesday the army was closing ranks behind Li,with the general staff publishing a letter strongly supporting Li'shard-line position. The letter was republished today in all majornewspapers.   However, Chinese sources said the struggle between Zhao and Liwas not yet over. ``The struggle is very intense,'' one sourcesaid. ``We don't even believe our own rumors now.''   One of the top candidates to move into the void if Zhao and Lifall, National People's Congress Chairman Wan Li, arrived inShanghai late Wednesday after cutting short a visit to the UnitedStates.</TEXT></DOC>
