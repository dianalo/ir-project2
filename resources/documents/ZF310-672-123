Raduchel, vice president and chief financial officer of Sun, said,&quot;It was an excellent quarter for us in all respects.andP;  We reported a majorincrease in revenues, record bookings, we ended the quarter with a recordbacklog of orders, almost $700 million in cash and a balance sheet that'snever been stronger.andM;&quot;Despite concerns over the Middle East war and the recession, our businessremained healthy.andP;  Apparently, our strategy of SPARC/UNIX/OPEN LOOK/ONC, is awinner with customers.&quot;andM;Sun reported that it was enjoying considerable success in all three of itsmajor geographies -- the United States, Europe and the Pacific Rim.andM;Commenting on the company's financial results, Raduchel said, &quot;Our operatingmargin improved a full 2 1/2 points from the second quarter, pushing it overthe 10 percent mark, the highest it's been in nearly three years.andP;  Net incomeof about $59 million was 6.9 percent of revenues, also at the high end of ourhistorical range.andM;&quot;Clearly, employees throughout the company have responded aggressively to ourcalls for expense controls, judicious and conservative hiring, and improvedasset management.andP;  As a result, our revenues per employee increased more than20 percent in the past 12 months.&quot;andM;Sun shipped a record 48,000 units in the quarter, with the SPARCstation IPCaccounting for the largest share.andP;  Raduchel indicated that the IPC,introduced nine months ago, increased shipment volume substantially in thethird quarter, jumping by about 50 percent from the prior quarter.andM;Meanwhile, the relatively new SPARCstation 2, introduced last quarter,doubled in shipments during the quarter.andM;&quot;We seem to have the right mix of prices and capabilities to respond crediblyto a broad range of customers seeking the advantages of client/servecomputing.andP;  Announcements made by competitors during the quarter only serveto highlight the appropriateness of our strategy...andP;  and the substantial leadwe have in implementing it.andM;&quot;In fact, we are successfully penetrating many new applications areas,particularly in the commercial sector, which we estimate now accounts forabout 30 percent of our revenues,&quot; Raduchel said.andM;Sun reminds investors that as the company has grown and become increasinglyglobal in nature, the seasonality prevalent in the computer industry is now afactor for Sun as well.andP;  For this reason, the company cautions againstexpecting sequential quarterly gains in revenues, net income or earnings pershare, especially in the first quarter (ending September) of each fiscalyear.andM;Because of this seasonal pattern, the company believes that year-over-yearcomparisons are more indicative of the company's true performance, progressand position in the industry.andM;Sun Microsystems is the world's leading supplier of client/server computingsolutions, which feature networked workstations and servers that store,process and distribute information.andM;Used for many demanding commercial and technical applications, Sun productscommand the largest share of the computer industry's fastest growing marketsegment (workstations and servers).andM;The company, founded in 1982 and headquartered in Mountain View, is amultibillion dollar corporation doing business worldwide.andP;  In 1990, abouthalf of Sun's revenues were generated outside the United States.andP;  ATandamp;T owns19.5 percent of Sun.andM;Sun Microsystems Inc.andM;Consolidated Statements of IncomeandM;(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)andM;(Unaudited)andM;Three Months EndedandM;3/29/91     3/30/90andM;Net revenues                              $ 848,293   $ 632,212andM;Costs and expenses:andM;Cost of sales                              468,790     341,103andM;Research and development                    89,917      78,863andM;Selling, general and administrative        199,712     153,419andM;Total costs and expenses                   758,419     573,385andM;Operating income                             89,874      58,827andM;Net interest expense                         (2,253)     (7,863)andM;Income before income taxes                   87,621      50,964andM;Provision for income taxes                   28,915      14,270andM;Net income                                 $ 58,706    $ 36,694andM;Net income per common and common-andM;equivalent share                          56 cents    40 centsandM;Common and common-equivalentandM;shares used in the calculationandM;of net income per share                    104,924      94,751andM;Nine Months EndedandM;3/29/91     3/30/90andM;Net revenues                            $ 2,278,831 $ 1,766,089andM;Costs and expenses:andM;Cost of sales                            1,245,536   1,024,462andM;Research and development                   264,615     219,121andM;Selling, general and administrative        574,520     416,742andM;Total costs and expenses                 2,084,671   1,660,325andM;Operating income                            194,160     105,764andM;Net interest expense                         (9,261)    (19,547)andM;Income before income taxes                  184,899      86,217andM;Provision for income taxes                   61,016      24,141andM;Net income                                $ 123,883    $ 62,076andM;Net income per common and common-andM;equivalent share                           $ 1.21     70 centsandM;Common and common-equivalentandM;shares used in the calculationandM;of net income per share                    102,187      93,191andM;Sun Microsystems Inc.andM;Consolidated Condensed Balance SheetandM;(Unaudited)(In thousands)andM;March 29, 1991     Dec. 28, 1990andM;AssetsandM;Current assets:andM;Cash and cash equivalents           $  696,032          $  570,231andM;Acounts receivable, net                657,230             598,498andM;Inventories                            242,958             237,032andM;Other current assets                   222,384             207,564andM;---------           ---------Total current assets                1,818,604           1,613,325andM;Property, plant and equipment, net      352,501             366,919andM;Spare parts and other assets, net       193,233             200,200andM;----------          ----------$2,364,338          $2,180,444andM;Liabilities and Stockholders' EquityandM;Current liabilities:andM;Notes payable                       $   43,926          $   43,968andM;Accounts payable                       184,896             158,604andM;Accrued liabilities                    267,770             240,123andM;Income taxes payable                    69,507              50,298andM;Other current liabilities               67,078              58,663andM;-------             -------Total current liabilities             633,177             551,656andM;Long-term debt and other liabilities    416,344             416,540andM;Stockholders' equity                  1,314,817           1,212,248andM;----------          ----------$2,364,338          $2,180,444</TEXT></DOC>
