Few Paraguayans doubt that ``El Viejo'' _``the old man'' _ did, too.   But the new government of Gen. Andres Rodriguez and the rulingColorado Party have expressed little interest in pursuing whetherStroessner should be investigated.   Rodriguez was a friend of Stroessner's, and his daughter, Marta,is married to Stroessner's son, Alfredo. A trial also could proveembarrassing to the party, which has held power since 1947.   After the Feb. 3 coup, Foreign Minister Luis Maria Argana saidthe country must ``look to the future and forget about the past.''   No apparent efforts have been made since then to seizeStroessner's assets, and a lawsuit seeking his return from exile inBrazil to face possible corruption charges has languished in court.   ``I see no political interest in trying Stroessner,'' said OscarPaciello, on leave as president of the Paraguay Bar Association.``During his 34 years in power, a lot of people here today were byhis side and a trial would leave the altars without any saints.''   Estimates of Stroessner's alleged ill-gotten gains run into thehundreds of millions of dollars, although proof of that is as hardto come by as evidence of what he did with any such money.   After the coup, there were no discoveries of fabulous artcollections, luxurious hideaways, foreign bank accounts or closetsstuffed with furs, jewels and shoes, such as followed the flights toexile of dictators Anastasio Somoza, Ferdinand Marcos andJean-Claude Duvalier.   ``Stroessner was much more intelligent than Somoza, who hadbusinesses in his name,'' said journalist Ricardo Canese.``Stroessner received commissions and dividends without everbecoming part of the business itself, without any document bearinghis name.''   The 76-year-old ex-army commander lived simply in this hot,steamy South America capital since he took power in a 1954 coup. Heshunned a flamboyant lifestyle.   Nevertheless, many Paraguayans, including Aldo Zuccolillo, editorof the newspaper ABC Color, are convinced that a simple lifestylemasked but did not hide Stroessner's systematic plundering.   Zuccolillo alleges Stroessner allowed Refineria Paraguaya, S.A.,to charge the government as much as twice the world price for oilfrom 1974-79 and pocketed $800 million. ABC Color published thescandal, leaving out the Stroessner connection for fear it would beclosed. It was closed anyway in 1984 and just now is reopening.   ``Stroessner may barely have a $10,000 bungalow here in Paraguay,but he has well over $1 billion overseas in secret accounts,''alleges Zuccolillo.   After the coup, Stroessner's long-time minister of public works,Gen. Juan Antonio Caceres, said his former boss had personalsignature power over two funds totaling $4 million. The money camefrom highway tolls and gasoline taxes, Caceres said, adding that hisministry was denied the funds.   A huge source of illegal commissions and overcharges was theconstruction in the 1970s with Brazil of the $16 billion Itaipu dam_ the world's largest hydroelectric project _ on the Parana River.   There also were allegations of contraband: cigarettes and liquorin the 1960s, stereos in the 1970s, computers and narcotics in the1980s. This California-size country of 4 million people nestledbetween Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia long has been a smugglers'paradise.   Five ex-Stroessner Cabinet ministers and seven senior aides andparty officials are accused of ``offenses against publicadministration'' including embezzlement, bribery and fraud. Thosewho have been charged have declared their innocence.   Attorney Pedro Abilio Rolon alleges former Interior MinisterSabino Augusto Montanaro sold passports to Koreans and Taiwanese for$2,500 each, and former Health Minister Adan Godoy Jimenez chargedthe government $40,000 to build each of more than 200 health clinicsthat cost only $10,000.   On Tuesday, former Justice Minister Jose Eugenio Jacquet wasbrought to court on corruption charges. A police report accused himof selling licenses to notaries and court clerks for $4,000 and saidhe influenced court cases, ``which resulted in important economicgains.''   Jacquet's attorney, Ramon Alberto Aquino, said the charges werevague, but he did not say how his client pleaded, if at all.   Stroessner's aides used to say with pride and arrogance, ``Not aleaf falls in Paraguay without Stroessner knowing it.''   ``Stroessner is the head of all this, the mastermind,'' saidattorney Gladys Ramboado, who filed suit in criminal court demandingthat Stroessner be returned to face corruption charges.   The suit has made little headway, and Ms. Ramoado admits she areunsure they can ever force the government to try Stroessner.   The provisional government has stressed Stroessner'saccomplishments in his early years and blamed greedy subordinates inhis later years.</TEXT></DOC>
