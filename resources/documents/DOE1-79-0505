The fore stage of this system comprises an preparatorycharger; and the rear stage, a dust collector with charge bed of chargedparticles. A model plant capable of processing 500 m{sup 3} N/hr gaswas constructed. Decrease in the dust collection efficiency with theincrease in moving velocity was greater at 250{sup 0}C than at 150{sup0}C. The removal capacity did not differ much as compared with the fixedbed in the case with fine grains, but lowered in the case with roughgrains of 1 {mu}m or larger in diameter. To restrain the lowering ofthe performance of the electrostatic air filter, a system with a dischargeelectrode added immeidately before the dust collector with charged bedof charged particles (front electrode E.G.B.) and one with dischargeelectrodes before and after the collector (two electrode E.G.B.) weredeveloped. The two electrode E.G.B. was more efficient than the conventionalE.G.B. (12 figs, 5 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
