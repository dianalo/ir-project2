Citibank Leasing is a unit of Citibank, owned in turn by New York-based Citicorp. Onex is Canada's largest company specializing in leveraged buyouts and has operations in airline catering, packaging, and courier services.    Onex said it will acquire about 650 million dollars of Citibank Leasing's 844 million dollars of assets. The remaining assets will be retained by a new company, Citibank Canada Leasing Inc., a unit of Citibank.    Bruce Clark, president of Citibank Leasing, said the sale is in line with the U.S. parent's strategic planning to concentrate more of its activities on investment and merchant banking and &quot;big-ticket leasing.&quot;    The transaction is scheduled to close in mid-July, when Citibank Leasing will be renamed Norex Leasing Inc. Mr. Clark and most of the management of Citibank Leasing plan to join Norex and will have an opportunity to acquire a 20% interest in Norex.    In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a business in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired operations or the sale of assets.    Onex's acquisition is being financed largely by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Royal Bank of Canada. Gerald Swartz, president of Onex, said Norex will begin operations with bank lines of credit of about one billion dollars from Imperial Bank, Royal Bank and Citibank's Canadian unit, Citibank Canada, of which about 400 million dollars will be unused. Onex is contributing about 50 million dollars of equity to Norex.    Onex said Citibank Leasing Canada has more than 50,000 customers and is Canada's industry leader in leasing office, medical and dental equipment. Citibank Leasing earned about 13 million dollars in 1986 on revenue of 126 million dollars.    Most of the assets being retained by Citibank represent aircraft leases. Mr. Swartz said Norex will focus its leasing operations mainly on transactions under 50,000 dollars, while Citibank Canada Leasing will concentrate on larger leasing deals.    Mr. Swartz said that while Citibank Canada Leasing has agreed to refrain from &quot;small-ticket leasing,&quot; Norex isn't prohibited from larger leasing transactions. </TEXT></DOC>
