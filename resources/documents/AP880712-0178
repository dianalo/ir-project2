Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as his vicepresidential running mate on Tuesday, signaling a Democratic driveto reclaim a portion of the South in the fall election againstGeorge Bush. Dukakis described the decision as his ``firstpresidential act.''   ``We're going to fight for every state in the Union and we'regoing all out to win,'' the 67-year-old Bentsen said in his publicdebut as Dukakis' political partner. Both men said they werefollowing the path to victory forged by another Massachusetts-Texasteam, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, in 1960.   Jesse Jackson, passed over for the job he openly sought, said hewas ``too controlled...and too mature to be angry.'' He said hisname would be placed in nomination for president against Dukakisnext Wednesday, but added, ``I no doubt will support the ticketthat the convention elects next week.''   There was no immediate reaction from Bush, although he said in aBoston Globe interview published earlier in the day that Bentsen``doesn't worry me'' despite the Democrat's victory in a 1970head-to-head Senate race. Senate GOP leader Bob Dole said Dukakis``couldn't have picked a better man.''   In Atlanta, party officials said construction work would befinished on the Omni convention hall ahead of schedule, and a fewdays before thousands of delegates begin streaming into theconvention city over the weekend.   Dukakis presented Bentsen in ceremony televised live fromswletering Faneuil Hall in Boston. A large crowd of supportersstood outside in the afternoon sunshine, waiting for a glimpse ofthe Democratic ticket for 1988.   ``We go to Atlanta and we begin the road to victory,'' Dukakissaid. His choice of Bentsen must be ratified by the delegates tothe convention that begins on Monday, and there is no doubt he willhave his way, regardless of whether Jackson or his delegates decideto seek a symbolic showdown.   One Jackson supporter in Congress, Rep. John Conyers ofMichigan, said the selection ``disappointed and shocked'' him. ``Itmay be that we're back in the Mondale-Carter syndrome of trying tomake the Democratic Party only slightly less conservative than theRepublican party,'' he said.   But the two ticket mates said they were on the road to the WhiteHouse.   Said Bentsen:   ``The Massachusetts and the Texas axis was good for the countryand good for the Democratic Party in 1960 and it's gonna be a realwinner in 1988.''   Dukakis said ``selecting a running mate is probably the firstpresidential act, if I could use those words, that I will do.'' Inchoosing Bentsen, he hoped the party's liberal wing would go along.   Bentsen, 67, is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and aconsummate party insider. He is a moderate who differs with Dukakison some issues, most prominently perhaps in his support for aid tothe Nicaraguan Contras.   Despite Bush's professed lack of concern, Republican strategistssaid that in turning to Bentsen, Dukakis had transformed one ofBush's strongest states into an autumn battleground. Texas has 29electoral votes, more than any state except California and NewYork, and no Democrat has been elected president this centurywithout carrying it.   Bush's campaign manager, Lee Atwater, said he was unconcerned.He said Democrats have ``thrown away the vice presidentialselection'' because they cannot wrest Texas away from theRepublicans. ``People in Texas want a president, not a vicepresident. And George Bush is the man they want,'' he said.   Among those considered and then passed over for the vicepresidential slot were Jackson, Sens. John Glenn of Ohio; AlbertGore Jr. of Tennessee, Bob Graham of Texas and Reps. RichardGephardt of Missouri and Lee Hamilton of Missouri. Sen. BillBradley of New Jersey and Sam Nunn of Georgia told Dukakis they didnot want to be considered.   Bentsen is a prodigious fundraiser and owner of a moderate toconservative voting record after nearly a quarter century in theHouse and Senate.   The selection was reminiscent of the 1960 campaign, when anotherson of Massachusetts _ John F. Kennedy _ turned to Texan LyndonJohnson in a drive for votes in the South. Johnson helped theticket win Texas and other states that year, and Sen. Edward M.Kennedy provided an echo of that past campaign after hearing ofBentsen's selection.   ``The Massachusetts-Texas combination got this country movingagain in 1960 _ and it will do the same for the nation in 1988,''said the senator in a statement.   Much of the Democratic establishment moved to embrace Bentsen.``Democratic prospects in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana will beboosted immediately, and when the American people get to know LloydBentsen it will strengthen the ticket everywhere,'' said Sen. PaulSimon, of Illinois, a liberal and former primary rival of Dukakis.   John White, a former Democratic national chairman who has beenadvising Jackson, said he was ``excited'' about the choice ofBentsen and said it would ``make Texas a hell of a battlefield.''   Asked if he would convince Jackson about the merits of Bentsen,White replied, ``Jesse's a very quick study. I'm not worried aboutthat.''   At his news conference, an obviously subdued Jackson said hefirst learned of Bentsen's selection from a reporter, but Dukakiscalled him a short while later and told him on the telephone. Hesaid he would press his case for the nomination as well as forchanges in the barebones platform drafted by Dukakis' forces.   There was no hint of whether Jackson or his 1,100 delegateswould challenge the nomination at the Democratic NationalConvention next week.   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., who is national co-chairwoman ofBush's presidential campaign, tried to dampen the historicalconnection.   ``I'm sure we're going to hear 1960 ad nauseum,'' she said.``There's a slight difference, of course. He (Bentsen) was notselected by his peers to be in leadership (as Lyndon Johnson, theSenate majority leader, had been); nor is Dukaks John Kennedy.''   Public polls taken recently indicate that Bentsen is littleknown nationally, but could give Dukakis an enormous boost in therace for Texas. One survey shows Bush routing Dukakis by more than20 percentage points in the Lone Star State _ with the margindwindling to four percentage points if Bentsen were placed on theticket.   The selection of Bentsen followed a six-week search for apartner for the fall campaign that was focused almost exclusivelyon members of Congress from the South and Midwest. ``It's kind offun, this business of running for the presidency,'' said Dukakis ashe arrived at his statehouse office a few hours before themid-afternoon announcement.   For the methodical and serious Dukakis, that sounded like awhoop of joy that his long search was over _ and that his secrethad held.   Bush campaigned during the day at an NAACP convention inWashington, where he promised to have a ``positive civil rightsagenda'' if he succeeds President Reagan in office.   ``I guarantee you I will be personally involved in protectingthe civil rights of all Americans,'' Bush said to loud applausefrom one of the nation's most prominent civil rights groups.</TEXT></DOC>
