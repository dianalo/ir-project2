(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Reading andamp; Bates Corp. announced Thursday itwill sell its oil and gas subsidiary and move its corporateheadquarters to Houston, where it will concentrate on offshoredrilling.   About 30 employees were laid off Thursday, and another 100 willlose their jobs in the next few months, officials said. The companyhas about 2,000 employees worldwide.   J.W. Bates Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said themove to Houston is expected to be completed by the end of the year.   Another subsidiary, Reading andamp; Bates Drilling Co. has maintainedoffices in Houston for more than 30 years.   ``Obviously, the decision has been a very difficult one,'' saidBates, who helped start the company in 1955.   But he said it is necessary because there has been no turnaroundfor the oil industry. Reading andamp; Bates has had three years of lossesand a fourth is anticipated, he said.   ``I think there's no question it'll get better,'' Bates said.``The question is, when. If the company is to survive as a majorinternational offshore drilling contractor, which has been ourprincipal business throughout the years, we have no alternative.''   Reading andamp; Bates operates a fleet of 18 offshore drilling rigsthroughout the world. The company also owns Resources ConservationCo., a process engineering company located in Seattle, and Readingandamp; Bates Coal Co. operating in eastern Kentucky.   Reading andamp; Bates disposed of its pipeline construction businessin 1985. In 1987, the company completed sale of its foreign oil andgas production, its horizontal drilling operations and its part ofa land drilling venture in Argentina.   It reported losses of $191 million, in 1987, $145.8 million in1986 and $190.6 million in 1985.   The company is in default of all leases, subject to continuingnegotiations, in an amount estimated at $272.2 million as of Dec.31, 1987. The company and its lenders are continuing to negotiateterms of a restructuring agreement, Bates said.   ``Hopefully, that will be accomplished by the end of the year,or certainly next year,'' he said.   Bates said he does not believe the company will have any troublefinding a buyer for the petroleum company.   Reading andamp; Bates Petroleum Co. had operating revenues of about$25 million in 1987, and proved developed reserves in the U.S. of5.7 million barrels of oil and 70 billion cubic feet of natural gas.   ``There is intense interest in acquiring reserves,'' Bates said.</TEXT></DOC>
