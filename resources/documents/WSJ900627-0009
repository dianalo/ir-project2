August gold closed at $352.90, off $3.30 an ounce. Julysilver settled at $4.8250 an ounce, down 0.3 cent. Octoberplatinum settled at $485.70 an ounce, down $1.90.</LP><TEXT>   Prices were boosted Monday by news that South Africa'scentral bank has been intervening to support the gold market.   Yesterday, silver performed relatively better than gold orplatinum, according to Don Tierney, metals analyst at StanleyB. Bell andamp; Co. in New York, because some precious metalstraders decided silver was a buy. But July silver had to fallbelow its 12 1/2-year low of $4.7620 -- the contract tradedas low as $4.7350 -- before buying developed.   &quot;I can't believe this silver price -- it just seems soattractive, especially when you realize that the last time itwas in this area was in December 1977,&quot; Mr. Tierney said.   Mr. Bell said many metals traders are turning from gold tosilver because they are tired of getting slammed in theovernight gold market. &quot;Three times in the last few monthsthey have awakened to the news that gold is down anywherefrom $6 to $20 an ounce,&quot; he said.   Mr. Bell pointed out that the number of gold contractsremaining to be nullified by opposite trades or fulfilled bydelivery of the metal is only 9,000 more than in silver,narrowed from a differential of 40,000 contracts a month ago.He said he expects ultimately to see this so-called openinterest in silver exceed that in gold when the commodityfunds that are holding large short positions take theirprofits in gold. &quot;I expect them to roll out of gold and intothe silver market,&quot; he said.   Larry Heim, publisher of the Heim Investment Letter inPortland, Ore., said yesterday's action in the silver marketwas positive.   &quot;The move to under $4.76 cleaned out all the stop-lossorders that might have been placed by not-very-determined&quot;buyers, he said. Such price action, he said, bodes well for apossible short-term turnaround in silver prices and perhapseven a major move higher.   William O'Neill, futures analyst at Merrill Lynch Futuresin New York, said the focus in the gold market now is on cashbullion. He said the sell-off in gold would have been worseif the dollar hadn't eased in the afternoon; gold and thedollar typically move in opposite directions.   As for gold-producing countries supporting gold prices,Mr. O'Neill said: &quot;It would be naive to expect South Africaor the Soviet Union to engage in any long-term campaign tosupport gold. These countries are so currency-starved thatlong-range support is out of the question.&quot;   But although ultimately their need to sell the metal willfar outweigh any support they can possibly give the market,he said, such producer intervention probably did help to haltthe market's slide temporarily.   However, Mr. O'Neill said, the market is still in anerosion mode. &quot;On rallies we have lower highs and onsell-offs lower lows,&quot; he said. He said the one bright spothas been some investment buying from the Far East, but ingeneral, investment buying has been absent.   Platinum seems to be in a bullish supply/demand situation,according to Mr. O'Neill, but it can't rally independently ofgold.   He said he is considering a &quot;spread&quot; trade in which hewould buy two October platinum contracts and sell one Octobergold contract to act on his expectation of platinumoutperforming gold. But he said he won't initiate this tradeuntil the price premium of platinum over gold narrows toabout $115 a ounce from $126 currently.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices closed mixed in relativelysubdued trading. Soybean and corn futures for July deliveryclosed slightly lower, reflecting many traders' belief thatMonday's rally wasn't totally supported by forecasts of hotweather spreading across Midwestern growing areas this week,said Steven Freed, a futures analyst with Dean WitterReynolds Inc. in Chicago. Short-covering by commodity funds,or the buying of contracts to offset those sold earlier inanticipation of continued price declines, accounted for asignificant portion of the Monday rally, Mr. Freed said. Julysoybean futures closed 4.75 cents a bushel lower at $6.08 abushel after gaining 13.25 cents a bushel Monday. July cornfutures slipped 1.25 cents to close at $2.8575 a bushel aftera five-cent gain Monday. Wheat futures for July delivery onthe Chicago Board of Trade bucked the trend and gained half acent a bushel to close at $3.34. Analysts said that corn andsoybean prices are likely to rise and fall in step withMidwestern temperatures for the next several weeks.                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices drifted lower inextremely light trading. The New York Mercantile Exchangeestimated volume at only about 54,000 contracts, resulting ina sluggish session as traders apparently decided to holdtight ahead of the weekly report of U.S. petroleuminventories due from the American Petroleum Institute lateyesterday. The August crude contract lost 24 cents a barrelto close at $17.14. Later months were lower as well. Evengasoline, which in recent sessions has seemed immune tocrude's declines, fell. July unleaded gasoline contracts lost0.95 cents a gallon to end the session at 61.32 cents.                                                                                                          COPPER: Prices drifted lower in a continuation of Monday'ssell-off. The July contract settled at $1.0835 a pound, down0.55 cent. Release of a London Metal Exchange report showingsupplies down 375 metric tons was a non-event, analysts said.Stocks at New York's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose 1,140tons to 18,801 tons. Mr. O'Neill of Merrill Lynch noted thatin London the premium of spot copper over metal to bedelivered in three months is now $16 a metric ton, narrowedfrom $50 a few months ago. The narrowing &quot;reflects that thedemand for immediate copper is falling,&quot; Mr. O'Neill said, aswell as indicating heavy selling by copper merchants. Mr.O'Neill said the copper market is drifting because there arefew reports due out this week. He added: &quot;Though the mid-Junecar sales were not good, I didn't think they were all thatbad. I think we may be near a bottom for those numbers.&quot;                                                                                                          COTTON: Prices continued fluctuating wildly. The old-cropJuly contract settled at 86.31 cents a pound, up 1.54 cents,while the new-crop December contract fell 0.30 cent to closeat 74.25 cents. Ernest Simon, cotton specialist atPrudential-Bache Securities in New York, said there stillisn't much cotton from last year's crop available fordelivery. &quot;Tuesday was the second day in which sellers couldgive notice that they intend to deliver cotton,&quot; he said. &quot;Sofar, there have been no delivery notices.&quot; He said the Julycontract is being driven up by traders who have soldcontracts in anticipation of lower prices and now must gointo the market to buy the contracts back. A few holders oflong positions in the July contract, he said, are probablyforeign countries who want cotton to meet current needs andare holding onto their contracts until some short-sellerdelivers physical cotton to them. However, he said, even therally in new-crop cotton has been explosive. &quot;Seven times inJune the new-crop month of December has made new contracthighs,&quot; he said, attributing the rally mainly to hot and dryweather in Texas. &quot;Weather in other cotton-growing regionshas been good, with the crop coming along nicely,&quot; accordingto Mr. Simon. He said the market is also being propelledupward by commodity funds that use trend-following techniquesand buy a commodity when certain technical indicators showprices to be in a general uptrend.</TEXT></DOC>
