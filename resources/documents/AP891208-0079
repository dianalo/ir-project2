Departing from the prepared text of a speech at a politicalfund-raiser in Houston on Thursday night, the president said:   ``Just last week democracy was challenged in the Philippines.And we stood with President Aquino and we continue to stand withher and with democracy now. We must not let the democratic processbe overthrown by revolution and by military takeover.''   ``Obviously we would like to see the Aquino government be ableto solidify its position to avoid a repetition of this,'' HouseSpeaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said after a White House meetingwith Bush earlier Thursday.   ``We're sympathetic to her as a democratically elected leader,and we hope that she can take whatever action is necessary toensure that this kind of open military challenge does notreoccur,'' said Foley, reflecting the discomfort many U.S.officials felt over the surprisingly strong coup attempt.   The Philippines, struggling with widespread rural poverty and a$28 billion international debt, has pinned its hopes on attractingoutside capital and trade. With Japan leading the way, the countryhas benefited from a multibillion-dollar international economicdevelopment program.   But those hopes, which have grown during the 3{ years since Mrs.Aquino was elected to replace dictator Ferdinand Marcos, restheavily on political stability.   Mrs. Aquino herself has been dogged by accusations ofincompetence and her government by charges it has failed to weedout corruption and address rural poverty.   One congressional official closely involved in U.S. policytoward the Philippines said any hesitancy on Mrs. Aquino's part indealing with dissident military officers who carried out the coupcould damage economic growth.   ``If she is seen as vacillating and not moving vigorouslyagainst the coup plotters, that is really going to be a blow toinvestor confidence,'' said the official, who spoke only oncondition of anonymity.   Mrs. Aquino must do more than she did in 1987, when coup leadersgenerally went unpunished and the government made concessions tothe rebellious military faction, the official said.   ``The only conclusion for investors is that if she doesn't moveagainst these guys, they could do it again, and next time theymight succeed,'' he said.   ``These events will slow things down in the minds of at leastsome potential investors,'' said John Callebaut, director of theU.S.-Philippine Business Committee, an arm of the U.S. Chamber ofCommerce.   But Callebaut said that during a tour the past two weeks tointerest U.S. electronics companies in investing in thePhilippines, he saw little change in attitude because of theattempted coup. The companies ``have a longer-term interest in thePhilippines, and there is a recognition that this is of ashort-term nature,'' he said.   At the White House and the State Department there werereassurances Thursday of U.S. backing for Mrs. Aquino.   ``Mrs. Aquino's government has shown incredible resilience inthis situation,'' said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.   He noted that after a serious coup attempt in August 1987 therewere pessimistic predictions about investor confidence which nevercame true. ``Stability returned rather quickly,'' with an annualgrowth rate of 6 percent, Boucher said.   But another department official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, acknowledged the latest coup will give pause tocompanies contemplating expanding to the Philippines.   ``In addition to being disruptive and destructive and unhealthyfor the democratic process, it raises questions in people's minds:Is the environment stable? Is the situation secure? Is this a goodplace to put money?'' the official said.   ``She already had a tough job, and it's become tougher. But it'snot impossible.''</TEXT></DOC>
