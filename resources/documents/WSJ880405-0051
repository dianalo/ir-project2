Conversations with Fed officials suggest the Fed is reversing the move toward lower interest rates that it made in January. And some traders and analysts predicted higher rates in coming weeks.    The Fed's apparent tightening is designed to fight possible inflationary pressures by slowing the domestic economy. Higher interest rates also could bolster the dollar, which has fallen in recent weeks.    Yesterday, the yield on the most recently issued 30-year government bond surged to 8.87%, its highest level since Jan. 14. Rates on the new three-month and six-month Treasury bills, auctioned yesterday, climbed to their highest levels since Jan. 19.    The catalyst for yesterday's rate moves was a government report issued Friday -- when the market was closed -- showing that the civilian jobless rate fell to 5.6% in March, a nine-year low. Bond prices, which move inversely to interest rates, tumbled from the beginning of trading. Late yesterday, the price of the most recently issued 30-year Treasury bond had dropped 1 1/8 points, or $11.25 for each $1,000 face amount.    &quot;The bond market is unhappy with America's good fortune,&quot; said David Gray, a director of bond investments at Boston Co., which manages nearly $5 billion of fixed-income funds. &quot;The economy is behaving a lot better than anyone might have expected at this point.&quot;    Fed officials expressed particular concern about the solid growth in business payrolls in March, and also about a revision that showed job growth in January was much stronger than previously reported.    &quot;The preponderance of data that has become available over the past month or so has been positive,&quot; said one Fed policy maker. &quot;If anything, the surprises have been on the up side.&quot;    Officials declined to say explicitly whether the Fed had tightened policy. But they acknowledged that the fears of a weak economy that led the Fed to ease slightly in January no longer existed.    The move toward higher interest rates makes it clear that Fed officials are determined not to let the economy grow too rapidly this year. Rapid growth, they fear, could foster inflation and also slow progress in the effort to reduce the trade deficit.    The Fed eased policy slightly in late January after economic data suggested that employment growth had slowed and that inventories had piled up in the fourth quarter of last year. Although most members of the central bank's policy committee didn't believe a recession was imminent, they felt a small adjustment in policy could reduce the risks.    Subsequent government reports, however, show that employment growth was relatively strong in the first quarter. Moreover, the fourth-quarter build-up in business inventories has been revised down somewhat by the Commerce Department. As a result, the central bank apparently is reversing its January move.    But the Fed's determination to fight inflation could pose political problems for the Republican Party later. If interest rates are pushed too high, they could cause a slowdown in the economy later this year. &quot;The economy may be peaking too soon for George Bush,&quot; said Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. economist Lawrence Kudlow, who predicts the economy will slow substantially in the summer and fall.    Other economists, however, foresee the economy expanding through this year. &quot;Anyone who feared a recession after the collapse of the stock market last October must completely rethink that story,&quot; said Robert Giordano, a partner and chief economist at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;We are seeing rapid income growth and that will allow excessive inventories (in the nation's factories) to be corrected without downward pressure on domestic production.&quot;    Mr. Giordano said there are &quot;a number of signs that suggest that some tightening by the Fed already is in progress.&quot; The most obvious indications that the Fed is making credit less plentiful are a higher rate on federal funds, or reserves banks lend each other overnight, and evidence the Fed is being stingy in its allocation of reserves to the banking system.    Federal funds hovered between 6.69% and 6.75% through most of yesterday's trading. That was up from the 6 1/2%-6.63% range that prevailed since early February, when the central bank decided to ease credit slightly. Since the October stock market crash, fed funds had traded consistently around 6 3/4%.    &quot;By our calculation, the Fed should be adding $3 billion (of reserves) a day to the banking system, but it has only added $200 million a day during the current bank statement period,&quot; Mr. Giordano said. &quot;This suggests the funds rate will continue to come under upward pressure.&quot; In the meantime, he predicts yields on 30-year government bonds will &quot;rise to the high end of an 8 1/2% to 9 1/2% range.&quot;    Appearing on CNN's Moneyline last night, Wayne Angell, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, declined to say whether the Fed had tightened credit. But he said: &quot;Some of us want to make certain that we do get the rate of inflation back down. I'd like to see the CPI get back to the 2% range by 1989.&quot; In recent months the Labor Department's consumer price index has been running about 4% above a year earlier.    Nonetheless, John Paulus, a managing director and chief economist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., predicted a big rise in short-term and long-term interest rates by year end as well as a large drop in the dollar against major currencies.    &quot;The economy is stronger than many people thought possible, and that has both limited the prospects for a reduced (U.S.) trade deficit and made the dollar highly vulnerable to a sell-off,&quot; he said. &quot;When you have a strong economy and a weakening currency -- generating inflation pressure -- unfortunately there isn't much you can do but have higher interest rates.&quot;    By the end of the year, Mr. Paulus said, rates on three-month Treasury bills and 30-year bonds are both likely to climb to 11%, from just over 6% and about 8.86%, respectively. &quot;The yield curve will be flat as a pancake,&quot; he predicted.    Some government securities dealers see parallels with the credit markets a year ago, when bond prices began a major slide. Underwriters on Wall Street &quot;are in a position very similar to last spring,&quot; said Joseph Petri, president of Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc., &quot;when there was huge congestion of unsold securities. Whatever it is -- mortgage-backed securities, new corporate offerings and even some municipals -- the Street is backed up with unsold inventories.&quot;    At the moment, investors aren't &quot;showing much interest in buying bonds, and that means yields&quot; on 30-year Treasurys &quot;probably will have to rise to at least 9%,&quot; he added.    Some investment strategists say current fears of a continuing slump are exaggerated. &quot;In the next six to eight weeks, the bond market probably will do a lot better,&quot; said Steven Blitz, a technical analyst in the fixed-income research department at Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;I could see yields on the 30-year government bond falling to 8 1/4%,&quot; he added.    But even Mr. Blitz isn't bullish longer term. &quot;The whole structure of the rally from the Oct. 19 low is not one that supports a long-term bull market,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of this move was a big short-covering rally,&quot; in which traders and investors bought back bonds and their futures and options equivalents that they initially sold short.    In the bond market yesterday, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 fell to a price of 100 2/32 from 101 6/32 last Thursday. The government's 8 1/8% notes due 1998 fell to 96 15/32 from 97 6/32, as the yield rose to 8.66% from 8.56%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds closed at 1261.05, down 11.48 points, its lowest level since Jan. 14. The index ranged between 1256.31 and 1262.09.    At the Treasury's regular bill auction yesterday, rates on new of three-month and six-month bills averaged 5.98% and 6.21%, respectively. The rates were up from 5.69% and 6% respectively the previous week. The new rates also were the highest since Jan. 19, when three-month bills averaged 6% and six-month bills averaged 6.37%.    Here are the results from yesterday's Treasury auction:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                 13-Week          26-Week    Applications .......... $27,890,455,000  $31,860,250,000    Accepted bids .........  $6,414,330,000   $6,409,225,000    Accepted at low price               41%              76%    Accepted noncompet'ly    $1,004,285,000     $995,100,000    Average price (Rate)      98.488(5.98%)    96.861(6.21%)    High price (Rate) .....   98.493(5.96%)    96.866(6.20%)    Low price (Rate) ......   98.486(5.99%)    96.861(6.21%)    Coupon equivalent .....           6.16%            6.50%   Both issues are dated April 7.
