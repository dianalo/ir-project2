The justices will consider whether Hawaii's law barringvoters from inserting the names of candidates not officiallyon the ballot violates constitutional rights of free speechand political association. In June, the federal appeals courtin San Francisco upheld the state's ban.</LP><TEXT>   Only four other states -- Indiana, Nevada, Oklahoma andSouth Dakota -- impose total bans on write-in voting,according to briefs filed in the case. Hawaii contends thatother states also restrict write-in voting, if lessstringently, and that its objective was to prevent&quot;intra-party feuds&quot; and &quot;late-blooming candidacies&quot; that lacksubstantial support.   The Hawaii resident who originally challenged the law in a1986 lawsuit said he did so because he was often&quot;dissatisfied&quot; with the candidates on the ballot. A variedgroup of political activists and organizations said in aseparate brief supporting the challenge that Hawaii'swrite-in ban, along with the state's other electionprocedures, constitute &quot;extraordinarily severe&quot; obstacles toindependent candidates.   In its decision, the San Francisco appeals court said thatall citizens enjoy a constitutional right to vote but that itisn't &quot;an unlimited right to vote for any particularcandidate.&quot; The appeals court also said that states havebroad latitude to set election procedures and that voters whoare dissatisfied with choices on the ballot have other waysto express their opinions.   The appeals court acknowledged that its decision clashedwith one issued in 1989 by the federal appeals court inRichmond, Va., creating a conflict among jurisdictions.(Burdick vs. Takushi)   Separately, the Supreme Court yesterday declined tore-enter the controversy over punitive damages. The highcourt let stand an Alabama jury's punitive award of $750,000against a unit of Principal Financial Group in a dispute overa $1,000 death benefit.   In March, the justices refused in an unrelated Alabamainsurance case to establish distinct constitutionalguidelines for punitive damages, which are imposed to punishor deter a civil defendant's conduct. Businesses have triedrepeatedly to persuade the justices to curb big punitiveawards, invoking a number of constitutional doctrines,including the right to &quot;due process,&quot; which was the issue inyesterday's case.   An Alabama jury found that Principal Mutual Life InsuranceCo. had acted in &quot;bad faith&quot; when it denied a Mobile, Ala.,woman's $1,000 insurance claim upon the death of herdaughter. The jury awarded $1,000 in compensatory damages,intended to reimburse the woman, as well as $750,000 inpunitive damages. The Alabama Supreme Court upheld theawards. In its unsuccessful petition for U.S. Supreme Courtreview, Principal Financial called the punitive award&quot;excessive.&quot; (Principal Financial Group vs. Thomas)   In other action yesterday, the high court:   -- Let stand a ruling that Gulf States Utilities Co. maynot pass along to customers in Louisiana $677 million inconstruction costs for the River Bend nuclear power plant.The Louisiana Public Services Commission concluded that GulfStates had acted &quot;imprudently&quot; in 1979, when it restartedconstruction on River Bend, north of Baton Rouge. The state'ssupreme court affirmed the decision. Construction of theplant, which was completed in 1986 at a cost of $4.4 billion,was begun in 1971. (Gulf States Utilities Co. vs. LouisianaPublic Service Commission)   -- Declined to consider giving lawyers more leeway tocriticize judges. In one of a pair of cases the high courtrefused to hear, New York state's top appellate court upheldthe 1988 reprimand of Elizabeth Holtzman, then districtattorney of Brooklyn, for publicly criticizing a state trialjudge's conduct in a rape case. Ms. Holtzman is now New YorkCity's comptroller and is expected to be a contender for theDemocratic nomination in next year's U.S. senate race in NewYork. As district attorney, she accused Judge Irving Levineof instructing an alleged rape victim to get down on herhands and knees to demonstrate the position in which she hadbeen raped.
