For the futuremovement of OPEC and the crude oil price, though the agreement of oilproduction quantity (15.06 million B/D by the total 12 countries exceptIraq) has been kept in 1988, the countries except Saudi Arabia and UAEare unconcerned about the fixed oil price (18 dollars/barrel). The settingof the fixed oil price is a question. The non-OPEC countries supply about60% of the petroleum demand in the world (1987) at the actual price.This fact makes OPEC take the market price into account for the oil supply.(2 figs, 5 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
