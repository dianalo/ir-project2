Macy on Monday sweetened its merger agreement with Federated by$200 million in cash, raising the value of the offer to $6.3billion and topping a rival, hostile $6.2 billion proposal byCampeau Corp.   Separately, a federal judge indicated he would not rule beforeWednesday in suits filed by Macy and Campeau in connection withtheir war over Federated, but effectively extended Campeau's buyoutoffer into next week.   Macy _ whose own offer expires April 4 _ had sought to delayexpiration of Campeau's offer by 20 days to lessen the pressure onFederated shareholders to accept the hostile bid.   Toronto-based Campeau extended its offer through Friday fromtoday's original expiration, but stated Monday it had no immediateintention to revise its bid in response to the sweetened offer fromMacy.   Under terms of the amended merger agreement unanimously approvedby the Federated board, Macy will offer $77.35 a share in cash for80 percent of Federated's stock, up from $74.50 per share in itsoriginal offer.   Macy plans to swap shares in the merged company and issueconvertible debt securities for the remaining 20 percent ofFederated shares.   Federated stock closed unchanged at $66 a share on the New YorkStock Exchange.   Federated also granted Macy the option to purchase itsBullock's-Bullock's Wilshire and I. Magnin retail divisions if themerger fell through. Such ``lockup'' options frequently are used todiscourage hostile suitors.   Federated said the divisions would sell for at least $800million and $150 million, respectively, although Campeau has valuedthose divisions at a total of about $1.25 billion.   Macy also granted Federated's board sole discretion over whetherto maintain its ``poison pill'' anti-takeover plan. Under itsprevious agreement, Cincinnati-based Federated would have rescindedthe plan in a merger with Macy.   Federated recommended its shareholders tender their stock toMacy, calling the new offer ``substantially more favorable toFederated stockholders than Macy's previous offer and the coerciveCampeau two-tier offer.''   Campeau is offering to pay $75 cash a share for 70.5 million ofFederated's common shares outstanding, or 80 percent, throughFriday.   The remaining 20 percent of Federated stock would be acquiredlater for $44 cash per share in a subsequent merger, giving thedeal an aggregate value of $68 per share.   Shortly after Campeau extended its offer, Federated urged itsshareholders to hold onto their stock, reversing the unusualrecommendation it made Sunday for stockholders to tender theirshares to the hostile bidder.   Federated is opposed to merging with Campeau, but the retailerhad intended to prevent its shareholders from having to accept thelower, $44 price under the ``back end'' of Campeau's two-tier bid.   At Monday night's hearing, U.S. District Judge Leonard Sandindicated he would not rule before Wednesday either on Macy'srequest to force Campeau to extend its tender offer past Friday oron Campeau's challenge to Federated's ``poison pill'' takeoverdefense.   Sand said he was seeking an opinion from the Securities andExchange Commission on Macy's contention that Campeau's latesttender offer, which was revised from a previous lower bid,constituted a brand-new offer. If the judge sides with Macy,Campeau would have to delay its offer _ and the date when it couldacquire tendered shares _ to give shareholders time to consider thenew bid.   The judge said he would not get the SEC opinion before Wednesdayand would not rule on either issue before then.   However, Sand stated both buyout offers would have to remain ineffect for at least three business days after he ruled on thepoison pill issue, effectively extending Campeau's offer throughnext week.</TEXT></DOC>
