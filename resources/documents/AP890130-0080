Franz Schoenhuber, a burly man with bushy eyebrows and aswashbuckling manner, rejects charges that his party is racist andhates foreigners. After Sunday's vote, the 66-year-old butcher's sonsaid the Republicans stood for ``patriotic'' causes.   His Republicans, who campaigned for sharply reducing the numberof foreign workers and Third World asylum-seekers in the nation, won7.5 percent of Sunday's vote and gained 11 seats in West Berlin's138-seat legislature.   Born in the Bavarian village of Trostberg, Schoenhubervolunteered for Adolf Hitler's air force in 1942 at age 19 but wasruled unfit to fly.   He then became a Nazi SS soldier and received training in anelite, hand-picked unit that initially served as Hitler's personalguard.   Schoenhuber fought in France and on the Eastern front beforespending 1{ years in British captivity.   After the war, he worked as an actor and a sports reporter. Helater worked as columnist for the Munich mass-circulation newspaperAbendzeitung and in 1972 became editor-in-chief of another Munichtabloid, TZ.   Later that year, Schoenhuber went to work for the Bavarian stateradio, Bayerische Rundfunk, and eventually became the moderator of apopular show in which politicians faced questions from citizens in aMunich tavern.   In 1981, he published ``I Was There,'' a book that described hisservice with the Waffen SS. The controversial book sold 60,000copies and became a best-seller, but Shoenhuber was forced to resignhis radio job and the chairmanship of the Bavarian Journalists Union.   Schoenhuber joined the Republican party shortly after it wasfounded in 1983.   The founders quit the party in 1985, saying his views onforeigners were too extreme. They accused Schoenhuber of trying tomodel the party after the organization of French right-wingextremist Jean-Marie Le Pen, who advocates limiting the number offoreign workers in his country.   While disputing the label ``extremist,'' Schoenhuber proudlyacknowledges that his party is ``rightist-conservative.''   Under his guidance, the Republicans made headlines by winning 3percent of the state vote in Bavaria in 1986.   The party's platform for the West Berlin elections said foreignworkers' contracts should have strict time limits and that theyshould not be allowed to bring their families to West Germany.   ``We are not the social welfare office of the Third World,'' theRepublicans' national spokesman, Harald Neubauer, said after theelection. ``We are for humane reunions of families of foreigners _in their home countries.''</TEXT></DOC>
