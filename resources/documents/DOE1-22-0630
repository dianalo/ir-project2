In addition, the problems associated with definingand obtaining an &quot;adequate&quot; reservoir description are discussed. Conclusionsare that laboratory flow experiments have great utility in discoveringand investigating fundamental displacement mechanisms and in establishingtrends that can lead to process optimization.</TEXT></DOC>
