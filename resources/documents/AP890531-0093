About 5,000 riot troopers in helmets and combat fatigues stoppedabout 1,000 students a few blocks from Myongdong Cathedral in thecity center. Police charged into the students several times anddragged away struggling protesters in a confrontation that lastedabout four hours.   Some students tried to ram through police lines to reach thecathedral, but most demonstrated peacefully.   Police said at least 500 students were arrested. Riot trooperskicked and beat some protesters who were hauled away and policesaid there were injuries among both troopers and students, but saidthey had no figures.   The students marched to the cathedral after 4,000 others tookpart earlier in rallies at 13 Seoul colleges. They called for theresignation of President Roh Tae-woo and protested the death ofdissident student Lee Chol-kyu, whom they claim was killed andtortured by police.   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Bring back Lee Chol-kyu!''students shouted.   The campus protests were peaceful except at Sogang University,where about 300 students battled police with firebombs and rocks.At least six people were hurt, police said.   Hundreds of students hurling rocks also clashed with police inthe southern city of Kwangju. Lee's body was found in a reservoirnear that city May 10.   A government report concluded Lee slipped and fell into thereservoir after fleeing a police roadblock. The report said therewas no evidence Lee was tortured or that police were involved inhis death.   Student leaders said hundreds of students today joined thehunger protest at the cathedral demanding the government admitpolice killed Lee. About 300 students began the hunger strike lastThursday, but their number dwindled to 60 by Tuesday. Studentleaders said about 500 students were now taking part in the hungerstrike, but there was no way to confirm the figure.   Doctors aiding the students said eight hunger strikers werehospitalized after collapsing and that scores gave up fastingbecause of weakness.   Riot police blocked the hunger strikers and about 300 protesterswhen they tried to march from the cathedral in a candlelightparade. Lines of police stopped the march, but there was noviolence.   Some radical student groups have called for peaceful protestsafter six riot troopers were killed May 3 in a campusdemonstration. The deaths outraged public opinion in South Korea.The South Korean radicals lack broad public support because oftheir violent tactics and extreme views.   Students said the cathedral protest is based on the same tacticsas those used by pro-democracy Chinese students in Beijing.   In a related development, news reports today said South Koreawill import spray guns that shoot tear gas mixed with water toreplace controversial rifles that shoot tear gas canisters. About230 guns will be imported from Israel to combat the violentprotests, according to the daily Chosun Ilbo.   Police will also import water cannons from Austria, thenewspaper said. Police refused comment on the reports.   There has been public outcry against police for using the riflesand armored vans carrying multiple tear gas launchers. The straighttear gas has caused injuries and some deaths.</TEXT></DOC>
