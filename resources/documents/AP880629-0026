Al-Sabah said in an interview. ``It's like buying a carwithout all the equipment that goes with it.''   Congress is reviewing the administration plan to sell $1.9billion worth of F-A-18s and armaments to Kuwait, which says itneeds the equipment to defend against attacks by participants inthe nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.   Three U.S. allies have been authorized to buy F-A-18s, theNavy's newest and fastest combination interceptor-bomber, butKuwait would be the first Arab nation to receive them.   The height of Capitol Hill concern about the sale is not theplanes, but the 300 Maverick antitank and antiship missiles thatwould be mounted on the aircraft.   The 20 senators and more than 50 congressmen who signed a letterexpressing reservations about the sale say they are worried aboutthe escalation of sophisticated weaponry in the region, notablyamong countries potentially hostile to Israel.   Al-Sabah said he believes the sale will go through, but added:``You cannot have an airplane flying without munitions. Unlessthere is sufficient ammunition to support this high-tech equipment,you would be buying something that in the end would be worthless.   ``We're not buying the aircraft to fly around in our leisure,''he said. ``You could buy a much cheaper aircraft for that purpose.''   The defense relationship between the United States and Kuwaithas grown in recent months with the ``reflagging'' of Kuwaitivessels to put them under the umbrella of U.S. naval protection.   In a visit designed to highlight the extent of the relationship,Kuwait's crown prince and prime minister, Shaikh Saad Al-AbdullahAl-Salem Al-Sabah will come to the United States in early July.   It will be the first state visit by a Kuwaiti leader sinceNovember 1968 and will include meetings with President Reagan, VicePresident George Bush, congressional leaders and members of theU.S. foreign policy establishment.   When Kuwait's emir came 20 years ago, he met President LyndonJohnson and President-elect Richard M. Nixon. There are no plansfor Shaikh Saad to meet the expected Democratic presidentialnominee, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, but the ambassadorsaid a get-together could be arranged if Dukakis is interested.   ``We have been on the front pages for the past 18 months or twoyears now,'' the ambassador said. ``I think the U.S. people havethe right to find out what Kuwait is all about, to know the leadersof Kuwait and to hear what they have to say.''   Shaikh Saad is especially eager to draw attention to Kuwait'sview that the deployment of U.S. and allied vessels in the PersianGulf does not merely help Kuwait, but safeguards the world's oilshipments, the ambassador said.   The message will be that the United States should ``stay thecourse'' as long as the gulf war continues and especially duringthe transition to the next U.S. administration, Al-Sabah said.   He predicted that the next administration, whether it beDemocrat or Republican, would maintain the policy, ``but there isalways a reevaluation.''   As for the chance of a peaceful settlement between Iran andIraq, the ambassador said, ``We see no light at the end of thetunnel. Every time our hopes are raised that this war is windingdown, we are faced with a new offensive or counteroffensive.''</TEXT></DOC>
