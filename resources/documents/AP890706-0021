But he's saying ``no thanks'' to a House offer of $75 million ifthe Texas task force is kept in operation and a similar unit isestablished in Southern California.   The two areas have the biggest backlog of Sandamp;L fraud cases. Theyalso account for about two-thirds of the thrift losses behind a $157billion bailout of the nation's biggest financial disaster since the1930s depression.   ``What we prefer to do is have the flexibility to move ourresources where they are necessary,'' Thornburgh said Wednesday. Hesaid his department will oppose the mandated task forces whenlawmakers start reconciling differences between House and Senateversions of the bill next week.   Meanwhile, Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wallsaid Wednesday that net withdrawals from the nation's 2,934 Sandamp;Lseased for the fourth month in a row in May.   Wall told reporters there was only a ``slight outflow'' ofdeposits in May, compared with $5.4 billion taken out in April.   Including interest credited to depositors' accounts, depositsactually rose in May, the first time that has occurred since lastDecember, Wall said. But, excluding interest, depositors took outmore money than they put in.   Thornburgh called a press conference Wednesday to announce theconviction of three former Dallas Sandamp;L executives on fraud and otherinsider abuse charges and the indictment of a fourth person.   He attributed the convictions _ all on guilty pleas _ andindictment to the special Dallas task force and said it is evidenceof what can be done if Congress provides ``the tools needed to dothe job.''   Since its creation two years ago, the task force _ a jointoperation of the Justice Department's criminal division, the U.S.attorney's office in Dallas, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Serviceand the bank board _ has obtained 50 indictments and 32 convictions,Thornburgh said.   But he said he opposes a provision in the House Sandamp;L bailout billthat would mandate the task forces for three years. Instead,Thornburgh endorsed a Senate version that parallels exactlyPresident Bush's proposal to devote $50 million over the next threeyears for prosecuting Sandamp;L fraud but with no strings on how the moneyis spent.   The three former Sandamp;L executives listed Wednesday by Thornburgh asentering guilty pleas are:   _John H. Roberts Jr., former president of Summit SavingsAssociation of Dallas, who was accused of using a nominee borrowerto obtain a $4.5 million loan from the institution in order toprovide an airplane for Roberts' personal use. He faces a maximumprison term of 10 years and a $15,000 fine.   _Joseph R. Smith, former vice president at Sunbelt SavingsAssociation in Dallas, who was accused of conspiring to defraud thebank board and the IRS. He faces a maximum sentence of five yearsand a fine of up to $250,000.   _Kenneth C. Hood, former vice president of Western SavingsAssociation in Dallas, who was accused of attempting to defraud theIRS by creating artificial ``losses'' and by making a falsestatement in connection with a $11.3 million loan from Sunbelt. Hefaces a maximum sentence of seven years in prison and a fine of$500,000.   Indicted was Bob R. Franks, former president of Northpark SavingsAssociation in Richardson, Texas. Franks is accused of illegallydiverting $138,000 in Northpark funds to make an interest payment ona $2.95 million loan from Centennial Savings Association ofGreenville, Texas.
