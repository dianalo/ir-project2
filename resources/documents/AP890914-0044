PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The KGB says its modern agents are well-educatedfamily men who spend almost as much time fighting ``scourges ofhumanity'' like terrorism and drug trafficking as they do keepingtabs on CIA agents.   But officials deny that they routinely eavesdrop on foreigners inMoscow or that they have done anything illegal in pursuingdissidents since the 1960s.   The feared Soviet secret service is trying to build a new imageof openness in keeping with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev'sreforms, and on Wednesday premiered the first Soviet documentaryfilm about the KGB.   Officials fielded questions from reporters for more than an hourafterwards, but their answers indicated glasnost only goes so far.   The officers told the news conference that the KGB had donenothing illegal in pursuing dissidents since the 1960s.   The 55-minute film ``The KGB Today,'' and a short film of aninterview with KGB Chairman Gen. Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, painted aportrait of what the secret police chief called the ``modern Chekaman,'' a well-educated professional whose work increasinglyencompasses the struggle against smuggling, organized crime and drugtrafficking.   Cheka was the name of the original Bolshevik secret policeorganization.   ``At present we're trying to create an objective image of ourorganization in the Soviet Union and abroad,'' Kryuchkov said in thefilm, which was shot by the government news agency Novosti.   Novosti officials billed the film as the first documentary aboutthe KGB. They said they hoped it, and more to follow, would be seenwidely in the Soviet Union and distributed outside the country.   Kryuchkov, who took over from Viktor M. Chebrikov as KGB chieflast year, has opened up the top-secret organization somewhat duringhis almost one year as chairman. He has granted interviews toforeign reporters and said the feared organization should be subjectto legislative oversight.   But he was greeted with snorts of laughter when he told nationallegislators at his confirmation hearing in July that the KGB doesnot tap telephones of Soviet citizens.   In the spirit of openness, the KGB gave filmmakers ElenaKovalieva and Stanislav Belianinov access to KGB martial artstraining, target practice, and the interior of KGB headquarters andof Lefortovo Prison in northeast Moscow.   The film devoted several minutes to Kim Philby, the Britishsecret service officer who spied for the KGB, and included are-creation of the apprehension of a U.S. diplomat on spying chargessix years ago.   The diplomat, Vice Consul Lon David Augustenborg of the LeningradConsulate, was expelled Sept. 12, 1983.   Officials said the KGB had agreed to cooperate in a British-madefilm about Philby, who fled to the Soviet Union in 1963 and died inMay 1988 in Moscow.   Kryuchkov and other KGB officials acknowledge that the KGB'spredecessor, Stalin's NKVD, broke laws in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.   But they said the KGB did not violate any laws in pressuringdissidents. Virtually every Soviet dissident of the past quartercentury has stories of KGB harassment ranging from searches andseizure of manuscripts to interrogations and beatings.   The number of such reports has dropped in recent years underGorbachev's reforms. Many dissidents have left the country andothers have found that the critical viewpoints that once made thempariahs now are well within official bounds. Those still active indissident activities say the KGB is less active, but stillunmistakeably present.   ``In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s the KGB did not violate the law,it abided by the letter and the spirit of the law,'' said KGBspokesman Col. Igor Prelin. ``It's not us who adopted the laws. Wemade decisions based on the laws.''   Westerners and many dissidents in Moscow assume that theirtelephones and apartments are bugged.   Pressed by one Western reporter to discuss bugging, KGB Chief ofInvestigations Col. Oleg Dobrovolsky said, ``I don't think you'reright, saying we tap telephones, that we listen to what you say overtelephones. You've got to prove that first, before you ask thatquestion.''   ``Sometimes, if it is in the interest of state security, we maylisten to telephones but that's not an established practice, youknow,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
