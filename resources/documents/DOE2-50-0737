<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-50-0737 </DOCNO><TEXT>A re-examination of the current literature shows that there exists atleast three classes of two-dimensional large eddy states in weakly stratifiedatmospheric boundary layers. Two of these states contain multiscale largeeddies, with horizontal scales on the order of the boundary-layer depth,as well as several times this depth. The theory discussed here attemptsto explain this structure as the result of wave-wave interactions betweengrowing disturbances to a model mean flow-a neutrally stratified Ekmanlayer. Nonlinear, coupled equations are derived that give the temporalevolution of a set of three isolated disturbances in a general unstableflow. The equations model large eddy/large eddy and large eddy/mean flowinteraction. A general theorem shows that the linearly fastest growingdisturbances act as a catalyst for the acceleration of the growth ofinitially slowly growing, or decaying disturbances. In essence, the fastest-growingdisturbances become unstable as they grow. This theorem also shows thelimitations of standard resonance concepts in unstable flow regimes,and points out the importance of initial conditions, such as boundaryirregularities or other sources of waves, in determining final flow fields.</TEXT></DOC>
