Maier will resign as vice chairman and president, effective Jan. 1, and as chairman and chief executive officer of its Kaiser Aluminum andamp; Chemical Corp. unit, effective June 26.    The 62-year-old executive's resignation from the helm of Kaiser Aluminum follows his unsuccessful battle last year to rebuff a takeover by an investor group led by Britain-based Alan E. Clore. In April, Mr. Clore, who controls a company that holds about 31% of KaiserTech's stock, replaced Mr. Maier as KaiserTech's chairman and chief executive when shareholders approved a plan to create Oakland, Calif.-based KaiserTech as the new parent company of Kaiser Aluminum.    KaiserTech said James S. Pasman Jr., 56, will succeed Mr. Maier as chairman and chief executive of Kaiser Aluminum. Mr. Pasman is a former vice chairman, director and chief financial officer of Aluminum Co. of America. KaiserTech didn't name successors for Mr. Maier in his posts at the parent.    The company said Mr. Maier will remain a director and member of the executive committees of KaiserTech and Kaiser Aluminum, and will serve as a consultant to both companies through 1992.    During last year's protracted takeover war, Mr. Maier was known to be particularly hostile toward the entreaties of Mr. Clore's investor group. For example, after an early skirmish in which Mr. Maier's slate of directors defeated a slate that included Mr. Clore in a proxy fight, Mr. Maier jabbed: &quot;We beat the hell out of them.&quot;    Mr. Maier, who eventually called Mr. Clore's control of the company &quot;very exciting,&quot; said through a spokesman that he is resigning his Kaiser posts &quot;on his own initiative.&quot; The spokesman added that Mr. Maier's continuing relationship with the company as director and consultant reflects the executive's eagerness to help the company prosper in the future.    In the first quarter, Kaiser had a net loss of $29.3 million, compared with net income of $17.4 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier period included a pre-tax gain of $51.4 million. Revenue in the quarter fell 8.5% to $546 million from $596.7 million.    Mr. Maier will receive severance pay of about $1 million from KaiserTech, in accordance with a so-called golden parachute formula established by Kaiser Aluminum last year. The severance package calls for Kaiser Aluminum's top five officers and some other employees to receive 2.5 times their base salaries in the event a change in corporate control results in their positions being altered or terminated. </TEXT></DOC>
