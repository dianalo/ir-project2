The ABC News-Washington Post poll of 1,242 likely voters put thecontest at 52-44 percent, closer than the 13-point gap in a CBSNews-New York Times poll and the 14 points among likely voters in aGallup poll released Tuesday.   The ABC-Post poll was conducted during the seven days endingTuesday, rather than the three- and four-day field periods of theearlier polls.   That could account for differing results. Polls done during fewerdays are more liable to be influenced by daily movements in voterpreference. In polls done over more time, changes may be tempered bydays of stable opinion.   ABC-Post polls have showed slight movement in the race, with Bushahead by six points in an Oct. 5-11 poll, seven in an Oct. 12-18poll and eight now. The Gallup and CBS-Times polls, done in shorterperiods, found more movement for Bush after the Oct. 13 presidentialdebate.   The margin of sampling error in the ABC-Post poll was plus orminus three percentage points.</TEXT></DOC>
