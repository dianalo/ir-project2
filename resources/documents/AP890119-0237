Bush said his inaugural address, after taking the presidentialoath at noon Friday, would be ``a broad appeal to the Americanpeople to pitch in and help,'' but without many specific calls toaction.   Bush met with news agency journalists at the White House prior toreporting to the Oval Office for his last meeting with PresidentReagan as his subordinate. After talking privately _ a weekly habiton Thursdays for eight years _ the pair went to the Roosevelt Roomto share their sentiments with senior White House aides.   According to spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, Bush said ``I wouldn'tbe the president if not for my teacher here, and my friend.''Reagan, the spokesman said, expressed equal warmth for hissuccessor, and quipped: ``George never took my pulse once.''   Bush's upbeat mood was matched by Washington's glorious weather.Inaugural celebrants strolled to and fro without topcoats in thebalmy-for-January sunshine. A mixture of sunshine and clouds, withan afternoon chill, was predicted for Friday, when Bush takes theoath and more than 10,000 performers join his parade to the WhiteHouse.   Four years ago, the weather was so harsh that Reagan had to besworn in indoors and his inauguration parade was cancelled.   Bush said his inaugural address ``will be an expression ofsatisfaction about how far we've come as a nation, and a recognitionthat we've got a long way to go,'' the president-elect said in aninterview. At the same time, he called the concept of a busy ``first100 days'' with Congress one ``that doesn't really apply'' to asitting vice president elected to the presidency.   He said, too, he is not ready to entertain the idea of meetingthis year with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, and ``I don't thinkwe know yet'' when U.S. negotiators will be prepared to resumestrategic arms reduction talks, once set for Feb. 15.   ``I think the Soviets understand that my intention is not to dragmy feet, but to simply do a prudent reassessment,'' Bush said. ``Idon't think progress should be measured solely on whether there's asummit meeting.''   Bush spent much of the day out of the public eye after a morningspeech to high school students. He promised he will do ``all in mypower'' to help young people flourish, saying America's ``best daysare yet to come.''   Barbara Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle, meanwhile, tooktheir special turns in the inaugural spotlight before joining theirspouses and 12,000 other black-tie revelers for a $9 millionentertainment gala, televised live to the nation by CBS.   The outgoing chief executive spent his last full day in officesaying goodbyes. Meeting reporters, he discussed a somber aspect ofhis presidency _ his failure to win the release of nine Americansheld hostage in Lebanon, some for nearly four years.   ``We don't know where they are,'' Reagan admitted, saying anyrescue attempt would have been foolhardy.   ``There hasn't been a moment that this hasn't been on my mind,''he told news service reporters.   Bush, appearing before the audience of top high school studentsfrom around the country, borrowed a line from Franklin DelanoRoosevelt: ``We can't always build a future for our youth, but wecan build our youth for the future.''   He also talked about Americans' characteristic optimism, and said``No one better personifies that than a president named RonaldReagan, whose shoes are going to be pretty darn hard to fill.''   Quayle, appearing separately before the same students, made aconfession: ``As one looks back at life, I'll be the first to admitI wish I had taken education more seriously.''   In the Capitol, where workers buffed the heavy mahogany doorsthrough which Reagan will usher his successor, the Senate ForeignRelations Committee unanimously approved Bush's senior cabinetappointee, Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III, who hadappealed during confirmation hearings this week for a restoration ofbipartisanship in foreign policy.   Mrs. Bush, 63, an ample, white-haired, grandmother whosetrademark is a three-strand chocker of artificial pearls, wowed12,000 guests who spilled into the three main halls of the John F.Kennedy Center for a $50-a-person ``Salute to the First Lady.''   She took note of the elegant surroundings, then said: ``Speakingof glamor, I want you all to look at me very carefully.'' Strikingcoquettish expression, she continued: ``Please notice the hair, themakeup, the designer clothes.'' With that, she whipped open the coatof her blue suit, revealing a patterned lining to match her scarf.   The audience roared, then burst into ovation when she added:``Look at me and remember. You may never see it again.''   She also exacted no small revenge for the playful chiding shetook from her husband on Wednesday, when Bush repeatedly toldaudiences she was getting ``mean and tough and ugly'' about makinghim do household chores _ especially packing for the move.   ``This is a good day for me to set something straight,'' Mrs.Bush said. ``George went around town all day yesterday, telling thatstory about the rigors of packing ...   ``Who remembers where George Bush was last weekend? Fishing. Somuch for the packing story. He won't dare tell that story again.''   The black-tie, invitation-only gala at the Washington ConventionCenter was expected to draw a television audience of 40 millionpeople. Headliners for the prime-time extravaganza included FrankSinatra, ballet star Mikhail Baryshnikov, the Mormon TabernacleChoir and two Bush favorites _ country singers Loretta Lynn and theOak Ridge Boys.   Comedian Bob Hope, the grand marshal for Friday's inauguralparade down Pennsylvania Avenue, was summoned for a ``surprise''appearance at the gala, expected to gross $9 million in ticket salesand revenues from TV commercials. That will help defray theestimated $25 million in total costs for the inaugural festivities.   Guests at the gala were paying as much as $250 per seat,depending on location, and $25,000 for an eight-seat ``box'' closeto the stage crowned by a canopy emblazoned with gold stars.   Bush laughed at himself in his talk to the high school students.   ``I certainly learned the importance of education during thecampaign,'' he said. ``I learned how vital it is to memorize dates _Pearl Harbor day, for example.'' Bush got that one woefully wrongduring the campaign.   But if Bush has straightened out his dates, he still needs helpon names. He told the youngsters he hopes to do better in hisinaugural address than ``Benjamin Harrison did. He spoke for an hourand a half and then got pneumonia and died a few weeks later.''Actually, that was William Henry Harrison, Benjamin's grandfather.</TEXT></DOC>
