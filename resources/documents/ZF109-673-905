 Cheneygave Andrews a Dec. 16 deadline for presenting a plan for following CIMprinciples throughout the department.andM;Andrews also will take over as chairman of DOD's Major Automated InformationSystems Review Committee, Cheney said.andP;  Formerly, DOD Comptroller SeanO'Keefe controlled both CIM and the MAISRC.andM;In the same memo, Cheney approved the Plan for Corporate InformationManagement for the Department of Defense that a task force of companyexecutives submitted in September.andM;As part of the Bush administration's continuing Defense Management Review(DMR), DOD created the task force earlier this year to oversee CIM and theconsolidation of ADP and software design centers.andM;A Pentagon spokeswoman said the executives' CIM plan has not been madepublic.andP;  Cheney's memo, however, indicated the task force concluded thatefforts by the military services and defense agencies to consolidate theirown ADP centers need not be extended by CIM consolidators.andM;&quot;The operation of data processing centers will remain the responsibility ofthe various Department of Defense components,&quot; Cheney said.andM;Last summer, officials working for O'Keefe presented a scenario under whichthe 42 major centers remaining after service consolidations could be cut downto 18 &quot;magnet centers&quot; through CIM.andM;ADP ControlandM;Under that plan, the Defense Communications Agency or some newly createdagency would have taken control of all DOD ADP centers, officials said.andM;Besides CIM, Cheney gave Andrews &quot;authority, direction and control over&quot; DCA,the Defense Mapping Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, according toa memo from Donald Atwood, deputy Defense secretary.andM;Cheney and Atwood also gave Andrews broad powers over &quot;acquisition-relatedactivities,&quot; leading to speculation that DCA might become CIM's centralprocurement authority.andM;Pentagon and DCA officials said they will not comment on any expansion ofDCA's role in ADP or CIM pending the outcome of planning that Andrews hasundertaken.andM;Cheney's directive also aroused speculation that the principal CIM operativesin the Pentagon, Cynthia Kendall, deputy comptroller for IRM, and BelkisLeong-Hong, the CIM director, will begin reporting to Andrews.andM;CIM was launched as part of the DMR earlier this year with the formation ofstudy groups at several different management levels both within and outsideDOD.andP;  Andrews has been a member of a CIM committee comprising DOD executives.andM;To date, the CIM plan's core work has been aimed at consolidatingrequirements for standard business systems to operate across DOD in eightfunctional areas such as medical, personnel, payroll and logisticsprocessing.andM;O'Keefe in June also directed the teams to identify interim standard systemswhere possible so as to eliminate duplication quickly.andM;Last month, to speed up the search for interim systems, Congress used thedefense authorization bill to extend the power of DOD's top CIM executive,then O'Keefe, to include oversight of $1 billion in systems development moneyrequested by the services and agencies.andM;Several DOD officials said they doubted Andrews could succeed at finishingthe requirements or disbursing this year's funds without keeping Kendall andLeong-Hong actively involved in CIM.andM;&quot;I can't imagine that [Andrews] could make decisions about how to disburse $1billion without relying on the people who've been involved in this from thebeginning,&quot; one service official said.andM;Others noted that the C31 operation Andrews runs is relatively small.andP;  &quot;Hedoesn't have nearly enough people to run CIM,&quot; a Pentagon official said.andM;In addition to CIM, Cheney decided to leave the MAISRC in its currentorganizational position as a committee of the Defense Acquisition Board.andP;  DABoversees weapons systems buys.andM;Systems OversightandM;In the January DMR report, officials asked the private-sector task force toconsider whether DAB or an independent authority should review informationsystems.andM;Since then, the MAISRC has been assigned a broader range of systems toreview, including several strategic information system upgrades formerlyreviewed by the DAB as part of broader weapons systems programs.andM;Those assignments followed recommendations from the General Accounting Officeand the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, which called on DOD tosubmit to MAISRC review projects like DCA's Worldwide Military Command andControl System ADP Modernization program and the Air Force's Strategic WarPlanning System upgrade.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
