A United Nations official involved in the inspection ofIraqi facilities has said that Iraq has enough uranium &quot;intheory&quot; to make from 20 to 40 nuclear weapons, according to adiplomat here. While it's doubtful Iraq actually can producea nuclear weapon any time soon, that represents a far largerstock of uranium than Iraq previously was thought to possess.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, U.S. officials said they expect the U.S.,Britain and France will announce this week that the remainingallied troops in Iraq are being withdrawn. After thewithdrawal, several thousand allied troops, mainly from thethree allied countries, will be based in Turkey near theIraqi border to protect Iraq's Kurdish population.   As a United Nations team continues its inspection ofIraq's nuclear facilities, Mr. Bush said during a White Housenews conference, &quot;When you're burying component parts off inthe desert somewhere, or in somebody's attic, or somebody'sbasement in downtown Baghdad, if that's what's happening, itis pretty hard to certify&quot; that the entire nuclear-weaponsprogram has been detected and destroyed.   The White House has said it would seriously consider amilitary strike to eliminate Iraqi nuclear facilities ifSaddam Hussein doesn't cooperate with internationalauthorities. However, Mr. Bush's admission that it isimpossible to know with certainty the whereabouts of nuclearcomponents underscores the difficulty of such a mission.   According to a report on NBC-TV last night, Pentagonofficials have assembled a list of as many as 100 potentialbombing targets inside Iraq, including some locations thatreceived little scrutiny during the war. Defense officialssaid various target lists, ranging from a few dozen to morethan 100 sites, have been created over the past few weeksbased on information culled from reconnaissance pictures.   Under the threat of U.S. military action, Iraq this weekreleased a 29-page inventory of its nuclear equipment. Mr.Bush said at his news conference that the move showed&quot;progress,&quot; but he added that &quot;there is still reason tobelieve that he {Saddam Hussein} is hiding {some nuclearcomponents} and has not come totally clean.&quot; Earlier thisweek, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler saidIraq's list contained &quot;significant omissions anddiscrepancies.&quot;   Iraq claims that its nuclear program is for civilianpurposes only, and that it didn't previously disclose some ofits elements for &quot;national security&quot; reasons.   Mr. Bush said the allies would never take Saddam Hussein'sword about whether he has been trying to produce nuclearweapons. But he pointedly added, &quot;We'd be perfectly willingto give the {Iraqi} military another chance, provided SaddamHussein was out of there and representations were made to therest of the world of their willingness . . . to abide bythese U.N. resolutions&quot; calling for the elimination of Iraq'sweapons of mass destruction.   At yesterday's news conference, Mr. Bush also reaffirmedhis total confidence in Robert Gates, the deputy nationalsecurity adviser whom he has nominated to be director of theCentral Intelligence Agency. There have been publishedreports that CIA officials who worked closely with Mr. Gatesduring the Reagan administration, when the nominee was at theagency, were aware of the secret diversion of funds to theNicaraguan Contras. But Mr. Bush said such reports didn't&quot;lessen my confidence in Gates,&quot; whose confirmation hearingbefore the Senate Intelligence Committee begins Monday.   Mr. Bush also announced that he had accepted therecommendations of a commission on military base closings.The report calls for closing 25 bases and consolidating orreducing 40 others.</TEXT></DOC>
