The ``World Refugee Survey'' from the U.S. Committee forRefugees said the number of refugees worldwide increased from 11.7million in 1986 to 13.3 million last year, but many of thoseseeking asylum here were discouraged by harsh Immigration andNaturalization policies, particularly in regard to refugees from ElSalvador, Haiti and Indochina.   ``Rather than granting the asylum seeker ... to present his casefreely and fairly, we seem to do everything in our power toprejudge him as a cheat and treat him like a criminal,'' BillFrelick, assistant editor of the report, said.   ``The problem may not be a question of law. But it is a questionof justice.''   Frelick quoted a report by the congressional General AccountingOffice saying that in New York the U.S. Immigration andNaturalization Service detained criminal aliens from El Salvadorand Haiti, along with others.   Some guards under contract are charged with ``lack of vigilance,gross negligence to duty, and suspected collusion in detaineeescapes.''   He also quotes a sworn statement from an Afghan he says wasexcluded after six months of detention:   ``From this jail and the mental torture I have been put through,it has become clear to me that what I heard about the UnitedStates... is nothing other than a dream and propaganda. The UnitedStates will never extend a helping hand to me.''   The signer of the statement is not named.   INS spokesman Verne Jervis did not immediately respond torequests for comment on the report.   A State Department official said the United States screensfleeing Haitians to determine who are political refugees. TheUnited States has an agreement with Haiti that providesinternational access to those sent home to see they are welltreated.   Court Robinson, the committee's specialist on southeast Asia,predicted in an interview Monday that the number of Indochinesebrought into this country from camps in Thailand will fall short ofthe permitted 29,500 in the year ending Sept. 30.   But the State Department official responded that the ceilingusually is reached and that another 8,500 can come directly fromVietnam, if the Vietnamese government permits.   Robinson said the Thai government had virtually stopped takingany more refugees at the end of January. Thailand already had morethan 404,000, nearly all from the communist-ruled countries ofIndochina, according to the survey.   The survey also reported diminishing opportunities for refugeesreaching other countries with more resources to take care of them.Canada's government, angered by boatloads of undocumented Asians,is pushing through Parliament a law that will make it a crime tobring them in without proper papers and will permit aliens to bedetained.   West Germany cut applications for asylum almost in half byturning away those who had spent more than three months in anothercountry considered safe, Frelick says.   New restrictions are also reported from Britain and Switzerland.   The number of refugees seeking homes in the United States andother western industrial countries is small compared with thebiggest new wave: 350,000 who fled to Malawi last year from therebellion against the government of Mozambique in southeasternAfrica.   ``At the end of 1987, more than 2 million of these affectedpersons are are physically displaced within Mozambique, and morethan 800,000 others have sought refuge from the conflict in theneighboring countries of Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Swaziland andSouth Africa,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., wrote in anarticle in the survey.   Though there was no one big movement last year, the numbeer ofAfghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran, and of Ethiopian refugees inSomalia and Sudan are much greater. The survey quotes Louis andNancy Hatch Dupree of Duke University as putting the total numberof Afghans in Pakistan at 3.2 million with 6,000 to 8,000 arrivingevery month. The survey puts another 2.2 million in Iran.   It estimates that there are 677,000 Ethiopians in Sudan andanother 430,000 in Somalia, though the last number is disputed.   The U.S. Committee for Refugees is supported by the FordFoundation, religious groups and charities.</TEXT></DOC>
