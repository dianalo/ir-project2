Balks At Boosting Reserves For Junk-Bond Losses </HL><SO> </SO><CO> ICA GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK BON </IN><DATELINE> SAN DIEGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Imperial Corp. of America, a thrift company with big junk-bond holdings, said it is involved in a dispute with federal regulators over reserves for losses on those bonds.    Federal regulators have suggested that Imperial Corp. establish a general loss allowance of 2.2% on its investment in junk bonds, which Imperial says would have reduced earnings last year by $13.4 million. For 1987, Imperial Corp. reported net income of $51.3 million, or $3.46 a share, up from $50.3 million, or $3.41 a share, a year earlier.    Imperial Corp. maintains that additional reserves aren't required and said that the matter is being reviewed by various bank board units in Washington.    Imperial Corp. had $1.47 billion of junk bonds in its investment portfolio at June 30, or 12.2% of its total asssets of $12.09 billion. Imperial has set up a $21.8 million reserve for possible losses on the junk bonds, which are high-yield, low-rated corporate debt securities. </TEXT></DOC>
