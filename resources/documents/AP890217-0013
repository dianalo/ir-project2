The Arab Cooperation Council born Thursday in Baghdad and theUnion of Maghreb Arab Countries under discussion in Morocco reflectmodern economic concerns, including reduced trade barriers and theopening of internal markets.   Their model is closer to the European Common Market than theill-fated United Arab Republic that joined Syria and Egypt as asingle nation from 1958 to 1961.   Dozens of Arab unity proposals have been born and died since theregion gained its independence from European powers after World WarII, frustrated by the borders dividing people with a common languageand common culture.   Many tried in a stroke to sweep away the frontiers, physicallyunite armed forces or unify foreign policy. Virtually all effortsfailed, victims of internal rivalry, external interference orshifting political tides.   But like the EEC, the new groupings have a political impact.   They have divided the Arab world into three main economic blocs:the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council in the Arabian Peninsula,the five-country Maghreb Union stretching from Libya to the Atlanticand the Arab Cooperation Council of Iraq, Egypt, Jordan and NorthYemen.   If successful, the new groupings will give their members accessto wider markets that should make their farms and industries moreefficient and enhance their bargaining power in the world economy.   It might also be easier for the three blocs to reach effectiveagreements on economic cooperation than it has been for the 21individual Arab countries.   The Gulf Cooperation Council, formed in 1981, evolved into amilitary and olitical alliance under the threat of the Iran-Iraq war.   While the leaders of the new Arab Council deny plans to form amilitary bloc or a political alliance, Egypt, Iraq and Jordanalready cooperate militarily in some ways.   They also include two of the Arab world's strongest militaryforces _ Iraq and Egypt _ as well as one of the best trained, Jordan.   Several of the leaders have acknowledged their economiccooperation has political implications. Their charter said theyacted in part to enhance ``pan-Arab security against current orfuture threats.''   But while they have left the door open to other states, the unionwill arouse apprehension in other quarters.   Syrian leaders cannot enjoy watching Jordanian TV reach intoSyrian homes with celebratory broadcasts of singers lauding IraqiPresident Saddam Hussein as ``Saddam the Joy.''   They remain deeply at odds with both Egypt and Iraq, which havetightened their embrace of a Syrian friend, Jordan.   The union adds to Syria's isolation, already aggravated by Arabsupport for Iraq in the Persian Gulf war, where fighting was haltedAug. 20 under a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire, and Egypt's reintegrationinto the Arab fold after years of estrangement following its 1979peace treaty with Israel.   The new council also helps cement Egypt's return to the Arabworld.   But the political clout of the Arab Council will be limited byeconomic difficulties faced by all four countries, as well as byoutside interests all still maintain.   Jordan, Iraq and Egypt particularly look to Saudi Arabia foreconomic aid and can ill afford to alienate it.   The new agreement ties Iraq to Arab countries lying to the west,but Baghdad is counting on money from its southern gulf neighbors tohelp finance post-war reconstruction.</TEXT></DOC>
