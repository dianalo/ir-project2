We have the answer. However he votes on Roe v.Wade, nothing.   The Supreme Court has already said it is willing to upholdrestrictions on abortions that the states, it turns out, areunwilling to legislate. Some 40 states have considered about300 new abortion restrictions during the past year. Onlythree states actually approved new laws, and none comes closeto banning abortions. With the passion on both sides, no oneseems to have noticed that the Supreme Court has been madeirrelevant to the availability of abortions by the very forcethat the liberal activist Justices feared most: politics.</LP><TEXT>   Beginning last year, a slight conservative majority issuedopinions that upheld restrictions on abortions such asparental notifications for minors. This set off an explosionof political activity. The net results:   Pennsylvania now requires wives to notify their husbands,bans abortion for gender selection and prohibits abortionsafter the second trimester. South Carolina requires parentalconsent. West Virginia passed a law to limit public funding.Even Louisiana and Idaho are tied in knots.   If anti-abortion forces do prevail in, say, Louisiana, themost that will happen is that to get an abortion women willhave to cross a state line. Anti-abortion politicians fromNew Jersey to California have been scampering to muddy theirpositions.   As a matter of academic interest, it's also clear how theDavid Souters of the bar think about abortion. It isperfectly clear to anyone who looks that the word &quot;abortion&quot;does not occur in the Constitution; if a Justice Souter werepresented Roe v. Wade on a blank slate, he'd snort it out ofcourt. Whether he'd overturn it now depends on how hebalances stare decisis with his duty to uphold theConstitution. We can totally assure the nervous pro-choicenellies that he will never read anywhere in the Constitutionthat abortion is a crime.   This important point should not be lost. Justice Souterwill not read through the Constitution to find some penumbraor emanation declaring that life begins at conception. Norwill Justice Rehnquist, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy,Justice O'Connor. Nor for that matter would a Justice EdithJones, a Justice Laurence Silberman or a Justice ClarenceThomas. Nor a Justice Robert Bork. Instead, they would rulethat abortion is not a constitutional issue for judges, butan issue reserved to the people to decide for themselves inthe states.   The wisdom of this position is already evident in the waythe abortion issue is sorting itself out once the courtstarted to let it. The pro-choice lobby is finding it neednot hide behind the court's skirts, and may eventually stoptalking as if abortion is some kind of sacrament. Thepro-life lobby is at least finally allowed to have its say,and may start to calm its own hysteria. If it fails to outlawabortion in the legislatures, after all, it will still have achance to convince women that what's legal is nonethelesssinful. This process will allow society to resolve its deepdivisions in a much healthier way than having nine Justicesweave constitutional law out of nothing.   If Roe v. Wade is approaching legal irrelevancy, why arethe liberal activists devoting such efforts in its name? Onereason is that this case is one of the few remaining symbolsof a declining era in the Supreme Court and a fading view ofits proper duties. Liberals since the Warren Court haveregarded the federal courts as their preserve, an institutionthat would bus schoolchildren, enforce quotas and advance theliberal agenda despite its failures at the polls. This willchange as the Reagan and Bush judges at all levels make theirpresence felt.   More broadly, rumbling underneath the debate about JudgeSouter is the fundamental question of what the courts arefor. The business of the Supreme Court is to ensure justicein accordance with the Constitution. It is no secret that theAmerican system of justice leaves much to be desired. It isfair to ask, where was the Supreme Court when the policediscovered they could no longer convict criminals? Where werethe Justices as our civil-liability system imploded withsenseless and costly litigation? The answer is that the courthas ignored rule-of-law problems to find room on its docketfor essentially political cases.   Instead of irrelevant issues, we'd like to know JudgeSouter's view of the role of the courts. Will he vote toreview the exclusionary rule that suppresses evidence ofcrimes? Will he vote to hear cases that can defuse ourlitigation explosion? Will he help make the Supreme Courtonce again the final arbiter not on social policy, but onlaw?</TEXT></DOC>
