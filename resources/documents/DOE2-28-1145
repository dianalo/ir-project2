After cream feeding, the proportion of radioactivity foundin phospholipids was high and increased during the first 3 h. After themeal 61 +/- 6% of the {sup 3}H and 57 +/- 10% of the {sup 14}C was inphosphatidylcholine, and 11 +/- 3% of the {sup 3}H and 3.0 +/- 4% ofthe {sup 14}C was in phosphatidylethanolamine. Changing the fat vehicleto Intralipid or pure 18:2 decreased the proportion of label in the phospholipdsand increased the {sup 3}H and {sup 14}C radioactivity in the triacylglycerolfraction, the distribution of {sup 14}C radioactivity in the triacylglycerolfraction, the distribution of {sup 14}C being influenced more than thatof {sup 3}H. After feeding the tracers in 200 {mu}l of pure 20:4, andgt;90%of both isotopes was in triacylglycerol. During fasting, triacylglyceroltransported 56% (0.7 {mu}mol/h), phosphatidylethanolamine transported10% (0.1 {mu}mol/h) of the 20:4 mass. After cream or Intralipid feeding,the output of 20:4-containing phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamineincreased 2.1- to 2.8-fold, whereas the transport of 20:4 with triacylglycerolremained constant. Phospholipids thus became the predominant transportform for 20:4. After feeding 200 {mu}l of 20:4, the intestine produced,however, 20:4-rich triacylglycerols that transported 80% of the chyle20:4.</TEXT></DOC>
