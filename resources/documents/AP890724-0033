They are demanding that Gandhi step down and call new elections.   As deputies from deputies from Gandhi's Congress Party chanted``shame, shame,'' the lawmakers from the 12 opposition partieshanded their letters of resignation to Speaker Balram Jakhar.   Gandhi quietly looked on.   Although opposition politicians have in the past boycottedentire sessions of parliament, they had never resigned.   Still, Gandhi's party holds a solid majority in the 544-memberchamber and the opposition's departure likely will have no effect.   In a rare display of solidarity, the usually fractious andunruly opposition on Sunday announced its decision to resign,citing an auditor's report on inconsistencies in the 1986 purchaseof artillery from a Swedish firm.   By giving up their seats, opposition leaders said, they hopedthe billion-dollar deal would be a major issue in the next generalelection, which Gandhi must call by January.   ``Never before has the office of the prime minister been broughtinto disrepute as under the present incumbent,'' said V.P. Singh,leader of the People's Party. ``We were all elected by the peopleand now we are going back to them for their verdict on this issue.''   Government officials contend the deal was sanctioned by Sing,who at that time served as finance minister in Gandhi's Cabinet.Singh left the governing party in 1987.   As he left Parliament, Singh denied any wrongdoing but added ifanyone had proof, ``They should prosecute me.''   Besides the People's Party, the opposition parties include theIndian People's Party, the Party of the Telugus, the two majorCommunist parties and seven regional groups.   The rest of the seats are controlled by Gandhi's Congress Partyand independents.   After the auditor general's report was released on Tuesday,opposition members in parliament shouted anti-government slogans,called Gandhi a thief and demanded his resignation. When herefused, they walked out and stalled the proceeedings for threedays.   The $1.4 billion deal has been a major scandal for Gandhi'sgovernment because of allegations that the Swedish firm AB Boforspaid kickbacks to secure the contract.   Newspapers and opposition politicians say kickbacks amounting toat least $50 million were paid to senior government officials andto Congress Party coffers. The allegations have never been proved.   The report by the auditor general said the arms purchase wasflawed on technical considerations and cost assessment.   Opposition parties have been using the Bofors issue to try tomerge and mount a viable challenge to Gandhi and the Congress Partyin the general election. But their efforts have stalled insquabbling and widely-publicized power struggles for nearly a year.   N.T. Rama Rao, leader of the Telugus Party, said the decision toresign from parliment proved the opposition could unite on majorissues.   ``We are committed to give a clean government to the country,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
