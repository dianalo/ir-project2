(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some of the nation's top computerscientists are challenging big companies they claim are trying togain control over parts of computer programs as fundamental assteering wheels and pedals on cars.   A handful of computer firms have filed lawsuits asserting theyare entitled to copyrights over the ``look and feel'' of popularcomputer programs, including widely used commands, menus anddisplays.   ``If there were copyrights like this on cars, then everymanufacturer would have to give you a different way to steer,''said Richard Stallman, a 36-year-old programmer at theMassaachusetts Institute of Technology.   ``If you learned to drive a Ford, you wouldn't know how to driveChevrolets. Some cars would have throttles, others would havejoysticks, and each manufacturer would have to find a new way ofdoing it,'' he said.   Shouting slogans such as ``Hey hey, ho ho, software tyranny hasgot to go,'' about 150 MIT professors and students picketedWednesday outside the computer firm Lotus Development Corp.   The protesters, including programmers from Boston-area companiesand some top computer scientists, say the firms are trying to gainpermanent control over computers' most fundamental conventions.They've mounted a grass-roots campaign against companies suing overprogramming.   The rash of lawsuits includes complaints filed by Apple ComputerInc. against competitors Microsoft and Hewlett Packard Co., and byAshton Tate against Fox Software.   Lotus, which makes the best-selling computer accounting programLotus 1-2-3, is suing competitors Paperback Software Internationaland Mosaic Marketing Inc.   Lotus and some other software companies contend that unlesstheir products enjoy strong copyright protection, they will nothave an economic incentive to develop new programs.   ``Our argument is that out-and-out copying of other people'swork stifles creativity and innovation,'' said Lotus spokeswomanBetsy Kosheff. ``Copyright law allows you to take other people'swork and build on it, but not to steal it.''   Copyright lawyers said the rash of ``look and feel'' lawsuitsbegan in late 1986, after a federal judge in California ruled thata small software company, Unison World Inc., had infringed acompetitor's copyright on a program for making customized greetingcards.   Since then, several companies have won similar cases, but ``eachcase, rather than settling the law, has tended to unsettle it andraise more questions,'' said Thomas M.S. Hemnes, a partner in theBoston law firm of Foley, Hoag andamp; Eliot.   The MIT protest grew out of an advertisement placed in an MITstudent newspaper last month by Stallman; Gerald J. Sussman, aprofessor of electrical engineering; and Marvin Minsky, founder ofMIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.   They warned that the lawsuits could freeze out new companies,make computers harder to use and, ultimately, retard the industry.   ``Until quite recently, people invented things, everybody gaveeach other all their software, we had fun and people made moneyanyway,'' Sussman said Wednesday. ``I'd like to see that comeback.''   Stallman, a prominent programmer who developed EMACS, a widelyused system for editing computer programs, said it is in the publicinterest to have computer programs share basic attributes, so usersdo not have to learn each program from scratch.   The lawsuits, he charged, will lead to ``inefficiency andgratuitous incompatibility,'' with ``a heavy cost for the economy.''   Protesters said they have formed a new organization, the Leaguefor Programming Freedom, to try to pressure Lotus and other firmsto drop the lawsuits.   In leaflets handed out at the pickets, the group urged people toboycott the firms bringing the lawsuits and to buy competingproducts instead. They also advised programmers not to go to workfor Lotus, Apple and Ashton Tate.</TEXT></DOC>
