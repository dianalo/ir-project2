Le Pen, who ran on an anti-immigration ``French First''platform, was eliminated in the first round of the election April24, but he won a surprising 14.4 percent of the vote and placedfourth.   Now, Chirac and Socialist President Francois Mitterrand _ thetop two vote-getters who advanced to Sunday's runoff _ are makingovertures to Le Pen supporters.   Chirac's Rally for the Republic party took its deepest swinginto Le Pen territory last weekend when Interior Minister CharlesPasqua said Le Pen's National Front ``claims the samepreoccupations, the same values'' as the traditional conservativeparties.   Chirac placed a weak second with just under 20 percent of theApril 24 vote. He needs to win over supporters of the NationalFront without distancing centrist voters who backed former PremierRaymond Barre, who came in third and was eliminated from the runoff.   Mitterrand, favored in Sunday's election, also needs supportfrom Le Pen's voters if his image as a uniting force in a dividedFrance is to be credible.   But Pasqua's remarks in an interview with the weekly ValeursActuelles unsettled the French political world.   Some of Chirac's other ministers demanded an explanation, whilea top National Front official said Pasqua would be welcome to joinup.   The premier himself said the attention to Pasqua's statement wasa maneuver ``invented by the left to mask the real debate'' _economic competitiveness.   ``Europe is in the making,'' Chirac said in a Tuesday nighttelevision interview in reference to 1992, when trade barriers willdissolve. He said talk should be focused on redressing the economy,not on ``an abstract debate on values.''   But the premier clearly has taken on the language of theNational Front. He has used its favorite words _ family, country,national identity _ and even uses Le Pen's preferred word _``decadence'' _ when referring to the left.   Mitterrand has said he will not pursue a ``witchhunt ofimmigrants'' but has begun saying that immigration to France shouldbe cut.   While making such subtle appeals to the National Front, he hassought the support of wayward centrists and moved the Socialistprogram toward the political center.   ``We don't have the right to refuse any help offered honestly.It is in union, not separation, that France will achieve itsdestiny,'' Mitterrand said this week at a rally in Strasbourg.   Because of Le Pen's strong showing, many French are worriedabout a rise in racism, fascism and undemocratic values.   Some centrists who have supported Chirac's government have beenunnerved by the open flirtation with Le Pen. Dozens who supportedBarre in the first round have announced support for Mitterrand.Most are obscure political figures, but four served as conservativeCabinet ministers in the 1970s.   ``Jacques Chirac is caught between the devil and the deep bluesea,'' Socialist Sen. Roger Quillot said Tuesday night. ``If hemoves toward Le Pen, he loses from Barre's side. If he moves tooclose to Barre, he loses from Le Pen's side.''   Mitterrand is widely expected to lure other centrists into thegovernment he will form if he wins the election.   Analysts have attributed much of Le Pen's support to a protestvote by people outside the economic and political mainstream.   Le Pen contends that France, inundated with immigrants, notablyfrom its former North African colonies, is in decline, growingdecadent and in danger of losing its identity. He says France, busyproviding for immigrants, has forgotten to take care of its own.   At a May 1 rally in Paris' Tuileries Gardens, Le Pen called onabout 30,000 supporters not to vote for Mitterrand. He asked themto use their own judgment on a vote for Chirac or not vote at all.He vowed to stay active and called on followers to organize formunicipal elections next spring.</TEXT></DOC>
