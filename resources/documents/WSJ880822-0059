Peter Thomas, chairman of Samoth Capital Corp., said at a news conference that the Vancouver real-estate concern also pledged to sell no alcohol or tobacco at the park and to set aside 25 acres of nearby land for a church. He said that for one year Samoth also would provide low-cost television and studio time for a daily hour of religious broadcasting on the PTL satellite network.    Mr. Thomas said he made a $1 million deposit last week on Samoth's offer to a U.S. government trustee. He said the offer includes a $46 million down payment and 7% interest on the balance, which would be paid after five years.    Mr. Thomas said the trustee set a Sept. 1 deadline to accept competing bids for the assets. He said Samoth hoped to profit from the purchase by developing much of the 2,148 acres the ministry owns around Charlotte, N.C.    The PTL ministry filed last year for reorganization in a federal bankruptcy court after Mr. Bakker resigned amid allegations of sexual improprieties. </TEXT></DOC>
