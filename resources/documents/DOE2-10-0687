He introduced a dimensionless parameter which, under adiabaticconditions, is large compared to unity, but is small in case of a suddenperturbation. The transition from an adiabatic to a sudden collisionis still an intriguing problem. It is, however, well established thatin slow atomic collisions the inner-shell electrons of target and projectilewill adjust to the transient internuclear configuration. In this paperwe want to demonstrate that there will be local adiabaticity also forcontinuum electrons if the external perturbation varies sufficientlyslowly. Instead of expounding on the complicated Coulomb problem we investigatethe simpler problem of how a continuum electron tunnels through a time-dependentbarrier. Among the huge number of possible tunnel configurations we choosethe simplest one: Tunneling through a delta-function barrier whose strengthdecays inversely proportional to time (Section 2). In Section 3 we calculatethe corrresponding Massey parameter. Section 4 illustrates the resultsin terms of elementary quantum dynamics.</TEXT></DOC>
