 Olivetti announced a25MHz 'tower' box in February but declined to ship it until June.andP;  ALR, aCalifornian PC company with a penchant for speed, is still in the throes offinalizing its MCA production and setting up distribution here in the UK.andM;That leaves you in the tender embrace of Apricot, which after a prolongedgestation period, is now delivering the first and only (in quantity, anyway)all singing, all dancing 25MHz desktop MCA box.andP;  And it's the fastest MCA boxso far in the PC User benchtest tables.andM;The outward conformation of the Qi 660i is unchanged from the World Exclusivereview last September (PC User No.andP;  89).andP;  A single 3-1/2-inch 1.44Mb floppygraces the right hand side of the fascia.andP;  A space is reserved on the leftfor a tape streamer.andP;  In between the two are LEDs for drives, power and LAN.andO;The ominous dark rectangle is the receiver for the infra-red security device,the Qi card.andM;The display in particular seems much more massive.andP;  In operation, the Qi isvirtually silent, like its PS/2 progenitors.andM;The power switch is hidden under the contours of the right side of themachine.andP;  Mouse and keyboard connectors (PS/2 type, naturally) are at therear, along with the parallel, serial, VGA and other attachment pointsdetailed below.andP;  The case lock is at the rear.andP;  There is a power point for amonitor.andM;Added value to Apricot means a lot more than providing three additional slotsbeyond the three doled out in the IBM 386 originals.andP;  Unlike the lowerpowered Qi 350, which has the SX chip and a 16-bit bus, the Qi 660i has twofull 32-bit slots, each capable of volunteering for the match memory cycleand a 16-bit slot with the video extension.andM;RAM expansion is not likely to need the fast bus cycle as 16Mb of SIMMs cansit directly on the motherboard.andP;  Expensive they will be, too, boasting an80ns or better refresh rate.andP;  The standard allocation of memory is 1Mb.andM;In the basic machine, Windows 386 is a non-starter.andP;  The Qi's architecturehas been set up like a 20MHz IBM Model 80 in that it gives you 640Kb, plus256Kb out of the first megabyte.andP;  Windows 386 wants to see more than 384Kb soit's not on for the bare box.andM;Getting 16Mb on the motherboard involves using Apricot's homebrew SIMMs,which hold 2Mb each.andP;  Last year I would not have wanted to hitch my cart tothat particular horse but in the much looser memory environment of 1989, itshould be a safe bet.andP;  Otherwise the limit is 8Mb.andM;VGA compatibility is provided by Chips and is spot on with IBM's, even inundocumented video modes.andP;  There is 256Kb of video RAM for the time being,but support for additional high resolution modes and colours by the additionof memory via a connector is envisaged.andM;The 25MHz 80386 is accompanied by the 82385 cache controller and 32Kb ofstatic cache RAM.andP;  Provision has been made for floating point coprocessorslike the Intel 80387 or the Weitek Abacus.andP;  The motherboard has been designedwith 33MHz in mind, and when the fast processor and ancillary chips areforthcoming so, too, will be a 33MHz Qi.andP;  The motherboard was quite clean butthere were a few straggling wires left.andP;  However, it was in a much morefinished state than the Qi 350i I examined over six months ago.andM;This top of the line Qi had a 1:1 interleaved 120Mb RLL drive by ControlData.andP;  The controller used was the MCA version of the WD 1006.andP;  CORE gave ita 5.3ms average access time that was clearly optimistic.andP;  The data transferrate was very high; CORE set it at 775Kb per second.andP;  There is no room in thecase for a second Winchester.andP;  Apricot supplies an internal tape streamer(40Mb) to help you sleep at night.andM;The Qi has an Ethernet interface built into the motherboard (phantom slotnumber four).andP;  Since about half of the corporate networking world subscribesto that wiring system, the other half will just have to use their referencedisk, deactivate the network controller and stick in their favourite TokenRing card.andM;Phantom slot five is a bisynchronous comms port for linking directly intoX.25 networks, it can also be used as two RS-232 ports with a specialadaptor.andM;Apricot has bundled the network and comms drivers, security bits and bobs andsome other 'optional' software into the Qi environment, which costs extra.andO;This comes in a MS Windows version and eventually a Presentation Manager one.andO;The machine itself is only shipped with MS-DOS.andM;Apricot is quite serious about keeping its software development efforts frombeing ripped off.andP;  They have gone to the trouble of fitting a dongleinternally to foil unprincipled copiers without interfering with an honestuser's god given right to back up expensive software.andP;  With the internaldongle, at least the parallel port is free.andM;Windows 386 from Compaq ran right away and since Apricot doesn't copy protectWindows, it was just duff issue disks that caused the fracas.andP;  My trustyDataflex MCA Biscom modem plugged in, configured and operated just like itdid in my Model 70.andM;In one of my dozen trips through the configuration I noticed that the BIOSshadowing was disabled.andP;  Enabling it did not change the benchmark times,though.andP;  Fast 386 machines that use cached memory don't need the shadowedBIOS in the way uncached architectures do.andP;  The Qi is shipped with shadowingdisabled because shadowed BIOS code is not write protected and that canpotentially lead to chaos.andM;There is enough security built in to calm a paranoiac but thanks to the Qiinfra red key card, it is easy to use.andP;  The security manual rightlyemphasizes that security arrangements need to include more than justtwiddling the bits inside the machine.andP;  It's a way of life.andM;By the time Apricot finished documenting all the wonders of the Qi 660i andthe Qi Environment, they had over a dozen separate perfect bound manuals.andO;The clarity of the writing is unimpeachable but what is missing is a findingaid so that you know what book to look in!andM;To bring the Qi to market, Apricot had to bring along with them Chips andamp;Technologies (suppliers of the gate arrays that glue the processor and memoryto the MCA bus) and Phoenix, the BIOS folks.andP;  It's been a long strugglecranking the Qi up the last 5MHz to 25MHz.andP;  Clonemakers that follow will owea debt to Apricot -- you know what happens to pioneers.andP;  In the meantime, theApricot is the fastest, bigtime MCA game in town.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
