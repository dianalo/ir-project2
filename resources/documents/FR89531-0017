EPA believesthat this substance may be hazardous to human health and that the usesdescribed in this proposed rule may result in significant human exposure.A requirement to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing significantnew uses would provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intendeduses and, if necessary, prohibit or limit those activities before theyoccur.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Authority</ITAG>Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determinethat a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant new use.'' EPA mustmake this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors,including those listed in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a useof a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B) ofTSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days beforethey manufacture, import, or process the substance for that use.Persons subject to the final SNUR would comply with the same notice requirementsand EPA regulatory procedures as submitters of PMNs under section 5(a)(1)(A)of TSCA. In particular, these requirements include the information submissionrequirements of section 5(b) and (d)(1), the exemptions authorized by section5(h) (1), (2), (3), and (5) and the regulations at 40 CFR Part 720. OnceEPA receives a SNUR notice, EPA may take regulatory action under section5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities on which it has receiveda SNUR notice. If EPA does not take action, section 5(g) of TSCA requiresEPA to explain in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> its reasons for not taking action.Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or finalSNUR are subject to the export notification provisions of TSCA section12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR Part707.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Applicability of General Provisions</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 5, 1984 (49 FR 35011), EPA promulgatedgeneral regulatory provisions applicable to SNURs (40 CFR Part 721, SubpartA). In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 27, 1988 (53 FR 28354), EPA promulgatedamendments to the general provisions. The general provisions are discussedin the two documents in detail, and interested persons should refer tothose documents for further information. EPA is proposing that these generalprovisions apply to this SNUR, except as discussed in this preamble andas set forth in proposed andSection; 721.562.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Summary of this Proposed Rule</ITAG>The chemical substance which is the subject of this proposed SNUR was thesubject of PMN P-85-929. It is identified as 1,3-Benzenediamine, 4-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-<T3>ar</T3>-methyl, and will be listed as such on the TSCA Inventory whena Notice of Commencement of Manufacture is received by EPA from the submitterof P-85-929. EPA is proposing to designate the following as significantnew uses of the substance: Use other than as a chain extender for reactioninjection molding polyurethane elastomers; disposal other than by incinerationor landfill; any manner or method of manufacture, import, or processingwithout establishing a program whereby: (1) Persons who may be exposeddermally to the substance wear gloves, eye protection, and protective clothing,and persons who may be exposed by inhalation during manufacture war a NationalInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health approved, category 19C air-suppliedrespirator; (2) potentially exposed individuals are informed of the possiblehazards and required protective equipment; and (3) containers of the substancewhich may be distributed in commerce are labeled; (4) the PMN substanceis disposed of by incineration or landfill; and (5) exceedance of a specifiedproduction limit prior to completion of certain tests.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Background</ITAG>On May 8, 1985, EPA received a PMN which EPA designated as P-85-929. EPAannounced receipt of the PMN in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 17, 1985 (50 FR 20596). The PMN submitterintends to manufacture the substance for use as a chain extender.The PMN submitter claimed the following as CBI: production volume, useinformation, process information, and portions of a mixture. Under section14(a)(4) of TSCA, EPA may disclose CBI relevant to any proceeding. ``[D]isclosurein such a proceeding shall be made in such manner as to preserve confidentialityto the extent practicable without impairing the proceeding.'' EPA is notconvinced that this rulemaking will be so impaired by these confidentialityclaims as to justify disclosure of CBI. Therefore, EPA has decided notto disclose any of the CBI at this time. EPA specifically requests commenton this approach for this SNUR rulemaking. For purposes of clarity, thesubstance will be referred to by its specific name and PMN number.Based upon results obtained from bioassays on structurally similar substances,2,4-diaminotoluene and 2,6-diaminotoluene, EPA believes P-85-929 may causecancer and chronic organ and systemic effects. A detailed discussion ofthese conclusions appears in the toxicity support document available inthe public record for this rulemaking (See Unit XIII). During review ofthe PMN, EPA concluded that the uncontrolled manufacture, import, processing,distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of the substance may presentan unreasonable risk of injury to human health. Therefore, EPA regulatedthe substance under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of informationsufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects. EPA concluded that the use of appropriate protective equipment will significantlyreduce exposure and potential risks to human health. A section 5(e) consentorder requiring the use of appropriate controls was negotiated with thePMN submitter. The order became effective February 20, 1988. The termsof the proposed SNUR are approximately the same as those of the consentorder.By issuing a section 5(e) consent order that allows controlled commercialproduction of the substance, EPA has taken a regulatory approach whichis appreciably less burdensome than an order prohibiting manufacture ofthe substance until additional data are submitted. At the same time, thesection 5(e) consent order protects human health by requiring precautionarycontrols pending the development of the data needed for a reasoned evaluationof the risks associated with the substance.Section 5(e) orders apply only to the PMN submitter. When the PMN submittercommences commercial manufacture of the substance and submits a Noticeof Commencement of Manufacture to EPA, EPA will add the substance to theTSCA Chemical Substance Inventory maintained pursuant to section 8(b) ofTSCA. When a substance is listed on the Inventory, it is no longer a ``newchemical substance'' for which a PMN would be required under section 5(a)(1)(A).Thus, other persons may manufacture, import, or process the substance withoutcontrols. Therefore, EPA is proposing to designate the uses set forth inproposed andSection; 721.562(a)(2) as significant new uses so that EPA canreview these uses before they occur.Through a SNUR, EPA would ensure that all manufacturers, importers, andprocessors are subject to similar reporting requirements. In addition,a SNUR would afford EPA the opportunity to review exposure and toxicityinformation on the substance before a significant new use occurs and, ifnecessary, take action to ensure that persons will not be exposed to levelsof the substance that are potentially hazardous.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Determination of Proposed Significant New Uses</ITAG>To determine what would constitute significant new uses of P-85-929, EPAconsidered relevant information about the toxicity of the substance, likelyexposures associated with possible uses, and the four factors listed insection 5(a)(2) of TSCA. Based on these considerations, EPA proposes todesignate the significant new uses of P-85-929, as set forth in proposedandSection; 721.562(a)(2). EPA has already determined in the section 5(e) order that unrestrictedmanufacture, import, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposalof the substance may present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health.While such a finding is not necessary to promulgate a SNUR, it stronglysupports a determination that the uses of the substance designated in thisproposed rule would be significant new uses of the substance.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Recordkeeping</ITAG>To ensure compliance with this proposed rule and to assist enforcementefforts, EPA is proposing, under its authority in sections 5 and 8(a) ofTSCA, that in addition to meeting the requirements in andSection; 721.17,the following records be maintained for 5 years after the date of theircreation by persons who manufacture, import, or process P-85-929.1. Any determination that gloves are impervious to the substance.2. Names of persons who have attended safety meetings in accordance withproposed andSection; 721.562(a)(2)(iii)(C), the dates of such meetings, andcopies of any written information provided.3. Copies of any Material Safety Data Sheets used.4. Names and addresses of all persons to whom the substance is sold ortransferred, including shipment destination address if different, the dateof each transfer, and the quantity of substance sold or transferred onsuch date.5. Copies of any labels used.6. Any names used for the substance and the corresponding dates of use.7. Quantities of the substance manufactured or imported, with the correspondingdates of manufacture or import.8. Quantities of the substance purchased by processors of the substance,names and addresses of suppliers, and corresponding dates of purchase.9. Information on disposal of the substance, including dates waste materialis disposed of, location of disposal sites, volume of disposed solid material,estimated volume of any disposed liquid wastes containing the substances,and method of disposal.These recordkeeping requirements would apply to all manufacturers, importers,and processors, including small manufacturers, importers, and processors,because the small business exemption of section 8(a) of TSCA is not applicablewhen the chemical substance which is the subject of the rule also is thesubject of a section 5(e) order. EPA considered omitting these specific recordkeeping requirements, butbelieves compliance monitoring for this proposed SNUR would be made moredifficult without them. The basis for EPA's recordkeeping requirementshas been set forth in the preambles to previously proposed SNURs. Personsinterested in a complete discussion of this issue should read the proposedSNUR for P-83-370 published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of January 13, 1984 (49 FR 1753).<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Exemptions to Reporting Requirements</ITAG>EPA has codified, in andSection; 721.19, general exemption provisions coveringSNUR reporting. On a case-by-case basis EPA may modify these provisions.However, in this case, EPA is proposing that andSection; 721.19 apply inits entirety.Section 721.19(g) exempts persons from SNUR reporting when they manufacture(under section 3(7) of TSCA, the term manufacture includes import) or processthe substance soley for export and label the substance in accordance withsection 12(a)(1)(b) of TSCA. While EPA is concerned about worker exposureduring manufacture and processing of the substance for export, section12(a) of TSCA prohibits EPA from requiring reporting of such manufactureor processing for a significant new use outside the United States. However,such persons would be required to notify EPA of such export under section12(b) of TSCA (see andSection; 721.17). Such notification will allow EPAto monitor manufacturing and processing activities which are not subjectto significant new use reporting.The term ``manufacture solely for export'' is defined in andSection; 720.3(s)of the PMN rule. The term ``process solely for export'' is defined in andSection;721.3 of the general SNUR provisions in a similar fashion. Thus, personswould be exempt from reporting under this SNUR if they manufacture, import,or process the substance solely for export from the United States underthe following restrictions: (1) there is no use of the substance in theUnited States except in small quantities solely for research and development;(2) processing is restricted to sites under the control of the manufacturer,importer, or processor, respectively; and (3) distribution in commerceis limited to purposes of export. If a person manfactured, imported, orprocessed the substance both for export and for use in the United States,the manfacturing, importing, or processing activity would not be ``solelyfor export.''<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Applicability of Proposal to Uses Occurring Before Promulgationof Final Rule</ITAG>When determining that a use is a significant ``new'' use, EPA intends thatthe use not be currently ongoing. In this case, the PMN submitter is prohibitedby the section 5(e) order from undertaking the activities which EPA isproposing be designated as significant new uses. Furthermore, since a Noticeof Commencement of Manufacture has not yet been submitted to EPA and thissubstance has not yet been added to the TSCA Chemical Inventory, no otherperson may commence such activities without first submitting a PMN to EPA.Therefore, at this time, EPA has concluded that these uses are not ongoing.However EPA recognizes that since the chemical substance identified inthis proposed SNUR may have been added to the Inventory, it may be manufactured,imported, or processed by other persons for a significant new use as definedin this proposal before promulgation of the rule.EPA believes that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designatinga use as a significant new use as of the proposal date of the SNUR ratherthan as of the promulgation of the final rule. If uses begun during theproposal period of a SNUR were considered ongoing, any person could defeatthe SNUR by initiating a proposed significant new use before the rule becamefinal. This would make it extremely difficult for EPA to establish SNURnotice requirements.Thus, persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing ofP-85-929 for a significant new use between proposal and promulgation ofthis proposed rule would have to cease that activity before the effectivedate of the rule. To resume their activities, these persons would haveto comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until thenotice review period, including all extensions, expired.EPA, not wishing to unnecessarily disrupt the commercial activities ofpersons who manufacture, import, or process for a proposed significantnew use prior to promulgation of a final SNUR, has promulgated a new andSection;721.45(h) (July 27, 1988, 53 FR 28354) to allow for advance SNUR compliance(i.e., compliance prior to the date of promulgation).<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Determining When Use is Designated in the Rule</ITAG>EPA is proposing a significant new use set at production volumes whichhave been claimed as CBI. EPA is also proposing that these production volumesremain confidential in the final rule. EPA believes it is appropriate tokeep this information confidential to protect the interest of the originalPMN submitter. EPA specifically requests comments on this issue.Therefore, EPA is proposing to reveal the production volumes describedin proposed andSection; 721.555(a)(2)(iv) only to a manufacturer or importerwho has shown a <T3>bona fide</T3> intent to manufacture or import the substance. To establisha <T3>bona fide</T3> intent, the person must submit the information requiredunder andSection; 721.11(b). EPA will make a determination as to whetherthe person has established a <T3>bona fide</T3> intent to manufacture or import the substance. If theperson has established a <T3>bona fide</T3> intent, EPA will inform the person of the productionvolumes which would constitute a significant new use.<ITAG tagnum="84">X. Test Data and Other Information</ITAG>EPA recognizes that, under TSCA section 5, persons are not required todevelop any particular test data before submitting a significant new usenotice. Rather, persons are only required to submit test data in theirpossession or control and to describe any other data known to or reasonablyascertainable by them.However, in view of the potential health risks that may be posed by a significantnew use of this substance, EPA suggests potential SNUR notice submittersconsider conducting tests that would permit a reasoned evaluation of thepotential risks posed by this substance when utilized for an intended use.EPA believes that the results of a 2-year rodent bioassay and a 90-daysubchronic study would adequately characterize possible cancer and chronichealth effects, respectively, of the substance. The section 5(e) consentorder negotiated with the PMN submitter prohibits the submitter from exceedinga specific production volume limit without completing these studies. Underthe consent order, the PMN submitter is required to submit each study atleast 12 weeks before it reaches the specified production volume limit.The order contains detailed procedures for dealing with situations wherethe resulting data are invalid or equivocal, or show that the substancewill present an unreasonable risk of injury under the exposure limitationsin the order. This proposed SNUR uses the same production volume limitsas the consent order; those production volume limits are defined as a significantnew use.EPA believes it is likely that the PMN submitter will conduct the 2-yearrodent bioassay and 90-day subchronic study before reaching the productionvolume limits and before any other person who would be subject to thisSNUR would reach the limits in the SNUR. Accordingly, before beginningto conduct either study a person subject to this SNUR should contact EPAto determine whether the required study has already been produced.EPA is also considering a more detailed description of the significantnew use that would incorporate some or all of the procedures reflectedin the consent order for dealing with invalid or equivocal data. EPA solicitscomments on such an approach.These studies may not be the only means of addressing the potential risks.SNUR notices submitted for significant new uses without any test data mayincrease the likelihood that EPA will take action under section 5(e) onthe PMN.EPA encourages persons to consult with EPA before selecting a protocolfor testing the substance. As part of this prenotice consultation, EPAwill discuss the test data it believes necessary to evaluate a significantnew use of the substance. Test data should be developed according to TSCAgood laboratory practice standards at 40 CFR Part 792. Failure to do somay lead EPA to find such data to be insufficient to evaluate reasonablythe health effects of the substances.EPA urges SNUR notice submitters to provide detailed information on humanexposure that will result from the significant new uses. In addition, EPAencourages persons to submit information on potential benefits of the substanceand information on risks posed by the substance compared to risks posedby substitutes.<ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Economic Analysis</ITAG>EPA has evaluated the potential costs of establishing significant new usenotice requirements for potential manufacture, import, processing, distributionin commerce, use, and/or disposal of this chemical substance. EPA's completeeconomic analysis is available in the public record.<ITAG tagnum="84">XII. Confidential Business Information</ITAG>Any person who submits comments which the person claims as CBI must markthe comments as ``confidential,'' ``trade secret,'' or other appropriatedesignation. Comments not claimed as confidential at the time of submissionwill be placed in the public file. Any comments marked as confidentialwill be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR Part 2. EPArequests that any person submitting confidential comments prepare and submita sanitized version of the comments which EPA can place in the public record.<ITAG tagnum="84">XIII. Rulemaking Record</ITAG>EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control numberOPTS-50572). The record includes basic information considered by EPA indeveloping this proposed rule. EPA will supplement the record with additionalinformation as it is received. The record now includes the following:1. The Premanufacture Notice (PMN).2. The <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of receipt of the PMN.3. The section 5(e) consent order.4. The economic analysis of the proposed rule.5. The toxicology support document.6. The engineering support document.7. The exposure support document.EPA will accept additional materials for inclusion in the record at anytime between this proposal and designation of the complete record.EPA will identify the complete rulemaking record by the date of promulgation.A public version of this record containing sanitized copies from whichCBI has been deleted is available to the public in the TSCA Public DocketOffice from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.The TSCA Public Docket Office is located in Rm. NE-G004, 401 M St., SW.,Washington, DC.<ITAG tagnum="84">XIV. Regulatory Assessment Requirements</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is ``major''and, therefore, requires a Regulatory Impact Analysis. EPA has determinedthat this proposed rule is not a ``major rule'' because it would not havean effect on the economy of $100 million or more and it would not havea significant effect on competition, costs, or prices. While there is noprecise way to calculate the total annual cost of compliance with thisproposed rule, EPA believes that the cost would be low. EPA believes that,because of the nature of the proposed rule and the substance involved,there will be few significant new use notices submitted. Furthermore, whilethe expense of a notice and the uncertainty of possible EPA regulationmay discourage certain innovation, that impact will be limited becausesuch factors are unlikely to discourage an innovation that has high potentialvalue.This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview as required by Executive Order 12291.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActUnder the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA has determinedthat this proposed rule would not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small businesses. EPA cannot determine whether parties affectedby this proposed rule are likely to be small businesses. However, EPA expectsto receive few SNUR notices for the substance. Therefore, EPA believesthat the number of small businesses affected by this proposed rule wouldnot be substantial even if all the SNUR notice submitters were small firms.C. Paperwork Reduction ActOMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in thisproposed rule under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980,44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> and has assigned OMB control number 2070-0012.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 8 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule willrespond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirementscontained in this proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 721</ITAG>Chemicals, Environmental protection, Hazardous substances, Significantnew uses.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 19, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Victor J.
