Under terms of a Central American peace plan, Nicaragua'sSandinista government has offered amnesty to rebels who return andenter the domestic political process.   Roberto Ferrey, who has been a member of the rebel executiveboard since 1987, made his announcement in letters to Joao BaenaSoares, secretary-general of the Organization of American States,and Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, Roman Catholic archbishop ofManagua.   In a statement released to news organizations, Ferrey said hewould return on Tuesday. His letter said he would join the NationalOpposition Union, a diverse coalition of opposition parties.   Central American presidents agreed earlier this month to disbandthe U.S.-supported rebels before the end of the year. In return,Nicaragua agreed to hold free and fair elections in February.   About 11,000 Contras and 12,000 dependents live in camps inHonduras. Congress ended military aid last year, but provides $4.5million a month in humanitarian assistance.   Nicaragua and the Contras agreed March 21 to suspend militaryoperations, but negotiations toward a permanent end to the7-year-old war have made little progress.</TEXT></DOC>
