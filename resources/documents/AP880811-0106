(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The fur is flying in Nevada Countyover a November ballot proposal to ban the use of steel-jaw legtraps, the first time that voters in California will have a say onthe issue.   Those favoring the ban say the traps, whichg and are indiscriminate,posing ahazard to humans, their pets and non-target animals.   Advocates, including ranchers and government predator controlexperts, say the traps are vital in their struggle to protectlivestock, crops and property. The traps also help controloutbreaks of rabies and other animal-carried diseases, they say.   Sixty-six countries have banned the traps, and their use isrestricted in four states. Other California communities haveoutlawed them, although the November initiative in the rural,mountainous county northeast of Sacramento is the first time votersin any of California's 58 counties will decide the issue.   San Francisco has had a ban since 1977, and two years ago theSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Santa Cruzwaged a successful campaign to get the Board of Supervisors tooutlaw steel-jaw traps in the county. Santa Clara Countysupervisors passed a similar ordinance in April.   Steel-jaw leg traps are triggered when pressure is applied to apad, snapping the U-shaped, spring-operated, toothless jaws closed.The traps are available in a range of sizes for different animals.The most powerful bear traps were outlawed in California years agobecause ``they used to find too many hunters trapped in them,''said Art Johnston, chairman of Citizens for a Healthful and SafeEnvironment, or CHASE, which favors the ban.   Debate has been charged, with proponents of the ban trying tomake their case using photographs of maimed pets, mangled animalsand three-legged survivors who chewed off a paw in their desperateescapes. Those who say the traps are necessary complain they arehelpless to counter the emotional appeals.   ``The thing actually has taken on all of the intensity of areligious controversy, with people rabidly for it and peoplerabidly against it,'' Johnston, who joined the fray seven monthsago, said recently.   ``We're not saying you can't trap anymore or you can't controlpredators. We're just saying use a trap that if a kid gets caughtin it, they can get out. That's all we're saying.''   David Lester, a federal trapper who contracts with Nevada Countyto do predator control by request on about 30,000 acres, says hisjob is misunderstood.   ``There's responsible people on both sides, and then there'sradicals on both sides. ... It's frustrating,'' said Lester, whowas born and raised in the county and whose uncle was the countytrapper before him. ``I've read in the paper where I've been calleda moron for setting these traps. I feel I'm as much a part ofnature as that blade of grass or the coyote.''   The county traps _ a maximum of 50 at any time _ are set offtrails to protect people, he said. Commercial fur trapping is doneduring the winter when fewer people are outside, he said.   Trappers are required by law to check their traps daily, butenforcement is non-existent and many animals die of starvation orexposure, critics say.   ``It just has no place in a civilized society, especiallybecause there are so many alternatives,'' said Judy Cassada,director of education for the Santa Cruz chapter of the SPCA.   Instead of the steel traps, ranchers should use fencing,shepherding and guard dogs, the ban's proponents say.   Ron Tapp is one of the initiative's supporters. He couldn't walkfor two weeks after he stepped in a coyote-sized trap whilebackpacking along the Feather River, he said.   The real problem, those who favor the initiative say, is thatauthorities see a successful crackdown on the use of steel-jawtraps as a major erosion of their powers that could trigger furthervictories by animal rights' activists who oppose wildlifemanagement and recreational hunting, trapping and fishing.   ``They don't want to be regulated ... because they never havebeen regulated,'' says Tanja Keogh, a co-coordinator of CHASE.``It's the old Wild West mentality. ... They're afraid if we win,the next step is we'll be taking away their guns.''</TEXT></DOC>
