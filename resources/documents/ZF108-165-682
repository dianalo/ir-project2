(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Joint applications design  (JAD) workshops  are at the heart  of newdevelopment methodologies such as rapid applications development (RAD) and DuPont's Timebox.andM;JAD techniques are used  in the initial requirements-planning phase of the RAD life cycle to identify high-level requirements and features of theproposed  system.andP;  Additional JAD workshops are  conducted in the subsequentuser design  phase to specify the detailed design of  the system.andP;  Thetechniques used in JAD  can be generalized and applied to a variety ofworkshop environments.andM;JAD attacks a common problem in  applications development -- the lack of effective communication between end  users and information-systems (IS)professionals.andM;The traditional applications-development process attempts to solve this communication problem through the  preparation of a series of specification documents.andP;  Initial user requirements are translated into a feasibilitydocument.andP;  As part of a structured analysis process,  the feasibilitydocument is expanded  into a structured specification.andP;  After the  user signsoff the specification document, it is translated into a detailed designdocument.andP;  The detailed design document is then manually translated into program code.andM;Doomed To FailandM;It is hard to imagine a process that is  more error-prone and more likely tofail  to meet users' requirements at cutover.andP;  Errors and misunderstandingsare introduced at each translation of the specifications from one language toanother.andP;  End users are involved only at the beginning and end of thedevelopment process, and that process is often so long  that businessconditions have changed  by the time it is finished, invalidating  theinitial functional requirements.andM;JAD provides an effective mechanism  to solve these communication problems.andO;It offers a structured environment in  which small teams of end users and IS professionals can work together to hammer out the design specifications for anew application.andP;  JAD produces results  faster than the traditional writingof  specifications.andP;  More important, it results  in a design that is muchbetter from the  users' point of view.andM;As shown in the figure, JAD workshops are conducted in a highly visual, structured environment.andP;  The rooms used  are often specially configured,using overhead projectors, white boards, flip  charts, copying facilities anda U-shaped  configuration of tables.andP;  An important additional facility is anintegrated computer-aided software engineering (I- CASE) tool and alarge-screen monitor  or television projection system.andM;I-CASE tools incorporate both front-end diagramming facilities and a tightly integrated back-end code generator capable of generating 100 percent of the code for an application.andP;  Using an I- CASE tool, the design developed in a JAD workshop can be converted auto- matically into a running prototype ap plication that can be demonstrated to  end users.andM;The key players in JAD are the end  users who want a system that implements agiven set of functions.andP;  Selecting  the best user participants is crucial.andO;They should have the right mix of knowledge about the business and the authority to make decisions about the  design, and they haveandM;to communicate   well.andP;  There are often one or more key  people who arecriticalandM;in creating the  design and having it accepted.andP;  If these  key players arenot available, the work shop should not be run.andM;There should be at least one IS professional to build the prototype designusing the I-CASE tool and to ensure that  the design is technically sound.andO;Part of  this task is the building or extraction of  the requisite normalizeddata model.andP;  Specialists in database design and other particular areas mayattend the JAD  sessions part-time to offer advice to the  participants.andM;A critically important participant in  the JAD process is the JAD leader.andO;This  person is a specialist who prepares and  directs the workshop sessions,encourages  the players to participate and  moves the session along towardits goals.andP;  Like an effective board chairman  or program moderator, a sessionleader  must be able to direct the human dialogue constructively and avoid squabbles.andM;The scribe is responsible for the documentation.andP;  He or she captures design specifications for the application using  an I-CASE tool.andP;  Specificationsthat have  been sketched on a white board and  agreed upon by the users areentered  into a design repository on the PC using  the diagramming capabilityof the I-  CASE tool.andP;  The scribe steadily adds detail to the design of theapplication as it  emerges on the screen of the I-CASE  tool, adding commentsas needed.andP;  He or  she should be skillful with the I-CASE  tool used to buildand edit the diagrams, create the design, extract repository information,build screen designs and reports and create prototypes.andM;The participants examine the screens  that are painted, the sample reports generated, the screen dialogue and the  structured design represented indecomposition diagrams, data-flow diagrams  and action diagrams.andO;Periodically, parts  of the design are printed for the users  to review ortake with them in the evening.andP;  Participants may also examine or  modifyparts of the design on their personal computers.andM;The JAD leader takes the participants  through a preplanned set of steps.andO;The  scribe records the results with the I- CASE tool and periodicallyinterrupts  when the tool detects inconsistencies or  ambiguities.andM;The tool helps ensure that the results  of the workshop are rigorous,consistent  and complete.andM;When he or she has cleaned up the  design, the scribe shows it to theparticipants using either a large-screen monitor, a television projectionsystem or a  computer-driven LCD mounted on a standard projector.andP;  This helpsin the discussion of designs and prototypes.andM;Some JAD sessions employ an I-CASE  tool without this large-screen projectionfacility; the scribe then builds the design  in the tool as it evolves on thewhite  boards and periodically prints parts of it.andM;Some primitive JAD workshops are  conducted without automated tools.andO;Experience has shown, however, that JAD  produces far better designs when I-CASE and prototyping tools are used.andP;  The workshop should be linked tightly to the repository, using its information  and building up design knowledge init.andM;JAD techniques are particularly valuable for projects that span userorganizations or for applications that affect  multiple locations ordisciplines.andP;  The  workshops are useful for resolving operational,organizational or procedural differences: End users and managers in theworkshop can confront each other under the guidance of a session leader trained in negotiating skills, and must  agree to a design that both sidesaccept.andM;The Benefits of JADandM;The design process can be much faster  than the elapsed time with traditionalIS analysis techniques.andP;  Any corporation  organized to conduct JAD workshops can prepare for a workshop in about  three weeks and complete the JAD in another two or three weeks.andM;JAD works because it harnesses the  know-how of the users, cuts acrossorganizational barriers and is an organized,  controlled, structured process.andO;Screen  generators, report generators and rough  prototypes make the designtangible,  and designs in I-CASE tools are quickly  implemented and easy tomaintain.andP;  The  I-CASE tools enforce rigor and ensure  high quality, and theprocess directly  addresses the strategic objectives of the  organization.andM;Next week, I will discuss the critical  functions performed by the JADleader,  an important new participant in the applications-developmentprocess.andM;----------The concepts embodied in RAD are described in a new volume in the James Martin Report Series.andP;
