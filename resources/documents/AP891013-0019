Attorneys said the settlement could cost GM $3 millionimmediately and up to $40 million over the next five years.   An appeal filed Thursday with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals in Cincinnati says the case was poorly handled and thesettlement too small.   Last month, U.S. District Judge John Feikens approved asettlement of the lawsuit originally filed by four employees in1983. It became a class action suit three years later involving10,000 black GM workers in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio.   The black workers claimed an employee appraisal system, droppedby the automaker after the suit was filed, resulted in lower payand fewer promotions for blacks between 1982 and 1986.   GM issued a statement Thursday saying the settlement was fair.   Godfrey Dillard, an attorney who represents a group of black GMemployees challenging the settlement, said the appeal will stopimplementation of the settlement.   Dennis James, an attorney who negotiated the settlement for theplaintiffs, said the appeal would cost about $1 million a year inattorneys' fees.</TEXT></DOC>
