It is necessary to eitherpre-coat the substrate with the sealing glass, or allow the substrateto remain hot in the sealing region for sufficient time for good wetting.Glass composition, substrate thickness, laser beam power density andscan rate all must be controlled to optimize sealing. Equal heating ofthe two glass-ceramic interfaces is also critical to uniform seal formation.2 refs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
