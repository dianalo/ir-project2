With nearly 80 percent of the polling stations reporting,Conservative President Joaquin Balaguer led his leftist opponent,Juan Bosch, by more than than 11,000 votes, according to theCentral Electoral Board.   Bosch on Thursday charged ``colossal fraud'' in vote countingand said he would call for street protests today, ``no matter whatthe consequences.''   But former President Jimmy Carter, one of 30 internationalelection observers, said Thursday he saw ``no evidence of fraud ormanipulation'' in the vote count. He urged the candidates to remaincalm and wait for final results.   There were no signs early today that police were preparing forany protests, and there were no large gatherings at Bosch's partyheadquarters.   But there was a disturbance when Bosch arrived at theheadquarters.   Army sources said a military intelligence agent was disarmed androughed up by Bosch's followers. But there were conflicting reportsabout what happened.   Bosch's followers said the man drew a revolver as the candidatestepped out of his vehicle. An army spokesman confirmed the man wasa military intelligence agent but denied that he had drawn a weapon.   The spokesman said the agent was disarmed and beaten by Bosch'sfollowers when they noticed he was armed. He said the man wasslightly injured and rushed to a hospital in a police car. Boschthen met with party officials.   For the first time since Wednesday's vote, commuters filled thestreets. Although the day after an election is not an officialholiday, Dominicans traditionally stay home to await the returns.   Bosch, 80, a former president overthrown by a 1963 militarycoup, called a news conference to protest the vote count afterlosing a narrow early lead to Balaguer, the blind, 83-year-oldincumbent.   He accused both Balaguer and the election board of fraud.   The electoral board announced on television Thursday night thatelection law barred any public demonstrations while the vote countcontinued. The announcement was repeated several times.   The election pis the rivals for the presidency of the Caribbeannation against each other for a fifth time. Balaguer has won threeof those races.   With 5,522 of the 6,663 polling stations reporting, Balaguer had543,610 votes and Bosch 532,340, official results showed. JoseFrancisco Pena Gomez, a former Bosch protege, was a distant thirdwith 356,593.   About 3.2 million people were registered to vote nationwide.   On Thursday, Bosch said: ``The Central Electoral Board and Dr.Balaguer committed a colossal fraud.''   ``We are announcing that PDL is going into the streets becausethe people have been cheated,'' Bosch said, referring to hisDominican Liberation Party. ``What remains of my life has nomeaning if this fraud takes place.''   But Pena Gomez, a former Socialist mayor of Santo Domingo, saidthe election board had agreed to review each polling station'stally sheet. He said he proposed the review to Balaguer.   ``President Balaguer accepted the proposal ... and said he wasdisposed to accept that international observers participate in theverification of the sheets,'' Pena Gomez said.   He earlier urged Bosch to withdraw his call for street protests,which he said could cause a bloodbath.   ``And I ask Balaguer not to bring out the armed forces toconfront protesters,'' Pena Gomez told reporters.   Balaguer made no immediate comment. He has remained out ofpublic view since casting his ballot Wednesday. Soldiers guardedhis residence.   Officials of Bosch's party met Thursday with six of the 30international observers monitoring the election. Oscar Ayerve ofEcuador said there was concern over the slow vote count, but he didnot elaborate.   Before the election, Bosch said his party had information thatBalaguer's Social Christian Reformist Party had prepared 300,000phony ballots to rig the election, a charge denied by Balaguerparty officials.   Bosch, an author, intellectual and self-described Marxist, ranon a moderate platform, endorsing capitalism as the best way toimprove his country's economic plight.   Balaguer was first elected president in 1966 and served threeconsecutive four-year terms before losing in 1978. He wasre-elected in 1986.   Over the past four years, he has presided over a $2 billionpublic-works project to transform centuries-old Santo Domingo. Theproject has created thousands of jobs, but economic problemspersisted and his popularity slumped.</TEXT></DOC>
