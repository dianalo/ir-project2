Lenders last week were asking, on average, a 10.36% interest rate on 30-year, fixed-rate conventional mortgages, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. That was up slightly from 10.35% a week earlier, but was below the 10.61% rate of a year earlier.    &quot;Mortgage rates haven't looked all that bad and they will begin to look better,&quot; said Martin Regalia, chief economist at the Washington-based National Council of Savings Institutions. He said it wasn't surprising that the average rate rose last week, in light of increases in interest rates earlier this year. But he declared: &quot;I would expect that in the long end, it will start to show some small improvement in July.&quot;    Peter Lloyd-Davies, vice president for financial research at Freddie Mac, said that the coming &quot;modest ease in rates should support new home sales during the summer.&quot;    Meanwhile, rates on adjustable rate loans fell last week. Lenders were asking an average rate of 7.86% for the first year of 30-year conventional mortgages with rates indexed to one-year Treasury bills. That modestly widened the large difference between fixed-rate and adjustable rate loans, a trend that will make adjustable loans more attractive. The adjustable-loan rate was 7.88% a week earlier.    Separately, a Federal Home Loan Bank Board survey, taken during the first five business days of June, showed the average effective interest rate for fixed-rate mortgages had risen to 10.85% from a revised 10.62% in May. Previously, the bank board survey reported the May figure as 10.52%.    Mr. Regalia said these early June figures mirrored &quot;activity before the recent decline in interest rates.&quot;    According to the bank board report, lenders in early June were seeking an 8.74% average effective interest rate for the most popular adjustable-rate loans -- those that restrict rate increases. That rate was above the revised 8.57% rate of early May, which was previously reported by the bank board as 8.49%. Similarly, for loans without rate caps, lenders were asking 8.46%, up from a revised 8.27% in early May. The May figure previously was reported as 8.25%.    According to the survey, adjustable-rate loans accounted for 36% of all loans closed in early June, compared with 27% a month earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
