But it said earnings from continuing operations rose, as expected, by about 14%, partly because of the acquisition of Ex-Cell-O Corp. last fall.    Earnings from continuing operations were $65.9 million, or $1.59 a share, up from $58 million, or $1.46 a share. Net income, after a loss on discontinued operations, was $61 million, or $1.47 a share, down from $72 million, or $1.81 a share. Revenue rose 23% to $2.05 bilion from $1.66 billion.    Textron said the strength of its aerospace/technology and consumer products businesses, as well as the Ex-Cell-O acquisition, were responsibile for the improved results from continuing operations. Textron's third major business, financial services, showed lower earnings for both the fourth quarter and full year.    For the full year, earnings from continuing operations were $241.6 million, or $5.85 a share, up 34% from $180.1 million, or $4.83 a share, in 1985. Net, after results of discontinued operations, special charges from the early repayment of debt and the cumulative effect of an accounting change in 1985, was $239.2 million, or $5.79 a share, off 5% from $251.8 million, or $6.75 a share, in 1985.    Revenue was $6.95 billion, up 21% from $5.72 billion.    Textron shares closed yesterday at $65.25, up $1.625, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
