(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A banker charged with hiding illegal drugprofits in a $32 million money-laundering case says he was trickedby federal agents and now faces guilt by association to his formercustomer _ Manuel Noriega.   Amjad Awan, who once claimed to control Noriega's secretaccounts, is charged along with four other officers of the Bank ofCredit and Commerce International and a Colombian with launderingcash they knew to be drug proceeds.   In opening arguments Tuesday, prosecutors wove an account of howundercover agents infiltrated a Colombian drug lord's operation,picked up cocaine profits from U.S. middlemen and went to thebankers to help hide the source of the cash.   ``It's easy after the fact to look back and second-guess,''countered Awan's attorney, John P. Hume. ``But it's standardpractice: Bankers never ask where the money comes from. Itembarrasses customers and drives people away.''   Hume said Robert Musella, who was actually a Customs agentposing as a high-stakes launderer, never had a deal with thebankers to launder drug cash.   ``He never said he was engaged in criminal conduct. He nevergave Awan an opportunity to get in or to get out,'' Hume said.   Although Awan testified before a U.S. Senate panel in 1988 thathe once handled $23 million in Noriega's accounts, the defenseattorney also warned the government to keep the deposed Panamanianleader out of the case.   ``This is guilt by association. By focusing in on Panama andGeneral Noriega, they're causing you not to focus in on theproblems of the transactions,'' Hume told jurors.   The other defendants are Colombian Rudolf Armbrect of Medellin;Syed Aftab Hussain, who was operations officer of theLuxembourg-based bank in Panama; Akbar A. Bilgrami of Miami, adirector of the Latin American Division; Sibte Hassan, who was anofficer with the Paris branch; and Ian Howard, French countrymanager based in Paris.   They are accused of conspiracy to traffic in drugs, conspiracyto launder drug profits and money laundering.   Prosecutors said the bankers proposed a scheme in which millionsin drug profits were converted into certificates of deposit at thebank's Panama City branch, and then used as collateral for loansthat gave drug barons a source of cash.   Undercover agents recorded 148 meetings and more than 2,000telephone calls that prosecutors said will show the defendants wereaware they were handling drug money.   ``It was a policy of the bank to take in as many deposits as youcan as fast as you can and don't be too careful about where itcomes from,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Rubenstein said.   ``My clients are the biggest drug dealers in Colombia,'' theprosecutor quoted the undercover agent as telling Awan.   ``It's not any business of mine who the customers are,'' Awanreplied, according to Rubinstein.   Rubenstein said the bankers were motivated by ambition.   ``Their career goals,'' he said, ``were more important than thelaws of any country.''   Before the start of jury selection two weeks ago, two divisionsof the Luxembourg bank, one of the world's largest privatefinancial institutions, pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges.   As part of a plea bargain, the bank agreed to forfeit a record$14 million in assets frozen earlier by the government and tocooperate against other defendants.</TEXT></DOC>
