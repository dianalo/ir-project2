Garcia</HL><DD> 06/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Despite the stock market's directionless trading of recent weeks, it looks as if one important group of investors is buying shares more aggressively.    For the first time in almost three years, purchases by corporate insiders -- officers, directors and holders of stakes of 10% or more -- exceeded sales by insiders in the week ended last Wednesday. The last week in which this happened came in July 1984, and the time before that was in July 1982.    When insiders' purchases outnumber sales, it is &quot;a monumental event -- it's as if the two superpowers agreed on something at a summit,&quot; Edwin Buck, head of Vickers Stock Research Corp., which tracks insider activity, says. The data are culled from reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Mr. Buck says insiders normally make about 2.5 sales for every purchase. When the sales-to-purchases ratio is higher than 2.5 to 1, he takes it as a warning of a market top. When it is less than 2 to 1, he takes it as a bullish signal.    Based on an eight-week moving average, which Mr. Buck watches because it irons out fluctuations in the weekly data, the ratio has become increasingly bullish lately. From 2.0 as of May 13, the eight-week average dropped to 1.71 for the period ended last Wednesday.    The insider sell-buy ratio is just one of many tools that analysts and money managers use to gauge market sentiment. And these market watchers are divided in their opinions of its value.    According to Frank Korth, a technical analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., the recent pattern means that &quot;the market is at a level where insiders are looking for a pickup in their businesses, and they are looking more positively at their own stock.&quot;    However, John Connolly, a market strategist with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York, says: &quot;Insider buying and selling reflect management's own forecast of a firm's profits. Right now, (their action) is saying profits will be up, but everyone knows that already. The real question is whether or not stocks are going up.&quot;    And Robert Farrell, chief market analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, says that &quot;most people who are involved in the day-to-day operations of their businesses aren't in tune with the performance of their stocks.&quot;    Although the ratio provides some interesting data, he says, &quot;I don't see it as a great predictor. It won't tell you when the market is going to have its next big advance.&quot;    Edward S. Babbitt, president of Avatar Associates, a New York money management concern, says buying by insiders now &quot;tells us that they see their business prospects improving.&quot; But at this point in the economic cycle, he says, &quot;I'm not so sure it's going to be good for the stock market.&quot;    He worries that more robust economic activity could drive up interest rates as demand for credit rises, and higher rates could quickly squelch any stock rally.    In view of the rise in interest rates since late March and a tighter monetary policy at the Federal Reserve, Avatar has been selling stocks in the past two months. Equities now make up about 50% of the portfolios the firm manages, compared with 100% in late March.    In the 17 years that Mr. Buck has been tracking the stock-market activities of corporate insiders, the buy-sell ratio has flashed some premature positive signals.    &quot;In the 1973-74 bear market, one of the most severe in the last 30 years, the data showed insiders started buying in January 1973 and kept on buying through the whole bear market,&quot; Mr. Farrell says.    However, Mr. Buck says, signals from the insider sell-buy ratio tend to be more reliable on the buying than on the selling side. Insiders &quot;always cash in their chips too soon,&quot; he says.    Many analysts say that although the ratio by itself doesn't make a bullish or bearish outlook on the stock market, it's an indicator worth looking at. The sell-buy ratio dropped to 2.0 last November, for instance, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood around 2000. The rally that it seemed to be predicting got rolling Jan. 2 and has carried the industrial average as high as 2405, about a 20% gain.    The ratio also touched 2.0 in October 1985, March 1984 and June 1982. In these cases, the industrial average, despite some fluctuations, showed advances ranging from 9% to 63% in the next 17 months or less.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   The stock market ignored a firmer bond market as trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange slipped to a five-month low.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 10.93 to 2326.15. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.64 to 293.45. Big Board decliners outnumbered gainers, 810-739.    Big Board volume fell to 129.1 million shares from an already slow 140.3 million Thursday. It was the slowest session since Jan. 2, when 91.9 million shares traded.    Traders said profit-taking among recent gainers and nervousness ahead of this week's Venice economic summit might have accounted for the declines in stock prices.    The market largely ignored news that non-farm payrolls last month rose less than expected. The bond market rallied on the news, expecting that demand for credit would remain modest if the economy is slowing.    Federated Department Stores rose 2 3/8 to 50 3/8 on rumors shopping mall magnate Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. was readying a takeover bid. Mr. DeBartolo couldn't be reached.    Imperial Chemical Industries, a British concern, fell 1 5/8 to 95. The company said it plans to buy Stauffer Chemical from Unilever for $1.69 billion. Unilever rose 7 to 319 1/4.    Crazy Eddie fell 3/8 to 8 1/4 in active over-the-counter trading. The company said it would study a takeover offer from Entertainment Marketing at $8 a share. An investor group led by Eddie Antar, the company's founder, has offered to buy the company at $7 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
