Richard W. Zobel, a plant geneticist, said the root zone ofplants, called the rhizosphere, is a teeming world of minerals,gases, water and life forms _ insects, earthworms, microscopicnematode worms, a host of microorganisms, living and dead plantroots, and the chemicals they exude.   ``We don't even begin to thoroughly understand it, althoughwe're slowly pulling it together,'' he said. ``I'd say ourknowledge of the area six inches to two feet below the soil'ssurface is comparable to our knowledge of outer space right now.''   Zobel works for the department's Agricultural Research Serviceat the agency's laboratory in Ithaca, N.Y.   One reason for lack of knowledge about the world at our feet isthat ``only recently have we had the tools to study it, and they'restill not up to the job,'' he said. ``Soil physics and chemistry,plant biology and physiology, entomology and microbiology allprovide tools, but none of them is designed to work with more thana single microorganism or a single plant at a time.''   And when a scientist has to ``put all these elements togetherand try to study them, it's tough,'' Zobel said. ``We need to learnhow microorganisms interact with the plant, and with each other.Plant roots aren't all the same; they're functionally different andhave different growth patterns. Some die back every two weeks,continually feeding the microorganisms in the soil.''   Zobel spoke at an annual symposium held by the agency atBeltsville, Md. His remarks were included in reports issued by thedepartment.   Topics in the four-day conference include genetic engineeringand some of the new technologies for investigating the Earth's rootzone.   At a ceremony, Henry A. Wallace, who died in 1965, was honoredas the first member of a new USDA honor roll of agriculturalscientists. Wallace was secretary of agriculture in 1933-40 andU.S. vice president 1941-45.   Wallace, whose roots were deep in Iowa agriculture, gainedacclaim for his work as a corn breeder and as the founder of thefirst commercial hybrid seed company. His father, Henry C. Wallace,was secretary of agriculture in the early 1920s.</TEXT></DOC>
