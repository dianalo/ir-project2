A calculation method for the damper current distributionis presented, which approximates the damper cylinder by a grid of short-circuitedloops with an infinite conductivity. Magnetic field of the stator windingas well as the field of the damper cylinder is calculated by BIOT-SAVART'sLaw. The loop currents are calculated by iteration. As a sample result,damper current distribution lots are shown, which refer to a generatorwith a special design of a high voltage stator winding, the so-calledcoaxial turn winding.</TEXT></DOC>
