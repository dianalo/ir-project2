At least three soldiers and six guerrillas were killed, policeand army sources said.   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Frontstruck several garrisons and posts in the northernmost province ofChalatenango, army and rebel reports said.   The rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos said 13 soldiers werekilled or wounded in the town of Tejutla, 30 miles north of SanSalvador.   The radio said guerrillas also hit the garrison in the provincialcapital of Chalatenango, 28 miles northeast of the capital, and armyor civil defense posts in three other towns.   The radio did not immediately provide casualty figures.   Col. Ciro Lopez Roque, commander of the 4th infantry brigade,said in a radio interview that the army had no precise figures butthat ``there were quite a few casualties.''   The armed forces press committee said three soldiers died andthree were wounded in the fighting.   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, reachedby telephone in Chalatenango said the bodies of six guerrillas hadbeen recovered. The rebels also broadened an implicit threat madeearlier this week.   ``The polling places will be sabotaged and those persons who lendthemselves to this electoral game will later be killed, becauseparticipation indicates agreement with escalation of the war,'' saida rebel statement sent to radio stations.   The leftist Farbundo Marti National Liberation Front said earlierthis week that election officials would be considered part of thecounterinsurgency campaign. The threats were similar to those thathave been made against mayors.   Nine mayors have been assassinated. More than half the country's262 mayors have resigned because of the threats.   ``The guerrillas' opposition to the elections confirms the beliefthat what they want is to take power by force,'' said President JoseNapoleon Duarte in a Tuesday television interview.   Sunday's election presents Salvadorans with their firstopportunity to vote out an incumbent civilian administration andpolls indicate they may do just that. The rightist RepublicanNationalist Alliance, led by Alfredo Cristiani, is favored to beatthe Christian Democrats led by Fidel Chavez Mena.   The third major contender is a leftist alliance, the DemocraticConvergence. The coalition has been strained by the guerrillathreats, but its candidate, Guillermo Ungo, may force a runoff witha strong third-place finish.   Duarte, the incumbent Christian Democrat who is not running forre-election, said he feared rebel intimidation would keep peoplefrom the polls.   The atmosphere in the capital was tense as Duarte spoke. Rebelsabotage of telephone and electrical installations havesignificantly reduced vital services.   The rebel movement has been fighting the U.S.-backed governmentfor nine years.</TEXT></DOC>
