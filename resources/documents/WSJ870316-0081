Even the FDIC under William M. Isaac's leadership in 1983 was against a merger, pending rationalization of the regulatory scheme for commercial banks. Three federal agencies regulate commercial banks in contrast with the unified system of regulation for savings institutions.    Mr. Isaac's successor as chairman of the FDIC, William Seidman, opposes a merger of the deposit-insurance funds and favors recapitalization of the FSLIC. He is joined by Edwin Gray, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board; George Gould, undersecretary of the Treasury, and by most commercial-bank and savings-institution executives and their trade groups, including the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.    The distracting merger proposal would provide no more money to resolve the FSLIC's problem cases than a plan by the U.S. League to borrow $5 billion over two years that, when added to FSLIC deposit-insurance premiums and other income, would provide the agency with $10 billion. If needed, the plan would provide the FSLIC up to $38.7 billion over 20 years, but at this time no one knows the full cost of resolving problem cases.    The former regulators assume incorrectly that the FDIC would spend about $1.2 billion a year on bank failures and that the agency's income from assessments and its investment portfolio would be available to handle FSLIC cases. But the FDIC spent more than $4 billion closing banks over the past two years, and will spend $5.4 billion this year, according to an estimate of the Office of Management and Budget.    Chairman Seidman told Congress the FDIC's $18.2 billion reserve might shrink this year as the agency closes &quot;significantly more&quot; banks than the 138 closed in 1986. The FDIC will have its hands full with its own problem banks without taking on the disposal of failed savings institutions. The threat of default on commercial banks' foreign loans still looms. U.S. banks have $115 billion in loans outstanding to less-developed nations.    A much better approach than merging the insurance funds is to enact the U.S. League's plan to replenish the FSLIC's reserves and to institute a forbearance program for well-managed savings institutions in economically depressed areas, minimizing the costs to the FSLIC.
