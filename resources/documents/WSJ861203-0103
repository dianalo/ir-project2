Or you're reading an article on architecture and can't visualize the differences among mansard, imperial and rotunda roof styles.    If you don't have a plumbing guide or a history of architecture handy, you're out of luck. Conventional dictionaries aren't of much help unless you know the word to begin with, and their written definitions of objects often aren't very clear.    Hence The Visual Dictionary (Facts on File Publications, 797 pages, $29.95).    If you need to answer your plumbing question, you look up &quot;sink&quot; in the Visual Dictionary's general index and find a diagram indicating 21 separate parts. The same goes for roof styles. There are diagrams of cuts of beef, cloud formations, musical instruments, volcanos and bulldozers.    The idea of a dictionary based on pictures seems simple enough, but it took Jacques Fortin, the determined owner of Editions Quebec-Amerique, a small French-language publishing house in Quebec, four years to turn the idea into reality.    Mr. Fortin dreamed of a visual dictionary since his early days in publishing as a sales representative for Larousse dictionaries. Then, in 1982, Mr. Fortin had a chance encounter at a Paris bistro with Jean-Claude Corbeil, a Quebec linguist and longtime acquaintance.    Mr. Fortin was looking to buy the French-language rights to What's What: A Visual Glossary of the Physical World, which uses photos and drawings to describe the workings of everyday objects. But Mr. Corbeil found What's What incomplete and its selection of material a bit too cute (it includes an electric chair). The Duden, a dictionary that originated in Germany, is also based on pictures, but both men felt it was outdated and hard to use. So they decided to compile a new dictionary based on pictures. It was an act of faith. &quot;We don't have the means to do marketing studies,&quot; says Mr. Fortin in his cramped office on the third floor of a downtown Montreal apartment building. &quot;I decide on marketing. I decide on everything.&quot;    They prepared an outline of their proposed dictionary and presented it to publishers at the Frankfurt book fair in 1983. The project was greeted with skepticism.    &quot;We were completely unknown internationally,&quot; says Mr. Fortin. &quot;We were looked on as adventurers. A French publisher told me it was too expensive and we would get into trouble with it. But I figured that if I was going to go bankrupt, it would be a nice bankruptcy.&quot;    The publishers did provide useful advice. They told Mr. Fortin to keep away from photographs or realistic illustrations and stick with technical drawings that didn't risk going out of fashion within a couple of years.    The meetings also convinced Mr. Fortin that success would come only if the dictionary made it in the U.S. So research on the dictionary was done simultaneously in English as well as French. &quot;The English version isn't a translation. It's based on English documentation,&quot; says Mr. Corbeil.    Many of the terms aren't included in conventional dictionaries and had to be found in encyclopedias, catalogs and even advertisements. Terms for appliances were researched in instruction manuals from appliance manufacturers, says Mr. Corbeil.    Mr. Fortin admits he guessed wrong on cost. &quot;We thought we could do it in two years for less than $500,000. It took four years and it cost double.&quot; Despite efforts to keep the dictionary neutral, there are signs of a Canadian bias. For one thing, it shows five different kinds of snowshoes. The section on energy includes a diagram of the Canadian-designed Candu nuclear reactor, hardly the world standard for such technology.    Mr. Corbeil responds that the Canadian nuclear system is similar to others and that using the Candu was the only way to get dependable terminology in both English and French. &quot;If I had taken an American process, I would have been unable to get a decent French version and if I had taken a French nuclear system, I wouldn't have got the English.&quot;    Other choices are more questionable. The section on cheeses includes a selection of French and North American varieties, but Stilton and Gouda are nowhere to be found. Mr. Corbeil admits the selection was arbitrary but says that otherwise there would have been eight or nine pages of cheeses rather than two.    Preparing the dictionary for the British market may prove more difficult. &quot;The estimate is that 15% to 20% of the terms will have to be changed. We originally felt it would be 5% to 10%,&quot; says Edward Knappman, publisher of Facts on File, which has rights to the dictionary in the U.S. and Britain. Changes are as basic as bonnet for hood and spanner for wrench but also include many technical terms.    Initially published this fall, the dictionary is already into its third printing for a total of 115,000 copies. The dictionary has been selected by two U.S. book clubs and there's talk of Spanish, German, Chinese and bilingual editions. There are also plans for a young people's edition and a computerized version.    For Mr. Fortin, the dictionary means a ticket out of what he terms &quot;the ghetto&quot; of publishing for the tiny Quebec market. Over the next four years, he expects revenue of $30 million from the dictionary.    Mr. Fortin admits to being a little overwhelmed by his success. &quot;Before we always had to solicit {business} and now we're the ones being solicited.&quot;    ---   Mr. Freeman is the Journal's Montreal bureau chief. </TEXT></DOC>
