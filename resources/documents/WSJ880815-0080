But observers say widespread civil unrest could erupt again unless the government bows to protesters' demands for fundamental political change.    After five days of nationwide anti-government demonstrations and bloodshed, Sein Lwin resigned Friday as chairman of the authoritarian Burma Socialist Program Party and president of the country. The military strongman had a reputation for ruthlessness in suppressing civil disturbances, including those last week.    Sein Lwin's departure, coming after only 18 days in power, is the first concession wrested from the government by popular protest in 26 years.    Demonstrations by students, monks and workers around the country have stopped. Although troops continued to patrol the capital of Rangoon yesterday, their numbers have diminished, residents say. Some government areas remained sealed off.    But whether the calm will continue depends on the outcome of an emergency session of the People's Assembly, set for Friday. Some Burmese predict that unless the session yields plans to alter the country's autocratic, single-party political system, protesters again will take to the streets. The government hasn't announced an agenda for the meeting.    &quot;There's a tremendous sense of relief that Sein Lwin is gone,&quot; a Western diplomat says. But whether the demonstrations resume &quot;depends upon the degree of popular support&quot; the as-yet unannounced new leader will have, he says.    Many Burmese believe that Ne Win, who seized power in a 1962 coup, still controls the party and the country, despite his resignation as party chairman last month. Given such skepticism about the government's power, some analysts believe that any new leader produced by the Burma Socialist Program Party is likely to encounter widespread opposition.    There has been little indication of who will succeed Sein Lwin. Some analysts mention as possibilities Aye Ko, Burma's vice president, and Kyaw Htin, newly appointed secretary of the Council of State, the party's executive committee. But both are career military leaders and aren't likely to gain much popular support.    Some residents also mention Maung Maung, chairman of the Council of People's Attorneys, a civilian who likely would be more acceptable to protesters. But diplomats note that even if he becomes president, the party chairmanship likely would go to a military leader, who probably would wield effective power.    An educator living in Rangoon mentions Aung Gyi, a former military colleague of Ne Win who resigned from the party in 1963, as the most acceptable contender. Aung Gyi helped give focus to popular disenchantment with Ne Win's regime early this year when several of his letters to the Burmese strongman urging reform were circulated in Rangoon. But Aung Gyi was arrested July 29 for attacking the state.    The official announcement of this Friday's assembly session didn't give details about what would be discussed. Although the government for 26 years has been unwilling to entertain public demands, some observers are hopeful that the recent violence may force concessions.    &quot;Some people think the new president will concede to student demands&quot; -- for democratic elections and the release of detainees -- &quot;because people are so fed up,&quot; says the educator in Rangoon. &quot;If not, the demonstrators might turn to the rebels, and divide the country,&quot; he says.    More than 10 rebel groups, composed mainly of ethnic minorities, have battled the government for 40 years and control large sections of Burma. One rebel leader Friday called for protesters to join with the rebels in toppling the government.    Since Friday, new posters have appeared throughout the capital calling for democracy, a release of political detainees and punishment of those responsible for the bloodshed, a diplomat says.    The government reported fewer than 100 deaths since last Monday, although some believe as many as 1,000 were killed. More than 1,400 have been arrested according to official reports.    Ne Win's single-party political system long has been unpopular, but it has remained in power largely because of military support. In his 26-year rule, Ne Win transformed Burma from one of Southeast Asia's richest societies to one of the world's poorest countries. Under his &quot;Burmese Way to Socialism,&quot; the state took control of almost all aspects of economic, political and social life.    When he resigned, Ne Win acknowledged the public's &quot;lack of trust in the government and the party that guides it.&quot; He also called for reforms, including a national referendum on the system of government. Although the assembly voted for economic reforms, the party rejected his call for political changes.    Even if reforms can be instituted, it will take years for the country to recover from Ne Win-style socialism. &quot;The government has destroyed the old education system, which taught people to think for themselves, because ignorant people are easier to control,&quot; the Rangoon educator says. &quot;You can mend the country's economy,&quot; he says, &quot;but it isn't easy to mend the mentality of the people.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
