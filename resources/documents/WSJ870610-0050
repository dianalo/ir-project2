Dallas-based EDS, which was to be the prime contractor in a team with US Sprint, cited recent changes in the bidding procedure made to accommodate American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., New York, as one reason for its withdrawal. Analysts said the ATandamp;T-requested changes will enable ATandamp;T, which holds the current federal phone contract, to make a very low bid for the federal contract, thus squeezing potential profits for all bidders.    A spokesman for EDS said the possibility that a winning bid for the system, called FTS 2000, might be unprofitable wasn't a factor in EDS's decision to withdraw. It said that changes in the date bids are due and uncertainty about when the bid would be awarded were the main reasons for withdrawing. The General Services Administration recently pushed back by one month, to July 30, the date bids are due and has said it expects to award the contract by the end of the year.    US Sprint -- a joint venture of Stamford, Conn.-based GTE Corp. and Kansas City, Mo.-based United Telecommunications Inc. -- said it would reconsider whether to bid as a prime contractor, with EDS perhaps as a subcontractor, or whether to withdraw from the process entirely.    A spokesman for US Sprint, based in Kansas City, said the concern was &quot;disappointed&quot; by EDS's withdrawal, but that its business plans hadn't counted on getting business from FTS 2000, so &quot;we have the luxury of assessing what is the best thing to do next.&quot;    Besides ATandamp;T, Martin Marietta Corp., Bethesda, Md., has said it would join with MCI Communications Corp., of Washington, the seven regional Bell concerns and a unit of Toronto-based Northern Telecom Ltd. to submit a bid for the federal phone system. </TEXT></DOC>
