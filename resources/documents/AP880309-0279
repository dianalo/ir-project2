(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. Labor Department has rejectedarguments from South Carolina and North Carolina officials who aretrying to keep 17-year-old school bus drivers on the road throughthe end of the school year.   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell on Wednesday repeated hisstate's plea to allow the drivers to remain behind the wheel.   Representatives of each state argued unsuccessfully for a stayof the department's revocation of waivers, effective April 1, thathad allowed the use of the young drivers if they had clean drivingrecords, Labor Department spokeswoman Linda Tavlin said Tuesday.   The two states won waivers last year of a federal lawprohibiting school bus drivers under 18, but the department revokedthe waivers in late February. In an investigation following thedeath of a West Columbia child hit by a 17-year-old driver with abad driving record, the department said it found many of the17-year-olds had bad records.   Campbell, in a letter to Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin, said heunderstands the department's decision and does not intend to seek awaiver for next year. But he said firing drivers before the end ofthe school year would not serve the department's purpose.   ``The State Superintendent of Education assures me that he hason file a letter from each of the 91 district superintendentscertifying that all 17-year-olds currently driving school busesmeet all ... conditions outlined in the letters of exemption,'' thegovernor wrote.   ``Replacing these drivers with slighly older, inexperienceddrivers for two months could potentially lead to a less safetransportation system,'' he wrote.   A spokesman for Campbell said Wednesday the governor's officewill continue working with South Carolina's senators, ErnestHollings and Strom Thurmond, to get legislative relief from theLabor Department's action.   The U.S. House already has approved a bill that would allow bothstates to use the drivers through the school year, and the Senateis expected to take up the measure next week.   Carl Garris, deputy state superintendent of schools, said thestate has about 950 17-year-old drivers now, down from 2,250 at thebeginning of the school year.</TEXT></DOC>
