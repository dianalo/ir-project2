<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-03-0964 </DOCNO><TEXT>Four surrogate waste constituents, benzene, toluene, methylene chlorideand trichlorethylene, were examined for destruction removal efficiency(DRE). These compounds were mixed with natural gas and burnt in a turbulentdiffusion flame. The DRE was determined by observing the change in wasteconcentration in the exhaust with and without a flame. The flame ionizationdetector (FID) in a gas chromatograph was used to monitor the waste concentrations.DREs of the wastes were plotted as a function of related parameters (characteristictime, mixing rate). Plots were also obtained for the tracer, SF/sub 6/.Data collection was subjet to the minimum detectability of the FID. Theconstraint limited useful data to benzene and trichloroethylene only.Comparison revealed a failure mode relationship for the DRE between thetracer and the surrogates tested.</TEXT></DOC>
