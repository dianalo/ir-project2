Consider the surfeit of product offshoots -- new flavorsor sizes or other variations of established brands --introduced last year: 64 spaghetti sauces, 103 snack chips,54 laundry detergents, 91 cold remedies and 69 disposablediapers, according to Marketing Intelligence Service Ltd.,Naples, N.Y. Group EFO, a marketing-consulting firm inWeston, Conn., reports that 81% of products introduced to themarketplace in 1990 were extensions of existing brands, upfrom 70% in 1988.</LP><TEXT>   The problem: Supermarket and drugstore managers don't havethe shelf space required to stock every brand extension.Shoppers, in turn, often can't find what they have been ledto believe is available. And even when the desired productsare in stock, consumers become confused about what to choose.   &quot;Everybody's trying to find a unique segment of theirmarket that they can dominate,&quot; says Richard L. Mazer ofMarketing Corp. of America, San Francisco. &quot;But at some pointthe number of options becomes bewildering.&quot;   Disposable diapers are an especially thorny issue. Thebulky packages plague retailers by filling coveted shelfspace. For shoppers, the consequences of purchasing the wrongdiaper -- particularly one that's too big -- can be dire (notto mention damp). As new varieties of disposable diapersmultiply, store managers are scrambling to find new shelfspace and shoppers are spending bewildering moments in thediaper aisle figuring out what to buy.   It used to be that disposable diapers came in small,medium, large and extra-large sizes. Now they are made to fitbabies at every stage of development, from newborns withsensitive umbilical cords to toddlers ready for toilettraining. And some are no longer unisex. Some diapers forboys are blue and have padding up front, while others forgirls are pink and have padding in the middle. Some brandshave fastener tabs with Disney cartoon characters; othersfeature the Muppets.   &quot;Since they added all these sizes, I've been havingtrouble,&quot; says Michael Eisenberg, a Pittsburgh dentist whofinds buying diapers for his two young daughters anincreasingly frustrating experience. His principal trouble:&quot;I go to the store and buy the wrong size.&quot;   Rosie Thomas, who minds several of her grandchildrenduring the week while their parents are at work, spendsprecious time in the diaper aisle of her supermarket puzzlingover what to buy. &quot;I've tried different brands -- Pampers,Huggies, Luvs -- to see what's the difference and they allseem the same to me,&quot; she says. &quot;Sometimes I can only get asmall pack of diapers when I want a big pack, or I can onlyget `boy' diapers when I need the `girl' kind.&quot;   Procter andamp; Gamble Co., which controls about 52% of thedisposable-diaper market, says the brand extensions aresimply a response to consumer demand, something it gaugesthrough marketing tests. &quot;We change with customerpreferences,&quot; says a Pandamp;G spokesman. Last fall Pandamp;G addedseveral new sizes to its Pampers and Luvs brands. Theconsumer-products giant now makes a dozen different kinds ofPampers and a dozen kinds of Luvs. And each kind comes in&quot;girl&quot; and &quot;boy&quot; styles and various size packages.   Rival Kimberly-Clark Corp.'s Huggies brand of disposablescomes in just five varieties, which could give it an edgewith customers. Huggies currently has about a 31% marketshare in disposables, while private labels have 17%. (Inanother bit of brand extension, Kimberly-Clark also makesHuggies Pull-Ups training pants in three sizes, for toddlerswho are out of diapers but not yet ready to give upprotection altogether.)   With so many choices of disposable diapers on the market,&quot;It makes sense that consumers would get irritated,&quot; saysBonita Austin, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co. Shebelieves it's too soon to tell if Pandamp;G's strategy willbackfire but agrees that &quot;it's so difficult to buy diapersnow because you have to be so specific in what you want.&quot;   Shoppers face the same confusion in food aisles. TakeCampbell soup. Once upon a time, it was a one-size staple,packaged in uniform red-and-white cans. Today, Campbell SoupCo. offers regular Campbell soup, home-cooking style, chunkyand &quot;healthy request&quot; varieties -- and more than 100 flavors.   Marketing experts say manufacturers may be reaching apoint of diminishing returns with brand offshoots. With allthe competition, &quot;the net result is that market shares don'tchange all that much,&quot; says Richard Lawrence, president ofMarketing Intelligence Service.   Moreover, consumer enthusiasm for product innovations haswaned as the economy pokes along, says Mr. Lawrence. &quot;Peopledon't have as much money to spend and are looking for lessexpensive products which don't offer the frills.&quot;   Some variations on existing products are numerous enoughto numb the sharpest shoppers' minds. Someone suffering fromcold symptoms, for instance, faces a torrent of Johnson andamp;Johnson products including Tylenol Cold and Flu (dissolves inhot liquids) or an &quot;effervescent&quot; variety (dissolves in coldliquids). Then there are Tylenol Cold, either regular or &quot;nodrowsiness,&quot; in tablets or caplets; Tylenol Cough, regularand decongestent; Tylenol Sinus gel caps and Tylenol AllergySinus gel caps or caplets, regular and extra strength.   Shoppers like Jean Striegl of Whitehall, Pa., cut throughthe confusion by selecting generic over-the-counter coldmedicines. &quot;They have the same ingredients, but they'recheaper and easier to tell apart,&quot; she says. Dr. Eisenberg,the Pittsburgh dentist, also says he eschews big-name brandsbecause &quot;it's all the same . . . just different colors.&quot;   Still, some innovations are decided hits. That has beenthe case in recent months with super-concentrated laundrydetergents, which require less powder per load of laundry andthus can be packaged in smaller and easier-to-carry packages.Pandamp;G was first last fall with a new &quot;ultra&quot; Tide detergent andhas since been followed by Colgate-Palmolive Co.'s Fab andAjax and Unilever Group's All. The ultra detergents areoutselling regular and liquid varieties, retailers report.   But even when consumers are pleased with new varieties,product proliferation triggers tension between manufacturersand retailers. Store managers get blamed when shoppers can'tfind certain products on crowded store shelves. &quot;It's a soresubject,&quot; says Frank Wolinsky, manager of a Food Gallerysupermarket in Pittsburgh.   Busy shoppers have short fuses. Deb Sievers of Omaha,Neb., whose newborn spent his first week in oversize Pampersbecause the supermarket was out of the tiniest size, says: &quot;Idon't blame the manufacturer. I blame the store.&quot;   Bob Bride, manager of a Hy-Vee Food Stores Inc.supermarket in Lincoln, Neb., explains how he fights backwhen manufacturers introduce new varieties: &quot;We say, `OK, ifyou have a new item, it has to come out of your own space.'They don't like it. Their purpose is to get more shelfspace.&quot;   But most of the time, Mr. Bride says, he is forced tostock offshoots when consumers, lured by marketing campaigns,start clamoring for them. &quot;Occasionally it's frustrating,like when they come out with a liquid bleach that comes in afresh scent, a lemon scent, a pine scent and a regularscent,&quot; he says. &quot;That's a great big gallon bottle that takesup a lot of shelf space.&quot;   Often, supermarket managers with limited shelf space haveto discontinue store-brand items, which they would prefer topromote, in favor of brand-name products being promoted bymanufacturers. Mr. Wolinsky says he is in a constant race tomake room for new versions of spaghetti sauces and frozendinners -- a difficult feat in his small, urban store.   He laments that &quot;if the consumer doesn't find a certainspaghetti sauce on the shelf and the retailer hasn't foundspace on the shelf, they'll start asking, and all of a suddena retailer like myself says: I better get it in and redeemcoupons.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
