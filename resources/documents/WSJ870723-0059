The Wilmington, Del.-based chemical concern also agreed to comply generally with federal health and safety regulations, to review its illness and injury record-keeping practices at all corporate locations, and to keep its records as required by federal rules, the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration said. Du Pont agreed to the settlement without admitting guilt.    OSHA had proposed penalties totaling $50,100, which Du Pont contested. The enforcement action stemmed from OSHA inspections of company facilities in Niagara Falls, N.Y., and Dallas.    The agency has recently reached settlement agreements in record-keeping cases with USX Corp. and Chrysler Corp., and has proposed major fines against some other employers on similar charges. </TEXT></DOC>
