As in some other communist countries, Yugoslavia's economic system has been incapable of coping with the pressures of modern times. And its leaders, unlike their strong-willed counterparts in the Soviet bloc, have had little power to do anything about it.    In a country without a free market, the central bank sometimes appears to have less influence over the money supply than the U.S. Federal Reserve Board; in August, the annual inflation rate topped 116%. In a system that doesn't admit the possibility of labor unrest, strikes are rampant: 873 have taken place since January.    In part because of a weak dollar, the country's foreign debt has, by one estimate, reached $22 billion. Political rivalries and ethnic conflicts among six republics and two autonomous provinces make everything worse.    &quot;It's not a totally hopeless case,&quot; says a Western banker who follows the country. &quot;It's what's been going on all along, only everybody thought that what was wrong was being fixed.&quot;    But now the country is being shaken by a scandal involving an outsized example of a business practice many Yugoslavs consider normal and many foreigners find astounding. A big agro-industrial company called Agrokomerc had issued promissory notes in local currency valued at at least $256 million. The notes had no collateral. A bank guaranteed them anyway. The company used the proceeds to finance some fancy projects. Now it can't pay the money back.    The bank that issued the guarantee, the Bank of Bihac, looks set to go under. In addition, 63 other banks are lining up to press their claims in court. The president of Agrokomerc, Fikret Abdic, is under arrest. And on Saturday, the man due to take over the ceremonial rotating presidency of Yugoslavia next May, Hamdija Pozderac, resigned as vice president.    The official Tanjug news agency said yesterday that the Communist Party expelled 42 members over the the scandal. It also said at least 130 Communists &quot;face the judgment of the party and the law&quot; in the Bosnian town of Velika Kladusa, where the financial dealings were first exposed last month.    Mr. Pozderac, who comes from Agrokomerc's home republic of Bosnia and Hercegovina, was accused in the state press of pushing the company's development plans. Denying any wrongdoing, he said his resignation was &quot;of a principled nature.&quot; Mr. Abdic, active in politics too, belonged to the Bosnian Communist Party's central committee. That also happens to be the power base of Yugoslavia's prime minister, Branko Mikulic.    The link hasn't improved the prime minister's image as an economic bumbler, and has begun to raise questions about his own future. Yet it is generally acknowledged in Yugoslavia that thousands of loss-making state companies survive in much the same way. Weak concerns have long turned to stronger ones for cash. More for political than for economic reasons, managers have been expected to cooperate. &quot;When banks didn't provide credit, the enterprises created their own,&quot; says Jan Vanous, research director of PlanEcon Inc. in Washington.&quot;    In many cases, promissory notes were passed on to other companies as payment for purchases of materials. They found their way into the banks, which preferred them to their fast-depreciating deposits of Yugoslavian dinars. The banks paid good interest. The companies were happy.    Last year alone, Mr. Vanous estimates, $8 billion in credit was generated this way. International bankers consider the practice a prime source of Yugoslavia's inflation, which has helped foment this year's wave of strikes for higher wages. The country's central bank has denounced the notes.    But Yugoslavia's leaders have yet to find a clear way out. Two years ago, the state passed a law to stem lending between companies. As the scandal at Agrokomerc suggests, the effect may be limited.    The law made it illegal to float promissory notes that aren't adequately backed, and it required a bank guarantee. But only two years ago, Agrokomerc's antics would have been legal. No one can say how many more enterprises are in the same kind of trouble.    &quot;It's a matter of time before we hear about other companies, and I don't know if Agrokomerc will be the worst,&quot; Mr. Vanous says. &quot;They are bankrupt. The moment of truth is coming.&quot;    At the end of this month, another law uncommon in a communist regime is due to take effect in Yugoslavia. Under it, companies that can't pay their debts are supposed to go bankrupt. Some say that could amount to a third of all the companies in the country.    This is all happening just as Yugoslavia prepares to ask the international banks for another rescheduling of its hard-currency debt. A rescheduling last March was put off because the Yugoslavs hadn't met the banks' demands. In July, the country had to miss a payment. But, oddly enough, nobody seems that worried.    Bankers expect the state to bail out many of the threatened enterprises. They say the International Monetary Fund may step in to press more actively for an economic reform. And that, at least, would put an end to the blizzard of promissory notes.    As a diplomat based in Belgrade puts it: &quot;I'm not ready to panic about anything that happens in Yugoslavia. They do things differently here.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
