KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell calledon President Bush on Wednesday to waive for a year a provisionlimiting U.S.-Soviet trade.   Mitchell also said Bush should consider permitting Soviet entryinto international economic organizations under specifiedconditions.   ``We should clearly indicate that if the Soviet Union will playby the rules, we will welcome it into the game,'' Mitchell said.   The majority leader told the Senate that the president, by hisproposal this week for mutual cuts in U.S. and Soviet forces inEurope, took a major step to address the apparently changed natureof Soviet communism under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   He called for a comprehensive American and NATO strategy to``seize upon change within the Soviet Union in order to enhanceWestern security.''   ``Changing circumstances require clear direction and not just areactive or improvised course of action,'' Mitchell said.   He said that a symbolic but important first step would be forBush to waive the Jackson-Vanik amendment which was imposed in 1974to prohibit U.S. trade concessions until Moscow permits freeimmigration of Jews and other minority groups.   The legislation was sponsored by the late Sen. Henry M. Jackson,D-Wash., and former Rep. Charles Vanik, D-Ohio.   Addressing himself to the president, Mitchell said: ``I urge himto use his authority to waive Jackson-Vanik for a year, therebyhelping to normalize economic relations and expand thepossibilities for trade.''   He noted that Soviet emigration is rising and that the Sovietgovernment is moving toward legal changes to institutionalize freeemigration.   ``Now is an appropriate time for the United States to respond tochange we have sought for more than a decade,'' Mitchell said. ``Wecan affirm and encourage further openness within the Soviet Union.''   Mitchell said Bush should build on that step by stating plainlythat if the Soviet Union is able to decentralize its economy andinstitute market mechanisms, ``then the United States would lookpositively upon Soviet entry into Western economic organizations,''including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.   Mitchell also said the administration should move quickly innegotiations aimed at achieving deep cuts in strategic nuclear arms.   ``It would be a great loss if we failed to capitalize on theopportunity to reduce the far larger strategic arsenals and tostabilize the nuclear balance,'' Mitchell said.</TEXT></DOC>
