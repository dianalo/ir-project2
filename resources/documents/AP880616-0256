At the White House, meanwhile, President Reagan met with topJustice Department and FBI officials to stress his desire for ``afull and thorough investigation as rapidly as possible,'' hisspokesman said.   The bug and wiretap were at the office of defense contractorconsultant Melvyn Paisley, who from 1981 to April 1987 wasassistant secretary of the Navy for research, engineering andsystems, a key acquisition post under former Navy Secretary John F.Lehman. Paisley now has numerous defense contractors as clients.   The sources were confirming a report in today's editions of TheWashington Post.   At the White House, Reagan met with the government's top lawenforcement officials, including Attorney General Edwin Meese; FBIDirector William Sessions; Edward Dennis, new head of the JusticeDepartment's criminal division, and U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson ofVirginia, along with top White House aides, including counselArthur Culvahouse.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater described Reagan as``very concerned,'' and added:   ``We can't go into any details of the investigation in terms ofthe discussion or what they told the president. But suffice to sayeveryone wants to pursue this with the utmost vigor anddetermination.''   Fitzwater said the matter ``certainly poses an internal securityproblem'' and told reporters that Reagan ``feels that this is amatter that deserves his attention and that everyone involvedshould know of his feelings, the intensity which he feels aboutdealing with any kinds of crimes that have been committed here.''   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said later that Carlucci hadordered two top officials to begin forming a special task forcethat would monitor developments in the investigation and ascertainif contracting procedures must be overhauled.   Howard said Kathleen Buck, the Pentagon's general counsel, andRobert Costello, the under secretary for acquisition, would headthe panel.   In St. Louis, a search warrant unsealed in federal court saidPaisley provided ``classified and-or confidential'' documents toone of his clients, McDonnell Douglas Corp., on contracts beingsought by the company. In two of those contracts, worth billions ofdollars, McDonnell Douglas is competing against General DynamicsCorp., which has its headquarters in St. Louis County.   On Tuesday, federal agents searched the office of a McDonnellDouglas executive as part of the probe of alleged bribery and fraudin defense contracting. McDonnell Douglas was served with a searchwarrant, along with 14 other defense contractors, and 38 searchwarrants were issued Tuesday and Wednesday in 12 states.   According to the search warrant unsealed in U.S. District Courtin St. Louis, part of the scheme involved the illegal disclosure ofconfidential or classified information and the ``exertion ofinfluence'' on Defense Department contracts.   The search warrant alleges that former Pentagon officials bribedcurrent government employees to get the information, then gave itto defense contractors who had hired the former officials asconsultants.   The investigation of McDonnell Douglas appears to center onThomas Gunn, vice president of marketing for McDonnell AircraftCo., and Paisley.   The warrant says Paisley gave McDonnell Douglas and Gunn``substantial information obtained from government officials whichhas been classified and-or confidential or not available to thecontracting public.''   The warrant said agents were looking for evidence of bribery ofpublic officials, violations of conflict-of-interest laws, theft ofgovernment property, fraud and conspiracy.   Gunn's was the only office at McDonnell Douglas's headquartersin St. Louis County to be searched, according to the warrant. Itemsseized in the search of Gunn's office included calendars, cardfiles, computer discs, memos, status reports and video cassettes.   The FBI also placed a court-authorized wiretap in the office ofVictor Cohen, the civilian official responsible for buying tacticalbattle command, control, communications and computer systems forthe Air Force, sources speaking on condition of anonymity told TheAssociated Press.   A court-authorized tap also was installed in the office of JamesGaines, deputy assistant secretary of the Navy for acquisitionmanagement, international programs and congressional support, saidthe sources.   Federal investigators armed with evidence from the wiretaps,hich have been in place for much of the two years of the probe, arepreparing to approach witnesses who now may be cooperate with thegovernment's massive Pentagon purchasing fraud probe.   The probe has turned up ``rampant bribery in the government''and includes allegations of cash payments, purchase of cars andpayments of bills for government employees, Sen. John Warner saidWednesday.   The government is now preparing to approach people whose voicesare recorded on the taps and who are implicated in possibly illegalacts, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.   ``They're going to confront them with the tapes and see who theycan flip'' into becoming government witnesses, one source saidWednesday.   The White House said Wednesday that President Reagan was amongmany top government officials who were not told in advance of theprobe.   Meese was not told of the investigation until late March becausehis name came up on one of the wiretaps, the Post reported today,citing unidentified sources for the information.   Warner, ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, saidthere were many cases where companies ``paid $500 or $1,000 to agovernment employee for proprietary information and then went outand sold it for $50,000.''   Warner made the statements in comments inadvertently recorded ashe spoke to committee chairman Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., prior to acongressional hearing.   One warrant sought information from two offices at Cubic DefenseSystems Inc. in San Diego, Calif., about a sophisticated electronicpilot training system used by the Air Force and Navy, said WilliamC. Stewart, vice president and general counsel at Cubic Corp.   Stewart said the company used a consultant, William Galvin ofWashington, whose office files also were searched in the probe.   Government sources said federal investigators also tried toquestion two Cubic employees who had spoken with Cohen, but weretold by company lawyers not to do so.   Search warrants were served on at least six current or formerPentagon employees.   Among the offices searched was that of George Stone, an officialin the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command. Stone is directorof the information management services and information transferpurchases division.   A warrant also was served on Jack Sherman, a civilian employeein the Marine Corps. Sherman works in the equipment and serviceacquisition section of the contracts division, installation andlogistics department at Marine Corps headquarters.   Another Pentagon employee whose files were searched, StuartBerlin, works for the Naval Air Systems Command, the primecontracting office for aircraft-related procurement. Berlin is thehead of the ship systems engineering branch.   Knight-Ridder reported that the search warrant for Berlin'soffice sought information about his relations</TEXT></DOC>
