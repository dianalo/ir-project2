The merging of two notabletrends, competition in providing electrical services and least-cost energyplanning, offers a promising approach to the effective implementationof least-cost strategies. Competition in providing electrical serviceshas stimulated alternative resource development, and in some cases, hascreated exciting opportunities for acquiring resources in a least-costmanner. However, a truly competitive market will require that demand-and supply-side resources can compete on an equal basis, but conservationis already at a serious disadvantage. Least-cost energy planning lawsand regulations have been adopted by over half a dozen states nationwide.The least-cost planning process requires utilities to identify the economicpotential for all resource options, including energy efficiency improvements,load management, cogeneration, and renewable energy sources. Utilitiesmust then rank these options according to their relative cost-effectiveness,and invest in the cheapest options for meeting electrical needs. A mergingof these two approaches holds great promise.</TEXT></DOC>
