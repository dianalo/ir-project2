However, even at 500 MHzthe 2D chemical shift dispersion does not allow for unambiguous assignmentof all cross-peaks. By use of 2D relayed coherence transfer experiments(RELAY) optimized to detect two-step {sup 1}H/{sup 1}H scalar interactionsin which one of the J-values is small, sufficient additional correlationscan be obtained from the frequency-isolated resonances to allow faciletracing of all scalar connectivities. Complete assignments of the {sup1}H NMR spectra of amikacin, its 6'-N-hemisuccinamide, and a novel bis(acylate)[{gamma}-N-(p-vinylbenzoyl)amikacin 6'-N-hemisuccinamide] were obtainedfor aqueous media. The NMR spectrum of amikacin free base was also assignedin dimethyl sulfoxide solution. The RELAY experiment can be extendedto the analysis of reaction mixtures, which allows for the identificationand resonance assignment of regioisomeric amikacin haptens in the mixturestate. All of the N-monohemisuccinyl isomers of amikacin have been identifiedin reaction mixtures through the RELAY experiment. The relative reactivitiesof the amino functions of amikacin toward acylating agents were foundto be 6'-N andgt; 3-N {ge} 3&quot;-N {ge} {gamma}-N. However, this reactivity orderis altered after the initial acylation event.</TEXT></DOC>
