Here the searchfor a site to drill into a magma chamber for the purpose of geothermalenergy development coincides with a separate scientific imperative, theneed to monitor the caldera for potential hazards due to earthquakesand volcanic eruptions. The region has a proven potential for these hazards:five M{ge}6 earthquakes have struck since 1978, and phreatic, ash andsteam, eruptions have occurred as recently as 550--600 years ago [Miller,1985]. As we assess the results of additional intermediate depth holesand the results from a widening spectrum of divining tools, the magmaseems farther from the surface and less abundant than it did just a fewyears ago. We have also begun to discern the prodound imprint of structureswhich predate the formation of the caldera 0.73 Ma and which now appearto control its eruptive behavior and hydrothermal system.</TEXT></DOC>
