The measure, introduced by Reps. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., andHenry Hyde, R-Ill., contains no sanctions against the woman or theperson who pays her to have a child.   Instead, it is aimed primarily at brokers who take a fee to linkwomen willing to have a baby for pay with couples willing to pay fora child. It calls for a maximum penalty of five years in prison anda $50,000 fine for conviction of such brokering and provides thatsuch contracts are unenforceable.   Introduction of the bill came one day before the firstanniversary of the famous ``Baby M'' case in which the New JerseySupreme Court ruled that a surrogate mother contract could not beenforced.   While the legislation is designed to effectively endcommercialized surrogate-mother contracts even if no broker isinvolved, Boxer and Hyde said they did not propose criminalpenalities for either the mother or the person who pays her becausethey consider both to be victims.   ``In the case of surrogancy, there is a desperate, childlesscouple and a surrogate mother desperate for money,'' said Boxer.``Into this circumstance a commercial brokerage business has emergedwhich could lead to the creation of a new class of women in oursociety _ paid breeders, and eventually a new class of children whowill be forced to accept the reality that their natural mothers soldthem.''   Hyde said the practice of paying a woman to have a baby smacks ofslavery.   ``By reducing childbearing to an occupation, surrogancyarrangements attack the essential human dignity of every person,''said Hyde.   The two representatives were joined at a news conference byJeremy Rifkin, cochairman of the National Coalition AgainstSurrogancy.   ``Commercialized childbearing denigrates human dignity because itplaces a commercial bond before a maternal bond,'' said Rifkin.   The Boxer-Hyde bill technically applies only to surrogate motherarrangements in which interstate commerce is involved, but attorneyssaid the courts have given such a broad interpretation to interstatecommerce that the bill effectively would stop almost all commercialsurrogate mother contracts if it becomes law.   Hyde is a leading opponent of abortion and Boxer is a staunchproponent of a woman's right to have an abortion.   Both turned aside questions about their differences on that issueand said just because they generally were at opposite poles on theconservative-liberal spectrum did not mean they did not respect eachother and could not work together.   After Boxer went out of her way to praise Hyde's integrity, Hydesaid he had always thought of her ``as an honest liberal because sheis tolerant of different views.''</TEXT></DOC>
