Followinga rapid bolus injection of the contrast media, the dynamic scan was performed;20 scans were obtained in the first 20 seconds, without any interscandelay. After the selection of the mask image, a series of subtractionimages were obtained and observed on the CRT monitor with the aid ofthe cine-mode display. This procedure enabled us to detect normal andabnormal structures in the scalp, skull, and meninges, such as the diploicveins and emissary veins, which cannot be visualized by conventionalCT. DSC-CTA can be used as an effective diagnostic method for high-flowarteriovenous malformations, disorders involving the meninges, skull,and scalp, and cerebrovascular disorders.</TEXT></DOC>
