This paperdescribes a three-dimensional clustering analysis of approx. 1100 'high-probability'candidates occupying the assigned-redshift band of 1.8-2.4. The analysisis sensitive to very weak clustering - to a level of 7 per cent of thequasars occurring in pairs on scales approx. 5h/sup -1/ Mpc - but noneis found.</TEXT></DOC>
