The Labor Department said that with the 6.7% report, the rate remained at its lowest since it was 6.3% in March 1980, despite a big increase in the labor force. Using a separate measure that counts the military among the employed, the jobless rate was also steady, at 6.6%.    Separately, the Federal Reserve Board said that consumer credit expanded $105 million in December, the smallest increase since the $63 million of December 1981. The small rise may have occurred in part because of effects of the new tax law, which took effect Jan. 1.    Under the new law, interest on home-equity loans is deductible, while the deductibility of consumer interest is being phased out. The Fed said declines in December in revolving credit and miscellaneous credit, which includes cash loans and certain retail transactions, may have reflected substitution of still-deductible home-equity loans for other types of borrowing. Loans secured by real estate aren't covered by the consumer credit report.    Non-farm payroll employment rose a sharp 448,000 last month after increasing a revised 225,000 in December. The December gain was previously reported as 269,000.    The huge January increase may have been distorted by the difficulty of adjusting for seasonal factors at this time of year. Specifically, the department said that post-holiday declines in employment were smaller than usual this year, while construction employment was buoyed by mild weather.    Still, many private economists hailed the report as an indication of solid growth even after accounting for the possible distortions. &quot;I think it's an unmistakable sign of an improving economy,&quot; said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. &quot;The economy is shifting gears to better growth and better balance.&quot;    He noted that January marked the fifth consecutive increase of 225,000 or more for payroll employment. Also, it was the fourth consecutive increase in manufacturing employment, although the latest rise was small -- 3,000 after a rise of 27,000 in December.    In testimony before Congress's Joint Economic Committee, Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the data &quot;show weakness in manufacturing.&quot; But weekly factory hours rose to 40.9, a level Mrs. Norwood called &quot;very high,&quot; from 40.8. Manufacturing overtime hours increased to an average of 3.6 a week from 3.5.    James Cochrane, chief economist at Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. in Houston, called the January payroll gain &quot;a striking number&quot; that indicates considerable strength ahead for the economy. But he suggested that there isn't likely to be a major economic pickup in the current quarter, because demand for goods and services remains weak. Among other factors, he contends, consumers are still recovering from their buying spree of last year's third quarter.    Construction employment rose 142,000 in January after a rise of 4,000 in December. A negative note came from the mining industry, where employment fell 11,000 after a 2,000-job decline. Overall, employment in goods-producing industries rose 134,000 last month after a 29,000-job increase in December.    The strongest gains, as usual, came in the services sector. Retail trade, affected by smaller-than-usual holiday hiring and firing, posted a rise of 166,000 jobs after an increase of just 1,000 in December. Mrs. Norwood said gains were robust in business and health services, and in finance, insurance and real estate.    The average workweek for non-farm workers rose to 34.7 hours from 34.6 in December. Average hourly earnings increased to $8.83 from $8.82. The department's hourly earnings index, which excludes wage changes caused by factory overtime and shift differentials, increased to 170.8% of its 1977 average from 170.6% in December.    The agency's survey of households, which is used in calculating the unemployment rate, showed that civilian employment rose 374,000 after an increase of 205,000 the month before. The labor force increased 448,000 after a drop of 89,000.    The unemployment rate increased sharply last month for teen-agers and blacks and edged up for whites and Hispanics.    David Wyss, senior economist at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass., suggested that the December credit figure may be understated. In addition to the effects of the tax law change on the figures, he said, part of a surge in car loans late in the month may not show up until the January statistics.    The December rise translated to an annual rate of 0.2%. It followed a revised November rise of $3.28 billion, or 6.7% at an annual rate. The November increase was originally reported as $4.02 billion.    At the end of 1986, consumer credit outstanding totaled $603.23 billion, up 11% from $543.22 billion a year earlier. Credit rose 18% in 1985.    The Fed said revolving credit fell $180 million in December after increasing $1.58 billion in November, while miscellaneous credit fell $465 million after expanding $1.13 billion. Auto credit increased $706 million after a $547 million rise. Mobile-home borrowing was up $44 million after a rise of $30 million.    The monthly figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal variation.    Here are excerpts from the Labor Department's employment report.
