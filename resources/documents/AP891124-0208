U.S. pump prices could tumble 5 cents to 6 cents a gallon overthe next three months without restraint by the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, said Allen Sinai, chief economist atthe New York investment firm of Boston Co.   Mari Buglass, an oil analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton inLondon, predicted that retail gasoline prices would be ``likely tostay static or (become) slightly softer for consumers.''   Whether they go up or down hinges in part on the outcome ofnegotiations among members of the 13-nation oil cartel, whichbegins its winter conference on Saturday.   The ministers started preliminary meetings on Thursday of thecommittee that monitors world oil prices, then talked privatelyFriday in their hotel rooms.   ``We are trying to find a solution,'' said Saudia Arabia'sHisham Nazer in early evening. ``We are making progress...There arevarious options being considered.''   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto described the ministers' work asan ``information-seeking and solution-seeking exercise.''   ``There are many things that are being explored right now,'' hesaid.   During their talks, the ministers must work out a new pricingand production accord in line with world demand for OPEC oil,forecasted to slow in the 1990 first quarter.   They also must try to find a way to halt persistent quotacheating by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, each producingabout double their OPEC allotments of 1.1 million barrels a day topress demands for higher shares.   The extra production has raised the cartel's output above 23million barrels a day _ sharply higher than OPEC's ceiling of 20.5million barrels and well above the 21.7 million barrel average 1990world demand forecast by the cartel's own economic experts.   Despite the excess, prices have remained fairly steady due tostrong demand, particularly by developing countries.   The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by OPEC was$17.16 a barrel from January through the third week of October whenit reached $17.76.   OPEC's target price is $18 a barrel. A year ago, the OPEC basketregistered $12.34.   Futures prices for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkAmerican crude which usually averages about $2 more than the OPECbasket, have been in the $20-a-barrel range.   Nevertheless, some cartel members see a need to curtail OPEC'sburgeoning production soon.   Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said lateThursday that the cartel's production ceiling could increase but``definitely not by more than one million'' barrels a day to 21.5million barrels.   Many analysts believe the ministers will bump up the officialproduction ceiling to that level in the first half of 1990,divvying it up proportionately among all members, even though itlikely would not satisfy Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.   Analysts said there was not enough pressure from weak prices toforce the ministers to come up with a novel solution or make toughcompromises in the quota dispute.   ``What does it do to oil prices?'' asked Fergus MacLeod, oilanalyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. ``Not a lot. Theymight fall some (but) very slightly.''   Ginandjar said he wasn't worried about prices. ``I don't see anyreason why prices should collapse.''   Ms. Buglass said, ``If they can be seen to reduce actualproduction, the market will take heart.''   But an inconclusive meeting, she said, could mean price erosion.   A confusing outcome _ along with a sagging U.S. economy _ couldsend oil prices down by about a dollar or two a barrel, Sinai said.   But he added that he doubted the meeting would end on a falsenote.   ``OPEC has managed since November 1988 to control supply and theperception of supply enough to keep prices up,'' he said.   Every dollar change in the price of a barrel of oil amounts toabout a five-cent change in gasoline prices.   U.S. gasoline prices shot up a seasonally adjusted 0.9 percentin October, the biggest gain since a 3.9 percent upward jolt in May.   Gasoline prices have been on a seesaw this year, going up by21.2 percent in the first five months of the year and then fallingby 9.3 percent from June through September.</TEXT></DOC>
