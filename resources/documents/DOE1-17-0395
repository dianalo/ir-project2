In fact, the low barrier to the isomerization usuallydictates that only the ring-opened form can be detected spectroscopicallyfrom monocyclic and bicyclic oxiranes at 77 K. These elusive cyclic cationsshould be accessible, however, in polycyclic oxiranes where steric constraintsprevent C...C opening of the oxirane ring, and here the authors reportthe first ESR characterization of ring-closed oxirane cations with aone-electron C-C bond.</TEXT></DOC>
