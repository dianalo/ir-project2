AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The legislature Thursday nominatedTomas Altamirano Duque, a newspaper publisher and friend of de factoleader Gen. Manuel Noriega, as the administrator of the Panama Canal.   But Panamanian and American sources expressed doubts AltamiranoDuque will get the approval of the U.S. Senate to head the PanamaCanal Commission, which is a U.S. federal agency.   Under treaties signed by the two countries in 1977 turningsovereignty of the waterway over to Panama, a Panamanian citizen isto be the canal administrator as of Jan. 1, 1990. But the candidate,after being nominated by Panama, must have the consent of the U.S.Senate.   ``If they don't like me, they can fire me,'' said AltamiranoDuque told reporters after the legislature voted 42-0, with 13abstentions, to nominate him over four other candidates.   ``I am not anti-American and I am not a Communist. The U.S. has agreat people that believe in democracy, but sometimes its governentgoes down a different path,'' he added. ``The U.S. should have noobjection, but if it opposes it, it will be another violation of thetreaties.''   Altamirano Duque, 55, is a prominent businessman, former Cabinetmember and publisher of La Estrella, Panama's biggest newspaper. Heis also is a longtime legislator for the ruling RevolutionaryDemocratic Party and holds a business administration degree from theUniversity of Florida.   A visa he had to travel to the United States was revoked by theembassy in September, ostensibly because of his friendship withNoriega and other top military officers who hold power.   Another obstacle apparently is that the Bush administration doesnot recognize acting president Manuel Solis Palma's government andinsists ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle is Panama's legitimatepresident.   Noriega was indicted by federal grand juries in Florida on drugsmuggling and money laundering charges in February 1988. A few dayslater, Delvalle fired Noriega as chief of the Defense Forces.   But Noriega, who controlled a majority of congressmen, had thelegislature fire Delvalle instead and named Solis Palma, then theeducation minister, acting president.   Since then, efforts by the U.S. to oust Noriega, includingeconomic sanctions against Panama, have failed to budge him frompower.   The commission, created to administer the canal until the year2000 when Panama takes over the waterway, has an Americanadministrator _ currently Dennis McAuliffe _ and a Panamanian deputyadministrator.   The deputy administrator, Fernando Manfredo, was considered astrong candidate whom the United States would have approved withoutreservations.   But Panamanian government identifies Manfredo too much with U.S.interests, and he received no votes when his name was proposed inthe legislature.</TEXT></DOC>
