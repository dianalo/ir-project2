Separately, regulators also closed banks in Nebraska and California and aided the acquisition of a failing Louisiana thrift.    The failed Baton Rouge bank had assets of about $372 million. Its offices will open today as branches of the newly created Capital Bank andamp; Trust Co., N.A. The Comptroller of the Currency chartered the bank after its predecessor was closed by Fred Dent, Louisiana commissioner of financial institutions. Mr. Dent ruled the state-chartered bank insolvent because of bad energy, real estate and agricultural loans.    Having created the &quot;bridge bank,&quot; the FDIC will be able to keep the institution open under new management until the agency can sell most of its assets and liabilities to another institution, said agency spokesman Steven Katsanos.    In the past, such acquisitions have been hastily arranged. The FDIC believes that additional time will enable buyers to better understand the value of the bank's assets and make higher bids. Mr. Katsanos declined to predict how often bridge bank authority will be used, but said, &quot;we think it is a very valuable tool, particularly when you have a large institution.&quot;    The federally chartered bank will acquire $349 million in loans and other assets of the failed bank as well as $308.7 million in 54,600 deposit accounts and secured liabilities. The FDIC will retain assets with a book value of $23.2 million.    Lawrence Merrigan, former president of Bank of New Orleans, was elected chairman, chief executive officer and president of the new bank.    Also in Louisiana, the former office of First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Natchitoches, La., will open today as a branch of First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association of Lake Charles, La. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board extended $22.1 million in cash and other assistance to facilitate its merger into the Lake Charles thrift. It was the board's first use of $600 million it raised recently by selling bonds to shore up the insurance fund that protects thrift deposits.    The Natchitoches thrift, a federally chartered mutual association with one office, had $52.9 million in assets and $68.6 million in liabilities.    And in Nebraska, American Security Bank, North Platte, was closed by the state director of banking. It reopened its two offices Saturday as branches of North Platte National Bank, also in North Platte. American Security had assets of $24.7 million and held $24 million in 6,300 deposit accounts.    Meanwhile, the sole office of Delta Pacific Bank, Pittsburg, Calif., will reopen today as a branch of Central Bank, San Francisco. Delta Pacific, which was closed Friday by California banking authorities, had assets of about $18.2 million. Central Bank will assume deposits of $17.6 million in 3,200 accounts and will purchase $15.7 million of the failed bank's assets at a discount of $1.5 million.    This year, 156 banks have failed nationwide. </TEXT></DOC>
