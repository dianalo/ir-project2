(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Xerox Goes Wild Xerox, which has been struggling to reconcile its leadingtechnology with its lagging marketing, has recently gone on a productrampage.andP;  It has announced the third generation of its Xerox network desktopenvironment (GlobalView) as well as new hardware that allows standardplatforms to have full access to the Xerox distributed computing environmentfor the first time.andP;  It has begun to deliver new group-oriented applicationsbuilt on top of GlobalView.andP;  And it has unleashed a new family ofnetwork-aware reprographic engines that redefine many aspects of publishing(DocuTech).andM;GLOBALVIEW.andP;  GlobalView, the successor to ViewPoint, extends the desktopmetaphor across the network to deliver consistent access to all informationand network resources.andP;  One primary difference between the GlobalViewapproach and the ViewPoint approach is GlobalView's embrace ofindustry-standard platforms.andP;  Yes, Xerox's Pilot and Mesa represented someterrific engineering and did amazing things with relatively small amounts ofmemory.andP;  However, the market clearly demanded the need for supportingstandard platforms, and Xerox is beginning to respond.andM;GLOBALVIEW ARCHITECTURE.andP;  The GlobalView architecture consists of five layers(see Illustration 1):andM;* Operating Environment, which includes SPARC/Unix, Intel DOS and OS/2, andXerox workstationsandM;* Network Service Layer, which is the critical enabler for GlobalView.andP;  Xeroxcurrently supports XNS, with gateways to SNA, TCP/IP, OSI, and DECnet.andO;&quot;Currently&quot; is a critical word.andP;  A few months back in Network Monitor (Vol.andO;5, No.andP;  5), we featured Xerox's XNS, ViewPoint, and Panos (StructuredViewPoint) as exemplary models of a distributed computing environment andaccompanying applications.andP;  As we mentioned in the Panos report, Xerox's XNSno longer offers a competitive advantage.andP;  There are now to &quot;open&quot; platformsfor advanced distributed computing of the type delivered by Xerox: the OpenSoftware Foundation Distributed Computed Environment (OSF DCE) and Sun's OpenNetwork Computing (ONC).andP;  It would make a great deal of sense for Xerox toexamine how it could begin to migrate to these standard foundations -- when,for example, it could swap out the Courier RPC in favor of, say, the NCS RPC.andM;* GlobalView Layer, which includes the desktop and the interface to thenetwork resources: filing, mailing, printing, terminal emulation, and so on.andM;* Standard Application User Interface Layer, which specifies the behavior andappearance of the environment.andM;* Application Elements Layer, which is where the software tools reside.andO;Xerox has defined three categories within this layer: general purpose,enhanced graphics and specialized applications, and advanced/distributedprocessing solutions.andP;  This layer also supports the use of &quot;agents.&quot;andP;  (Xeroxhas finally adopted the increasingly common term &quot;agents&quot; rather thanretaining CUSP, its older user-programming solution.)andM;Applications.andP;  Xerox is bundling all its general purpose businessproductivity applications into what it calls the ViewPak (VP) software.andP;  VPconsists of modules familiar to ViewPoint users:andM;* The compound document editorandM;* Programs for generating graphics, forms, and equationsandM;* E-mailandM;* Iconic representation of printers and serversandM;* Terminal emulatorsandM;* Agents for customer programming and task automationandM;* Support for DOS in a windowandM;* Utilities for document and data conversionandM;* HypertextandM;* Shared books for team collaborationandM;Xerox is basically maintaining the same set of enhanced graphics andspecialty applications that it had with ViewPoint: Xerox PublishingIllustrator, Xerox Pro Illustrator, Xerox Chemical Illustrator, and anEquations editor.andP;  It has added an X Environment window for runningthird-party applications on Unix platforms, and it offers a DocumentInterface Library.andP;  The library facilitates the development of C programs fordata and document interchange on Unix platforms.andM;The advanced network applications Xerox has begun producing recently arekeeping right up with the new environment: Document Search and Retrieval(DSR) and Docu Team (formerly Panos).andP;  (For a more complete review ofDocuTeam's functions, see our review of Panos, Network Monitor, Vol.andP;  5, No.andO;5.)andP;  DocuTran highlights Xerox's capabilities in machine translation.andO;(Additionally, the extended applications support double-byte language sets,such as Japanese and Chinese, along with Arabic and Hebrew.andM;Hardware.andP;  The 6520 workstation is the result of the previously announcedtechnology alliance between Sun and Xerox.andP;  The SPARC workstation runs at15.8 MIPS, comes with 8MB of main memory (expandable to 48MB), 200MB internalstorage, a 3.5 1.44MB floppy, and it includes SunOS.andM;The environment here supports NFS and TCP/IP as well as XNS.andP;  Prices for the6520 start at $9,995.andM;GlobalView-for-the-PC is a hardware/software solution for bringing PCs fullyinto the Global View environment.andP;  The package consists of a coprocessorboard with 4MB of extra RAM, a 19-inch display, and the GlovalView software.andO;Xerox estimates that more than 96 percent of the current base of 80286 and80386 PCs can utilize this solution.andP;  Users can hot-key among the GlobalView,DOS, and OS/2 environments.andP;  The GlobalView-for-the-PC package starts at$3,995.andM;Comments.andP;  GlobalView is a very positive step for Xerox.andP;  The company now hasa means of capitalizing on the popular hardware platforms in the market, aswell as catching a ride on the Unix wave with Sun.andM;True, coprocessing boards haven't been the most popular solutions fordelivering advanced software functionality.andP;  NBI didn't do too well with itsome years back.andP;  We believe that GlobalView-for-the-PC will be most popularwith existing customers who would like to expand their Xerox networks by&quot;retreading&quot; existing PCs.andP;  For new purchasers, that SPARC-based 6520 isgoing to be hard to ignore.andM;But, best of all from the industry point of view, the GlobalView applicationsand services are going to have even more opportunity to influence otherdevelopers.andP;  We're starting to see some very creative network applicationsemerge, such as Lotus Notes and the new InfoAlliance from Software PublishingCorporation (SPC).andP;  Combine with that the exploitation of workstationplatforms by products such as the new Lotus Improv on the NeXT machine, thenstir in the power of Xerox's network services and applications as a furthercatalyst, and we could have something extremely exciting brewing.andM;XEROX DOCUBUILD.andP;  DocuBuild, the new GlobalView application, providesfeatures for the collective creation of, contribution to, and management ofcomplex, multiauthor documents such as product manuals, technical proposals,and scientific reports.andM;DocuBuild is a WYSIWYG SGML document processor that offers:andM;* Document control and trackingandM;* Control of advanced printer functionsandM;* Automatic user-defined routinesandM;* Document-independent style sheetsandM;Xerox's new DocuTech electronic document publishing product delivers acombination of scanning, filing, printing, and finishing.andP;  Although theinitial release o the product was in a standalone configuration, Xerox willbe introducing networked versions of DocuTech in 1991, as well as downscaledimplementations of the DocuTech technology for workgroup networks.andP;  Thecurrent DocuTech system is just a forerunner of an entire product family.andM;The DocuTech Production Publisher is a multifunctional device that provideshigh-speed, high-resolution digital image capture (23 pages perminute--ppm--at 600 dots per inch--dpi), advanced document manipulationcapabilities and support for high-quality images.andP;  It prints up to 135 600dpi copies per minute with in-line collating, stitching, binding, andstacking capabilities.andP;  The internal hardware is impressive: an aggregate 120MIPS with 1GB of storage for the various process components.andP;  The printer canuse 11-by-17-inch paper to print signatures--four letter-sized pages on thesheet that then folds to become part of a booklet.andP;  Xerox makes fantastic useof the system's intelligence in this operation: The printer determines whichpages should be printed on which sheets to ensure that the page-numbering ofthe publication comes out right.andM;Watching this device at work is like watching one of the early Jetsonscartoons.andP;  The operator &quot;presses&quot; a button on the 19-inch gray-scale monitorthat serves as the device's interface.andP;  A few minutes later, at the other endof the device, a panel opens, and a palette arm holding a stack of boundvolumes quietly slides out.andP;  No matter how familiar you are with thetechnology, it still is amazing to watch (perhaps even more amazing if youknow what constitutes the current process).andP;  This enterprise-class device hasthe potential of eliminating a great deal of offset printing work.andP;  The costsavings (both in material and in time) are quite substantial.andM;As intriguing as this base capability might be, of more interest to us is theNetwork Publisher.andP;  This ties the DocuTech publisher into networks.andP;  Not justXNS networks, either.andP;  Xerox is working with a variety of important partners,from Digital Equipment and Sun to Novell, to deliver the needed integration.andM;This integration will not just give the DocuTech operator access to thenetwork; it also gives network users access to DocuTech.andP;  Xerox will offersoftware &quot;job tickets&quot; that will pop up within an application--such asPageMaker--to allow users to specify a numbering of printing or finishingoptions.andM;DocuTech allows the operator to make changes in the document electronically,so Xerox is rightly concerned with two-way document traffic: not onlydocuments in to the publisher, but also electronic documents back out.andP;  Xeroxis looking at providing electronic mail and document transfer support, aswell as a variety of filtering options.andP;  Such capabilities will trulyredefine the nature of document production in a network environment.andM;Xerox is not being shy about gathering partners for this effort, either.andM;Partners.andP;  Xerox is actively entering into hardware and software partnershiparrangements to create support for the DocuTech products.andP;  Xerox is makingsure that it delivers, and that everyone knows that it is delivering, an openarchitecture with this product.andP;  The lessons of XNS and ViewPoint are sinkinginandM;Partnership arrangements include:andM;* Adobe for PostScript compatibility (Xerox is offering a PostScript level 2interpreter as an option.)andM;* Novell, for NetWare support (Xerox will be delivering an NLM for NetWare386.)andM;* ATandamp;T, for developing links between the DocuTech family and ATandamp;T's StarGroupLAN Manager, with access to Rhapsody and other hardware and software systemsandM;* Digital, to develop integration of DECnet/OSI, Network Application Support(NAS), and the DocuTech familyandM;* Aldus, Interleaf, Intergraph, WordPerfect, Intran, Elixir, and Xerox's ownVentura to integrate with those software packagesandM;* Bourg, for expanding the in-line finishing capabilities of the DocuTechpublisherandM;With products such as this, Xerox is making good on its assertion that it isthe document company.andP;  However, as neat as the present DocuTech system is forhigh-volume production, the true potential of the series will not be realizeduntil the network connections are delivered and until there are lower-endsolutions for workgroups.andM;COMMENTS.andP;  Outstanding technology is no guarantee of success.andP;  Manyinnovative vendors who subsequently failed have proved that.andP;  Xerox for yearshas functioned as a hothouse for ideas and talent for the rest of theindustry.andP;  While people have passed through its corridors and thenpurposefully moved on to other ventures, Xerox itself seems to have keptwandering along, pursuing its technological ideals.andM;Somebody finally woke up.andP;  Xerox is bringing its products into alignment withthe industry-wide demand for standards.andP;  And it has firmly seized a marketposition for itself: the document company.andP;  True, it has tried that before.andO;But now, Xerox is backing its assertion up with a set of advanced hardwareand software capability that other vendors initially will have a hard timematching.andM;In our view, Xerox could do a lot more.andP;  It could accommodate the OSFtechnology (Motif, DCE, and DME) as well as that of Sun, thereby bringingitself into even better striking range for the commercial desktop andworkgroup network.andP;  But what it currently has is a terrific start on itsmarket rehabilitation.andP;  For someone concerned with an advanced, distributedpublishing solution, Xerox is definitely work a look.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
