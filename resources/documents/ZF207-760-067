 We were given a set of forms and instructed to fill them out aspart of our design.andM;The task was quite time-consuming, and of little evident practicality.andP;  Therewas no rationale for doing it, other than that They Who Must Be Obeyed seemedto feel that it would help our productivity, and the quality of our work.andM;In fact, the forms we filled out, and the time spent trying to structure ourwork did little to help either of these goals.andP;  The notebooks of forms wecreated gathered dust on shelves, and the company abandoned the methodology.andM;Fifteen years later, in the 1980s, as a consultant to They Who Must BeObeyed, I frequently see the same scenario repeated, with a minor change.andO;Instead of laboriously filling in all the forms and drawing the diagrams byhand, computers are used to speed the creation of notebooks that are filled,filed and never used again.andM;Computer-aided Software Engineering (Case) has grown out of this effort toautomate the system design methodologies of the '70s.andM;Database management systems, which preceded Case tools in the marketplace,are used to store much of the data referred to or manipulated by the programswritten with Case tools.andM;Most organizations that would use Case tools also use DBMSs.andP;  The utility ofa Case product that does not work closely with the DBMS is restricted.andP;  Yetuntil recently, Case tools have had a limited degree of integration with DBMSproducts.andM;This is changing.andP;  Today, most products in the Case world are addressing thelimitation.andP;  The scene painted at the beginning of this article is beginningto disappear as products start working closely with database managementsystems, and as new products helpe bridge the gap between process-orientedCase tools and database design.andM;It is no longer left as an exercise for the user to figure out how to go fromthe Case systems design to the implementation.andP;  The integration with thedatabase supplies a vital element in the step to implementation.andM;Case is not a single class of applications; rather it is a collection ofsoftware technologies designed to improve both the productivity and accuracyof the software creation process by automating various methods in each stepof the software life cycle.andP;  It includes software for:andM;* Planning applicationsandM;* designing systemsandM;* Designing databasesandM;* using application languages (4GLs)andM;* generating applications.andM;Products in the first two categories are sometimes lumped together as &quot;uppercase,&quot; and in the other categories as &quot;lower case.&quot;andP;  Products tend to overlapthese categories and groupings.andM;The design tools are intended to automate a particular design methodology.andO;Most methods start with gathering the information to draw a data flowdiagram; each method's diagram style is unique.andP;  Many design tools will drawdiagrams for more than one methodology.andM;Most of the tools include a repository of system information.andP;  Thisrepository is itself a database about the database and the application.andM;An important issue for larger projects is how this repository is to be sharedamong the project members.andP;  Both IBM and DEC are moving to having their ownsystem repositories.andP;  These repositories are likely to be built on their ownproprietary relational DBMSs: DB2 for IBM on MVS and Rdb for DEC on VAXs.andM;DEC's Common Data Dictionary/Plus (CDD/Plus) already has many of thecharacteristics of a repository in that it stores data definitions and theirrelationships to applications.andP;  As these become available, they willundoubtedly influence the direction of Case tools.andM;Case tools are moving toward cooperative processing.andP;  Most tools run on PCsto take advantage of their superior graphics and display capabilities.andP;  Butthe need to coordinate a development team requires networking, and a degreeof distributed database that is not available in the marketplace today.andM;The need to use the mainframe's repository will eventually lead to anevolution of host- and workstation-based design tools.andM;Most Case tools still consider the database design and specification aspectsas an afterthought.andP;  Although this improves on past practice, they still needto reflect on the iterative cycle of system design and database design.andP;  Thatis, the procedures of an application require the specification of a databasedesign.andP;  As that design evolves, the procedures will require modification.andM;The design process always uncovers more things to be done, as well as hiddenassumptions that will also modify the procedures and, hence, the databasedesign.andP;  But there is a problem with this process.andP;  Frequently there is noclear-cut stopping point at which the design team can say, &quot;Our work isfinished.&quot;andM;A good Case tool with integration of both database design and processspecification helps the development process by shortening the time for eachiteration and letting the project team explore alternative solutions.andP;  Thefinished software is more likely to be robust and easier to maintain.andM;A few products that address the need for tighter integration between thedatabase and Case tools are available.andM;A relatively new tools is the database design tool.andP;  This tool goes beyondthe data structure diagrammers, which assume that if you can draw a diagramthe hard part of database design is done.andP;  Rather, the new tools help in theaccurate, logical and physical design of a database by bringing in specific,detailed knowledge of the design process.andM;The Bachman/Re-engineering Product Set, from Bachman Information Systems inCambridge, Mass., is one of the best examples in this category.andP;  CharlesBachman, founder of the company, developed the first network DBMS that laterbecame the basis for the Codasyl model and Cullinet's IDMS.andM;The Bachman/Re-engineering Product Set allows the user to capture existingdata definitions from Cobol with Vsam or sequential files, IDMS, IMS or DB2programs.andM;A capture module brings the existing data definition from a program into thedesign database.andP;  The Bachman/Data Analyst generates a data structure diagrambased on Bachman's Partnership Data Model (a partnership is a relationshipbetween two entities) from the captured definition and displays it on a19-inch high-resolution monitor.andP;  This saves a significant amount of time.andM;The design can be edited and modified using graphical and text editors toincorporate new tables, relationships or other elements of the database.andM;Of particular importance is the incorporation of an expert design advisor.andO;This part of the tool identifies inconsistencies in the data structure andsuggests remedies.andM;This modified design is then &quot;forward engineered&quot; to generate the newdatabase definition for the target DBMS using the Bachman/DatabaseAdministrator for IDMS or DB2.andP;  The tool also incorporates an expert advisorto help with the physical design.andM;The Bachman/Re-engineering Product Set can also be used for new designs.andP;  Itsimplifies the specification of a first cut data structure and helps move thefinal design with its modeling tools and design advice.andM;The Bachman/Re-engineering Product Set was originally intended to help IDMSusers maintain and enhance their existing applications.andP;  With version 2.1,Bachman is focusing on DB2, and is working with IBM to help people convert toDB2 from other databases.andM;Using its knowledge of how DB2 processes database accesses (the queryoptimizer).andP;  Bachman/Data Analyst will, for example, suggest what indexes tobuild or how to allocate data to physical files.andM;GTE Directories Inc., Dallas, is a user of the Bachman/Re-engineering ProductSet.andP;  It is a billion dollar company in the marketing and publishing areas,with over 6,000 employees and 34 sales divisions.andP;  It has stringent databaserequirements, and a constant need to modify applications.andP;  It has an IDMSdatabase with over 300 record types and executes 500,000 transactions perday.andM;According to Glenn Whittington, data administration manager, the Bachman Casetools have saved time and improved accuracy.andP;  The company uses theRe-engineering Tool Set to modify and control IDMS applications.andM;Originally it took over one week to redraw the data structure diagram for oneof the larger databases, after accumulated changes had rendered it obsolete.andM;GTE Directories first generated a current data structure diagram using theDatabase Administrator for IDMS in about 30 minutes.andP;  Whittington points outthat not only was the time savings significant, having an accurate diagramwas of inestimable value.andM;Another problem stemmed from different application groups that worked onmodifying the same database.andP;  Ensuring the changes were consistent and insynchronization was time-consuming and difficult.andP;  With the use of theBachman Case tools, less time was required and accuracy improved, he said.andM;In helping to design or re-engineer the database, most Case tools use thedata definition in a program or in a data dictionary.andM;But what if there are errors in that design?andP;  Frequently looking at the dataitself can suggest alterations to the data design.andP;  for even modest-sizeddatabases, this task is extremely large, with many opportunities to miss akey relationship.andM;DB Software, Palo Alto, Calif., is building a Case tool that analyzes theactual data and constructs a third normal-form database design.andP;  Founder DinaBitton based the product on research he conducted at the University ofIllinois.andM;The tool allows the database administrator to capture the functionaldependencies in the data, as well as specify dependencies that may not be inthe rows of the database.andM;(A functional dependency is a column in a table whose value is uniquelydetermined by one or more other columns in the table.andP;  For example, anemployees' name is uniquely determined by an employee identification number.andO;This is a new dimension to the automation of the system development process.)andM;Case tools such as the Bachman/Re-engineering Product Set and the DB Softwaredata normalization product supplement process-centered tools such as thosefrom Index Technology, Inc., Cambridge, Mass., or KnowledgeWare, Atlanta.andO;They bring the design into more intimate and accurate contact with the actualdata and physical design of the database, making it immediately useful.andP;  Theprocess-centered tools simply treat the database design as an adjunct.andM;Index Tech's Excelerator, based on a central dictionary of information aboutthe application (called the XLDictionary), generates data flow diagrams and atype of data structure diagram called an entity-relationship diagram.andP;  Someanalysis tools help the user assess the data structure, including reports onredundant data, and reports that identify possible normalization problems.andO;(Normalized records contain information about one thing only.andP;  Normalizationreduces problems caused by data redundancy.)andM;Until recently, this system design had to be manually implemented in thedatabase and language of choice.andP;  Late last year, Index Technology releasedinterfaces to DB2, and to VAX CDD/Plus.andM;The DB2 interface will automatically generate the SQL data definition for thedatabase designed in Excelerator.andP;  The link to DB2 also includes extensionsto the XLDictionary where information specific to the DB2 data structure canbe placed, including information about tables, columns, indexes, views,tablespaces, storage group and databases.andP;  This data can be used toautomatically calculate physical database requirements such as track andcylinder space.andM;The link with CDD/Plus allows the capture of design data from existingapplications into XLDictionary.andP;  The ability to view and manipulate theExcelerator and CDD/Plus data simultaneously eases synchronization of the twodefinitions.andM;Oracle Corp., Belmont, Calif., has also moved into the Case field.andP;  Thecenterpiece, a repository called the Case* Dictionary, contains all of theinformation about the application.andP;  This dictionary is built with Oracle'sown relational DBMS.andM;The Case* Designer is a set of graphical interfaces for drawing a datastructure diagram and specifying the contents of the database.andM;The relationships between functions and database entities can be specified,and cross-references among dictionary items (such as functions and entitiesor modules and tables) displayed in a matrix format.andM;The Case* Designer will generate the SQL to define the database.andP;  A newcapability, the Case* Generator, allows the entry of additional informationto generate data entry screens for the database using Oracle's applicationdevelopment facility, SQL* Forms.andM;Cullinet Software Inc., Westwood, Mass., is moving into the Case tools arenawith the Enterprise:Engineering Tools.andP;  The Builder is a tool for specifyingthe database definition, forms, reports and application specifications in arepository.andM;The application is written in the Program Specification Requirements language(PSR).andP;  PSR can be automatically generated using the forms tools that arepart of the product.andP;  When PSR is processed it produces ADS/O, Cullinet'sprocedural application development language for IDMS, or Cobol, with embeddedSQL for Enterprise:DB.andM;Cullinet intends to let PSR generate code in other languages for other DBMSs,including DB2.andM;When generating standard 3GL code users get the productivity of a generatorwhile still taking advantage of the DBMS vendor's precompiler and debuggingaids.andP;  Furthermore, it is easier to track changes in the target DBMS thisway.andM;Cortex, Inc., Waltham, Mass., takes another route to the goal of applicationgeneration.andP;  Its CorVision product interfaces with Digital Equipment's RMSfiles or Rdb relational database.andP;  It allows a user to specify the databasedesign, menus, screens and reports in a high-level visual interface, anddirectly generates compiled machine code.andM;KnowledgeWare has tried to span the gamut of Case tasks with its InformationEngineering Workbench.andP;  It offers software for systems planning, analysis anddesign that is tied into its mainframe repository, the Encyclopedia.andM;The next step for the KnowledgeWare user is to generate the application inCobol.andP;  Target DBMSs that can be specified to include DB2, IMS and IDMS.andO;Both the data definition and data manipulation routines are generated.andM;In the future, the process-oriented tools are going to add more databaseexpertise; data-centered tools will be adding more process-oriented designfunctionality; and the application generators will be adding more systems anddatabase design components.andP;  The result for users is Case tools that offerfar more productivity.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
