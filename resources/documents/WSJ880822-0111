Inside the thatched workshop, captured Soviet-made AK-47 rifles are repaired; out back, a couple of damaged rocket launchers are retooled and readied for a return to the front.    The other combatants in the 13-year-old Angolan civil war -- Cuba, South Africa and the forces of the Angolan government, known as the MPLA -- may have agreed to a cease-fire. But there isn't any letup at Jamba, Unita's headquarters deep in the Angolan bush.    &quot;It isn't our cease-fire,&quot; says Eliseu Jornal, the deputy director of the weapons workshop. &quot;We will continue to fight until the Angolan government decides to negotiate with Unita.&quot;    The Unita guerrilla movement, which is supported by the U.S. and South Africa, is the wild card in the negotiations to end the fighting in southwest Africa. For the past several months, the U.S. has been mediating talks aimed at getting South African and Cuban troops out of Angola and at bringing independence to Namibia, the Pretoria-administered territory south of Angola. Two weeks ago, a cease-fire went into effect as South Africa began withdrawing its several thousand soldiers from Angola. And when the negotiations resume Wednesday in Brazzaville, Congo, the Cubans are expected to propose a timetable for withdrawing their 50,000 troops.    But Unita, which claims to control a third of Angola, hasn't been included in the talks. Until it is, the soldiers here say, there can't be peace in Angola.    &quot;The source of the conflict in Angola is between Unita and the MPLA,&quot; guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi said in an interview here last week. &quot;Even if they get an agreement with South Africa and the Cubans, and no agreement between Unita and the MPLA, there will be no cease-fire.&quot;    Thus, Unita is intensifying its war preparations, hoping to fight its way to the negotiating table. As long as they keep fighting, the guerrillas reckon, the Cubans won't leave Angola; and if the Cubans don't leave Angola, the South Africans won't relinquish Namibia.    To emphasize their stand, Unita attacked an MPLA supply base in southern Angola just 14 hours after the start of the Cuba-South Africa cease-fire. The guerrillas claim they killed 35 Angolans and 15 Cubans. Two days later, it blew up fuel and ammunition dumps in the central region.    Unita has been present in Angola since 1966, when Mr. Savimbi assembled a band of guerrillas to fight the Portuguese colonial rulers. When independence from Portugal was won in 1975, Unita was included in a transitional government with the Marxist-oriented MPLA, a rival liberation group. But when the MPLA was bolstered by Cuban and Soviet support, Unita returned to the bush. South African troops joined the fight against the Cubans, and the U.S. chipped in military and financial support.    Unita's retreat ended at Jamba in 1979, and since then it has built up a civilian and military infrastructure in the southeastern third of the country that it controls. The mud and grass structures may convey the image of a temporary presence, but Unita has settled in for the long haul. The guerrillas have a network of hospitals and schools, their own sawmill and furniture factory, even a ministry of natural resources that prospects for diamonds and exports ivory carvings.    At the military headquarters here, beyond the range of Cuban and Angolan jets, the main battle is one of public relations. Mimeographed photos of Mr. Savimbi meeting at the White House with President Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz are everywhere. The top brass, many of whom were educated in Europe and are fluent in foreign languages, entertain visitors from around the world, promoting their goal of national reconciliation over a shot of imported whiskey or a glass of South African beer. The officers wear well-cut fatigues, many sport fancy watches and designer sunglasses. Expensive radios are never far, for this is how the guerrillas follow the peace talks.    A British Broadcasting Corp. report that South African troops in Namibia have been seen moving toward the Angolan border instead of away from it brings howls of derision from a group of officers. Later, an analysis from Washington that peace is breaking out in southern Africa is greeted by a chorus of skepticism. &quot;Not here it isn't,&quot; says one officer.    And so the business of war continues. Over at the General Office of Uniforms, 120 Singer sewing machines are running at double-time. Capt. Trinita Lucas, the head tailor, explains that production is being increased to 1,000 uniforms a day from 800. Each soldier, he figures, goes through one uniform per battle.    &quot;We cannot stop making, because our troops need uniforms,&quot; he says. &quot;We make, we make, we make.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
