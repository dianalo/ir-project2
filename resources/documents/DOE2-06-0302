Films as thinas 0.6 {mu}m in thickness was found to exhibit excellent superconductingtransition behavior. For films up to 2 {mu}m in thickness, typical valuesof T/sub c/ onset, T/sub c/ zero and transition width (90%--10%) weremeasured to be 82, 76, and 1.5 K, respectively. Both plan-view and cross-sectionaltransmission electron microscopy revealed that the orientation relationshipsbetween the epitaxial films and the substrate are [001]YBCO//[001]MgOand (110)YBCO//(200)MgO. Twins, which may be perceived as domains thatare rotated 90{sup 0} along the c axis of the thin films with respectto the substrate, were found to be copiously present. The influencesof the configuration of the oriented growth of overlayer thin films onthe superconducting properties are addressed. The advantages of the chemicalspray pyrolysis in producing superconducting thin films are outlined.</TEXT></DOC>
