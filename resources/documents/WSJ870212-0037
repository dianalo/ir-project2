IEOC Co., a Panamanian company with energy holdings in Egypt, paid Denison $90 million last month. Denison said IEOC will pay the balance later this year, and also will get some of Denison's share of oil produced at the two properties. Denison, a large oil, gas, coal and uranium producer, said it will use proceeds for investment in its resource sector and debt reduction.    Denison retains a 35% interest in Meleiha, which began production in 1986, a 45% interest in West Razzak, which is still being explored, and a 17.5% stake in the pipeline. </TEXT></DOC>
