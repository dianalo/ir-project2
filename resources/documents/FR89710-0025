Specific subjects on which public discussion is planned includewhether changes to the TCAS II installation schedule are desirable; whethera new schedule should include a time-phased equipage requirement and, ifso, what fraction of the fleet should be equipped with TCAS II by whichdates; whether the Government should include an operational evaluationphase in the TCAS II schedule and, if so, who should participate; whetherthe airbone windshear warning and escape path flight guidance equipagerequirements should be modified as requested in a petition from the AirTransport Association; and whether the equipage schedule for airborne windshearwarning and escape path flight guidance equipage schedule should be modifiedto be compatible with that adopted for TCAS II equipage. The Federal AviationAdministration (FAA) recognizes that provisions of the Airport and AirwaySafety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1987 governing the TCAS II equipageschedule differ from some of the changes to be discussed at this meeting,but anticipates the possibility of statutory changes in the near futurethat may provide authority for some or all of the changes listed. In theevent that those statutory changes are enacted into law, it is essentialthat regulatory action proceed immediately. The objective of this meetingis to provide all interested parties an opportunity to comment on theseissues so that, when and if the statutory changes become law, the Agencycan promptly move to issue a final rule based in part upon the informationreceived at this meeting. The FAA will consider all comments prior to takingsuch action.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>The public meeting will be held on August 16, and August17, 1989, if necessary, from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Comments must be receivedon or before August 23, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>The public meeting will be held in the 3rd floor auditorium,FAA, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591.Comments on the subjects in this notice should be submitted, in triplicate,to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Chief Counsel, Attention:Rules Docket [AGG-10], Docket No. 25954, 800 Independence Avenue, SW.,Washington, DC 20591.

Prior to the publication of the finalrule and in response to numerous questions on the implementation scheduleof TCAS, the Subcommittee on Aviation of the Senate Committee on Commerce,Science and Transportation requested the Office of Technology Assessment(OTA) to assess whether the FAA, manufacturers, and airlines have the capabilityto comply with the TCAS II schedule enacted by Congress and to identifyany other important issues raised by the final rule. In addition to interviewsand visits to the FAA, manufacturers, and airlines, OTA invited representativesfrom airframe and avionic manufacturers, airline labor unions, repiar andalteration stations, FAA, and NASA to a 1-day workshop, January 12, 1989,to assist OTA in evaluating the information that had been provided by theaviation community, as well as to obtain a variety of perspectives on TCAS.Subsequently, OTA issued a special report, in February 1989, entitled ``SaferSkies With TCAS.''The House Subcommittee on Aviation held a hearing May 4, 1989, on CollisionAvoidance System Equipment and Compliance Deadlines. The hearing coveredissues involving the legislatively mandated installation of TCAS II.Testimony at this hearing, and the OTA report, suggested that airlinescould experience implementation difficulties that would make it desirableto revise the current schedule. Further, a fairly large-scale operationalevaluation program was recommended by OTA and a number of witnesses, toensure that a large number of TCAS units can be installed and operatedas designed in the air traffic environment.Based on the OTA report, and testimony presented at the May 4, 1989, hearing,the FAA seeks public comment on the following modified TCAS II schedule,which will be considered in the event Congress modifies the statutory mandate:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,xs72,r25</C> <H1>Date</H1><H1>Required equipage</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">December 30, 1990<D>20% of all civil aircraft with more than 30 passenger seats operatedby airlines who operate more than 30 or more such aircraft under the provisionsof 14 CFR Parts 121 and 129.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">December 30, 1991<D>50% of all civil aircraft with more than 30 passenger seats operatedby airlines who operate under the provisions of 14 CFR Parts 121 and 129.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">December 30, 1993<D>100% of all civil aircraft with more than 30 passenger seats operatingin the United States.</D></ITAG></ITAG>The FAA also seeks public comment on the need to conduct an operationaltest and evaluation program during 1990, during which approximately 6 monthsof in-use data would be collected to ensure practicability of the productionof TCAS II systems and to assess their impact, in large numbers, on thesafe and efficient operation of the air traffic control system, as recommendedby the OTA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Windshear Discussion</ITAG>An extended compliance date for TCAS II would, in terms of efficiency andcost effectiveness, be incompatible with the current installation schedulefor airborne windshear warning and escape flight path guidance equipment,in that some carriers would have to take aircraft out of service for twocycles of retrofit. In addition, the FAA has received a petition from theAir Transport Association (Docket No. 25924) requesting that an extendedcompliance schedule for installing windshear warning and flight guidancesystems be based on fleet compliance rather than the currently mandatedphased schedule. The ATA also requests that the FAA remove the requirementthat certain older aircraft be retrofitted with flight guidance systems.If the TCAS II schedule is revised, the FAA solicits comments at this publicmeeting on whether the windshear-equipment retrofit schedule should alsobe revised to make it compatible with the TCAS II schedule, and whetherescape path flight guidance requirements should be modified as requestedby the petitioner.<ITAG tagnum="84">Need for This Meeting</ITAG>The present requirements of the Federal Aviation Regulations call for completionof the TCAS II installations by December 30, 1991, and the airborne windshearwarning and escape path flight guidance equipment installations by January2, 1991, unless extensions are granted extending the compliance date toJanuary 4, 1993. Testimony of a number of witnesses at the May 4, 1989,hearing of the Aviation Subcommittee, as well as the independent evaluationby the OTA, suggest that uniform attainment of the TCAS II schedule aspresently required may not be feasible. Since time is becoming criticallyshort to permit reasonable scheduling of the TCAS II retrofit installations,it would be necessary for the FAA to move as quickly as possible followingenactment of any legislation that amends the compliance dates to establisha new retrofit schedule so that TCAS II equipment could receive the widestpossible usage in the shortest period of time consistent with a prudentoperational phase-in of this new equipment. In doing so, the Agency seeksto consider other issues that, if they are to be addressed, must be consideredwith any modifications to the TCAS II schedule. These issues include thosediscussed above concerning the appropriate phase-in of the TCAS II installationschedule, establishment of the operational evaluation program, and modificationsto the windshear equipment requirements and installation schedule. Thepurpose of this meeting is to provide for the widest possible public commenton these complex issues in a short period of time.<ITAG tagnum="84">Meeting Procedures</ITAG>The meeting will be informal in nature and will be conducted by representativesof the FAA. Representatives from the FAA will present a formal briefingon options for changes in the schedule, depending on the outcome of proposedlegislation. All other participants will be given an opportunity to makea presentation.The meeting will be open to all persons on a space-available basis. Therewill be no admission fee or charge to attend.Any person wishing to make a presentation to the FAA will be asked to signin and estimate the amount of time needed for such presentation; this willpermit allocation of an appropriate amount of time for each presenter.The FAA may allocate the time available for each presentation in orderto accommodate all speakers. The FAA will make every effort to see thateveryone on the list has an opportunity to address the panel. The meetingmay be adjourned at any time if all persons present have had the opportunityto speak.Any person who wishes to present a position paper at the meeting to theFAA pertinent to the topics, TCAS rule extension, phased-in implementationschedule, operational flight evaluation program, and windshear equipmentinstallation schedule, may either submit all written comments prior tothe meeting by mailing such comments to the address listed above or bypresenting the papers at the meeting.The meeting will be recorded to ensure that each respondent's commentsare noted accurately.
