The reports suggest that manufacturing is recovering after being battered by foreign competition in the past several years while home building, which had been strong for about two years, appears to be faltering in response to the recent rise in mortgage rates.    The increase in production by the nation's factories, mines and utilities was widespread among materials and products, the Federal Reserve Board said. The report was accompanied by upward revisions to show a 0.1% decline in April, rather than the 0.4% decline originally reported, and an unchanged figure in March, rather than a 0.2% decline.    The decline in May housing starts was the third in as many months. The Commerce Department said work was begun on new homes last month at an annual rate of 1,620,000 units, following a revised drop of 3.8% in April to an annual rate of 1,665,000. The department previously reported the April decline at 2.9%.    Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, in a statement, said: &quot;Home building activity will remain sluggish until interest rates return to lower levels.&quot;    The industrial production figures are being aided by strong export growth, said Lyle Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. &quot;The significant revisions will us give a stronger pace going into the third quarter,&quot; he said.    Priscilla Luce Trumbull, director of the industrial analysis group at Wharton Econometrics in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said industrial production &quot;was falling out of step with the other manufacturing indicators and it caught up.&quot; She said the outlook is still for &quot;slow movement upward.&quot;    Output of consumer goods increased 0.6% in May following a 0.8% decline in April, the Fed said. Auto production was trimmed slightly and industry schedules for June show a further small decline.    Output of business equipment increased 0.5%, following a 0.1% decline in April, with rises in commerical and manufacturing equipment contributing to last month's increase.    Production by manufacturers increased 0.5% in May after falling 0.2% in April, while mining output dropped 0.2% following a 0.1% increase. Production by utilities jumped 1.4% after increasing 1.1%. Materials output rose 0.4% in both months.    The Fed's industrial production index stood at 127.8% of the 1977 average in May, up 2.9% from a year earlier.    The drop in housing starts was accompanied by a decline in building permits, which are generally a good indication of future building. Permits plunged 7.6% in May following a large 7% drop in April, declining to a 1,477,000-unit annual rate, the lowest since March 1983.    &quot;The housing starts report is a fairly predictable picture of weakness,&quot; said Davis Seiders, chief economist with the National Association of Homebuilders here. &quot;The decline is directly linked to interest rates, and starts will continue to move downward especially for single-family units.&quot;    Single-family starts fell 7.6% last month to a 1,129,000-unit annual rate after increasing 1% in April to a 1,222,000-unit pace. May starts on multi-family housing, however, were up 10.8% to a 491,000-unit annual rate following a 14.6% drop in April to a 443,000-unit pace.    &quot;The increase in multi-family units is not a signal that the market has bottomed out,&quot; Mr. Seiders said. &quot;We are still looking at this category as being on a downward trend.&quot; He noted that many builders have abandoned possible multi-family unit projects because of tax-law changes and higher interest rates.    The drop in housing starts last month was most pronounced in the West, where they fell 6.9% after dropping 13.2% in April. Starts also fell in the South but they rose in the Northeast and Midwest. In the South, starts fell 6.2% after rising 9%. In the Northeast, they increased 6.9% following a 7.1% April decline and in the Midwest they rose 1.9% after falling 10.9%.    The figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal variation.    Here is a summary of the Federal Reserve Board's report on industrial production in May.
