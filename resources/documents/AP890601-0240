In Jerusalem, tens of thousands of Israelis gathered at thesacred Western Wall in the Old City in a show of solidarity markingthe 22nd anniversary of Israel's capture of Arab east Jerusalem.   Israel TV quoted police as saying that about 40,000 people, manywaving Israeli flags, came to the plaza facing the Wall, the lastremnant of the ancient Jewish Temple and Judaism's holiest site.   The identity card program in the Gaza Strip will force Gazans toshow the cards on leaving and re-entering the territory via armycheckpoints, media reports said.   Government officials have said they also expect the system to beused in the West Bank.   The new Gaza Strip identity cards have imbedded magnetic strips.A senior military official refused comment on media reports thatthe cards would be run through computer readers at army checkpoints.   Women as well as children under 16 are exempt and can continueusing their old identity cards, the official said. He said heexpected between 70,000 and 80,000 Gazans to apply for the newcards, most of them because they work in Israel.   Last month, the army ordered all 50,000 Gazans working in Israelto return to their homes for a week, and several municipalgovernments and some Israeli factories launched campaigns toreplace Arab workers with Jews.   The latest move coincided with a demand by Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir that the army adopt harsher measures to end thenearly 18-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule inthe occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Israel captured the territories, home to 1.7 millionPalestinians, from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.The rebellion has left 503 Palestinians and 22 Israelis dead.   ``A way must be found to liquidate the intefadeh,'' Shamir wasquoted by the daily Yediot Ahronot as telling Defense MinisterYitzhak Rabin in a private meeting Wednesday. ``Intefadeh'' isArabic for uprising.   Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir confirmed that Shamir sought atougher approach by the military but declined to give details. Heinsisted Israel would maintain a policy of inflicting ``the minimumpossible bloodshed.''   The Jewish ceremony in the Old City began with a prayer, andthen plaza lights were put out and a giant image of the Star ofDavid was projected on the Wall's ancient stones.   The government placed a special emphasis on the Jerusalem Daycelebrations in an apparent attempt to confront Arab demands thatthe status of Jerusalem, which Israel has declared its capital, bediscussed in talks on the future of the occupied lands. ThePalestine Liberation Organization has declared an independent state.   At the Western Wall, Shamir vowed that that ``the country of themurderers will not come into being.''   ``No force in the world can separate us and Jerusalem,'' Shamirdeclared at a rally earlier in the day.   Also Thursday, Jewish extremists waving Israeli flags andsinging Hebrew songs marched for two hours through Jerusalem's Arabsector under heavy police guard to mark Jerusalem Day.   Police fired tear gas and chased an Arab youth into his homeafter a bottle and two rocks were dropped from rooftops on a groupof about 50 Jewish marchers. No one was injured.   Ariel, a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, amended rulesrequiring Palestinian employees to wear tags reading ``alienworker.'' Dorit Shalit, an administrative employee, said allnon-residents would be required to wear tags, including Jews.   Introduction of the tags for Palestinians had inspiredcomparisons with the Nazi order that every Jew wear a yellow Starof David.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher calledthe tags for Palestinian workers ``offensive.''   Also Thursday, at least 18 Palestinians, mostly teen-agers, werewounded in clashes with troops in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,Arab hospital officials said.   The army confirmed eight injuries, including five people shotand wounded in the West Bank city of Nablus. Arab reports said theNablus injuries occurred when soldiers opened fire to break up aprotest march by about 200 children.   In the West Bank town of Salfit, Israeli paratroopers detainedabout 30 suspected leaders of the uprising in a raid.</TEXT></DOC>
