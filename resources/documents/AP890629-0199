The army said they were leaders of the uprising in the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip.   The deportations brought to 55 the number of Palestinians sentinto exile since the rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987. At least fourother cases are pending.   At U.N. headquarters in New York, Secretary-general Javier Perezde Cuellar said he was ``greatly dismayed'' by the Israeli action.   Adam Shub, a State Department spokesman, said in Washington: ``Weare strongly opposed to deportations. We have ... spoken to ...Israel many times about this. It is fully aware of our views.''   He said deportations are especially harmful now while the Bushadministration seeks support for an Israeli proposal to holdelections among Palestinian Arabs in the occupied lands.   Twenty right-wing members of Israel's parliament hiked into theWest Bank a day ahead of 50 marches planned by Jewish settlers forFriday to dramatize their claim to the territory, part of thebiblical land of Israel. Two dozen soldiers guarded them and noincidents were reported.   The umbrella group for settlers called Gush Emunim, or Bloc ofthe Faithful, said the hikes were an effort to counter the revolt.About 1.7 million Palestinians and 70,000 settlers live in the WestBank and Gaza, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the1967 war.   Gush Emunim said: ``The terrorists and instigators will notfrighten us off, neither from the roads nor from the hiking trailsof Israel.''   Residents of the territories held a general strike Thursday toprotest settler attacks on Palestinians, which have increased inrecent weeks. Scattered confrontations with Israeli soldiers werereported, and Arab hospital officials said 13 Palestinians werewounded by army gunfire.   At least 538 Palestinians and 23 Israelis have been killed inmore than 18 months of revolt in the occupied lands. More than 8,000Palestinians have been wounded.   Army spokesmen reported Thursday that soldiers demolished thehomes of three murder suspects in the Gaza Strip and four houses inthe West Bank belonging to Palestinians accused of bomb attacks.   The International Committee of the Red Cross contendsdeportations contravene the Geneva convention on treatment of peoplein occupied territory, which Israel has signed.   Israel says the convention permits selective deportations ``inextreme cases.''   An army communique said the eight Palestinians deported were``leaders of the uprising in the territories and outstandingactivists'' of Fatah, the guerrilla group led by PLO chairmanbYasser Arafat, and of the Syria-based Democratic Front for theLiberation of Palestine.   Expulsion orders for all of them were issued in August, but werenot carried out until the Supreme Court heard appeals by some of thePalestinians. All the appeals were rejected.   Lebanese police said the deportees, four each from the West Bankand Gaza Strip, were flown by helicopter to Israel's ``securityzone'' in south Lebanon and driven to the Zommaraya crossing, agateway between the border strip and the rest of the country.   Among those deported Thursday were two prominent West Bank laborunion activists, Mohammed Abdullah Labadi, 34, and Radwan AhmadZayad, 31, and Abu Karesh, 50, a Gaza City teacher.   Efforts are under way in Israel to speed the expulsion process.Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has asked that deportations beallowed before completion of the appeals process.</TEXT></DOC>
