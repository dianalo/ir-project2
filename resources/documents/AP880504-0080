Nocasualties were reported.   The two-hour battle in downtown Beirut came amid reports ofgrowing tension between a Christian militia and the Lebanese army.   There was no word on what caused the battle, the fourth betweencivil war antagonists in Beirut in two weeks. The clashes havestrained a 14-month-old truce in the war that began in 1975.   The fighting coincided with a state of alert proclaimed by the6,000-strong Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia, in eastBeirut and the Christian heartland north of the capital.   Christian militiamen set up checkpoints and roadblocks all overthe Christian sector of Beirut and along the main coastal highwayrunning north from the city, witnesses reported.   Fighters in battle fatigues and carrying automatic weaponssearched cars and frisked occupants, said the witnesses, who spokeon condition of anonymity.   The militia gave no explanation for the alert. But theChristian-owned Ad-Diyar daily said it stemmed from tension betweenthe militia and the Lebanese army, which is controlled by Christianofficers.   The newspaper said the militia was putting on a muscle-flexingshow to demonstrate it controls the Christian enclave, not the army.   The commander of the 37,000-man army, Gen. Michel Aoun, has beenquoted by several Beirut newspapers recently as saying the militarycould finish off the militia any time it wanted.   Newspapers said his remarks were part of a campaign by theMaronite Catholic commander to become the next president of Lebanonafter President Amin Gemayel's six-year term expires in September.Aoun, who has not denied the statements, has not officallyproclaimed his candidacy.</TEXT></DOC>
