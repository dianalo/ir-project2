A subsidiary of New York-based Reliance Group Holdings Inc. plans to sign today a $160 million Euronote facility backed by insurance premium loans. The financing, arranged by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Inc., carries a provisional single-A-1 rating from Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    With insurance premiums climbing, the premium loans business is booming, says Peter Hahn, a vice president in Manufacturers Hanover's structured finance group. From a volume of $2 billion to $3 billion in 1984, the business grew to near $9 billion last year. Reliance, by turning its loans into securities, and getting them off its balance sheet, is able to increase its business without a corresponding increase in costly capital.    Investment bankers have been eyeing insurance-related loans -- both those covering premium payments and those that insurers make on life insurance policies -- for some time, but turning them into securities poses some problems.    With the Reliance financing, the main difficulty was credit, Mr. Hahn says.    Unlike mortgages, which are the assets most commonly used to back securities, premium loans have a predictable cash flow, making the mathematical aspect of the offering fairly simple. But the loans backing the Reliance notes are relatively small -- an average of $20,000 each -- and involve small and medium-sized businesses whose credit-worthiness is hard for investors to judge.    A common solution in similar financings backed by other types of assets has been to guarantee the whole financing with an insurance policy or letter of credit. In the Reliance offering, however, only the first 7% of losses are covered by a letter of credit -- a considerably lower-than-average coverage. Basically, investors are relying on the pool of loans itself for repayment.    Manufacturers Hanover expects investors to accept that relatively low level of credit support because of the way premium loans are structured, Mr. Hahn explained.    If a borrower defaults, the insurance company has to refund the unearned premium to the lender. If the default occurs early in the life of the loan, there could be a shortage of up to 9%, Mr. Hahn said, but the loss rate as a whole on the Reliance loans has been only 0.3%.    The notes will carry maturities of 30, 60 or 90 days. The maturity of the underlying loans, however, ranges up to nine months. In addition to the letter of credit, the notes will be backed by a bank liquidity facility that will guarantee payment if market conditions make it impossible to issue new notes to pay outstanding ones. </TEXT></DOC>
