The House voted 380-48 to block the 51 percent salary boost andthe Senate concurred less than three hours later by a 94-6 margin.The Senate had passed a similar but not identically worded measure,95-5, last week.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would sign thebill, which also would kill large pay raises for federal judges andsenior officials in the executive branch. ``The president will abideby the wishes of the Congress,'' he said.   Lawmakers in both houses said the votes were a bow tooverwhelming public sentiment against the big boost in the currentcongressional pay of $89,500 a year.   ``You can fight city hall and you can take on the Congress of theUnited States with all its legerdemain and all its legislativeability'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.   The six senators voting to permit the raise were DemocratsChristopher Dodd of Connecticut, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts andSpark Matsunaga of Hawaii; and Republicans James Jeffords of Vermontand Frank Murkowski and Ted Stevens, both of Alaska.   It took a two-thirds vote for the repeal measure to clear theHouse, and there was no doubt about the outcome.   ``We face reality here today,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., astaunch supporter of the increase. ``We're doing what has becomeinevitable.''   ``Today, we the Congress will be reflecting the voice of thepeople regarding the attitude on congressional pay,'' said Rep.Jerry Lewis, R-Calif.   One lawmaker spoke out forcefully in favor of the pay raise _ anddrew an ovation from the lawmakers gathered to vote against him.   ``Each member of the House, Democrat and Republican, is worth$135,000,'' said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill. He said that whateverthe pay and perquisites received by lawmakers, it doesn't make upfor the missed birthdays, school plays and other family occasionsthat are part of life in Congress.   Public opinion polls reflected overwhelming opposition to theincrease, and the House debated the issue before a packed gallerywith a long line of spectators waiting in the Capitol corridorshoping for a seat.   The repeal of the raise _ recommended by a federal commission andendorsed by Presidents Reagan and Bush _ would leave congressionalpay at $89,500 a year.   At the same time, it would leave intact a much-criticized systemthat permits lawmakers to earn thousands of dollars in speakingfees, permits them to earn other outside income and enables them tohave lobbyists pay travel costs for public appearances.   Even as the House moved toward a vote, lawmakers cautioned thatwithout a raise for judges for senior executive branch officials,the government would be hardpressed to find and keep qualified menand women on the job. ``There are Supreme Court justices who makeless than their clerks the day after they (the clearks) retire andgo into private practice,'' said Fazio.   ``This issue isn't over,'' said Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, a leadingopponent of the pay raise who said the Congress must deal this yearwith pay for judges and bureaucrats as well as the questionsinvolved in honoraria and other forms of outside income forlawmakers.   Raise opponents cleared the path for rejection votes in bothhouses today, after they engineered the collapse Monday of HouseSpeaker Jim Wright's suggested alternative, a 30 percent payincrease.   The speaker conceded after his forces were beaten decisively whenthey tried to adjourn the House, let the full raise become law at12:01 a.m. Wednesday and then schedule a Thursday vote to scale backthe increase to 30 percent. The opening move in that strategy failedon a 238-88 vote.   Public clamor against the raise has been growing each day. Aweekend Gallup poll asked 1,001 adults from Friday through Sundaywhether they favored or opposed increasing congressional pay from$89,500 to $135,000, the amount of the proposed increase.   The results, with a four-point margin of error, showed 82 percentopposed with only 15 percent in favor.   One immediate casualty of the raise appears to be a plan to banlawmakers' receipt of fees for speeches and appearances. These oftenare paid by special interests seeking to influence legislation.   Many members of Congress who accept the money said they do so tosupplement an inadequate income.   Assuming the full raise is defeated, any elimination of the$26,850 that House members can retain in honoraria _ or the $35,800that senators can keep _ would be a move to reduce lawmakers' pay.Senators already have unanimously approved an honoraria ban forthemselves, but made it conditional upon the full raise becoming law.   Also left dangling was a proposal to end a loophole in federallaw that allowed 190 House members to accumulate $39 million inleftover campaign cash, which could be converted to their personaluse. A bipartisan House negotiating team agreed to eliminate theloophole if the raise went into effect.</TEXT></DOC>
