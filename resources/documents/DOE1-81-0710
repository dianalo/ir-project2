The photostationary mixturesin both singlet and triplet experiments contain only tran,trans and cis,transisomers; no cis,cis isomer or any photoproducts were observed. The twocis isomers exhibit no measurable fluorescence or triplet formation.Results are interpreted in terms of allylmethylene-like intermediates.Efficient internal conversion of singlet DPBs is inferred from low isomerizationquantum yields by direct excitation. Triplet-sensitized isomerizationsshow a marked DPB concentration dependence of photostationary compositionand quantum yields. Analysis of these data reveals a quantum chain processinvolving excited triplet DPB as the chain-carrying species. Transientabsorption measurements show that sensitized excitation of any DPB isomerleads directly to a fast equilibrium between triplet all-trans and trans-twistedforms.</TEXT></DOC>
