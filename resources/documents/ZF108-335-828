 However, traumatic thattransition may have been, it pales in comparison with today's versions of thesame problem because of the increasing complexity and rate of change inbusiness and technology.andM;The business side uses organizational structure as one method to stabilizeits side of the equation.andP;  It creates separate organizations to handle thepursuit and development of new business.andP;  Business recognizes that the samepeople cannot successfully be assigned to both current operations and newbusiness at the same time.andM;IS should emulate the successful model of the business side and use some ofthe same structural techniques.andP;  Some variations may be appropriate for thetypical IS organization, but a similar emphasis is needed for successfulplanning and implementation of new technology.andM;Constant ChangeandM;The neat, synergistic relationship of business generating requirements forsupporting technology is complicated by the typically messy facts of life;nothing is ever as simple as it seems.andP;  Both business and technology arecontinually changing.andM;The business side is in constant flux because of the normal flow ofbusiness--today's business is constantly changed by tomorrow's new products,markets and customers.andP;  Similarly, the current technology is constantly underpressure from emerging technology.andM;During the constant cycles of change, the business side must remain stableand so must the supporting technology base.andP;  The technology must provideconstant support; it cannot afford the luxury of shutting down to retool.andP;  Adelicate balance must be maintained; the new technology must be slid in undertoday's business, even as tomorrow's business is becoming today's.andM;How Business CopesandM;Although most business resources are devoted to supporting currentoperations, which generate revenue, business knows it must devote sufficientattention to the future in order to succeed.andM;As a reflection of the importance of future planning, the new business unitsrank as highly as the operational ones, even though they are typically muchsmaller.andP;  Both new business and operational organizations are often headed byvice presidents.andP;  Often, the two vice presidents each report directly to thepresident.andM;New business and current operations receive equal emphasis because thebusiness side has long recognized that success, in fact survival itself,depends as much on the ability to get new business as it does on the abilityto do today's business.andM;IS should institute a similar structure, elevating new technology to equalstatus with that of daily operations.andP;  Those responsible for currentoperations and future technology could each report directly to the head ofIS.andM;IS does not yet seem to understand the value of separate units devoted totoday's and tomorrow's technologies.andP;  True, there will often be groups thatidentify and bring in new technology.andP;  These groups will fly a variety offlags such as Systems Engineering, Planning and Technology, Advanced Systemsand so forth.andP;  Sometimes they will be staff organizations and other timesthey will be part of the line.andM;A New IS StructureandM;Probably the least frequently used structure but potentially the mosteffective is for the future technology group, often called SystemsEngineering, to be placed at the top of the IS organization, reporting onlyto the IS director.andP;  In this structure, the group can oversee the entireorganization and is not directly subordinate to a daily operations, currenttechnology entity.andM;Another approach is to elevate the new technology group to equal status withthe daily operations group.andP;  Under this arrangement, the new technology groupis no longer expected to survive on the operations leftovers.andP;  No longer isit viewed as a spare-time job.andP;  Resources are now dedicated to this effort.andO;New technology is represented to the boss by a voice that is equal to that ofdaily operations.andP;  The people assigned to the task are motivated and have thetime to do the job and to do it right.andM;Most important of all is the message sent to the IS organization and thecompany at large: Keeping up with technology is important.andP;  Doing this wellis just as important to success as providing high-quality and good service indaily operations.andM;Equal status is not a license to build an empire.andP;  Just as on the businessside, the new technology organization will be small but powerful.andP;  The powercomes from management commitment, not body count.andM;The new technology unit must stress quality over quantity.andP;  It should be thenatural haunt of those whose interest and capabilities lie in the pursuit ofnew ideas, fresh approaches and visions of the future firmly grounded in atechnical base.andP;  It is also the home turf for the planners who can work outthat balancing act required to shift the new into place.andP;  This organization'sproper function is planning for new technology, testing technical feasibilityand demonstrating solutions to technical problems.andP;  Implementing the plans isstill the function of those folks who will be providing the support for whatwill then be the current technology.andM;However, in the typical IS shop, the organizational structures often indicatethat IS' priority is current operations.andP;  Under this structure, newtechnology is represented by staff, the current operations by line.andP;  The linemanagement will most often have superior rank, power and credibility with theboss.andP;  The future technology function has even less influence when it isstaffed at lower levels of the organization.andP;  The odds against success areeven longer because the groups are much more directly under the control ofthe line management responsible for daily operations.andM;Overpowered By Daily OperationsandM;As line organizations, they are rarely above first-line management and arefrequently at first-level supervision.andP;  They can be either a line functionreporting to a line manager or they can be embedded as a function within aline organization.andP;  The latter is by far the weakest of the organizationalpositions.andP;  At worst, they will be ineffective because of being continuallyoverpowered by the needs of the daily operation.andP;  At best, they may effectsome small change within the sphere of influence of their parentorganization.andM;As a line function reporting to a line manager, the group is somewhat betteroff, but not much.andP;  The current operation is still obviously the top priorityfor the higher-level manager.andP;  Also, there will be more peer-level managersconcerned with the current operations and technology than with the new.andO;Sheer weight of numbers will take its toll.andP;  Whether the new technology groupis line or staff, it is part of the same organizational structure that hasresponsibility for the day-to-day operations.andM;The majority of resources in the typical IS shop are devoted to maintainingoperating system and applications, tuning data bases, managing DASD farms,implementing and testing modifications and the hundreds of other tasksrequired to keep the installed technology base operating smoothly.andP;  A premiumis placed on high performance levels and continuous service.andM;The management system is designed to reward behavior that contributes to asmoothly running, trouble-free environment.andP;  One way to achieve this desiredstate is to keep changes, of any kind, to a minimum.andP;  The introduction of newtechnology is a change.andP;  When change is equated with disturbance, disruptionand chaos, all of which the prudent line manager seeks to avoid, change willbe resisted.andM;Another, perhaps more insidious barrier to bringing in new technology is theresistance to change based on familiarity with the current technology.andP;  Manyof the line people, particularly management and senior technicians, havevested interest in keeping things the way they are.andP;  There is a certaincomfort level associated with what they know, no matter how promising thefuture may look (to someone else).andM;If management's commitment to change (new technology) is perceived as lessthan the commitment to maintaining the effectiveness of daily operations, itencourages resistance.andP;  The typical IS organization, totally focused oncurrent operations, clearly fosters this perception.andP;  When the organizationalso places the agents of change noticeably subordinate to the currentoperations, it reinforces the perception.andM;Personnel assigned to new technology functions are often technicalspecialists who have earned their reputations in line organizations.andP;  On theline, they solved the most difficult problems encountered with the installedtechnology base.andP;  Typically, their names appeared on every task force, tigerteam and technical review board that came along.andM;Unfortunately, referring to participation in those activities in the pasttense is just a fond dream.andP;  They are still the names that appear on everytask force, tiger team and technical review board that comes along.andP;  Thepeople and their specialized knowledge are just too valuable to dailyoperations.andP;  When they report to the same management that is responsible forthe daily operations, this double duty is inescapable.andM;Furthermore, the people assigned to the groups are usually picked because oftheir in-depth technical knowledge of the current technology.andP;  Although anindicator of technical ability, it does not necessarily show knowledge offuture technology.andP;  Worst of all, the expert on current technology may resistchanges to the environment on which that expertise is based.andM;People ProblemsandM;Even when none of these negative aspects surface and the technical people areideally suited to the new technology task, they seldom have time to do thejob right.andP;  Why?andP;  Because they are tied up on &quot;more important things,&quot; liketrouble-shooting current systems.andM;The existence of these problems in IS is a shock to some and denied by many.andO;IS personnel observe exactly the same behavior in user organizations in many,if not most, of the projects they participate in.andP;  They see line managers andsenior technicians strongly resisting changes that new system implementationsintroduce, even though most in the organization agree that the systems arebeneficial.andP;  As it turns out, one of the most frequently named culprits forthis behavior cited by IS is back of management commitment.andP;  Physician healthyself.andM;Structural changes usually do not solve a problem all by themselves.andP;  Manyother aspects are involved, such as involvement with the business lineorganization to understand its needs, strategic planning, level of executivesupport, etc., but this change does cause a shift in IS managementcommitment.andP;  Who better than IS understands the power of managementcommitment?andM;R.andP;  E.
