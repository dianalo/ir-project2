An effective poolingof resources and talent is the only viable answer to this dilemma. Roboticsor automation applied to complex existing systems will not provide thefull benefit of these technologies. New, simpler systems, designed specificallyfor remote or automated control, must be developed. Three candidate systemconcepts for coal mining are described, including continuous remotelycontrolled heading advance, advanced longwall, and a cross-pit conveyor/excavatorconcept for surface mining.</TEXT></DOC>
