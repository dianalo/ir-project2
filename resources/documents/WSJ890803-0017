In the past two days, more than a dozen companies have entered the market with $2.6 billion of debt offerings. Some of the issues, including McDonald's Corp. and Export Development Corp., were said to have sold briskly. But a few other issues encountered investor resistance as the rally faded.    &quot;This market is not a bottomless pit,&quot; one syndicate official said. &quot;The supply will be digested in the next couple of days, but until some of this paper clears or the markets rally, the window is basically closed for others,&quot; he added.    Corporate bond traders said the issues sold &quot;reasonably well,&quot; but added that about $1 billion, or 38%, of the new debt hasn't yet been sold and remains in underwriters' inventories.    One company too late to tap the market was United Technologies Corp. The huge volume of new issues and the sluggish tone of the secondary market forced the defense contractor to call off a $140 million issue of 30-year debentures, according to traders.    In trading yesterday, prices of actively traded corporate bonds were unchanged to 1/4 point lower, or down as much as $2.50 per $1,000 face amount.    In the Treasury market, prices were unchanged to modestly lower in sporadic trading as investors moved cautiously ahead of Friday's employment report for July and the government's announcement of the details of its next quarterly refunding.    The benchmark 30-year bond, which rose nearly 1/2 point during the day, closed slightly lower than Tuesday. Shorter-term issues were as much as 1/8 point lower.    The Treasury said it plans to sell $29.5 billion of notes and bonds to raise about $13.6 billion in cash. The Treasury will redeem $15.9 billion of maturing government securities.    But the Treasury said the auction will take place only if Congress increases the federal government's current debt ceiling of $2.8 trillion. That contingency clause will limit the amount of preliminary trading activity, which bond dealers refer to as &quot;when-issued&quot; trading. During that period, dealers are able to size up the market and estimate the level of investor demand for the new bonds. As a result of the contingency clause, some analysts speculate that yields on the new bonds could come in slightly higher to compensate dealers for the greater risk involved with participating in the auction.    Maria Fiorini Ramirez, money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said that &quot;a shorter distribution process before the auction does not help the Treasury in financing its obligations,&quot; cheaply. But she added, &quot;I never remember Congress being cost-conscious on this matter.&quot;    Joseph Liro, a vice president and money market economist at S.G. Warburg Securities andamp; Co., believes that Congress will pass the proposed debt ceiling increase over the weekend, which will allow when-issued activity to begin Monday.    Mr. Liro said that prices at the auction might depend upon tomorrow's employment report. &quot;If the report is weaker than expected, the auction prices will come in higher. Conversely, if the report is stronger than expected, yields will back up.&quot;    Economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets expect, on average, a 158,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in July. In June, non-farm payrolls grew by 180,000. The economists' average estimate for the July unemployment rate is 5.3%, unchanged from June.    Treasury Securities    Treasury securities ended unchanged to slightly lower in light trading.    The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at about 111 25/32 to yield about 7.84%, down from a price of 111 29/32 and yield of 7.83% Tuesday. The latest 10-year notes were quoted unchanged at 109 7/32 to yield 7.75%. Some five-year notes fell as much as 1/4 point.    Short-term rates were mixed. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.66% for a bond equivalent yield of 7.9% compared with a rate of 7.69% and yield of 7.93% Tuesday. But the rate on six-month Treasury bills rose to 7.42% for a bond equivalent yield of 7.79% compared with a rate of 7.36% and yield of 7.73% Tuesday.    Municipal Issues Washington Public Power Supply System, the nuclear power agency behind the biggest municipal bond default in history, plans to issue new debt later this month.    WPPSS said it intends to offer $450 million of revenue bonds for two of its nuclear power plants. Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. will be lead underwriter for the negotiated financing, WPPSS's first sale since it defaulted five years ago on $2.25 billion of bonds.    The memory of the default notwithstanding, officials connected with the sale don't expect investors to demand a significant yield premium from the new debt.    &quot;We don't feel there should be a premium. This is going to be one of the best-funded issues that you're ever going to see,&quot; says Carl Halvorson, chairman of the WPPSS executive board. &quot;This should be regarded as an absolutely prime credit compared to all revenue bonds.&quot; Rather than being secured by a revenue stream from underlying WPPSS projects, Mr. Halvorson says the refunding bonds will be backed by net billing agreements with the Bonneville Power Administration.    Today, New York City takes bids for $950 million revenue anticipation notes and $300 million tax anticipation notes, all due June 29, 1990.    Corporate Issues    The onslaught of new corporate bond offerings continued with five companies issuing a total of $750 million of new debt.    Among the best-received offerings yesterday was McDonald's $100 million of 30-year debentures and Export Development's $200 million of 10-year notes.    McDonald's debentures were priced to yield 9.001% while Export Development's notes were priced to yield 8.181%.    Sears Roebuck andamp; Co. came to market with $200 million of seven-year notes priced at a yield 8.55%. According to a Sears spokesperson, proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes including retiring some commercial paper debt.    In other new-issue market news, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. assigned an E-3 event-risk covenant ranking to Bowater Inc.'s issue of $300 million of 20-year debentures, which were priced to yield 9% on Tuesday by First Boston Corp.    This is the first new corporate bond offering to be evaluted under Sandamp;P's new bondholder protection ranking service. Prior to this, the rating agency had announced event-risk covenant rankings to existing corporate bond issues.    According to the credit rating agency, the ranking indicates that &quot;covenants in the issue provide some event-risk protection by allowing debt holders to put the bonds back to Bowater should certain credit-damaging events occur.&quot;    Sandamp;P's event-risk covenant rankings, which were started last month, have five categories. E-3 stands midway. Traders have said the Bowater bonds was the best-received deal in the past two sessions because of strong investor demand for event-risk protection.    Mortgage-Backed Issues    Ginnie Maes and other mortgage securities ended as much as 3/8 point lower, amid continued pressure by thrift selling.    &quot;It's hard to tell whether all the (portfolio) liquidations you hear about are true, but the threat is still there,&quot; says one trader of the thrift selling that has kept mortgage securities under a cloud.    There was speculation early yesterday that one ailing thrift had sold over $1 billion of mortgage securities late Tuesday and early yesterday.    Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for August delivery was quoted at 99 11/32, down 7/32 on the day, after wavering in a 99 3/32 to 99 19/32 range. The closely watched coupon was yielding about 9.21% to a 12-year average life assumption.    Ginnie Mae's 8 1/2% issue was quoted at 97 1/4, down 6/32, while its 9 1/2% securities were off 7/32 at 101 3/32.    In the derivative arena, Prudential-Bache Capital Funding launched a $420 million issue of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Remic mortgage securities in nine classes, six of which are planned amortization classes. A Remic is a real estate mortgage investment conduit.    The offering, Series 80, is backed by Freddie Mac's 9% issue, with a weighted average remaining term to maturity of 25.67 years.    Foreign Bonds    Most foreign bond markets were quiet, but a large offering of dollar-denominated Eurobonds sparked some interest.    West Germany's BASF Finance Europe NV, a unit of BASF AG, issued $300 million of 8% seven-year Eurobonds. Traders said German corporations seldom tap the Euromarket, which lends their debt a certain rarity value. &quot;It's the sort of paper that German institutions just have to buy,&quot; one dealer said.    Elsewhere:    --Japanese government bonds were little changed in quiet trading. The benchmark No. 111 4.6% issue due 1998 closed at a price of 97.42, down 0.03 yen per 100 yen face value. The issue's yield was 5.02%.    --West German government bonds were unchanged to slightly lower. Bonn's 7% issue due February 1999 ended at 102.80 to yield 6.59%, the same as Tuesday. The 6 3/4% notes due 1994 fell 0.05 point to 100.475 to yield 6.62%.    --British government bonds drifted lower. The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 ended 5/32 lower at 115 18/32 to yield 9.65%. The 11 3/4% notes due 1991 fell 1/32 at 99 29/32 to yield 11.75%. </TEXT></DOC>
