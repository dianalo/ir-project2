KobbandM;West Paterson, New JerseyandM;AREV RaveandM;Thanks for your &quot;Revelation Expert&quot; column by John Gunther.andP;  As anintermediate Revelation user, I'm starving for information and reasonablypriced support.andP;  Every month you have his column I buy your magazine.andP;  I alsoapplaud your new BBS policy.andP;  You're providing a great service to readers.andO;However, I urge you to also establish a Revelation conference.andP;  There are sofew places Revelation users can turn to for information.andM;Ron WielageandM;Omaha, NebraskaandM;Ed.'s Note: If you haven't tried out the Data Based Advisor Reader'sExchange, here's your chance.andP;  It's absolutely free  although you do pay forthe call).andP;  Just dial (619) 270-2042 with your modem; the parameters are 1200or2400 baud, 8 data bits, one stop bit, and no parity.andM;Adding ZerosandM;Malcolm Rubel's  &quot;dBASE IV Primer&quot; is clear and well written.andP;  RegardingJune's column, here's another approach to placing zeros in the customerfield.andP;  The customer I.D.andP;  number is the record number converted to a string.andO;Simply add the record number to 100,000.andP;  Now convert the resulting number toa string.andP;  The right five characters will be the record number with leadingzeros.andP;  It can be done with a single line of code:andM;rvalue = rightfstr(recno() + 100000),5)andM;Many companies use this idea for the key entry of stock numbers.andP;  The stocknumber is a character field.andP;  Yet, the data entry screens use numericvariables for input.andP;  In this way, the user needn't worry about addingleading zeros.andM;Carl M. BishopandM;SanCar Computer ServicesandM;Mentor, OhioandM;Fox FanandM;Let me add my voice to those praising George Goley and his &quot;Fox Files&quot;column.andP;  He covers materials and techniques utterly ignored in any manualsI've seen and on a level commensurate with my database skills (I'm neither acomplete novice nor a chiphead).andM;Goley's got it, by golly !andP;  Patterson SmithandM;Montclair, New JerseyandM;Why Relative Directory Addressing WorksandM;I appreciated Brian Smith's  Paradox Programmer&quot; article in the June issueregarding application speed-up via &quot;Relative Directory Addressing.&quot; Histechnique has merit on the basis of good file classification.andP;  But he didn'texplain why his technique works, and the reasons may provide insight toimproving speed even more.andM;Just as files can be fragmented, so can subdirectories.andP;  They fragment whenyou've stored more file names than will fit in one cluster (a small number ofcontiguous disk sectors).andP;  By making several subdirectories prior to creatingthe files, as with Brian's RDA technique, you create relatively closedirectory clusters.andP;  This lessens fragmenting but creates just as many (ormore) clusters and could involve just as many disk operations.andP;  But disk I/Odoesn't take as long because the head has less distance to move.andP;  Minimizingsubdirectory fragmentation is the reason that RDA works.andM;Just as fragmentation can improve access time to files, optimization can havean impact on directory access.andP;  I periodically run Norton's SD program tooptimize my hard disk.andP;  Version 4.5 provides for selection among severalmethods.andP;  Full optimization, defragmentation of both files andsubdirectories, takes a half hour or more, but directory optimization alonetakes only seconds.andM;Running optimizers that work on subdirectories as well as files involves timewell spent if you have many files in one directory.andP;  Even with RDA,optimization can improve access time further by bringing the differentsubdirectory clusters into close proximity.andM;Don't go overboard with subdirectories! As you can see from the descriptionabove, having many partially full subdirectories creates fragmentation thateven the optimizing programs can't correct.andM;Other techniques can also help.andP;  DOS' FASTOPEN and various disk cachingprograms may help more than RDA or optimization, depending on theapplication.andP;  Keep up the good work.andP;  Since I'm an Advanced Revelationdevotee, I'd like more articles such as the occasional &quot;Revelation Expert&quot;column.andM;Jim BoardmanandM;MultiSource ConsultingandM;Tucson, ArizonaandM;CorrectionsandM;In the June feature,  Managing Text,&quot; we listed dated contact information forGolden Retriever.andP;  The text manager is now offered by S.K.andP;  Data, P.O. Box413, Burlington, Mass.andP;  01803, (617) 229-8909.andP;  Also, in Russell Freeland'sarticle, &quot;The DBF Divulged,&quot; the following information was incorrect.andO;Clipper allows 1,024 fields per record, not 512.andP;  The terminating characteris a carriage return, ASCII 13.andM;TalkbackandM;Your  Fast Take' of Query 2.1 in the June issue calls for clarification.andM;In Query, one sets up and maintains queries from a table before invokingthem; in fact, Query can be described as a query organization system.andP;  Byusing this scheme, the results of a query can be shown using a table, report,or graph.Multi queries can appear in multiple wndows.andP;  One can zoom toanother query for detail, chain to another query, or set up an applicationmenu.andP;  We don't know if the reviewer finds them any good since these featuresaren't mentioned.andP;  I want to address the following points: '...you can placelabels where you need them.' You can place legends, not labels, anywhere ongraphs.andP;  'It's missing the keyword, HAVING.' Supported in version 2.2.andP;  'Ifthe DOS SELECT is first in your path, you could be in for some trouble.' Bysome trouble, does he mean that Query wouldn't be loaded? He doesn't mentionthe solution, which is to type &quot;Query SELECT * FROM TABLE' instead of 'SELECT* FROM TABLE'.andP;  Moreover, when was the last time you used the DOS SELECTcommand? 'One of the things I needed most was a list of keystrokeassignments.' The keystroke table is in on-line help.andM;Considering that a large percentage of users currently use 'CGA monitors...'andO;I don't agree.andM;YSCTech also offers an OS/2 version of Query that uses 80386 protected mode.'andO;Microsoft hasn't released OS/2 version 2.0 yet.andM;The standard, three-ring black binder ...andP;  is poorly written with no examplesof the output you could expect to see or produce.' A whole chapter isdedicated to examples.andM;For knowledgeable SQL users who can get by with little documentation...' Hedoesn't mention that Query is for dBASE users too.andP;  Out of the seven types ofqueries, TABLE, REPORT, GRAPH, and HIST use DBASE terminology.andP;  SELECT,UPDATE, and DELETE use SQL syntax.andP;  When one fills in index, relation, andfilter, no SQL knowledge is called for.andM;Fast Takes may not be exhaustive studies, but don't ignore the main featuresor pick on small points by copying the limitations and cautions stated in themanual.andM;Yuksun ChanandM;President, YSCTECHandM;Willowdale, Ontario</TEXT></DOC>
