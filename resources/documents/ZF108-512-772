 Although some restrictionswould still apply, OSF/1 business area manager Grace Perez says independentsoftware vendors could have it by September - and possibly before - sincenone of the members objected to the idea.andP;  Meanwhile Ms Perez, and Foundationchief Dave Tory said that OSF/1 will have Xenix compatibility - but by thefirst quarter of next year rather than at the launch of OSF/1 in November.andO;The Foundation is working with Santa Cruz Operation, along with LocusComputing Corp and Hewlett-Packard Co on the development project.andP;  Locus willbe responsible for software engineering, Hewlett will provide hardware.andP;  Thegoal is &quot;to ensure compatibility with SCO Unix System V/386, Open Desktop,SCO Xenix System V and other System V/386s by first half 1991&quot;.andM;Unix International woos MS-DOS, VMS, OS/400 developersandM;to make System V uncatchable...andM;Unix International Inc has opened a new front in its escalating battle withthe Open Software Foundation, this time aimed at winning the hearts and mindsof the strategic independent software vendor community.andP;  The true blue Unixclub says it is out to double its claimed 15,000-strong program base withintwo years, making it the equal of MS-DOS today.andP;  Marketing vice-presidentDave Sandell said that the first target is MS-DOS houses, particularly thoseworking in the client-server and personal productivity area.andP;  Then come IBMmid-range and DEC VMS developers, Ultrix and AIX vendors and the Xenix andBerkeley crowds.andP;  Enticements include a new advertising campaign in the WallStreet Journal (&quot;the most secure investment in this paper&quot;), Financial Times,Asian Wall Street Journal and various trade publications, and 10 one-dayseminars in the US and Europe.andP;  Unix International has secured theendorsements of Sparc International, 88Open and Intel for the programme, toemphasise the possibilities of high volume sales through binarycompatibility; each has pledged to help vendors to convert to Unix.andP;  UnixInternational member companies will also make porting centres in 18 countriesavailable for third party use, backed by loan programmes, detailed conversionguides and discounted training courses.andM;...claims 85% have taken up V.4...andM;According to Unix International's Dave Sandell, there are 175 companies withSystem V licences and 85% of those have licences to V.4, and the UnixSoftware Operation says it is actively negotiating with the rest.andP;  Answeringthe Software Foundation claims that System V.4 isn't actually shipping,Sandell says that ICL, ATandamp;T and NEC are currently delivering binary versionswith applications.andP;  But the Foundation riposts that if that's the case, itwould still like to get a copy to play with!andM;...and wins System V.4 support in IndiaandM;In the wake of Unix International's field trip to India last month, 12 Indiancompanies and governmental agencies have formed a regional group supportingUnix System V.4.andP;  The group hopes to harness India's highly skilled butlow-cost programmer population to writ V.4 software for export.andP;  Theconsolidation move, believed to be organised by ATandamp;T India and Sun'sdistributor Wypro, includes Hindustan Computers Ltd, Tata ConsultancyServices, The National Centre for Software Technology, Softek, Org Systems,ITC Ltd, ICIM - ICL India, the National Council for Social Development, TheNational Association of Software and Service Companies, and KirloskarComputer.andP;  Unix International is also watching the way the wind blows at theCocom meeting this month, contemplating a move on Comecon.andM;X/Open won't move on user interfacesandM;X/Open Co Ltd refuses to back one graphical user interface even though thefirst two of four action items at its user meeting in Luxembourg last monthwere demands that they make a choice.andP;  X/Open, wanting to make sure itsupports a de facto standard, feels it is still to soon.andP;  Those that thinkthat X/Open should do more note that even Apple has Motif up under A/UX, andATandamp;T will sell Motif if that's what it takes to close a deal.andP;  Roger Sippl,chairman of Informix Corp and of X/Open's software vendor user council, saidsupport for a common applications programming interface encompassing Motifand Open Look would not be possible without compromise: &quot;the feature sets arenot close enough and you would still need two sets of documentation, twoquality assurance tests and two training efforts&quot;.andM;Kavner statement on ATandamp;T peace feelersandM;&quot;If anyone has a solution to the impasse between Unix International and theOpen Software Foundation, I welcome it.andP;  There is a need for one Uniximplementation in the marketplace if there is to be consistency andinteroperability among vendors and architectures.andP;  The Unix operating systemshould not be a turf for competitive differentiation.andP;  It just hurts thecustomer.andP;  I suggest that any new dialogue address only specific issues andthe discussion not be allowed to be used as a vehicle for competing companiesto gain new advantages.andP;  This has been our problem to date.andP;  My chief concern- and the concern of those companies who have adopted Unix System V as thestandard Unix platforms - is that we protect the investment users, vendorsand software independents have made to date.andP;  The industry needs to preservethose investments and I think that's what this new user group is telling us.andO;They're saying, &quot;We're interested in the Unix operating system, we haveinvestments in the Unix operating system, and we need assurances that thefuture of the Unix operating system is not disruptive.&quot; In my mind, acommitment to Unix System V is all the assurance they need.andP;  You have toremember that there are some pretty major players in the  industry who don'tagree, for their own reasons, and may not find it in their best interest toreach an accomodation over a standard platform.andP;  We have tried for nearly twoyears to reach an accomodation.andP;  While there is some agreement on technology,the Holy Grail has eluded us.andP;  Maybe a fresh look at the issue will help.andO;The key to success is to force out self interest and address the Unix issuesfrom the perspective of those who have invested to date, and how others canbe accommodated.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
