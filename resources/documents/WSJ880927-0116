Browning (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LVMHY WNEWS </CO><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bernard Arnault asserted his predominance among shareholders of the French luxury group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton by having his father, Jean Arnault, elected chairman of the group's supervisory board.    The supervisory board then elected Alain Chevalier, who is close to the Moet-Hennessy family interests, as chairman of the management committee that will run the company under the board's loose supervision.    The two elections formalized the alliance under which Messrs. Arnault and Chevalier now seem determined to preside jointly over the luxury group's future. The two men demonstrated that they and the Moet-Hennessy families control the board, following a feud that split the Moet-Hennessy and Vuitton family interests and led to the management restructuring.    Mr. Arnault, whose broad retailing, industrial and textile group includes the Christian Dior and Christian Lacroix fashion houses, stepped in during the feud and bought massively. Guinness PLC agreed to take a 40% stake in Mr. Arnault's investment. In less than six months they acquired nearly one-third of the company's shares, the largest single bloc.    Sources said the election of the senior Mr. Arnault to the board chairmanship appeared to shock the Vuitton side, which late last week still thought it had an agreement that the job would go to one of its senior members, Henry Vuitton.    Despite this defeat, the Vuittons retain extensive power within the group. Together, they are the second-largest shareholders, and under the group's decentralized structure they still have broad authority to run the Louis Vuitton side of the business themselves.    The division over the supervisory board chairmanship nevertheless suggests that hard feelings continue within the group, created by merger just a year ago. </TEXT></DOC>
