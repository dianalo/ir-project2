(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Too much cruising along the Modesto stripthat inspired George Lucas to film ``American Graffiti'' has ledcity officials to propose banning it.   City officials have drafted ordinances that would prevent anyonefrom driving by certain checkpoints along McHenry Avenue more thanonce in four hours. Another ordinance would make it illegal toloiter at night along streets in this city 90 miles southeast ofSan Francisco.   The ordinances, which have not yet come before the City Council,were spurred by Police Chief Gerald McKenzie saying up to 5,000cars cruise McHenry some evenings.   ``The threat of civil unrest is very real and demands ourattention and best efforts to avert a disaster,'' McKenzie wrotethe city manager.   Lucas, who grew up in Modesto, based ``American Graffiti'' on afictional night in 1962 of cruising 10th Street and McHenry Avenue.Lucas is famous for the ``Star Wars'' trilogy.   The popularity of the 1973 movie has led to thousands ofyoungsters descending on McHenry the first Saturday evening afterhigh school is out in June to celebrate ``Graffiti Night.''</TEXT></DOC>
