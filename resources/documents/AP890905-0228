Gold prices softened. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, goldbullion for current delivery settled at $359.60 a troy ounce, down$1 from Friday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bidfor gold of $358.60 an ounce, off 65 cents from Friday.   U.S. financial markets were closed Monday for the Labor Dayholiday.   Currency dealers said the dollar started out strong on continuedconfidence that U.S. interest rates would remain firm and could evenmove higher. But the dollar ended off its highs of the day largelydue to profit-taking, they said.   ``There's some pretty good demand out there,'' said Robert Ryan,a senior trader for Irving Trust Co. ``The market likes the dollarbut it thinks it's slightly overbought.''   Traders said the market had little reaction to reported effortsby about a dozen major central banks to drive down the dollar'svalue, including the Federal Reserve, which was said to haveintervened three times.   A recent chain of positive economic data has helped support thedollar by making U.S. securities more attractive to foreigninvestors, thereby increasing the need to convert overseascurrencies into dollars.   Some dealers say the dollar is poised to move higher because theeconomy's apparent strength might prompt the Fed to raise interestrates to quell inflationary pressures.
