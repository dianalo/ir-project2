An A-4 Skyhawk jet carrying the bomb fell off the U.S. aircraftcarrier Ticonderoga about 80 miles from a small island that is partof the Okinawa prefecture, an American military spokesman in Japansaid. The ship was bound from Vietnam to Yokosuka, Japan.   Newsweek magazine initially reported the story, saying the bombdisappeared 70 miles from an inhabited Japanese island. On Monday,Japan made an informal request for information from the UnitedStates.   The case added an irritant to U.S. military relations withOkinawa, a Japanese island where one of the bloodiest battles ofWorld War II was fought. The continued presence of 35,000 Americansoldiers on Okinawa has led to tension and protests about suchproblems as accidents on target ranges.   Asahi, a national newspaper, said in an editorial Wednsday the``incident is of such a nature that we simply cannot let it pass,however long ago it occurred.''   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said privately on Tuesday: ``Thishappened in international waters so we have no right to make a louddemand. We are just asking the United States to give us anexplanation. We are interested and concerned'' about the details.   Other officials said the government did not know the location orcondition of the B-43 bomb and there had been no discussions withthe United States of what to do about it.   Newsweek quoted nuclear expert William Arkin of the Institutefor Policy Studies in Washington as saying the U.S. Navy kept theincident secret until a 1981 Pentagon report listed accidentsinvolving nuclear weapons.   Washington ``did not bring it to our attention'' at the time ofthe report, the Foreign Office official said.   Japan is the only country attacked with nuclear weapons and bansthem from its territory. The lost one-megaton bomb was about 70times as powerful as the one dropped on Hiroshima in August 1945,Kyodo News Service reported.   Arkin was quoted as saying there was little danger ofdetonation, but the 33 pounds of plutonium in the bomb couldthreaten the environment as it deteriorated.   The Ticonderoga, an attack carrier, was on a mission thatincluded readiness to launch a nuclear strike, said a declassifiedU.S. Navy document released by Arkin and the environmental groupGreenpeace.   That raised the possibility of the carrier entering Yokosuka,south of Tokyo, with nuclear arms despite the Japanese ban.   In Washingon on Monday, Arkin said: ``There is no doubt in mymind that U.S. ships still transit Japan with nuclear weaponsaboard.''   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard denied any attemptto conceal what had happened.   ``It was way out to sea in international waters,'' he saidTuesday. ``The weapon went down in 16,000 feet of water. There wasno danger to anyone other than the unfortunate pilot of theaircraft in this incident. There was not then and there is notnow.''   Asked whether he would deny that Navy ships entered Japanesewaters carrying nuclear weapons, Howard replied: ``We are aware ofthe special sentiments of the Japanese people with regard tonuclear weapons. We have faithfully honored our obligations underthe U.S.-Japanese Treaty of Mutual Security and its relatedarrangements, and we'll continue to do so.''   He would not say whether the United States considered that aport call by a warship constituted introducing nuclear weapons toJapan.   Japanese opposition parties and citizens' organizations haveclaimed U.S. Navy ships routinely visit Japanese ports carryingnuclear weapons, with the government's tacit agreement.   Government officials said the United States is not allowed tobring in such weapons without prior consultation, and there havebeen no such consultations.   The Asahi editorial said: ``If the aircraft carrier had dockedat Yokosuka without the accident having taken place, the UnitedStates would have been censured as violating the U.S.-JapanSecurity Treaty'' requiring consultation.   ``Besides, it is hardly conceivable that the Skyhawk in questionwas alone armed with a nuke,'' the paper said. ``Which Japaneseport did the carrier eventually visit after the hydrogen bomb waslost?''   Asking what has become of the bomb, the Asahi editorial saidWednesday: ``Has it not been crushed by the water pressure? Hasradioactive material not leaked from it, bit by bit?''</TEXT></DOC>
