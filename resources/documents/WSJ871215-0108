Blame it on proposed tax-law changes. The changes are aimed primarily at master limited partnerships -- those traded on stock exchanges -- and are designed to prevent corporations from avoiding taxes by restructuring as MLPs. But unless Congress narrows its definition of publicly traded partnerships, the measures also could wipe out the small secondary market in ordinary limited partnerships, which represents virtually the only way for an investor to bail out of such a partnership before it is liquidated and its assets sold.    The proposals are included in revenue-raising measures being drafted by lawmakers as part of the deficit-reduction effort. Both would make many publicly traded partnerships less attractive to investors by subjecting partnership income to corporate tax and eliminating a key tax break for individuals.    The problem, syndicators say, is that the definition of publicly traded partnerships is broad enough -- those whose &quot;interests . . . are readily tradeable on a secondary market (or a substantial equivalent thereof)&quot; -- to include not only master limited partnerships, but also ordinary partnerships in which units change hands in the secondary market.    Many syndicators say they would counter by not allowing partners to sell their units. Most syndicators already reserve the right to prohibit investors from doing so, but they have rarely exercised it in the past, says George Hamilton, president of National Partnership Exchange Inc. in Tampa, Fla.    Rep. Mike Andrews, a Democrat from Texas and a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, says there's &quot;a possibility&quot; the definition will be narrowed in the House-Senate conference on the measure, which is scheduled to begin today. But if the present definition becomes law, &quot;it could kill the partnership secondary market,&quot; says Brent Donaldson, president of Liquidity Fund Investment Corp. in Emeryville, Calif., a big buyer of partnership interests from individual investors.    Under one proposal, passed by the House in October, publicly traded partnerships not involved in real estate or natural resources would be taxed as corporations. The change would apply immediately to any partnerships that hadn't registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Oct. 13; any funds that filed with the SEC by that date wouldn't pay the tax until 1995.    The second measure, passed by the House in October and the Senate last week, would classify any publicly traded partnership's cash distributions to investors as portfolio income, rather than so-called passive income, starting with the current tax year. The change would mean that an investor's income from such partnerships couldn't be offset by losses from other activities that the tax overhaul defined as passive -- generally, business activities where the investor isn't actively involved in management.    Rather, says William Brennan, a Valley Forge, Pa., investment adviser, &quot;losses from a publicly traded syndication that came under the new rules would only offset income from that particular partnership.&quot;    For conventional partnerships, the secondary market is made up of several small investment firms that buy units from disenchanted owners, nearly always at steep discounts, either for their own accounts or to resell to other investors. Although still tiny, the secondary market got a big boost from the 1986 tax overhaul, which eliminated investors' ability to use partnership losses to reduce taxes on ordinary salary and investment income.    Syndicators welcomed the growth because, they say, the secondary market makes partnerships easier to sell by offering investors liquidity. Now they are scrambling to convince Congress to narrow the law to master limited partnerships.    &quot;We've contacted many members of the House and Senate expressing our concern,&quot; says Christopher Davis, president of the Investment Partnership Association, a trade group. Lawmakers say they hope to vote on a final package of tax increases and spending cuts before adjourning for the holidays. </TEXT></DOC>
