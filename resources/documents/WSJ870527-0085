The temporary-personnel and health care services company also said it intends to increase the dividend on common shares 50% by keeping it at five cents each on post-split shares. The split is payable June 9 to stock of record yesterday.    The creation of the new Class B stock is designed to &quot;keep management in control of the company and to ward off possible raiders,&quot; said Frank N. Liguori, president and chief operating officer.    Mr. Liguori said holders of the company's 12.3 million post-split shares outstanding then will be offered the chance to convert their shares to the new Class B shares on a one-for-one basis. The new shares will carry 10 times the voting power of the common shares, but the annual dividend on the new class will be 14 cents a share, instead of 20 cents a share for the common shares. The new shares also won't trade publicly, but will be convertible into common shares on a one-for-one basis.    Mr. Liguori said the company expects that only the Olsten family will convert its shares, in order to enhance its voting control.    Shareholders also approved at the annual meeting yesterday an increase in the number of authorized shares to 50 million from 30 million. About 15 million of the newly authorized shares are Class B shares. </TEXT></DOC>
