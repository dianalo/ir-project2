Usually a buyer from General Electric Co. of Fairfield,Conn., Emirates surprised aerospace analysts by pickingRolls-Royce and gave a boost to efforts to establishRolls-Royce's newly developed Trent engine on the 777.Emirates placed seven firm orders and seven options for thetwinengine 777, Boeing's latest aircraft. The carrier,established in 1985, will start taking deliveries in 1996.</LP><TEXT>   Although the Emirates order isn't one of the largestengine orders received by Rolls-Royce this year, it is seenby analysts as one of the most significant. In the battle forcustomers among the world's three dominant jet engine makers,Rolls-Royce has ranked behind the U.S. giants, GE and UnitedTechnologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney. But by winning theEmirates order, Rolls-Royce snatched a GE customer andfurther bolstered its position in the lucrative market tooutfit wide-body aircraft.   Competition among engine makers has been fierce for marketshare on the new generation of wide-body craft being producedby the world's three large commercial-aircraft manufacturers.Industry analysts predict this segment of the engine marketcould generate $50 billion of business during the next decade-- about half the total civil engine market.   At first, Rolls-Royce appeared to be the odd man out inthe battle. Its hope for fitting McDonnell Douglas Corp.'sMD-11 with the Trent were disappointed when the MD-11's onlycustomer, Air Europe, went out of business earlier this year.Rolls-Royce then abandoned efforts to get its engine on theMD-11.   Rolls-Royce has had better luck with Airbus Industrie'sA-330. Four customers -- about a third -- have chosen theTrent for the A-330, including Cathay Pacific and International Lease Finance Corp.   But the competition to get the engine on the Boeing 777,due to enter service in 1995, has been particularly intense.Rolls-Royce was hurt when it lost longtime customer BritishAirways to GE. Shortly afterward, All Nippon Airways, citingthe British Airways decision, opted for Pratt andamp; Whitneyinstead of its earlier favorite, Rolls-Royce. Rolls-Royce hassince recovered, winning its first order for 777 engines inSeptember from Thai Airways International.</TEXT></DOC>
