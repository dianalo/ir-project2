D.R. ``Doc'' Rice, 83, returned to Detroit to celebrate his rolefour decades ago in jazzing up the treat with a sugary ``creme''filling and a squiggly white line of icing.   The cupcake Hostess introduced on May 10, 1919, was made ofdevil's food cake and hand-covered with vanilla or chocolate icing.Sales were stale by World War II, when rationing restricted theamount and quality of sugar and chocolate.   Enter Rice, a cupcake fancier who developed a fancier cupcake atContinental Baking Co.'s Detroit plant.   St. Louis-based Continental Baking, which owns Hostess, sold 400million cupcakes last year.   Detroit residents bought more than people in any other city.   ``We thought about that a lot and there are several reasons,''Rice said in a telephone interview from Chicago on Tuesday. ``It'swhere we first made them and test-marketed them. The Hostess cakealways has had a good reputation in Detroit. I guess people havegood taste there.''</TEXT><DATELINE>FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A mountain gorilla named Amohoro inAfrica has a new family: 100 junior high school students who raised$1,200 to ``adopt'' her.   The seventh-graders at Cache La Poudre Junior High School onTuesday became the first group of students to adopt a mountaingorilla through the Digit Fund, a program established by the lateprimatologist Dian Fossey.   The students baby-sat, worked odd jobs and solicited donationsfor six weeks to raise the money.   ``You are the first class in the world to ever adopt a gorilla,and you deserve a lot of credit,'' Ruth Keesling, president of theDigit Fund, told the beaming students gathered on bleachers in theschool's gymnasium.   The money, $200 more than the $1,000 the fund requires for anadoption, will go to fight poaching and to pay for research intothe gorillas' behavior and social patterns, Keesling said.   Fossey established the fund, based in the Denver suburb ofEnglewood, in 1978 to garner international support for theendangered gorillas. While lowland gorillas thrive in Africa, thereare only about 280 mountain gorillas left in the world. Fossey'swork inspired the movie ``Gorillas In The Mist.''   The students received a photo of their adopted gorilla, whosename means Peace.</TEXT></DOC>
