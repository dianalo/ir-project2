The Fed is ratcheting up rates because its slow-but-steady stepsto tighten credit so far have failed to prevent inflation fromtaking hold, experts say.   The central bank's interest-rate steering wheel has gotten looserin recent years. So, like someone at the wheel of a carnival arcadedriving game, the Fed may now have to oversteer to get the resultsit wants _ and hope it doesn't cause a crash.   Indeed, rooting out inflation now that it has become establishedwill take measures so tough that there is a chance theyunintentionally could produce a recession, economists say.   ``In the entire last year the Fed acted with so much discretionthat it was almost painful to see. Now people know that they meanbusiness,'' said Francis Schott, chief economist for Equitable LifeAssurance Society in New York.   Schott said there was about a 50-50 chance of a Fed-instigatedrecession, although most other economists have said a downturn thisyear is unlikely.   On Friday, the Federal Reserve signaled its long-term commitmentto a stepped-up inflation fight by raising its discount rate onloans to member banks by half a percentage point to 7 percent, itshighest level since April 1986.   Major banks, which have been squeezed by Fed pressure on othershort-term interest rates, already had begun raising their primelending rate half a percentage point to 11.5 percent.   The hike in the bank rate _ which now is at its highest sinceNovember 1984 _ will boost costs of some adjustable-rate mortgages,home-equity loans, auto dealer inventory loans and other forms ofborrowing tied to the prime.   The Fed's squeeze on credit will drive up lending rates acrossthe board. Auto loans already have gotten more expensive _ theyrange from 11 percent to 13.5 percent nationally, excluding specialincentive rates from automakers _ because of the rising cost offunds for loan issuers.   Any further Fed tightening could push auto loans still higher,said John Andrews, a spokesman for General Motors Acceptance Corp.   Fixed-rate mortgages probably are least affected by the Fedtightening, but they too have risen about 1 percentage point overthe past year.   The national average on 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans islikely to rise another three-quarters of a percentage point incoming months, to the 11.25 percent to 11.75 percent range, beforetrending downward as the Fed gets a grip on inflation, predictedJohn Tuccillo, economist for the National Association of Realtors.   Unfortunately for borrowers, painfully high interest rates arethe only tool the Fed has to control inflation.   If the increases aren't painful, economists say, people andbusinesses will continue to borrow freely, the economy will grow tooquickly and shortages of labor and materials will drive priceshigher.   In January, strong economic growth produced annual consumer priceinflation of 7.2 percent, the highest in two years, the LaborDepartment reported Wednesday.   The Fed's influence on interest rates is less effective incontrolling the economy than it used to be partly because it hasless impact on the housing market. Dampening the housing markettends to ripple through the rest of the economy, from lumbersuppliers to appliance makers.   Former federal limits on interest rates made it uneconomical forbanks and savings institutions to make mortgage loans when theircost of funds got too high. With those caps now gone, mortgage fundsare always available and customers are willing to pay higher rates.   ``'87 and '88 were terrific for home sales'' in spite ofgradually rising rates, said the Realtors' Tuccillo.   Oddly, in the past year, the Fed's very success in establishingits credibility as an inflation fighter undermined its ability tofight inflation.   Investors were so confident of the Fed's ability to whipinflation that they aggressively bought long-term government andcorporate bonds, which are sensitive to inflation. That strongdemand held down long-term interest rates and helped fuel economicgrowth _ not what the Fed wanted.   Now long-term rates are beginning to rise, which should cool offthe economy. One reason is that the Fed finally has raisedshort-term rates so high that investors are switching to short-terminvestments from long-term bonds, said Barry Bosworth, a BrookingsInstitution economist.   Investors also are backing away from long-term bonds due to theloss of some confidence in the Fed's ability to quickly curbinflation. Yields on the bonds are consequently rising, raisinglong-term borrowing costs, and the Fed's objectives are beingaccomplished through the Fed's failure.   ``This is the kind of Machiavellian thinking one has to gothrough,'' Schott said.</TEXT></DOC>
