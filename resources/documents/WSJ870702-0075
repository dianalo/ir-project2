CohenStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> RCICHEMICALS, PLASTICS (CHM)TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   Reichhold Chemicals Inc. said its board rejected as &quot;inadequate&quot; a $52.50-a-share tender offer by Dainippon Ink andamp; Chemicals Inc.    Reichhold, a maker of specialty chemicals used in printing inks, said it plans to explore inquiries from &quot;other parties&quot; that have expressed interest in acquiring the company. The company also said it is studying such other alternatives as a leveraged buyout, recapitalization or restructuring.    A Reichhold spokesman declined to elaborate on what other companies have been in contact with Reichhold representatives. But sources familiar with the company said more than a dozen other chemical concerns have contacted Reichhold representatives since last Thursday, when Tokyo-based Dainippon unveiled its $473 million tender offer.    A source familiar with the company also said that Reichhold, based in White Plains, N.Y., plans to hire attorneys in Washington to &quot;look into Japanese takeovers of American firms.&quot; As hostile bids by Japanese companies for American concerns are extremely rare, U.S. concerns haven't previously solicited the help of politicians to challenge Japanese companies.    Japanese and other foreigners aren't barred from buying most types of American companies. But in the past year, Japanese have taken advantage of the weak dollar to buy billions of dollars of real estate and companies in the U.S., and an increasing number of politicians have been calling for protectionist legislation.    Reichhold said its board -- with one member absent -- voted 9-0 to spurn the bid. C. Robert Powell, chairman and chief executive officer, said &quot;our investment banker has confirmed what we knew: That the company is worth much more than Dainippon is offering.&quot;    First Boston Corp., Reichhold's investment banker, declined comment on its valuation of the company.    Stock buyers appear to be betting that the company will be sold at a significantly higher price than Dainippon is offering. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Reichhold closed at $63.125, up $2.375.    A spokesman for Dainippon said the company didn't have any immediate comment on the action by Reichhold's board. A source close to Dainippon said, however, that the company had sent a letter to Reichhold directors late yesterday telling the board that Dainippon would like to be considered equally among the potential buyers of Reichhold.    Mr. Powell said &quot;our board was profoundly disappointed at the manner in which Dainippon approached their discussions with us and their launching of a surprise offer at a ludicrous price in the midst of our talks.&quot;    Reichhold hadn't previously acknowledged that there were any talks. However, as previously reported, Dainippon disclosed in its tender offer document last week that it had several discussions with Mr. Powell and his representatives from March through late June.    A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Reichhold yesterday disclosed that Mr. Powell hadn't told Reichhold directors of his discussions with Dainippon until June 9. That day, Shigekuni Kawamura, president of Dainippon, sent a letter to Mr. Powell proposing to buy Reichhold for $50 a share.    The filing also showed that besides First Boston, Reichhold had also retained Dillon, Read andamp; Co. to assist with matters relating to the Dainippon bid. Dillon Read had represented Mr. Powell in his meetings with Dainippon officials.    First Boston stands to earn $1 million in fees plus 1% of the purchase price of Reichhold if the company is sold. Reichhold will pay Dillon Read a fee of $100,000 and 0.45% of the purchase price.    Analysts said Mr. Powell last year forecast rosy earnings for Reichhold, promising that the company's restructuring moves over the past five years would finally pay off. Those moves included sales of businesses, plant modernizations and a shift in Reichhold's business focus.    But earnings forecasts became cloudier several months ago, when prices for many of the raw materials used for Reichhold's products began to soar. Reichhold officials recently began telling analysts that the results of the restructuring won't be truly apparent until 1988. Industry analysts say the company has become a vulnerable target in recent months because its performance has continued to lag behind its competitors.    For 1986, Reichhold reported net income of $15.9 million, or $2.13 a share, on sales of $765.6 million. Profit included a net gain of $7.5 million from the sale of certain businesses and the restructuring program. In the previous year, Reichhold had a loss of $28.4 million, largely because of restructuring costs. Sales for 1985 were $822.5 million. </TEXT></DOC>
