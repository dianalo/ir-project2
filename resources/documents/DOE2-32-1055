In the event of an accident, these gases mat be releasedto the atmosphere and pose hazards to public and occupational safetyand health. This paper outlines an approach for designing systems forthe control of these releases given the uncertainty in release conditionsand lack of data on the chemical systems involved. Accidental releasesof these gases in storage cabinets can be controlled by either a venturiand packed-bed scrubber and carbon adsorption bed, or containment scrubbingequipment followed by carbon adsorption. These systems can effectivelyreduce toxic gas emissions to levels needed to protect public health.The costs of these controls ({approximately}$0. 012/W{sub p}) are smallin comparison with current ({approximately}$6/W{sub p}) and projected({approximately}$1/W{sub p}) production costs. 7 refs., 2 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
