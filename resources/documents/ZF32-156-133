VAX8700 and 8550 computers in Washington.andP;  From there the information istransferred to Martinsburg through the same type of network.andM;The military accesses the system from the Defense Medical RegulatingInformation System at Scott Air Force Base, Ill., through modems connected toMartinsburg.andM;Although the immediate threat of large loads of casualties is past, thesystem remains in effect, Baker said.andM;Mumps was a very appropriate language for the system, Baker said.andP;  &quot;Itsstrength is its ability to store character strings and to, in a very quickfashion, produce the types of input routines that are required,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
