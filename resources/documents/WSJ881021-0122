The deluge of proposed takeovers and leveraged buy-outs presents a quandary for more and more investors: What should they do when stocks they own go into play?    Sell immediately? That nails down a gain, but it could mean missing a better offer soon to come. Hold on for more? That could be great, but what if the deal falls through?    Don't get too upset, though. The first thing to do is enjoy the problem. In most cases, investors are bound to make money. The question is, how much?    &quot;My basic philosophy would be along the lines of Woody Allen -- take the money and run,&quot; says Robert Nurock, editor of the Astute Investor, a Paoli, Pa., stockmarket newsletter. &quot;A gift horse has delivered something you didn't expect. I would not be too greedy.&quot;    Mr. Nurock thinks investors should sell half their holding unless they have a strong reason to believe a better bid will come down the pike soon.    &quot;See where the stock trades the first day or so,&quot; Mr. Nurock says. &quot;I'd take half my money out unless the stock price goes above the offering price right away. The other 50% I would be willing to hang on to, awaiting new developments.&quot;    Mr. Nurock cites the case of Wickes Cos. as an example of why investors shouldn't get too greedy. In August, the stock was trading at about $9. The company announced a plan to go private through a leveraged buy-out, and the stock surged to about $14, which was well above the proposed buy-out price.    When a stock trades above a proposed deal price, it means investors expect someone to wade in with a higher offer. Not only did that not happen with Wickes, but management last week called off the buyout. The stock dropped, closing yesterday at $7.75 a share-up 25 cents in a strongly rising market.    But sometimes it pays to be bold. Cary Retlin, a market strategist with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York, says investors &quot;should always wait a minimum of a few days&quot; before selling out.    That will give them time to see whether the company's management proposes a leveraged buy-out or seeks a different potential acquirer as a &quot;white knight.&quot; And there's little risk in waiting a week or so, Mr. Retlin argues, because over the past few months, few deals have unraveled that quickly.    The potential advantage of patience can be clearly seen in what's happened to Macmillan Inc. Back in May, when the stock was selling for a little over $50 a share, a proposed $64-a-share offer from Robert M. Bass Group put the company into play. But in the weeks since, a series of bids and counterbids -- involving an internal restructuring plan, Maxwell Communication Corp. and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. -- has driven the price up dramatically. Yesterday, it closed at $88.125, up 25 cents.    Selling at the market price as soon as a deal is proposed &quot;would certainly be the conservative thing,&quot; says Robert Farrell, chief market analyst for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. &quot;If Pillsbury goes from $37 to $60, you'd feel pretty bad if the deal didn't go through and you end up at $37 again.&quot; (Grand Metropolitan Co. of Great Britain is attempting to take over Pillsbury Co. for $5.23 billion, or $60 a share.)    But Mr. Farrell says that in the past year or two, most proposed takeovers have either been completed or led to a better offer. &quot;It's pretty much paid to stay (invested) until you saw whether there was a rival bid coming in,&quot; he says.    Each deal needs to be evaluated separately, Mr. Farrell says, to determine how likely it is to be completed and how likely it is that a rival bid will emerge. To ascertain those things, he and others suggest watching several factors.    What's the spread? Stocks usually trade about 1% to 5% below a proposed takeover price, reflecting the uncertainty involved and the wait for the payoff. The typical spread has widened toward the high end of that range and even gone beyond it in the past few weeks as arbitragers and other takeover speculators have confronted a glut of potential deals.    In Mr. Nurock's view, the smaller the discount when a bid is announced, the more likely it is that a better bid is coming. If the stock trades above the bid price, he says, it's an even better sign.    Some investors are tempted to hop in and &quot;play the spread.&quot; They buy a stock after a proposal is announced, hoping to make at least the amount of the spread, and much more if a bidding war ensues. Most investment professionals agree, however, that buying after the announcement is a high-risk strategy, as is chasing rumors about which company may be next to attract a bid.    Is the takeover offer friendly? &quot;When it's unfriendly, the deal is possibly not going to work,&quot; Mr. Farrell says. But Mr. Retlin points out that an unfriendly overture often drives the prey into the arms of another acquirer.    What's the financing? If the buyer is in a position to pay cash, a deal is much more likely to go through. News accounts of takeover attempts often give investors some idea about the financing.    What's the past price action? If a stock has already run up considerably in the weeks or months before the first bid is announced, it may mean that the company has quietly been for sale for some time. In that case, Mr. Retlin says, management probably won't fight off a takeover, but there may be less potential profit for investors who hold on. </TEXT></DOC>
