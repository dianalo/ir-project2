(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Singer Lee Greenwood, who wrote thepatriotic song ``God Bless the USA,'' has performed at the WhiteHouse four times, and has become one of President Bush's favoriteentertainers.   Greenwood, the Country Music Association's male vocalist of theyear in 1983 and 1984, was also a favorite of former PresidentReagan. The singer's popularity at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue carriedover into the Bush administration. He spent Easter weekend with Bushat Camp David.   ``God Bless the USA'' was used extensively by Reagan during the1984 presidential campaign. Greenwood also sang it at Bush campaignappearances in the 1988 campaign, and also performed it at variousinauguration events.   During his Easter weekend with Bush, Greenwood recalled seeingsome of the president's record collection.   ``He has the Oak Ridge Boys, Loretta Lynn, I believe GeorgeStrait and myself,'' he said. ``The tapes I saw at Camp David werejust those acts. I didn't see any others; there was nothing butcountry music and just those selected artists.''   The 1983 ``God Bless the USA'' salutes those who have dieddefending the United States, and cites American pride.   As a result of the song, Greenwood also has become a top act atmilitary bases. He has performed on four USO tours, including aneight-day tour around the world with comedian Bob Hope in 1987. Atthe request of the White House, Greenwood will do another one thisChristmas.   Greenwood, a native of Los Angeles, was born to parents who splitup when he was a year old. He was raised by his grandparents on asmall chicken farm near Sacramento, Calif., and was a member of therock 'n' roll group the Young Rascals before they became famous.   He spent about 10 years as a casino dealer and performer in LasVegas until becoming a country music star in the early 1980s.   ``I was raised without much money,'' the 46-year-old singer saidin an interview at his Nashville office. ``To raise to the height ofbeing honored at the residence of the head of state says a lot forthis country and the system. It's a great honor for me.''   ``I'm lucky, I guess,'' he said. ``It says a lot about America tobe able to work into that position.''   His other hit records include ``IOU,'' ``Dixie Road,'' ``You'veGot a Good Love Coming,'' ``It Turns Me Inside Out'' and ``Ring onHer Finger, Time on Her Hands.''   Blessed with a husky voice and driving ambition, he won a Grammyaward for ``IOU.'' ``God Bless the USA'' was voted song of the yearby the CMA in 1985.   Greenwood said ``God Bless the USA'' has outpaced other aspectsof his career. Reagan once said the song ``lifted the spirit ofAmerica to a new place it had never been before.''   ``It stands so high above everything else I've done,'' Greenwoodsaid. ``It is a powerful piece of material and it's almostimpossible for me to do a show without it. We're a very difficultact to follow just because of that piece of material.''   Earlier this year, he issued a revised version, ``God BlessCanada,'' changing the lyrics to salute Canada. Larry Gatlin and theGatlin Brothers, three of his country music counterparts, sangharmony.   Greenwood, looking to expand his career further, is now turningto movies. He plans to be involved in three motion pictures, actingin two and writing songs for all three. The first is ``Stranglehold:Delta Force II,'' starring Chuck Norris. The other two are a CivilWar movie and a film about the Vietnam war. He said he will havelimited roles in the last two.   ``I'm under no pressure to be a great actor,'' Greenwood said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions Sept 22-24</NOTE></DOC>
