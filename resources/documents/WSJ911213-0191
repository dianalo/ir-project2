The denial came in a statement from the Saudi oilminister, Hisham Nazer, and was issued by the official SaudiPress Agency.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Nazer cited oil-market &quot;speculation&quot; that the kingdomhas increased production to maintain a low price &quot;forpolitical reasons to help countries in overcoming theeconomic crisis.&quot;   Calling such speculation &quot;baseless,&quot; Mr. Nazer added: &quot;Theinterest of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the oil exportingcountries lies in maintaining {a} balance and not floodingthe market.&quot;   Oil markets have weakened recently on indications that theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may not cutoutput sufficiently in the months ahead to prevent an oilglut. Many expect an oversupply of oil next year -- byspring, if not sooner -- unless Saudi Arabia and otherleading producers reduce output as much as two millionbarrels a day.   It's generally assumed such cuts will be needed to makeroom for a resumption of exports by Iraq and Kuwait and toallow for the seasonal slump in demand during the secondquarter. Underscoring the oil-market concern that is sharedby some oil ministers has been the recent drop in prices. Thenear-month price of crude rose yesterday in U.S. futurestrading 45 cents to $19.96 a barrel, but that's still $4 abarrel below the level of only a few weeks ago.   Closer to home for OPEC is the fall in the average priceof the basket of seven crudes it uses as a benchmark. Only amonth ago, the average was near the $21 a barrel the oilministers have set as an OPEC reference. By last week, theaverage price of the basket was $18.30 a barrel.   Neither Iraq nor Kuwait is currently a significant factorin world oil markets. Still, OPEC's output now exceeds 24million barrels a day, the highest level since the PersianGulf crisis began in August 1990 with Iraq's invasion ofKuwait. Saudi Arabia accounts for more than one-third ofOPEC's output.   The kingdom had the spare capacity to increase productionthe most in the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis,singlehandedly making up 75% of the four million barrels ofoil a day that was needed to offset lost Iraqi and Kuwaitioutput. Saudi Arabia still produces 8.5 million barrels a day-- which Mr. Nazer now considers to be the kingdom's &quot;quota&quot;-- and claims a capacity of nine million barrels daily.   Saudi officials have made clear repeatedly that they willnever retreat to their prior limit of 5.4 million barrels,their quota under the system that was scrapped by OPEC whenthe Persian Gulf crisis began. They have suggested, however,that the kingdom may consider reducing output to about eightmillion barrels a day in next year's second quarter if othersmake like percentage cuts.   Still, Saudi Arabia has come under increasing criticism inrecent months from other OPEC members because of its stubbornrefusal to discuss any new output restrictions for 1992. Mr.Nazer was at the center of controversy at a September meetingof the cartel in Geneva. In the more recent meeting of theoil ministers last month in Vienna, there was much lessacrimony. Some other oil ministers suggested that the kingdomhad &quot;signaled&quot; it would consider some move to curb its oilflow for 1992's second quarter. The oil ministers havescheduled their next meeting for Feb. 12 in Geneva.   Mr. Nazer showed increasing irritation with reporters atthe Vienna meeting, particularly over the constantquestioning about whether Saudi Arabia would eventually cutits output. In reply to questions about the kingdom'scapacity, he reconfirmed a longstanding Saudi plan to boostits production ability to 10 million barrels a day by 1995.But then he chastised reporters for quoting him as sayingSaudi Arabia would raise its output.   In yesterday's statement, Mr. Nazer described publishedreports about Saudi production capacity as &quot;misguided.&quot; Hesaid Saudi Arabia would maintain the production level &quot;thathas been agreed upon and will not push out any more thanthat.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
