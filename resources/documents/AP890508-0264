Investigators worked for six months to obtain evidence extendingback almost 10 years, said Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., andJohn McCain, R-Ariz.   They said the names of the companies would be revealed athearings, beginning Tuesday, by the special investigative unit ofthe Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, which DeConciniheads.   The senators said that the oil companies under investigationaren't among the top seven corporations. They are independent,multimillion-dollar ``middle-level'' companies, the senators added.   Earl Ross, spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, saidnone of the companies involved are members of his organization, thelargest oil trade association in the country. He said the institutesupplied the committee with technical information on how to measureoil.   DeConcini said committee's staff examined 700,000 pages ofsubpoenaed documents. He said undercover investigators went intothe oil fields and saw theft taking place.   McCain said millions of dollars in royalities are not going tothe rightful people. He and Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., are the othertwo members of the special investigative committee.   ``To a poor native American, being deprived of only a fewdollars is significant,'' McCain said.   DeConcini said some of the committee's findings will be turnedover the Justice Department.   Ken Ballen, chief counsel for the committee, said two issues areinvolved _ one is actual theft of oil from wells, the other isunderpayment of royalties.   ``It's a sophisticated kind of theft,'' said Ballen. He saidthat companies ``mismeasure'' the amount of oil they take and areable to get away with it because the areas are so remote thatnobody is watching.   DeConcini said investigators hid behind bushes to observe thetheft taking place.   McCain said the goal of the committee is to determine how wellthe federal government is fufilling its responsibility to theIndians.   ``Our job is to review policies, programs and management so wecan recommend changes so problems won't happen again,'' he said.   In February, the special committee held three weeks of hearingsfocusing on contracting fraud, child abuse and organized crime onIndian reservations and among those doing business with them.   The senators said that they will spend this week on oilcompanies and next week on problems within the Indian HealthService.   Both senators said the hearings on the health service wouldreveal ``gross mismanagement.''   DeConcini called the federal agency's approach to Indian healthcare a ``tragedy of all tragedies.''   He said the standard at the health service was ``less than thenorm for the nation.''   DeConcini said he expected to have a report on all of thecommittee's findings by October.</TEXT></DOC>
