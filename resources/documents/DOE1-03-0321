In the first group,the animals were irradiated by 4 fractions of 4 different daily doses; 4.7 Gy, 5.7 Gy, 6.6 Gy and 7.4 Gy. Each dose corresponds to 30 Gy,40 Gy, 50 Gy and 60 Gy by ordinary 2 Gy-a-day irradiation respectivelyin the estimation of TDF value. Degree of radiation injury and recoveryof the parotid glands was examined histologically, and the area ratio(acini/total gland) was calculated at 1, 3 and 6 months after the completionof irradiation. In the second group, the animals were irradiated by thefollowing schedule ; 10 fractions of 3.6 Gy daily (I-group) and 20 fractionsof 1.8 Gy (II a-group), 2.2 Gy (II b-group) and 2.9 Gy (II c-group) twice-a-day,for 2 weeks, 5 days per week. Histological changes of parotid glandsthe irradiation, such as collapse of acini, degeneration of acinar cells,dilatation of ducts, fibrosis and fatty replacement were found. Thesechanges increased corresponding to the absorbed dose. In 60 Gy-groupthe area ratio (acini/total gland) decreased with time, 1, 3 and 6 monthsafter the irradiation (40 %, 20 % and 10 % of the control group, respectively),while, there was no remarkable change in 50 Gy-group (60 %) and 40 Gy-group(70 - 80 %). Whereas the area ratio in 30 Gy-group decreased at 1 and3 months (80 - 85 %), it increased up to the nearly equal level of thecontrol group at 6 months after the irradiation. It was suggested thatthe borderline dose which allowed the salivary gland to recover fromradiation injury existed between 30 Gy and 40 Gy. The area ratio of IIb-group at 1 and 3 months after the irradiation (50 %, 48 %) was nearlyequal to that of I-group (53 %, 57 %). While the area ratio of II a-group(71 %, 73 %) was larger than that of I-group with a statistical significance.(J.P.N.).</TEXT></DOC>
