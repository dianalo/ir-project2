In Ontario, itsapplications could range from allowing commercial production from shut-ingas wells, to providing a natural gas supply to remote mining and loggingfacilities. Since Ontario produces only a small percentage of its totalnatural gas consumption and the remainder must be imported through verylong and costly transmission lines, the benefits of increased provincialproduction are obvious. From a consumption standpoint, any Ontario industrywould profit from having an abundant, clean-burning fuel available ata competitive price. This paper describes a natural gas transportationsystem which employs a highly portable, low capital cost concept to permitnatural gas transportation service to be extended to producing and consumingcommunities that would otherwise not be considered for connection bypipeline. The system consists of gas processing equipment, compression,loading and unloading apparatus, and a compressed gas storage and transportmedium. It can be adapted for use in truck, rail or water-borne configurations.A wide variety of potential applications are presented along with relevanttechnical and economic parameters. Figures are shown at the end of thepaper. 3 refs., 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
