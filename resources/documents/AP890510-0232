Tracking the trend in interest rates, many financialinstitutions have been boosting the rates or fees on standardcredit cards for the first time in several months. Some areshrinking or scrapping grace periods.   The rate rise began late last year but has been particularlynoticeable lately with some of the nation's largest banks andthrifts announcing changes.   As of June 1, for instance, two of the largest bank credit cardissuers, Chase Manhattan Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.,plan to raise rates on some types of Mastercard and Visa cards.   Chase's rate will go to 19.8 percent from 17.5 percent onstandard cards, the first increase in about two years.Manufacturers Hanover will hike some standard card rates to 19.8percent from 17.8 percent for the first time since October 1985.   John C. Pollock III, editor and publisher of Iselin, N.J.-basedBank Credit Card Observer, said the majority of the 200 banks hispublication regularly surveys has raised card rates since January.The average rate among those institutions now stands at 17.78percent, he said, up from 17.61 percent just three months ago. Theprime stands at 11.5 percent.   Financial institutions have defended the high rates as necessaryto cover costs and fraud. They've also called the move a reactionto higher interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve torestrain inflation.   Credit-card using consumers themselves have been cutting intobank profits by paying the full balance at the end of the month inincreasing numbers, about 40 percent in 1988 vs. 37 percent in 1987.   ``With credit cards there's a high degree of administration costas opposed to your plain vanilla loan,'' said Chase spokesman KenMills. ``There are literally hundreds of small transactions ascards are used.''   Elgie Holstein, director of Bankcard Holders of America, aconsumer group based in Herndon, Va., said he doesn't dispute that,but says the spread between banks' cost of funds and what theycharge credit card customers is excessive.   ``It costs banks about 7 percent for money they're lending outat 18 to 20 percent,'' he said.   Consumers can shop for better deals by doing some homework, andthe government will make it easier Aug. 31.   That's when a new law takes full effect forcing all card issuersto supply complete credit terms, such as the interest rates, feesand grace periods, on applications and solicitations. Theypreviously had been permitted to delay the release of suchinformation until the card was issued.   Consumer groups are hoping the disclosure law will make creditcard rates _ historically high compared with other loan rates _more competitive, especially if banks and thrifts must advertisethem.   Those who tend to carry over their balances should shop for thelowest rates, while those who pay them promptly are better offseeking institutions offering no or low annual fees.   ``Many Americans aren't aware that you can easily go out ofstate'' to find the best deal, said Robert K. Heady, editor of BankRate Monitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla., publication that tracksconventional credit card rates nationwide.   Bank Rate Monitor, Bank Credit Card Observer and BankcardHolders of America are among organizations that provide lists ofbest deals in credit cards for a fee.   Bank Rate Monitor said the lowest rate for those carryingbalances is at Arkansas Federal Savings Bank in Little Rock, Ark.,which had an 11.88 percent annual rate as of May 3.   NCNB offered one of the best all-round deals, with no annual feeand a 13.90 percent variable rate, Bank Rate Monitor said.   Others with no fees, it said, included: Amalgamated Trust andSavings Bank in Chicago; Dauphin Deposit Bank andamp; Trust inHarrisburg, Pa.; Security Bank andamp; Trust in Southgate, Mich.; andBeverly Bank in Chicago.   Consumers also should scrutinize credit card fees, which havebeen creeping up, and grace periods, or the time before lenderscharge interest on unpaid bills. Grace periods range from 0 to 30days.   Experts say in recent months some institutions have eliminatedor trimmed grace periods. In some cases, the grace period wasrevised to begin after a purchase is made instead of when a bill issent.   ``By the time you receive your bill you may be subject to aninterest charge,'' Pollock said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday May 11</NOTE></DOC>
