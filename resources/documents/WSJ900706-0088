But while a carbon taxsounds good in theory, practice might be another story.   Recent converts to free-market principles, such as theNational Wildlife Federation, support a carbon tax as a fixto the global warming problem that would work far moresmoothly than complex command-and-control regulations oncarbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Auto makers,truckers and other industries heavily dependent on cheaptransportation fuels see the tax as a way to short-circuit agasoline tax increase, shifting the burden to otherindustries that also are major producers of carbon dioxide.</LP><TEXT>   The White House has not taken a position on carbon taxes,but the &quot;troika&quot; -- Chief of Staff John Sununu; RichardDarman, director of the Office of Management and Budget; andMichael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers-- is intrigued by such taxes. This year's Council ofEconomic Advisers annual report, for example, devotesconsiderable attention to the merits of market-tuned emissiontaxes.   Understandably, opponents of carbon taxes include the coaland electric industries and the big energy producing andconsuming states. They fear that legislation introduced lastmonth by Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.) could become an easyvehicle by which the House Ways and Means Committee couldspeed the tax through. They note that it wasn't until thistime last year that the notion of a chlorofluorocarbon taxwas introduced; six months later it had passed and gone intoeffect.   The Stark bill would tax coal at $15 a ton, petroleum at$3.25 a barrel and natural gas at 40 cents per thousand cubicfeet. Unlike the very simple chlorofluorocarbon tax levied onDu Pont and the small number of CFC producers, a carbon taxwould by its nature be broad-based and require a complexallocation of responsibilities. If applied equitably, itcould be levied at the source -- the coal mine, for example-- and on the end-user.   Among the drawbacks of a carbon tax:   -- It would fall more heavily on some parts of the countrythan others. Western coal- and oil-producing regions andMidwestern coal-burning regions would both be hit hard.   -- Domestic coal, which supplies 60% of America'selectricity and will be even more crucial in the futureunless nuclear power is revived, would be hitdisproportionately hard if a tax is levied that does notconsider environmental-control technologies that alter actualemissions. Coal exports could be mortally wounded.   -- A carbon tax could inadvertently encourage more importsof oil. Swapping part of the budget deficit for a largertrade deficit may not be prudent policy.   -- A U.S.-only tax could further reduce Americancompetitiveness.   -- Many utilities are scampering to finance billions ofdollars in upgrades to meet the acid-rain provisions of theClean Air Act legislation that Congress is expected tofinally pass this fall. These same utilities would be themost likely candidates to pay a hefty carbon tax.   -- A carbon tax -- if not set at the right level, tied tochanging energy prices and to capital costs -- might not leadto significant carbon dioxide cuts if industry decided it wascheaper to pay a tax than to clean up older plants. Insteadof encouraging energy efficiency, it could bias the energyindustry against new capital investments.   -- While a carbon tax might reduce overall carbon dioxideemissions, it would not provide crucial incentives for theU.S. and other nations to engage in reforestation and otherenvironmental goals.   -- Carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas. Ameaningful first response to global climate change is todevelop a greenhouse-gas index that compares the impacts ofvarious gases on the environment and allows countries toestablish their own priorities among the various greenhousegases -- including CFCs, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrousoxide.   -- Finally, before Congress and the administration moveany farther down the carbon-tax path, they must earmark therevenue for environmental and energy projects. More likely,the revenue would go for increased government spending inother areas.   A carefully constructed strategy makes sense once we knowmore about global warming and the pacing of necessaryactions. And a carefully constructed increase in taxes alsomakes sense. It could be devastating to the U.S., however, toget carried away by a naive belief that fixing the deficitand the environment is only a matter of working out a fewmechanical details at some late-night congressionalconference.   ---   Mr. Gale is president of the Washington InternationalEnergy Group, a consultant to U.S. and international energycompanies.
