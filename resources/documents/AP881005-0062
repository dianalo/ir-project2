Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, and a seniorofficer claimed investigators were closing in on the renegadeleader of last year's bloody coup attempt.   Col. Manuel Oxales, deputy military commander of Manila, toldreporters former Master Sgt. Godofredo Gamboa was arrested earlytoday during a raid on his home in suburban Caloocan City.   Meanwhile, President Corazon Aquino acknowledged that hergovernment had failed to resolve many of the country's problems andrestore social justice as promised after the Marcos administrationcollapsed.   Oxales said the raiders also seized a .45 caliber pistol andassorted ammunition. Gamboa, a former counterintelligence agent,denied he was involved in any attempts to topple Mrs. Aquino.   But Oxales claimed Gamboa, who faces illegal weapons charges,was a ``close contact man'' of Honasan, renegade leader of the Aug.28, 1987, coup attempt.   At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded inthe failed coup.   ``We are closely following the leads we are receiving, and weare closing in on `Gringo,''' Oxales said. ``To get Honasan, we aregetting those people who are close to him.''   On Monday, police arrested three renegade soldiers sought in thefailed coup and seized $5,000 dollars in pesos which Brig. Gen.Rodolfo Biazon said was apparently earmarked to finance anothercoup attempt.   Oxales said information given by one of the three, Capt.Francisco Baula, helped lead to today's arrest. He did notelaborate.   Today's arrest brought to 74 the number of alleged right-wingextremists taken into custody in recent weeks. They include keyofficers who helped seize military and media facilities in Manilaand central Luzon during Honasan's coup attempt.   Honasan was arrested last December but escaped from a prisonship in Manila Bay the following April. Honasan played a key rolein the February 1986 military-civilian revolt which toppledPresident Ferdinand Marcos and propelled Mrs. Aquino to office.   But Honasan became disillusioned with Mrs. Aquino because of heralleged failure to crush the Communist rebellion and rid thegovernment of corruption.   Mrs. Aquino acknowledged certain failings during an emotionaleulogy for Joaquin ``Chino'' Roces, a newspaper publisher whoconvinced her to run for office but two years later rebuked heradministration publicly for its failures.   Roces, a leader in the struggle against Marcos, died Friday ofcancer at the age of 75. After receiving the Legion of Honor fromMrs. Aquino last July, Roces publicly chided her for failing toestablish a ``new moral order'' after the Marcos governmentcollapsed.   ``It hurt when he said it, but it had to be said,'' Mrs. Aquinosaid, her voice breaking with emotion. ``And he was one with themoral authority to say it. He has warned us that we, the friends ofdemocracy, shall have a worse time of it than the clear enemies ofthe people if we fail the people.''   The Aquino government has faced growing criticism in the pressover alleged corruption, mismanagement and the promotion ofofficials chosen more for their loyalty to the administration thantheir qualifications.   In another development, the Philippine Constabulary announcedtoday it had seized a Chinese research vessel off eastern Luzonafter inspectors found weapons and ammunition aboard.   The Science Research Vessel No. 1 was detained Monday offCasiguran after three machine guns, eight assault rifles, twosemi-automatic rifles and 4,850 rounds of machine gun ammunitionwere found aboard, Capt. Edgardo Ingusan of the 119th PhilippineConstabulary Company said.   Communist rebels operate in the remote area, which has fewharbors and inadequate roads.   In Manila, a Chinese embassy spokesman said the vessel droppedanchor off Casiguran to escape a tropical storm and the weaponswere on board for self-defense.   China maintains diplomatic relations with the Philippines. LastApril, Mrs. Aquino visited China and was assured by Chinese leaderDeng Xiaoping of his government's support for her.</TEXT></DOC>
