Lloyd, 5/4/89, KFA-0275</T3>Michael G. Lloyd filed an Appeal from a determination issued by the DOE'sOak Ridge Operations Office in which the Office withheld a doument entitled``Case Analysis and Review'' in its entirety pursuant to subsection (d)(5)of the Privacy Act, which exempts from disclosure ``any information compiledin reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.'' 5 U.S.C.andSection; 522a(d)(5). In denying Lloyd's Appeal, the DOE determined thatthe document at issue was created in anticipation of civil litigation andtherefore properly withheld pursuant to subsection (d)(5). In making thatdetermination, the DOE found that the fact that the Office and Lloyd subsequentlyresolved the matter at issue did not strip the document of its exempt statusunder the Privacy Act.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>The Schenectady Gazette, 5/4/89, KFA-0274</T3>The Schenectady Gazette filed an Appeal from a determination by the DOE'sNaval Reactors Program (NRP) denying the Gazette's Freedom of InformationAct (FOIA) request for five documents. The NRP determined that portionsof the five documents were properly withheld pursuant to Exemptions 3,4, and 5. The appellant only challenged the portion of the determinationthat concerned Exemption 5. The DOE found that the portions of the documentswithheld pursuant to Exemption 5 were properly withheld, because were partof the delibertative process or because they were nonsegregable factualmaterials. Accordingly, the Appeal was denied.<ITAG tagnum="84">Supplemental Order</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Research Fuels, Inc., Oasis Petroleum Corporation, 5/3/89, HCX-0100,KER-0013, KEZ-0095, KER-0051</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning three motions related toa consolidated case remanded to the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA)by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texasand a Petition for Special Redress filed with OHA pursuant to the termsof an order issued by the United States District Court for the Middle Districtof Florida. The three motions all pertain to a Decision and Order issuedby OHA in 1986, <T3>Lucky Stores, Inc./Research Fuels, Inc., </T3>14 DOE andpara;82,505 (1986).Those motions are the following: 1) a motion to Strike certain portionsof the 1986 Decision; 2) a Motion for Reconsideration of other portionsof the 1986 Decision; and 3) a Motion for Modification of the 1986 Decisionand for other Forms of Relief. The filing of the first two motions describedabove was precipitated by an order issued by the Texas district court vacatingportions of the 1986 Decision.In considering the Motion to Strike, the DOE recalled that the consolidatedcase remanded to OHA from the Texas district court was separate and distinctfrom the case referred to OHA by the Florida district court. Viewing thetwo court proceedings in this way, the DOE found that the Motion to Strikeshould be granted only insofar as it pertained to or affected the two actionsremanded to OHA from the Texas district court. The DOE denied the motioninsofar as it pertained to or affected the matter referred to the DOE fromthe Florida district court. The DOE explained that its decision to leaveits 1986 Decision intact for the Florida court was not one made in flagrantdisregard for the Texas court's Order to Vacate. Rather, it was a decisionmade in recognition of the Florida court's interest in the integrity ofthe 1986 Decision. The DOE decided that it was for the Florida court, notOHA, to determine the collateral effect, if any, of the Texas court's Orderto Vacate on the litigation pending before the Florida court.The DOE next denied in its entirety the Motion for Reconsideration. Withrespect to the Texas remand proceeding, DOE found that those portions ofthe 1986 Decision which it struck for purposes of the Texas remand casesin no way served as legal or factual predictes for the other portions ofthe Decision which DOE left intact. The DOE therefore found there to beno basis to ``reconsider'' its 1986 Decision and strike the remaining portionsof that Decision.With respect to the Motion as it pertained to the Florida litigation, theDOE observed that the reconsideration request was contingent upon the unconditionalgranting of the Motion to Strike. Inasmuch as the DOE denied the Motionto Strike as it pertained to the Florida litigation, the DOE determinedthat the Motion for Reconsideration directed toward the Florida forum mustfail as well. The DOE further opined that even if the Motion for Reconsiderationdid not depend on the unconditional granting of the Motion to Strike, themotion could not prevail because it, like the Motion to Strike, could notbe used as a procedural vehicle to deprive the Florida court of an opportunityto evaluate independently the 1986 Decision in its entirety.The DOE also decided, <T3>sua sponte, </T3>to dismiss Case No. HCX-0100 which concerned the contemplatedremedial phase of the proceeding underlying the 1986 Decision. DOE explainedthat the administrative proceeding which culminated in issuance of the1986 Decision became moot after the Texas district court distributed themonies held in several escrow accounts under its control. OHA would havedetermined in the remedial phase of Case No. HCX-0100 the proper recipientsof all or a portion of those escrow accounts.Finally, the DOE dismissed the Motion for Modification and Other Formsof Relief on the basis that the motion concerned the administrative proceedingwhich had been rendered moot as the result of action taken by the Texasdistrict court.<ITAG tagnum="84">Refund Applications</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>A.B.

All four applicants were retailersof petroleum products during the period August 19, 1973 through January27, 1981. Because none of the applicants demonstrated that they were injureddue to the crude oil overcharges, they were found ineligible for crudeoil refunds. Accordingly, their Applications for Refund were denied.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Aminoil U.S.A.

The refunds grantedin this Decision totaled $18,120.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Boise Cascade Corp. et. al., 5/4/89, RF272-67314 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying Motions for Reconsiderationand Applications for Refund filed by Boise Cascade Corporation, PackagingCorporation of America, and Burlington Industries, Inc. Each of these firmspreviously had submitted Applications for Refund in both the crude oilSubpart V proceedings as well as the Surface Transporter (ST) or Rail andWater Transporter (RWT) refund proceedings conducted pursuant to the StripperWell Settlement Agreement. For each applicant, the DOE had granted itsST or RWT claim and denied the crude oil claim. In each case, the DOE determinedthat the firms had irrevocably waived any rights they might have had toa crude oil refund by submitting valid ST or RWT waivers. Each firm fileda Motion for Reconsideration of those Decisions, as well as a contingentApplication for Refund in the crude oil proceedings. In each of their Motionsand Applications, the firms argued that the ST or RWT Waivers extendedonly to the actual gallons of petroleum products for which the applicantwas making a claim. This argument was expressly rejected by the TemporaryEmergency Court of Appeals in <T3>Mid-America Dairymen, Inc. v. Herrington, </T3>No. 10-79 (Temp. Emer.Ct. App. April 19, 1989). The DOE agreed with the court's determinationin this regard, and therefore denied the firms' Motions and Applications.The DOE also denied a Motion for Discovery filed by a group of states regardingthe Boise Cascade Application for Refund.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Crown Central Petroleum Corporation/Beaty Oil Company, Inc. et al.,5/3/89, RF313-87 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting Applications for Refund filedby ten purchasers of Crown refined petroleum products in the Crown CentralPetroleum Corporation special refund proceeding. According to the proceduresset forth in <T3>Crown Central Petroleum Corp., </T3>18 DOE andpara; 85,326 (1988), eachapplicant was found to be eligible for a refund based on the volume ofproducts it purchased from Crown. The total amount of refunds approvedin this Decision was $38,889.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Dorchester Gas Corp./ Christian County Gas Company, et al., 5/3/89,RF253-52 et al. </T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning seven Applications for Refundin the Dorchester Gas Corporation refund proceeding. Each of the applicantspurchased Dorchester propane from Home Petroleum Corporation. The DOE hadpreviously determined that Home was not injured with respect to its purchasesof Dorchester propane. Accordingly, the indirect purchasers were eligiblefor their full allocable shares. Under the small claims presumption ofinjury, the applicants were granted refunds, including both principal andinterest, totalling $29,683.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Dorchester Gas Corp./Liquid Petroleum Corp., 5/1/89, RF253-36</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundsubmitted by Liquid Petroleum Corporation (Liquid) in the Dorchester GasCorporation special refund proceeding. Liquid adequately established thatit purchased 9,117,908 gallons of normal butane from Dorchester. Liquidrequested a refund greater than $5,000 and, therefore, was required tosubmit a detailed demonstration of injury. Liquid demonstrated that itmaintained cost banks during the relevant time period greater than itsallocable share of the Dorchester funds. Market prices are not availablefor butane prior to July 1975. Therefore, to complete Liquid's competitivedisadvantage analysis, the DOE extrapolated average national market pricesfor butane before July 1975 by comparing <T3>Platt's </T3>data for propane and EIA data for butane. Based on theresulting information, the DOE determined that in less than half of themonths of the consent order period, Dorchester's prices to Liquid exceededaverage national market prices. Liquid was granted a refund based on theabove-market gallons of butane multiplied by the volumetric. The totalrefund granted was $56,084.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Eastern Oil Company/Highway Transport Inc., 5/3/89, RF306-4</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refundfiled by Highway Transport Inc. in the Eastern Oil Company special refundproceeding.

The jobbers that supplied these 10 applicants: 1) havenot applied in the Gulf proceeding; 2) have not attempted to prove injury;or 3) have already received a refund in the Gulf proceeding under an injurypresumption. Accordingly, the 10 applicants were treated in the same manneras applicants who purchased directly from Gulf. Each application was approvedusing a presumption of injury. The sum of the refunds granted in this Decisionis $12,724.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Gulf Oil Corporation/Ellsworth Oil Company, 5/1/89, RF300-5233.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundsubmitted in the Gulf Oil Corporation special refund proceeding by EllsworthOil Company, a consignee and reseller of Gulf refined products. EllsworthOil Company's allocable share as a reseller is less than $5,000, and itstotal principal refund is less than $5,000.

(Case No. RF300-2847) and Langer Gas Service Co. (CaseNo. RF300-3156), Because both firms were operationally related during theconsent order period, it is appropriate to consider them together whenapplying the presumptions of injury. However, both firms had already benefittedfrom consideration under separate presumptions of injury and received refundamounts of $953 and $6,404 ($5,000 plus interest) in this proceeding. Thetwo firms collectively purchased 12,260,548 gallons of covered Gulf products.In the absence of a specific injury showing, this purchase volume entitlesthe firms to a total refund of $5,000 plus interest.

For the purposes of Subpart V proceedings, vehicle rentalfirms are considered to be retailers. Because Huber's failed to demonstratethat it was injured due to the crude oil overcharges, it was found to beineligible for a crude oil refund. Accordingly, Huber's Application forRefund was denied.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Indian Wells Oil Company </T3>/<T3>Gates Learjet Corporation, 5/3/89, </T3><T3>RF317-1</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled by Gates Learjet Corporation (Gates) in the Indian Wells Oil Companyspecial refund proceeding. <T3>See Indian Wells Oil Co., </T3>18 DOE andpara; 85,296 (1988).

Accordingly,Gates was granted a refund of $5,468.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Marathon Petroleum Company </T3>/<T3>Rogers Oil Company, 5/3/89, </T3><T3>RR250-5</T3>Rogers Oil Company filed a Motion for Reconsideration of a partial denialof its refund request from a consent order fund made available by MarathonPetroleum Company. Because the DOE found that Rogers had failed to proveinjury at a higher level, Rogers was granted a refund of $11,541 basedon the 35 percent presumption of injury methodology. In its Motion forReconsideration, the firm claimed that in assessing whether it had experienceda competitive disadvantage in purchasing product from Marathon, the DOEincorrectly found that the prices it paid should be compared to pricesother retailers in its market area paid, rather than to refinery and terminalprices. Rogers maintained that it was a wholesaler, not a retailer of product.The DOE rejected this argument, finding that Rogers' sister firm, DiamondServices, Inc., retailed the Marathon product purchased by Rogers, andthat Rogers was, therefore, in essence, a retailer of product. Accordingly,the Motion was denied.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp. </T3>/<T3>McCall Oil and Chemical Corporation, 5/5/89, </T3><T3>RF225-9122</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refundfiled by McCall Oil and Chemical Corporation in the Mobil Oil Corporationspecial refund proceeding. <T3>Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985). McCall, a retailerof home heating oil, claimed a refund on its purchases of 82,412,752 galllonsof No. 2 fuel oil from Mobil. The DOE did not have all of the informationrequired to apply a ``competitive disadvantage test'' to McCall's purchasesfrom Mobil. However, after examining the firm's cost banks and the specificeffects of Mobil's pricing practices on several indices of McCall's businessperformance, the DOE concluded that McCall was injured by its purchasesfrom Mobil. Accordingly, McCall was granted a refund of $41,701.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Modine Manufacturing Company,</T3><ITAG tagnum="16">  5/4/89, </ITAG><T3>RF272-18968 </T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a refund from crude oil overchargefunds to Modine Manufacturing Company based on Modine's purchases of refinedpetroleum products during the period August 19, 1973 through January 27,1981. However, the portion of Modine's claim based on methyl ethyl ketone(MEK) was denied. The DOE determined that MEK, having never been definedas a covered product during the controls period and being too remote fromcrude oil to be considered a covered product, could not form a basis fora refund in the Subpart V proceeding. Modine's total gallonage figure wasadjusted accordingly. Modine was an end-user of the products it claimedand was therefore presumed injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges.The amount of the refund granted in this Decision is $1,983. <ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Sunflower Electric Coop., Inc, et al., 5/4/89, </T3><T3>RF272-332 et al.,</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning five Applications for Refundsubmitted in the crude oil Subpart V proceeding. Each of the applicantsis an electric cooperative. The States submitted objections to the fiveApplications, which stated that the applicants were not eligible to receivea crude oil refund because they were not injured by crude oil overcharges.The States argued that the five applicants passed through any overchargesdirectly to their members. The DOE determined that the five applicantswere eligible for refunds provided that they passed through the refundsreceived on a dollar-for-dollar basis to their members. The sum of therefunds granted in this Decision is $125,699. <ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Total Petroleum Inc./Dilries Oil, Inc. et al.,</T3> 5/4/89, <T3>RF310-308 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning 11 Applications for Refundfiled by purchasers of motor gasoline from Total Petroleum, Inc.

Each of the applicants was a reseller whoseallocable share is less than $5,000. Under the standards established in<T3>Total Petroleum, Inc., </T3>17 DOE andpara; 85,542 (1988), the DOE grantedrefunds in this proceeding which total $11,089. <ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>United Technologies Corp., </T3>5/4/89, RF272-9183, <T3>RD272-9183</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a refund from crude oil overchargefunds to United Technologies Corporation (United), a conglomerate corporationspecializing in the design and manufacture of high-technology products.In reaching its determination, the DOE rejected the objections to United'sclaim submitted by a group of States and denied the States' Motion forDiscovery. Specifically, the DOE restated its position that general economicarguments which are applicable to most segments of the United States economyare insufficient to rebut the presumption that end-users outside of thepetroleum industry were injured by crude oil overcharges. The DOE alsodetermined that the States' showing of sustained growth and profitabilityof a particular firm does not rebut the end-user presumption. In evaluatingUnited's claim, the DOE found that 5.2 percent of the firm's sales duringthe period of price controls were attributable to cost-reimbursement typecontracts.
