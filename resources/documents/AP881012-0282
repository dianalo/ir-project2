(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Holly Farms Corp. said Wednesday it willconsider the nearly $900 million takeover offer from rival poultryprocessor Tyson Foods Inc.   Tyson, the nation's largest poultry processor, offered lateTuesday to pay $45 in cash and a quarter share of its Class Acommon stock for each of Holly Farms' 18.1 million outstandingshares.   In a brief statement Wednesday, Holly Farms said its board ofdirectors would study the offer. The company declined to offer anyother comment.   ``I think Holly Farms will sell to Tyson only as a lastresort,'' said John M. McMillin, an analyst with the investmentfirm Prudential-Bache Securities in New York.   However, John Lawrence, an associate analyst at the investmentfirm Morgan Keegan in Memphis, predicted a deal would be worked outbetween the two poultry rivals.   Holly Farms stock rose sharply in heavy trading, jumping $6.62{a share to $49.62{ in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.Tyson fell 62{ cents a share to $17 in over-the-counter trading.   McMillin said he estimated Holly Farms was worth at least $55 ashare, or about $6 a share higher than Tyson offered. Lawrence putHolly Farms' value at between $50 and $55 a share.   McMillin said Holly Farms' managers could seek a higher bid froma third party but he speculated they might try to buy the companythemselves in a leveraged buyout.   A leveraged buyout is financed with debt that is repaid with thetarget company's cash flow or sale of assets.   ``There's a couple of options,'' McMillin said. ``One is to lookfor a white knight, which could potentially be a Phillip Morris ora Sara Lee ... look for a company to basically choose who they wantto get married to.   ``The other is to pursue a management-led leveraged buyout, takethe company private. I think that's what they're pursuing rightnow,'' he said.   Several hours before Tyson disclosed its offer, Holly Farms hadannounced it had been approached by an unidentified companyregarding a possible business combination. Holly Farms said nospecific proposal had been received and the company did not intendto seek one.   The company also said it had activated its ``poison pill''takeover defense, which is designed to make a hostile takeoverprohibitively expensive.   Bob Justice, a spokesman at Tyson's headquarters in Springdale,Ark., said Wednesday that Tyson had not heard from Holly Farmsabout the offer.   ``We are just waiting on whatever decision they are making overthere. We are standing by,'' he said. ``We do have a timetable ofOct. 19. That's our deadline. Hopefully, they can make a decisionprior to that. And we feel optimistic about a response beforethat.''   McMillin said a merger would increase Tyson's share of thenational poultry market from 18 percent to 28 percent.   Tyson produces 14 million pounds of chicken meat each week froman operation that includes hatcheries, feed mills, processingplants and a sophisticated marketing arm. The company sells bothwhole chickens and processed products to supermarkets, fast foodchains and institutional customers.   Tyson had revenues of about $1.8 billion in its most recentfiscal year, with an after-tax profit of $67 million. It has 25,600employees.   Holly Farms is a diversified foods company, with about 50percent of its sales concentrated in chicken. The company alsomills flour and provides other meats for the food service industry.   Holly Farms had sales of $1.6 billion last year and net incomeof $36.2 million.</TEXT></DOC>
