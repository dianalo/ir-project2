Nopickup.</NOTE><DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Johann Deisenhofer, Robert Huber andHartmut Michel of West Germany won the Nobel Prize in chemistrytoday for determining the structure of certain proteins needed inphotosynthesis.   In 1982, Michel was able to obtain these proteins in acrystalline form that allowed their structure to be determined, andthe structure was then determined in collaboration with Deisenhoferand Huber, said the citation from the Royal Swedish Academy ofSciences.   Deisenhofer, 45, studied at the Max Planck Institute forBiochemistry and now works at the Howard Hughes Medical Institutein Dallas.   Huber, 51, is still at the Max Planck biochemistry institute inMartinsried, West Germany. Michel, 42, works at the Max PlanckInstitute for Biophysics in Frankfurt.   The proteins studied by the researchers were taken from bacteriawhich, like green plants, draw energy from sunlight. Theseso-called membrane-bound proteins are found in the membranessurrounding structures called chloroplasts and mitochondria insidecells. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, which is essential tophotosynthesis, and mitochondria are the cell's energy-generatingfactories.   The work of Deisenhofer, Huber and Michel has led to increasedunderstanding of photosynthesis not only in bacteria, but in algaeand higher plants as well, the academy said.   Earlier in the day, three Americans shared the Nobel Prize inphysics.   Leon Lederman, Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger, an Americanworking in Switzerland, were cited for their work with neutrinobeams. The announcement said their work was carried out in the1960s and ``opened entirely new opportunities for research into theinnermost structure and dynamics of matter.''</TEXT></DOC>
