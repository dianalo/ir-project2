(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Activists in the Baltics should abandontheir ``secessionist mood'' and negotiate with Soviet officials onachieving more independence, the Communist Party daily Pravda saidtoday.   On Wednesday, hundreds of thousands of people formed a gianthuman chain across the Baltics to dramatize their demand forindependence.   Pravda told the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estoniathat there is an alternative to secession.   The article said the party's reforms already allow moreindependence to republics within the framework of the Soviet Union,and it called for the ``scrupulous and friendly labor'' needed toimplement them.   Hundreds of thousands of people stood hand-in-hand across theBaltic republics Wednesday to mark the 50th anniversary of a secretagreement between Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin that put thethen-independent republics into the Soviet orbit.   The protest, organized by grassroots groups in the threerepublics, reflected activists' growing calls for full independencefrom Moscow instead of merely increased sovereignty.   Official estimates provided by the Tass news agency in Moscowsaid 500,000 people turned out in Lithuania, a republic of 3.7million people and that 300,000 of Estonia's 1.6 million people tookpart.   There was no official estimate from Latvia, but the People'sFront grassroots organization in Riga said about 400,000 of Latvia's2.7 million people turned out.   ``I've never lived in an independent Lithuania,'' 30-year-oldgraphic illustrator Audrius Ciocys said as he stood on in the linewith his wife and 3-year-old son. ``I believe there will be one _for my son there must be.''   Official newspapers in the Baltics gave heavy coverage today tothe human chain. One paper in Tallinn, Estonia, filled most of itsfront page with reports and pictures of the event and summarized themood with the headline, ``Our Goal is Freedom.''   Edgar Savisaar, leader of the Estonian People's Front, said hebelieved the republic's parliament might decide as soon as Octoberto issue a republic-wide referendum on independence.   Miik Titma, the ideology chief of Estonia's Communist Party saidin that republic's capital Tallinn that people there were feelingmore inner freedom, and that would lead them to becoming a freenation.   Estonian People's Front activist Heinz Valk declared that byforming the giant human chain, ``We are proclaiming to each otherand to the whole world that we in the Baltic nations have nevergiven up our freedom.''   On Aug. 23, 1939, Hitler and Stalin divided Eastern Europe intospheres of influence and less than a year later Stalin annexed theBaltic states.   In the first reaction by the official Soviet media, the eveningTV news program ``Vremya'' said the human chain should be understoodnot as a demand to leave the Soviet Union, but as a call forhistoric justice.   But it said it would be naive to think that the borders could beredrawn 50 years later.   Moscow Radio today quoted a Moscow's historian's ``dismissal asunlawful'' any attempts to claim the Soviet hold on the Balticstates is invalid because it stems from the 1939 pact.   Estonia's government leaders joined the chain at its beginning ata medieval tower near the Gulf of Finland. About 370 miles to thesouth in Vilnius, capital of Lithuania, demonstrators held candlesto remember the 1 million Lithuanians they say were killed, jailedor exiled in 50 years of Soviet rule.   In Tallinn, the chain was four-deep in places, and then stretchedsouth out of the windy port.   Participants still were returning to Tallinn at 4 a.m. from aprotest at the Estonian-Latvian border where a copy of theHitler-Stalin agreement was burned in a large bonfire surrounded bythe flags of the independent Baltic states.   Witnesses said the highway north of Riga toward Estonia waspacked with people.   Organizers said they needed 1.5 million participants to fill upthe chain, and some gaps were reported.   Moscow activists tried to organize a sympathy protest in thecapital, but police and a special anti-demonstration unit broke itup. The official Tass news agency said 75 people were detained.   In the southwestern Soviet republic of Moldavia, also annexed bythe Soviet Union under the secret agreement, about 10,000 peopleattended an outdoor rally in heavy rain.   They carried the blue, red and yellow national flag of Moldavia,as well as the flags of the Baltic republics, said MoldavianPeople's Front activist Yuri Rozhgo in a telephone interview fromKishinv, the republic's capital.   Georgian activists said about 1,500 people gathered in thecapital Tbilisi on Wednesday evening in a demonstration of supportfor the Baltic republics.</TEXT></DOC>
