TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Maj. Gen. YitzhakMordechai, a bull-necked, outspoken veteran of three wars, saysIsrael's army will outlast Arabs in the daily street battles thathave become a fixture of the Palestinian uprising.   ``We will never become tired. We will act as if the intefadeh isgoing to last for 100 years,'' said Mordechai, the head of Israel'ssouthern command. ``It means the Israeli army will carry out itsmission with tenacity and sensitivity as long as it is ordered todo so by the government.''   At least 112 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Stripsince the uprising _ or intefadeh _ began nearly 17 months agoagainst Israeli rule of the territory and the West Bank.   Mordechai, 44, believes the only lasting solution to the GazaStrip's chronic unrest is an international campaign to relocate thenearly 250,000 Palestinians who live in the crowded refugee campsthat spawned the uprising.   Until then, Mordechai is prepared to direct the battle againstthe squads of Arab youths who throw stones at his cream Land-Roveras it leads a convoy of jeeps through Gaza City.   At a strategy session last week, he placed his black-handled.45-caliber automatic on the desk in front of him as he questionedtwo dozen field officers packed into a situation room.   Should he close a school where students had rioted? What aboutthe mosques?   Avi, a studious-looking major with wire-rimmed glasses, arguedthat classrooms should be kept open to encourage as normal a lifeas possible.   Asaf, a white-haired veteran, proposed closing the school for amonth as punishment. But he argued against shutting mosques, sayingit could inflame Moslem fundamentalists. Israel doesn't want a holywar, he said.   Mordechai, who allowed a reporter to attend the review oncondition he not quote soldiers verbatim, ended the debate with alecture on the need to be sensitive during the holy month ofRamadan, when Moslems fast from dawn to dusk.   The general recalled a recent three-hour meeting with Moslemelders in which Israeli officers, on his orders, refrained fromeating, drinking or smoking in deference to the fast. He said theelders praised the Israelis for showing respect.   ``We should use the same respect with the mosques,'' saidMordechai, who later demonstrated his fluency in Arabic by stoppingto chat with Palestinian vegetable vendors and children on OmarMukhtar Street.   The army has temporarily cut off access to six of the 60 mosquesin the Gaza Strip and indefinitely shut 15 of the 260 schools.Officers say the schools and mosques have become rallying pointsfor the uprising.   More than 450 Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Striphave been killed in the revolt.   By mid-April, according to army count, soldiers had shot andkilled 112 Arabs and wounded 1,500 in the Gaza Strip.   By U.N. count, 131 Palestinians had been killed in the GazaStrip and 18,000 hurt, 2,659 by gunfire. U.N. officials said aboutone-third of the injured were children under 15.   The high number of casualties in an uprising in which soldiersoften face rock-throwing youths has caused many Israelis toquestion army tactics.   Some reservists contend that service in the occupied lands isnot what they have been trained for. They have argued that dailyconfrontations with Palestinian civilians have damaged troop morale.   Mordechai, in an interview over lunch at the Gaza City jail,bristled when asked why so many children were hurt. He and otherofficers said activists invite serious injury by putting women andchildren in the midst of violent demonstrations.   ``We don't shoot children (intentionally) even with plasticbullets,'' he said, adding that children only got hurt when theystood behind adults and soldiers couldn't see them.   Mordechai also said Palestinian hospital officials paddedcasualty figures by taking names from telephone books. On onerecent day, the army could only confirm eight to 10 wounded whileArab reports said more than 50 were shot, he said.   ``This is part of the battle to win public opinion to theirside,'' he said.   Mordechai, a paratroop officer who studied infantry tactics inEngland, is a veteran field officer _ what Israelis call a ``battlefox.'' He commanded troops at the ``Chinese farm'' in Egypt, one ofthe bloodiest encounters of the 1973 war; 51 of his soldiers werekilled and 100 were wounded.   He defended the Jordan Valley against Palestinian cross-borderraids in the 1960s and in 1982 led Israeli troops in taking WestBeirut, the former PLO enclave.   Mordechai stands in sharp contrast to his more liberalcounterpart in the West Bank, Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, whothreatened to resign over Israel's conduct of the 1982 invasion ofLebanon and who told reporters he had trouble sleeping at nightbecause of the actions soldiers were sometimes forced to take inthe West Bank.   Mordechai said the key was finding the right amount of force touse in a given situation. In the uprising, he said, the army cannotuse the large amount of firepower at its disposal without long-termrepercussions.   ``We don't use 5 percent of our might,'' he said. ``We want tolive in this part of the world, with our neighbors'' when theuprising has ended.</TEXT></DOC>
