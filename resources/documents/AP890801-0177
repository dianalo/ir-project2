TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Facing criticism that Israel's abduction of aShiite Moslem clergyman endangered foreign hostages, Israeliofficials mounted a counterattack Tuesday and said the action was anecessary part of the war on terrorism.   Despite a public show of unity, sources said sharp internaldivisions emerged in Israel's government about the operation inwhich Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid was kidnapped from his home insouthern Lebanon on Friday.   Pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists said Monday they killed oneof the U.S. hostages, Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, becauseIsrael did not release Obeid.   ``We will see if decisions were taken without thinking about theresults and not taking into account possible developments,'' IsraelTV quoted one legislator as saying.   The broadcast said opposition to the abduction is increasing butmost legislators were ``observing silence.''   The television report said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin willaddress Parliament Wednesday in response to three motions ofno-confidence submitted by far-left parties over the raid. Thedebate will be broadcast live on army radio.   The decision-making inner Cabinet is set to discuss the raid onWednesday.   To prevent further strains in U.S.-Israel relations, the ForeignMinistry set up a six-member team to monitor reaction to thehostage crisis. Several Israeli leaders also appeared on U.S. TVprograms to explain Israel's actions.   ``I understand the anguish and the feeling of frustration in theUnited States,'' Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said on ABC's ``GoodMorning America.''   ``But I think that it is important that we reserve our angeragainst those who are responsible for this situation, against theterrorists of the Hezbollah movement.''   Arens later said on ``CBS Evening News'' that Obeid ``was a manwho was in charge of terrorist activities for the Hezbollah ... insouthern Lebanon. He is directly responsible for the kidnapping ofCol. Higgins. If Col. Higgins was executed ... he (Obeid) wasdirectly responsible for the death .... And I don't see why anybodyin the civilized world ... would now suggest that this murderershould now be released or that his apprehension was a mistake.   ``I think in retrospect we will see that we struck a veryeffective blow against terrorism.''   Israel's abduction of Obeid prompted indirect criticism fromPresident Bush, who said all hostage-taking hindered peace effortsin the Middle East.   In toughly worded statements after the reported killing, somemembers of the U.S. Congress criticized Israel for not coordinatingits actions with the United States in advance and for failing toanticipate that the abduction would threaten the lives of Americansheld hostage in Lebanon.   The statements raised concern about Israel's relations with theUnited States, which provides $3 billion a year in annual militaryand economic aid.   ``We call upon the American people not to allow this outrage todrive a wedge between the United States and Israel. Let us standtogether in the fight against terrorism,'' said Foreign Ministryspokesman Alon Liel.   Harry Wall, Israel director of the Anti-Defamation League ofB'nai B'rith, said: ``Israel is in a war, fighting against an enemythat doesn't play by the norms and rules that the West shares. Putotherwise, you can't wear kid gloves in a brass-knuckleneighborhood.''   Israeli officials disputed that the Obeid kidnap triggeredHiggins' death, saying there were strong indications he was killedsix months to one year earlier in retaliation for the U.S. downingof an Iranian jetliner.   They portrayed Obeid as a guerrilla leader in the Iranian-backedHezbollah, or Party of God, even though some experts characterizedhim as more of a propagandist.   The army said that based on interrogations, Obeid was involvedin car bomb attacks, infiltration attempts and the kidnapping ofHiggins.   ``He's quite a big fish. He knows and has been telling us agreat deal about Hezbollah terrorist operations,'' Deputy ForeignMinister Benjamin Netanyahu said on ``CBS This Morning.''   Israeli media said there was behind-the-scene criticism that theCabinet failed to consider the possibility that Hezbollah wouldretaliate against Western hostages instead of Israel's threeprisoners of war.   ``It is now clear that in the Cabinet meeting in which thekidnapping was approved, a script was not presented to theministers which took into account the execution of the foreignhostages in Lebanon,'' Israel radio said.   Both Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev and Mordechai Gur, a Cabinetminister without portfolio, disputed the claim, saying all possibleramifications were taken into account.   One member of the Cabinet, Energy Minister Moshe Shahal of theleft-leaning Labor Party, disclosed that he had voted against theabduction at a Cabinet meeting July 26. The operation was approvedby 11-1.   Another official said Israel did not anticipate the intensity ofworld reaction. ``Perhaps we underestimated the extent of the mediacoverage of this crisis,'' he said.  </TEXT></DOC>
