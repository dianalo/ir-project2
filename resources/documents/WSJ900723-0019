In this town,the new dreaded scarlet letter is R -- for recession.   Conventional wisdom has long held that the Washingtonarea's economy is recession-proof, resilient when other areashave downturns. Its primary industries -- government,consulting, contracting and law -- seem to roll alongoblivious to the ups and downs of the business cycle.</LP><TEXT>   Until now. Recent data, while not indicating a seriousdecline for the area's overall economic health, reflect amarked slowdown in growth. And a sharp downturn in the realestate market has sent shock waves throughout the community.The latest sign of deep trouble came Wednesday, whenWashington Bancorp. posted an $80 million second-quarter lossand said that its National Bank of Washington subsidiary, theDistrict of Columbia's fourth-largest bank, no longer meetsfederal capital requirements and faces a threat to itssurvival.   Local residents, long accustomed to a robust economy, aresuffering from a case of declining expectations. &quot;Theslowdown, even if the economy is still growing, is enough toshake a lot of people,&quot; says Joel Popkin, a local consultant.For the first time in memory, job growth in the Washingtonarea is less than the rest of the country -- 1.7% from April1989 through April 1990, compared with 2.1% for the rest ofthe nation.   The signs of trouble are evident throughout themetropolitan area, which includes suburbs in Virginia andMaryland as well as the District of Columbia itself. Afteryears of booming growth, the value of office-space buildingpermits dropped 43% last year, the Commerce Department says,while the value of residential building permits declined5.5%. The vacancy rate for existing office buildings in theregion rose to 14.4% from 9.6% in 1984, according to theOffice Network, a real-estate brokerage firm.   In the wake of the slowdown, Perpetual Financial Corp.,the parent company of Perpetual Savings Bank, the area'slargest thrift, had a $50.2 million loss in the secondquarter, while MNC Financial Inc., the holding company forthree of the area's largest commercial banks, recentlyannounced that it expects a second-quarter loss of $75million.   Meanwhile, Garfinckel's, once the area's premier upscaleretailer, is conducting a going-out-of-business sale, as isArthur A. Adler, the venerable men's clothing store favoredby George Bush. Some local observers blame the problems ofGarfinckel's and Adler mostly on management miscues andincreased competition. But the problems have been exacerbatedby what a recent report by management consultants GrantThornton concludes is a flattening of retail sales in thearea.   To be sure, a lot of areas would be quite satisfied withthe kind of &quot;recession&quot; Washington is experiencing. Despitethe slowdown, the Grant Thornton report ranks the area'seconomy as the seventh-strongest out of 24 major metropolitanareas in the U.S. And job growth, while down from 4.5% in1988, could still be as high as 2% this year -- about averagefor the rest of the country. &quot;In the '80s, you were goingdown the road at 80 miles an hour,&quot; says William Wrench,president of the Greater Washington Board of Trade, the localchamber of commerce. &quot;Now we're slowing down to 55.&quot;   But that slowdown is being felt in a broad range ofsectors. &quot;We've laid off quite a few of our constructionworkers, and now we're at the stage of looking at otherlayoffs,&quot; says Edward Miller Jr., a local developer.Meanwhile, with Congress preparing to whack at the Pentagonbudget, Towson, Md.-based Black andamp; Decker Corp. has run intotrouble in its efforts to sell Planning Research Corp. andAdvanced Technologies Inc., two companies in the northernVirginia suburbs that have significant defense-relatedcomponents. &quot;The market is somewhat softer than we expected,&quot;said Barbara Lucas, a spokeswoman for Black andamp; Decker.   Experts say that one of the main culprits in the area'sslowdown is the same thing that has fueled growth for so manyyears: federal spending. According to a recent report byStephen Fuller, chairman of George Washington University'sDepartment of Urban Planning and Real Estate Development,federal procurement awards in the metropolitan area declined16% between 1987 and 1989, while they declined 9.5%nationwide in the same period.   Mr. Fuller's report says that federal purchases decreasedabout a third faster in the Washington area than in the restof the country in 1989. The area's share of all U.S.government purchases slipped to 5.4% in 1989 from 5.8% in1987. Nonmilitary purchases in the area dropped 15% lastyear, compared with a 2.3% drop nationwide.   Even more worrisome are long-term demographic changesreflecting economic deterioration in the area's core -- theDistrict of Columbia.   The notion of Washington as recession-proof has alwaysbeen &quot;a relatively snobbish perspective,&quot; says localconsultant Clifford Alexander, a former D.C. mayoralcandidate and secretary of the Army under President Carter.&quot;When you see what people in this city do, it's far fromrecession-proof,&quot; he says, referring to the variety ofhardships that beset the poor residents of the districtduring economic downturns.   While the metropolitan area continues to gain people, astudy by the Greater Washington Research Center concludesthat the federal city itself has been losing residents at anaverage rate of 3% a year in the 1980s, and that itspopulation will decline to 595,000 in the year 2000 fromroughly 613,000 now. Further, D.C. residents' median incomedeclined $1,500 in real dollars between 1980 and 1986 and isprojected to decline a further $3,000 by the turn of thecentury.   That trend is expected to worsen pressures on the suburbs,which until now have been the engine of the region's growth.&quot;If we have a very dependent and economically weak urbancenter of the metro area, that can have negative consequencesto the suburban areas,&quot; says Mr. Fuller. &quot;The fringes aremoving out, too. The suburban jurisdictions will be taking ongreater social costs than they had before. What happens ifyou only have basket cases and millionaires living in thedistrict?&quot;   Some analysts believe the trend will lead the suburbs andaffluent D.C. residents to put more and more pressure on thedistrict to spend money to remedy its problems. But that willbe hard, given that city tax revenues are likely to decreaseas the median income declines. The federal government, whichmakes an annual payment to the district in lieu of propertytaxes on government buildings, is itself strapped for moneyand seems ill-inclined to help much. One possible solutionmight be a commuter tax, but that idea is routinely scuttledby opposition in Congress from suburban lawmakers.   Political turmoil is also taking a toll. The current drugand perjury trial of Mayor Marion Barry, and thecountercharges of racism by some in the black community, havehad a dispiriting effect on the city that may yet affect itseconomic prospects.</TEXT></DOC>
