The truth is, wenever had any vital interests in Vietnam.;    Every conflict we have beeninvolved in since the Vietnam War -- such as Grenada and Panama -- has been inour vital interests, or at least a lot closer to home. Certainly we have vitalinterests in the Middle East. Why do protesters keep harping about every newconflict being &quot;another Vietnam&quot;?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GULF WAR CANNOT BE 'ANOTHER VIETNAM'  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  </MEMO><TEXT>     Before this war began, President Bush showed considerable restraint,compared to Lyndon Johnson and the beginning of the Vietnam War. I believe itis time to back our troops in the gulf.;    -- Tom Peterson; Cupertino;DROUGHT CRIES OUT FOR WISE WATER WAYS; The media repeatedly tell us that weare entering the fifth year of drought. We are reminded that such droughtsrecur approximately every 10 or 11 years. Even if the rains were to resumetomorrow, another shortage is just a few years away.;    State and regionalwater agencies are holding emergency meetings to implement drasticconservation measures. Consider these suggestions:;    (check) Relate billingunits to gallons. We use -- and save -- water by the gallon, not the cubicfoot. One billing unit andequals; 100 cubic feet (ccf) andequals; 748 gallons.;    (check)Establish a lifeline rate of $1 per unit for the first seven units (5,236gallons) per month; then, in steps, escalate rates dramatically to $20 or moreat 50 units (37,400 gallons!) a month. That's still less than 2.7 cents pergallon!;    (check) Establish absolute limits and collect a hefty fine forexceeding them. A penalty of a meager $2 per ccf for exceeding the allotmentonly adds a quarter of a cent to the cost of a gallon of water.;    (check)Use increased revenues to fund research and construction of alternative,environmentally sound sources of water. Desalinization may be expensive, butit holds promise.;    (check) With state and local officials, developguidelines for gray water use. Establish tax credits or similar incentives fordesigning and installing effective gray water-recovery systems. Why use cleardrinking water to flush the toilet?;    (check) Acknowledge the tremendouscommitment of those who are already conserving dramatically. Carrying bucketsof water from the bathtub to the washing machine or the lawn -- for less thana penny a bucket -- is clearly a labor of love.;    We certainly must makesome modifications in our lifestyles -- not just while we're in this drought,but permanently.;    -- Jonathan P. Cranch; Palo Alto; BROWN DOESN'T SPEAK FORTHE MAJORITY; When Jerry Brown, chairman of the Californian Democratic Party,implied Jan. 19 on a TV program called &quot;Sound Off&quot; that President Bush led theUnited States into war with Iraq to increase his popularity, Brown made publichis contempt for the president, his ignorance of the causes of the war and hiscynical attitude toward American public opinion.;    If, as Brown implied,President Bush predicted that a war would increase his popularity, that meansthat most Americans support the war. Who, then, does Brown speak for when heobjects to the war? Not for the majority of Americans.;    -- RivkaSherman-Gold; Palo Alto  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910130  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  533  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 30, 199100030126,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
