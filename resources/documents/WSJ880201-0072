While a debate about NATO is needed, the discussion will be more helpful if it becomes part of a broader reconsideration of U.S. defense strategy around the world. Important changes are buffeting the assumptions of the postwar era, and U.S. defense strategy has only begun to grapple with the consequences.    The maps nearby suggest the magnitude of the change over the past 30 years in one area, the ability to project force into the Persian Gulf (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Feb. 1, 1988). In the mid-1950s, as the first map shows, the U.S. had sufficient overflight rights and base access to be confident it could send forces quickly from Europe into the gulf. Soviet airlift, however, was highly problematic, because it had to travel an extremely long route from arctic ports around both Europe and Africa.    In the second map, we see that over the years a near reversal has taken place. Today the Soviets can quickly airlift forces into the gulf, without refueling, and with barely an objecting nod from allied or neutral states. Meanwhile, through such strategic debacles as the fall of Iran's shah, U.S. access has slipped alarmingly. The U.S. may be able to protect gulf shipping from the Iranians, but in a real crisis the U.S. would have to airlift forces 6,500 nautical miles across the Atlantic, risking enemy attack all the way.    The Reagan defense buildup has increased U.S. sea-lift and airlift capability by some 50%, but that must compensate for declining U.S. access both in the gulf and around the world. In Europe, Spain is giving the boot to 72 U.S. F-16 fighters, while bases in Greece and the Azores are jeopardized by local politics. In the Pacific, the U.S. may lose its access to bases in the Philippines even as the Soviets expand their presence in Vietnam, notably at Cam Ranh Bay.    To isolationists, all of this suggests that the U.S. should withdraw from its foreign commitments. It's fashionable to talk about America's &quot;relative decline,&quot; and all too many are ready to make it a self-fulfilling prophecy. But in a world increasingly linked by trade, investment and communications the West's largest nation has no choice but to remain a global military power. So long as the Soviet Union remains an expansionist regime ruled by a narrow elite, the U.S. and its allies must continue to deter a Soviet attack. The real issue for the 1990s and beyond is how to craft a defense strategy that adapts to global change, deters more intelligently and gets more out of the defense budget.    One place where fresh thinking is required is NATO itself. For 30 years NATO's strategy has been to prepare for a massive Soviet invasion of Central Europe. As the recent Ikle-Wohlstetter report, &quot;Discriminate Deterrence&quot; (the source of the nearby maps), to President Reagan makes clear, it's far more likely that the Soviets would attack first on the more vulnerable fringes of the alliance, perhaps in the Persian Gulf or Norway. Yet in the event of such an attack, would other European countries risk a Soviet reprisal by fighting in the gulf? Would they even refuse, as France did in the Libya episode, to let U.S. forces cross their territory?    Clearly, NATO needs to think about fortifying its flanks, especially near the gulf. Support for Turkey, particularly for air defense, should be an obvious priority. Other U.S. friends in the region should be encouraged to provide bases in an emergency. The Ikle-Wohlstetter report also recommends exploiting the West's technological superiority to produce for NATO &quot;smart&quot; weapons, &quot;Stealth&quot; aircraft, ballistic missile and air defenses, and conventionally armed long-range cruise missiles. All would complicate any Soviet attack.    More broadly, the U.S. must develop alternatives to overseas bases. &quot;Here again our technology can help us,&quot; the report says. It recommends low-cost satellites to replace the intelligence-gathering role of bases; long-range aircraft, both manned and unmanned, for surveillance; and, obviously, a continued ability to project naval power.    The answer to a changing world is not to withdraw from it but to adapt. Of course allies in Asia and Europe need to &quot;share more of the burden&quot; of defense spending, but what American politicians too often mean by this is that the U.S. should simply spend less. The escort operation in the Persian Gulf has shown that NATO can adapt to new threats once the U.S. shows it will lead. The next step is to settle on a strategy for defending U.S. interests -- in the Persian Gulf, but also in a less hospitable world. </TEXT></DOC>
