Bush: Well, I don't question his passion. I question _ and Idon't question his concern about the war in Vietnam. He introducedor supported legislation back then that suggested that kids fromMassachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.Now, that's a certain passion, but in my view it's misguidedpassion.   He _ we have a big difference on issues. You see, last year inthe primary, he expressed his passion.   He said, ``I am a strong, liberal Democrat'' _ August, '87.   Then he said, ``I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU.''   That was what he said. He is out there on, out of themainstream. He is very passionate. My argument with the governoris, do we want this country to go that far left? And I wish we hadtime to let me explain. But I salute him for his passion. We justhave a big difference on where this country should be led, and inwhat direction it ought to go.   Lehrer: Peter, a question for the vice president, Peter.   Jennings: I'd just like to follow up, if I may, on this mentionyou've made of his card-carrying membership in the American CivilLiberties Union. Now, you've used the phrase ``card-carrying'' somany times, since Governor Dukakis first acknowledged that he was acard-carrying member of the ACLU, that some people, some peoplehave come to believe that you have used it in, to brand him in someway, to identify him as people were identified in the 1950s, asless than patriotic.   I'd like to know why you keep repeating the phrase. What's theimportant issue here? What is so wrong with the governor being amember of an organization which has come to the defense of, amongother people, Col. Oliver North?   Bush: Nothing's wrong with it, but just take a look at thepositions of the, just take a look at the positions of the ACLU.   But Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like metalking about liberal.   They do not like it when I say that he says he's a card-carryingmember. Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it righthere.   I've seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I've done himan injustice, and he didn't say it, I'm very, very sorry.   But I don't agree with a lot of the, most of the positions ofthe ACLU. I simply don't want to see the ratings on movies, I don'twant my 10-year-old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
