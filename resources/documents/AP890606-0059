Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler described the climate as ``tenseand unsettled'' but said there were no known threats againstAmerican residents, tourists or diplomats. An estimated 1,400Americans are in Beijing and 8,800 in China overall.   ``Persons in other parts of China may also wish to leave Chinadepending on the local situation,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``Citizenswho chose to leave should, if possible, avoid routes out of thecountry that would require them to travel through Beijing.''   The spokeswoman said arrangements were being made with Unitedand Northwest airlines to supplement their regular service fromChina with charter flights. Beijing airport was reported open.   For the first time, meanwhile, the State Department acknowledgedthere may be dissension within the ranks of the Chinese armedforces.   ``We have reason to believe that all elements of the Army do notsupport what is taking place,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``We have nofirm evidence of armed clashes.''   Troops opened fire on Sunday on students in Tiananmen Square,killing hundreds of the young demonstrators who were demandingdemocratic reforms in the world's largest Marxist country.   Ms. Tutwiler also announced that all Chinese in the UnitedStates would be allowed to remain indefinitely because of thesituation at home. She said President Bush made the move as acompassionate gesture.   Sources said telephone calls were being made systematically toall American residents of Beijing, who had been asked earlier tomake the embassy aware of their whereabouts.   The State Department on Monday urged American students in Chinato stay away from campuses and to remain in touch with the U.S.embassy. The department also renewed its advisory urging Americansagainst travel to China.   The Chinese capital was threatened with civil war as armiesloyal to rival political factions were reported battling forcontrol of the city.   President Bush said Monday the world ``must stand with'' theChinese demonstrator who, in a singular act of defiance captured bytelevision, placed himself in front of a column of tanks rollingthrough Beijing.   ``I think that image is going to be with us for a long time,''Bush said. ``And all I can say to him, wherever he might be, and tothe people around the world, is: we are, and we must, stand withhim.''   Crafting a course influenced by his firsthand experience inChina, Bush suspended more than $600 million in U.S. arms sales toChina but stopped short of advocating economic sanctions.   ``I reserve the right to take a whole new look at things if theviolence escalates,'' Bush said, but for now he is sticking withthe arms move and suspending visits between U.S. and Chinesemilitary leaders.   Bush made the announcement _ applauded by congressional leaders_ at a news conference, but later discussed the China situationagain emotionally during a speech before the Business Roundtable.   The president met today with the leader of another Asian power,Pakistan, pledging to join Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto inexploring ``any serious avenue'' to a political solution to thebloody conflict in Afghanistan.   ``Prime Minister Bhutto and I reviewed the situation inAfghanistan. ... We agreed ... that the job is not done,'' Bushsaid of the Afghan rebels' struggle to topple the Marxist regime inKabul.   ``Pakistan remains fully committed to a politcal solution'' inAfghanistan, Mrs. Bhutto said following a meeting with Bush at theWhite House.   In his remarks Monday night to business leaders, Bush said hewas haunted by the sight _ played frequently through the day ontelevision _ of a demonstrator who stood alone in front of tanksadvancing through Beijing.   ``I was so moved by the bravery of that individual ... What isit that gives a young man strength, gives him the courage, to standup in front of a column of tanks right there in front of theworld?''   Bush told the business leaders they should continue to seektrade with China, claiming he preferred military sanctions againstChina rather than economic ones.   Earlier, he told reporters, ``I don't want to hurt the Chinesepeople.'' He rejected out of hand the idea of recalling the U.S.ambassador.   ``That would be 180 degrees wrong,'' said Bush, who was himselfthe U.S. envoy in China in 1974-75. ``Our ambassador provides oneof the best listening posts we have in China.''   ``I am trying to take steps that will encourage a peacefulchange, and yet recognize the fact that China does have great pridein its own history,'' he said.   Leaders of Congress who visited the White House for a foreignpolicy review with the president, including a firsthand report onhis triumphs at last week's NATO summit in Brussels, emerged withstrong praise for the course Bush has set.   ``I think he's done the right thing,'' said House MajorityLeader Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., after the bipartisan session.   Bush also made clear, both at his news conference and in anunusual Oval Office meeting, the depth of what he called the``great admiration in my heart for the students'' who havedemonstrated and now died for democracy in Beijing.   Bush also said he would give ``sympathetic review'' to visaextensions for any of the 40,000 Chinese students studying in theUnited States who were afraid of returning home.   The White House hastily invited four pro-democracy Chinesegraduate students and activists from local universities to meetwith Bush.   The president looked on approvingly as Jia Hao, 38, a Ph.D.candidate in political science at George Washington University,applauded Bush's actions, saying they ``will be a great supportspiritually and physically to the people who are fighting for thefreedom and democracy.''   Bush condemned the assault as ``a violent and bloody attack'' ondemonstrators who were ``advocating basic human rights.''   Bush said halting arms sales ``is going to send a strong signal.I'm not saying it's going to cure the short-range problem in China... but I think it is very important the Chinese leaders know it'snot going to be business as usual.''   White House officials said that over $600 million in continuingmilitary sles to China would be affected _ including a $502 millionprogram to help the Chinese upgrade electronic and navigationalequipment on their F-8 fighter jets.   Other projects affected are the final two units in a $62.5million sale of four artillery-locating radars, a $28.5 millionprogram for upgrading large-calibre ammunition production, and an$8.5 million sale of anti-submarine torpedos.   The United States has sold more than $700 million in arms toChina since 1979.</TEXT></DOC>
