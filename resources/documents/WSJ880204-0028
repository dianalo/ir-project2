The Alaska Indian and Eskimo corporations were created by a 1971 federal law to hold assets conferred on the state's natives in exchange for ending their broad claims to Alaska lands. Under the law, scores of village corporations and 13 regional corporations chose about 40 million acres of land and received almost $1 billion. A few have prospered by exploiting timber, oil and other natural resources, but many have encountered financial difficulties through legal battles and inopportune investments.    The measure was designed to prevent individual shareholders from selling out their holdings and leaving &quot;nothing for future generations,&quot; said an aide to Sen. Frank Murkowski (R., Alaska), who sponsored the measure. The prohibition on individual sales of stock was to have expired in 1991.    Mr. Reagan signed the new measure despite opposition by the Interior Department and some other agencies that argue that the bill will create permanent, racially defined economic and property rights. </TEXT></DOC>
