Thirty-nine lesions showed increased flowand were, therefore, diagnosed as vascular malformations. Subsequentbiopsy of 10 of these lesions confirmed that diagnosis. The other 29lesions with increased flow were followed for 10 months to 5 years andthe clinical course was consistent with vascular malformation in everycase. Eight lesions showed no increased flow on technetium scan. Oneof these subsequently proved to be a hemangioma. The others have turnedout not to be vascular malformations. Therefore, in our experience, thetechnetium-99m-labeled red blood cell scan has had 98% sensitivity and100% specificity in diagnosing vascular malformations in children.</TEXT></DOC>
