Real-Estate Experts See the Next Disaster in CentralLos Angeles.&quot;   Comparing the diverse Los Angeles economy with a citywhere most jobs depend on a single industry paints anentirely inaccurate picture of current West Coast economicconditions. The signature skyline of downtown Los Angelescrowns more than office space. The manufacturing andwholesale industries alone generate sales revenue in excessof $20 billion a year.</LP><TEXT>   A Price Waterhouse survey released in June said -- basedon projections that 1.7 million new jobs will be created inLos Angeles in the 1990s -- that &quot;by the end of 1992, vacancyrates are likely to be dropping and effective rents rising.Confidence in the Southern California market will thenfollow.&quot;   Unfortunately, you looked at the status of only a fewbuildings and then predicted a gloomy future for the city.The strength of our downtown community, known here in LosAngeles as Bunker Hill, is underscored by the busiestconstruction site downtown, where Metropolitan Structures isbuilding Two California Plaza, a second office tower rising52 stories. The tallest building west of the Mississippi --First Interstate World Center -- is virtually fully leasedafter opening only a year ago. Construction of the 52-storyGas Co. Tower isn't even completed, yet 80% of its officespace is leased.   There has been an influx of financial institutions thatrecognize Los Angeles as a pre-eminent financial center ofthe West Coast, and that has attracted legal and accountingfirms, insurance and real-estate corporations, builders anddevelopers.   The fact that Los Angeles is attracting foreign investorsdemonstrates an underlying long-term confidence in the LosAngeles market that American corporations began to discover ashort 15 years ago.   It should be no surprise that the pace of commercialconstruction has slowed during a nationwide recession. Inplace of commercial building, we are seeing an increase inresidential and retail facilities to serve a new downtownpopulation of residents, workers and visitors. While LosAngeles is not immune to economic ills, the diversity of oureconomy has allowed us to withstand recessions much betterthan other large cities.   Your simplistic view of Los Angeles does a great injusticeto the 3.5 million people who live and work in our city. Iencourage your readers to take another look at our dynamiccity.   Tom Bradley   Mayor   City of Los Angeles   Los Angeles   ---   Your article has conveyed an image of a city on the brinkof a real-estate disaster, which is without foundation.However dismal the quoted sources want to paint SouthernCalifornia's office-market picture, the undeniable facts arethat the region possesses a diversified economy, an intricatemix of local support businesses, some of the nation's largestports and airports, a Pacific Rim location, and the mostrapidly growing population base of any major city in the U.S.   Ignored in the article are some major facts that are thesubject of a comprehensive research study by the PriceWaterhouse Real Estate Group:   -- Southern California is projected to add 1.7 millionjobs in the 1990s, a 21% growth level, with Los Angelesleading all other markets with 550,000 new office jobs.   -- The amount of excess vacant space (the amount above an8% vacancy factor) in central Los Angeles represents anaverage of just 4.8 years of absorption.   While this nearly five years of supply is much higher thandesirable, and in combination with the recession andreal-estate liquidity crisis explains why rents have softenedand property values declined, it certainly is not the 12-yearnightmare scenario portrayed in your article.   While central Los Angeles contains only 11% of SouthernCalifornia's rentable office space, it has 33% of theregion's space under construction. Based on this, vacancyrates definitely will rise over the next two years, perhapspeaking in the high 20% range. Then they will begin todecline as job growth and other factors balance thesupply-demand equation.   -- According to the U.S. Commerce Department, one of everysix jobs in the U.S. will be in California by the year 2000.That means more than half of those jobs will be coming toSouthern California and Los Angeles in the years between nowand then.   While it is true that factors such as the consolidation ofthe banking industry may add temporarily to the amount ofavailable office space in the central Los Angeles area,similar events in past recessions have occurred. Long-termdemographic trends and projections incorporate such advanceevents and have, in fact, generally proved to be conservativeestimates of real economic growth.   David A. Esner   Managing Partner   Price Waterhouse Real Estate Group   Los Angeles   ---   Your story has caused more comment in the SouthernCalifornia real-estate community than any article in recentmemory.   You documented and said out loud what people here for sometime have been worried is true.   Bruce W.
