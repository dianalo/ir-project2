The rebels announced the fall of the garrison in northwesternGonder Province earlier this week in addition to the capture of twotowns in Shoa Province to the south.   The government has made no comment on the reported fighting, butdiplomats in the capital, Addis Ababa, say the rebel claims ofcapturing the three communities appear to be true.   Reporters have been denied access to the region, and thereports, especially regarding casualties, cannot be independentlyverified.   In clandestine radio broadcasts earlier in the week, the rebelsof the Tigre People's Liberation Front put the government toll forall three towns at nearly 3,000 killed, wounded or captured.   But in a broadcast monitored in Nairobi today, the insurgentsclaimed far higher government losses in Debre Tabor alone.   None of the broadcasts heard through the week mentioned rebellosses.   If the rebel reports of government losses are true, theseven-day battle for Debre Tabor would mark the biggest defeat inmore than a year for the forces of President Mengistu Haile Mariam.   The Tigrean rebels opened a new offensive in late August after asix-month lull in their 14-year-old war to topple Mengistu'sgovernment. They now control all of their home province of Tigreand have made signigicant advances into Wollo, Gonder and Shoaprovinces to the south and west.   Like the government, the Tigrean insurgents are Marxists. Theirleaders have spoken frequently and paradoxically of wanting ademocratic government patterned after that of Communist Albania.   The government faces an even older insurgency in thenorthernmost province of Eritrea, where rebels have been fighting aseccessionist war for 28 years. However, there has been littleactivity in that region in recent months.</TEXT></DOC>
