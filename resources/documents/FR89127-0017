The basiclicense fee was increased from $25 ($50 for two years) to $250 per year,and each licensee was allowed five (5) prepaid shipments. The Service chargeda $25 inspection fee for each shipment in excess of five (5) that a licenseeimported or exported during the license year. To collect these fees, theService developed a computerized billing system and sent monthly billsto each licensee. The Service also used the system to bill licensees forthe annual renewal of their licenses.  Recently the Service and the Department of the Interior (Department) identifiedseveral areas in which the inspection fee system was inconsistent withthe Federal Government's financial management policies. First, the Servicedid not integrate the inspection fee billing system into the overall financialmanagement system of the Service. Therefore, the Service could not maintainaccounts receivable for the money owed to the Government. Second, the Servicedid not collect fees at the time it performed inspections. This resultedin what amounted to interest-free loans to licensees. Finally, the Servicehas not charged interest for late or unpaid bills.  To correct these problems, it was recommended that the Service collectinspection fees at the time of the inspection. The reviewers further recommendedthat the Service integrate the license and inspection fee program intoits overall financial management system. Accordingly, the Service is proposingregulatory changes to implement these recommendations.  Beginning October 1, 1988, the Service stopped billing licensees for licenserenewal fees. To renew a license, the licensee will have to submit an applicationat least 30 days before the expiration date of the current license. TheService will process applications for license renewals according to theprocedures in andSection; 13.24 of Title 50, Code of Federal Regulations.This does not amount to a change in regulations. The existing procedureof billing licensees for license renewal has been, in fact, a deviationfrom the requirements of the regulations in Part 13.  Also effective October 1, 1988, the Service ceased billing licensees forinspection fees. The Service will require licensees to pay for each shipmentat or prior to the inspection. The Service issued its last bills for import/exportfees on November 4, 1988.  Because it has been virtually impossible for the Service to manage thesystem of allowing five (5) prepaid shipments to each licensee, the Servicewill modify its user fee system. These changes will not increase any licensee'scosts for user fees, and will reduce the user fee costs for those licenseeswho import or export fewer than five (5) shipments annually. The Servicewill reduce the annual import/export license fee from $250 to $125. TheService will eliminate the five (5) prepaid shipments and will charge a$25 inspection fee for each shipment. Therefore, those licensees who importor export five (5) or more shipments annually will pay the same fees asthey have been paying. However, licensees who import or export fewer thanfive (5) shipments will pay less in user fees.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments  </ITAG>The proposed rule was published on September 8, 1988 (53 FR 34795). Threeletters were received which offered comments on the proposal. A customsbrokerage and a fur company suggested that the Service was moving backwardsin returning to a manual fee collection system. The recommended the Serviceretain the computerized, monthly billing system for the convenience ofbusinesses involved. The fur company indicated it would be inconvenientfor their field representatives to use a credit card to charge inspectionfees at the time of each wildlife clearance. The Service understands thatthe return to a manual fee collection system may cause occasional inconvenienceand limited additional cost to some businesses engaged in the internationalwildlife trade. However, the Service has no choice for the moment but tocomply with the requirements of the Department of the Interior and Federalfinancial management policies regarding the collection of fees. The Serviceis currently exploring other methods of user fee collection which wouldbe more convenient to the public while remaining in compliance with theGovernment financial management system.  The third letter of comment was received from the Humane Society of theUnited States. The Humane Society objected to the reduction of the import/exportlicense fee and recommended that it be increased to $500 per year to morefully compensate the Government for the expenses of processing and issuinglicenses. As stated above, the Service is not actually reducing the feecharged for wildlife inspections, but simply omitting the five prepaidinspections for which an additional $125 was built into the license fee.The Service does not believe that a license fee of $500 is appropriateat this time, particularly for small businesses which engage in limitedcommerce in wildlife each year. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>The Department of the Interior has determined that thisdocument is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291 and certifiesthat this proposed rule will not have a significant effect on a substantialnumber of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq.</T3>).
