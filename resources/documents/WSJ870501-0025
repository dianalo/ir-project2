The citation is the second in a week by the Labor Department's job-safety agency against employers for record-keeping violations. Last Friday, John Morrell andamp; Co., a meatpacking subsidiary of United Brands Co., was cited, with a proposed $690,000 fine.    Ford has 15 days in which to appeal the citation to an OSHA review panel. The agency cited Ford for 119 alleged &quot;willful&quot; violations for improperly recording injuries including eye and back injuries, fractures, chemical exposure, strains and lacerations. OSHA also charged Ford didn't report several cases in which workers required hospitalization. The alleged violations occurred in 1985 and 1986, OSHA said.    &quot;Willful&quot; citations involve cases in which an employer knew a violation was occurring or was aware that a hazardous condition existed and didn't make a reasonable effort to eliminate it.    The agency also cited Ford for two alleged &quot;serious&quot; safety violations involving guarding of machinery and unsafe operation of a forklift truck.    In Dearborn, Mich., a Ford spokesman said Ford &quot;is reviewing each item of the citation and is considering whether it will appeal the matter.&quot;    Dr. Franklin E. Mirer, director of the United Auto Workers union's health and safety department, said the violations Ford was cited for were common throughout the industry, saying that the reported Hapeville injury rates &quot;were not dramatically different than from the rest of the company.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
