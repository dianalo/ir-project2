Gilead, based in Foster City, Calif., yesterday filed aninvestigational new drug application with the Food and DrugAdministration covering a new drug for the treatment ofAIDS-related blindness. The FDA's response typically comeswithin 30 days, after which the company may launch humantests.</LP><TEXT>   Gilead's president and chief executive officer, Michael L.Riordan, said the compound GS504 is the first of a suite ofexperimental new drugs that Gilead is developing fromnucleotides, the building blocks of deoxyribonucleic acid(DNA), the raw material of genes.   GS504 will be tested against cytomegalovirus, or CMV, avirus that frequently attacks AIDS patients, causinginflammation of the retina and eventual blindness. Whileanimal studies suggest kidney toxicity may be a side effect,other drugs have side effects as well.   Later this year, Gilead plans to file an investigationalnew drug application to test a second experimental drug,dubbed GS393, against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),which causes AIDS. In animal studies, GS393 so far appearsmore potent than Wellcome PLC's antiviral drug AZT, Dr.Riordan said. The compound also inhibits herpes virus, afrequent companioninfection of AIDS.   Dr. Riordan says these first two AIDS-related drugs may begiven in convenient oral formulas and also have a longhalflife, or active stint in the body, perhaps enablingdoctors to give less frequent doses. But he emphasizes thereis no guarantee of human safety or effectiveness. &quot;Nonucleotide (drug) has ever been in humans yet,&quot; he says.   The five-year-old company went public in December. Gileadis one of a new wave of biotech companies aiming to usegenetic building blocks to fight disease in a different waythan most established biotech firms. &quot;Old biotech focuses onthe production of beneficial proteins; we're focused onturning off disease-causing proteins,&quot; said Dr. Riordan.   GS504 is earmarked for Gilead's first time in clinicaltests, under its three-part program to treat diseases fromviral infections and heart disease to cancer. That program isorganized around three kinds of experimental compounds ofincreasing size: the small molecules for the AIDS virus,medium-sized strands for heart disease, and long strands thatwould block a gene that triggers cancerous growth. Gilead'scancer work is being done under a pact with Glaxo Inc.   The company has $105 million on hand to fund its ambitiousresearch and development program, Dr. Riordan said. Still,given the long lead time and arduous testing required forsuch experimental drugs, Gilead isn't expecting to seeproduct revenues for &quot;a few years,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
