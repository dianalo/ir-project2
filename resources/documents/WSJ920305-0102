The test, called a sigmoidoscopy, involves inserting asmall scope into the rectum. Many groups have urged using thetest on people over age 50 on the ground that it detectscolon cancer earlier when chances of successful treatment aregreater. But performing the $100 to $200 test just once onthe 60 million Americans over 50 would add at least $6billion to the nation's health bill, and whether the testprolongs lives has been open to question.</LP><TEXT>   The new report offers the strongest answer yet by showingthat people who had the procedure were significantly lesslikely to die of colon cancer than those who didn't have thetest. The study also reflects broader efforts aimed atdetermining the cost effectiveness and lifesaving value ofscreening tests for a variety of illnesses.   &quot;Our data suggest that sigmoidoscopy is among the mostefficacious of screening tests,&quot; says Joe V. Selby, assistantdirector for health services research at Kaiser PermanenteMedical Care Program, Oakland, Calif. At least 50% of allcolon cancers arise in the portion of the colon that thescopes reach, which means the test could cut the overalldeath rate from the disease by at least 30%, says Dr. Selby,lead author of the study in today's New England Journal ofMedicine.   Colon and rectal, or colorectal, cancer kills about 60,000U.S. residents each year, making it second to lung canceramong cancer killers. About 156,000 new cases are reportedannually. At age 50, a person faces a 5% risk of developingthe disease by age 80 and a 2.5% risk of dying from it.Because most colorectal cancers develop slowly, beginning aspolyps in the lower digestive tract, the disease isconsidered curable with surgery when detected early.   While the American Cancer Society and the National CancerInstitute already recommend that people over 50 undergosigmoidoscopy screening every three to five years, others,especially the federal Preventive Services Task Force, saythat evidence isn't sufficient to recommend the procedure inpeople without symptoms. The lack of consensus, as well asthe discomfort of the exam, may explain why many people don'tundergo it. By some estimates, only 10% to 15% of peoplewithout symptoms are tested even when their doctors recommendit.   The new study isn't a randomized clinical trial, whichresearchers agree would provide the best data to judge thetests. Steven Woolf, scientific adviser to the PreventiveServices Task Force, says he hasn't seen the report, but ifit meets the task force's research criteria, it could alterthe agency's position.   Pap smears to test for cervical cancer and mammographyexams for breast cancer are among screens most authoritiesagree have proven effective in reducing death rates. Theevidence isn't in yet for others. They include a new bloodtest for prostate cancer called PSA, for prostate specificantigen, though many urologists believe its use will improvesurvival rates for prostate cancer patients.   One concern among skeptics of the value of screeningpeople without symptoms is that tests will detect early-stagedisease in some people that left untreated wouldn't everaffect their health. But once found, the case for treatmentwould be compelling, exposing a person to unnecessary andrisky surgery.   The National Cancer Institute plans a large randomizedtrial involving 148,000 patients to test the efficacy ofpreventive tests for prostate, colon and rectal, ovarian andlung cancers. &quot;It will prove the value of screening and thatit saves lives or it will prove the lack of value ofscreening and save money,&quot; says Barnett Kramer, associatedirector, early detection and community oncology program atNCI. &quot;Or in some cases, it will do both.&quot;   In the current report, Dr. Selby and colleagues compared261 cases of members of the Kaiser Permanente plan who haddied between 1971 and 1988 of colorectal cancer that couldhave been detected by sigmoidoscopy with 868 other memberswho didn't die of colon cancer and served as controls. Amongthose in the &quot;case&quot; group, 9% had undergone sigmoidoscopywithin 10 years before diagnosis of the cancer vs. 24% of thecontrols. The results translated into a 59% to 70% drop incolorectal cancer deaths among those who had the test.</TEXT></DOC>
