But the humble trappings of Leszek's room belie his status as afuture member of the economic elite in his native Poland.   ``I want to build a house in Poland, so here I have to work tomake the money,'' said Leszek, who, like other Poles interviewed,spoke on condition that his surname not be used.   Leszek (pronounced LESH-ek) is one of thousands of Poles whohave fled the deteriorating economic situation in their homeland,where even staples such as bread and milk are often missing fromshops.   In 1988, of the 63,500 Poles who entered the United States astourists, about 14,000 stayed longer than their visas permitted,U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service figures show. Touristvisas usually are valid from three to nine months.   A higher percentage of Poles illegally overstay their visas thanresidents of any other major country, said INS researcher RobertWarren.   That number has fallen from 22,000 since 1986, the year a newimmigration law mandating penalties for employers who hire illegalaliens went into effect.   But the number of Poles illegally working here is stillconsiderable, said INS spokesman Carl Henderson in Chicago, wherethe majority of such Poles end up. Polish restaurants and shopsabound in this city, and Poles can get by with learning a minimumof English.   At Poland's consulate in Chicago, Vice-consul Robert Michniewiczacknowledged, ``With the economic situation in Poland, people areall wanting to get out and earn easy money.''   But he added, ``Most of them want to come here just to make somedollars and then go back.''   Wages at even menial jobs here far outstrip earnings in Poland,where monthly salaries average about $15 at the legal black marketexchange rate.   ``What I make here in a week, it would take me a year to earn inPoland,'' said Jadwiga, who earns $275 weekly for taking care of anailing woman here.   Even so, the 48-year-old research chemist noted, ``It wouldnever come into my head to leave Poland forever. Life in Poland isvery hard, but I don't want to be a foreigner all my life.''   And with dollars or West German marks in hand, a Pole can affordwhat many of his or her countrymen can only dream about _ luxuriessuch as a telephone, a car, even an apartment.   For other Poles, working abroad is simply a matter of survival.   ``I had to come here,'' said Marta, a high school teacher inPoland who has taken care of an elderly man in a Chicago suburbsince the fall of 1987.   Marta, 40, entered the United States on a tourist visa, leavingher 14-year-old daughter at home with the girl's grandparents.   She said she plans to return with some $15,000, which she saysshe will put in an interest-bearing dollar account in a Polish bankto supplement her salary so she can put food on the table.   ``I've paid a certain psychological price, but there's apositive side to it, too,'' Marta said. ``My daughter says shemisses me, but she understands we need the money.''   For many immigrants the price of American wages can be high.   ``They do the hardest and dirtiest jobs,'' said Michniewicz, thevice consul.   ``People are living six to a basement and working two or threejobs.''   Although Leszek, as a miner in Poland, could earn three timesthe average salary, that sum is still paltry when compared with the$5 an hour he can earn doing odd jobs at construction sites inChicago.   In his quest for a better life, Leszek, who is 37 but looksolder, left behind his wife and two daughters.   He plans on staying in the United States for about 18 months.Working a year in Germany previously allowed him to pay the $2,300cost of his trip here and to buy a car.   In his basement room, Leszek looks out the window at the tiresof passing cars, then shows off pictures of his wife and childrenin their Polish home.   ``Here it's such a wild life _ everybody's running aftermoney,'' he said. ``At home we have time to go to the sea or to themountains. Here they're working from morning to night.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, Oct. 2</NOTE></DOC>
