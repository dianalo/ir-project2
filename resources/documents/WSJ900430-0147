Constitutional law experts say the justices, who scarelyacknowledged the sweep of their recent ruling, significantlyaltered their approach to cases involving the &quot;free exercise&quot;of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment. The court gavestate and local governments substantially more authority toenforce their laws, even when those laws conflict withreligious practices.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's the single most dramatic change in free exercisedoctrine in the last 25 years,&quot; says William Van Alstyne, aDuke University Law School professor. &quot;It's the clearestdoctrinal turnaround in the constitutional area,&quot; saysMichael McConnell, a University of Chicago Law Schoolprofessor.   Free exercise cases, as they are called, have always beendifficult for the Supreme Court; they often require the courtto recognize special treatment for people because of theirreligious beliefs. In 1972, for example, the court ruled thatWisconsin had to exempt the Amish from compulsory publicschool attendance after the eighth grade; although the votewas 7-0, there were four separate opinions.   The case decided recently involved a challenge by AmericanIndians to an Oregon law that makes it a crime to use thehallucinogenic drug peyote. The Native American Church usesthe drug for sacramental ceremonies. The Oregon Supreme Courtruled that applying the ban to prohibit the religious use ofpeyote violated the free exercise of the Indians' religion.   But the U.S. Supreme Court, in an opinion written byJustice Antonin Scalia, reversed the state court ruling by a6-3 vote and said that a total ban on peyote use doesn'tviolate the First Amendment. Given the legal complexity ofthe case, it isn't the result that is so surprising, but theway that Justice Scalia justified the decision.   Beginning in 1963, in a major Warren Court decision, thejustices have said that state governments must have a&quot;compelling&quot; reason for enforcing a law that interferes withsomeone's religion. Since then, the court has ruled in somecases that a state's rationale was sufficient; in othercases, a majority has said that a state law infringed onreligious freedom.   But Justice Scalia simply discarded the &quot;compellinginterest&quot; test. Although saying he wasn't overruling thetest, he said that it has been applied only to state lawsdenying unemployment benefits to people who refused to workon their sabbath or under other conditions that violatedtheir religious beliefs. In all other contexts, he concluded,a state is free to require everyone to comply with a law thatis generally valid. A state may make exceptions for religiouspractices, but isn't required to do so by the Constitution,he said.   &quot;This is something of a revolution in doctrine,&quot; saysProf. Van Alstyne of Duke.   He and Chicago's Prof. McConnell agree that,theoretically, the ruling means that states aren't requiredto make exceptions to their laws to allow Catholic priests togive communion to minors, who would otherwise be legallybarred from drinking wine or other alcoholic beverages.   No one is suggesting that local sheriffs or state troopersstart rounding up priests for violating state drinking-agelaws. But under Justice Scalia's ruling, they could.   There are more practical examples. Many courts haverequired prison officials to accommodate requests by Jewishinmates to be provided kosher meals. Those requests could bedenied now.   Prof. McConnell, who has studied the history of theadoption of the free exercise guarantee, notes that therecent court decision failed to examine history at all. Even200 years ago, he says, &quot;free exercise of religion entailedexemptions from generally applicable state laws.&quot; He said 12of the 13 original states had free exercise guarantees intheir constitutions and made exceptions for differentreligious practices.   Even a member of the majority that upheld the Oregon law,Justice Sandra O'Connor, noted in a separate opinion that thecourt &quot;dramatically departs from well-settled FirstAmendment&quot; principles. The dissent, written by Justice HarryBlackmun, was even more blunt: &quot;It effects a wholesaleoverturning of settled law. . . .&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
