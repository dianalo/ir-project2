Voting 8-1 to overturn a $50,000 penalty against a now-dissolvedNew York City law firm, the justices said a federal court rule isaimed only at the lawyers who sign the offending documents. Therule does not apply to those lawyers' law firms, the court said.   The rule at issue says courts may deal with an offendingdocument by imposing ``on the person who signed it ... anappropriate sanction.''   Writing for the court, Justice Antonin Scalia said, ``Just asthe requirement of signature is imposed upon the individual, wethink the recited import and consequences of signature run as tohim.''   The federal rule requires litigating lawyers to inquire beforeattaching the required signature to any filing whether it has merit.   Scalia said, ``Where the text establishes a duty that cannot bedelegated, one may reasonably expect it to authorize punishmentonly of the party upon whom the duty is placed.''   Justice Thurgood Marshall was the sole dissenter, callingtoday's decison ``an unnecessary erosion of the discretion offederal trial judges.''   In other action, the court:   _Made it easier for workers to sue their unions over allegedfailures to offer fair representation.   The court unanimously reinstated a federal lawsuit a Toledo,Ohio, area sheet metal worker filed against his union five yearsago.   Lower courts had thrown out the suit, ruling the plaintiff wasalleging an unfair labor practice and that the National LaborRelations Board has exclusive jurisdiction over such claims. Thejustices said those courts were wrong.   _Ruled that cities and other local governments that interfereillegally in labor negotiations may be forced to pay damages forlosses suffered by management or workers.   The court ruled, 6-3, that Los Angeles officials are required tocompensate a taxi company that went out of business after the cityinterfered in a dispute between the company and its driver.   The lawyer-sanctions case stemmed from a 1982 lawsuit filed byNorthern J. Calloway, an actor who plays the character David ontelevision's ``Sesame Street.''   Calloway sued Marvel Entertainment Group and others, accusingthem of copyright infringement and other violations on a proposedanimated science fiction movie to be called ``The Skyrider.''   His suit sought $44 million in damages.   A federal judge dismissed the suit and imposed $100,000 insanctions against Calloway, $50,000 against his lawyer, RayLeFlore, and $50,000 against the former law firm of Pavelic andLeFlore.   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the penaltiesagainst LeFlore and the law firm, stating, ``Calloway's case was atall times very weak. From the very beginning (his) case sufferedfrom obvious and grave weaknesses.''   For example, the appeals court said, none of the people suedmade any money from the proposed movie project.   Today's decision reversed the 2nd Circuit court's rulingregarding the law firm's sanction.   LeFlore did not ask the high court to overturn the $50,000penalty assessed against him personally.   The case is Pavelic andamp; LeFlore vs. Marvel Entertainment, 88-791.</TEXT></DOC>
