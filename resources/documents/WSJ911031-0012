Manylawyers and political scientists say no, arguing that neitherCongress nor the states may add to the age, citizenship andresidency qualifications set forth in the Constitution.   But critics of state-imposed term limits on Congress missthe point. Term limits do not add another &quot;qualification&quot; forservice in Congress. They do not prevent anyone from havingan opportunity to serve in Congress. They merely prevent aperson who has already served a certain number of consecutiveterms in office from serving another consecutive term.</LP><TEXT>   State statutes that bar first-time candidates from runningfor Congress have been held to add to the qualifications setforth in the Constitution and have been invalidated. Forexample, the 1972 decision in Dillon v. Fiorina struck down aNew Mexico law requiring candidates entering a congressionalprimary to have belonged to their party for a year and to paya registration fee. But state statutes that simply limit thetenure of existing congressional officeholders have not yetbeen tested in court.   The constitutionality of such state term limits may,however, be tested next month. Florida's attorney general hasasked its state Supreme Court for an advisory opinion on aterm-limit initiative that would limit the state's members ofCongress to eight consecutive years in office. Three U.S.House members, led by Democrat Larry Smith, have filed briefsasking the court to rule state term limits unconstitutional.The court will hear arguments Friday, and may rule later thismonth.   By 6 to 1, the California Supreme Court ruled this monththat the state's new term-limit law was constitutional. Thecourt said the &quot;state's strong interests in protectingagainst an entrenched, dynastic legislative bureaucracy&quot;outweighed objections that term limits restrict voter choiceat the ballot box. But the court's decision affected onlyterm limits on state officials; federal officeholders weren'tincluded in California's limits.   Nevertheless, the California decision demolished many ofthe legal arguments made by incumbents. They claimed there isa &quot;fundamental right to be a candidate for public office,&quot;which they found among the &quot;associational rights&quot; in theFirst Amendment. They argued that voters were denied theright to be represented by the same legislator indefinitely,and that term limits discriminated against incumbents anddenied them their right to equal protection of the laws.California's highest court rejected all of these arguments.   Term limitations do not restrict the right to vote for acandidate because of his or her ideology or party. Therefore,they do not deprive voters of the freedom to associate withcandidates based on their viewpoint or with any particularparty. Rather, they prevent citizens from voting for aparticular candidate after he has served in office a setnumber of years. They may vote for that candidate again aftera &quot;waiting period&quot; has ended. The restriction is imposed in anon-discriminatory manner on all candidates regardless ofviewpoint or party affiliation.   In its 1972 decision Bullock v. Carter and again in its1982 decision Clements v. Fashing, the U.S. Supreme Courtdetermined that a particular candidate has no &quot;fundamental&quot;right to ballot access or to run for office. Federal courtshave upheld many state restrictions on who may qualify forballot access. They have never held reasonable,non-discriminatory restrictions on who may run a violation ofthe right to vote.   Likewise, term limits do not violate the Equal ProtectionClause of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court has foundthat clause violated only in those cases where ballot accessrestrictions discriminate against the poor and against new,small or independent party candidates.   Unlike the age, residency and citizenship requirements,term limits do not prevent any non-incumbent from running forCongress. Nor do they prevent a House member who has reacheda term limit from running for the U.S. Senate or vice versa.Nor do they limit an incumbent who leaves office for a periodof time (six years in Washington state) from running again.Moreover, term limits do not in any way modify the age,residency or citizenship requirements in the Constitution.Consequently, the argument that term limits are&quot;qualifications&quot; just like those already in the Constitution-- and that therefore they can be added only by amending theConstitution -- isn't particularly convincing. Viewed in thisway, term limits imposed by states would be constitutional.   The Supreme Court has long held that the power to ensure afair electoral system, truly responsive representation inCongress and a high degree of citizen participation inelections rests with the states. In its 1974 decision Storerv. Brown, the Supreme Court upheld a California law thatprohibited an independent candidate from running for Congressbecause he had changed his registration to Independent lessthan 11 months before the election. This law was found not tobe an improper additional qualification because a valid stateinterest was pursued.   In explaining that interest, the court recognized that&quot;there must be a substantial regulation of elections {by thestates} if they are to be fair and honest,&quot; and if some sortof order is to accompany the democratic process. As recentlyas June of this year, the Supreme Court again reiterated thatthe states have reserved to themselves, via the TenthAmendment, &quot;the power to regulate elections.&quot;   Elsewhere, the court in 1988 ruled in South Carolina v.Baker, that certain &quot;extraordinary defects in the nationalpolitical process might render congressional regulation ofstate activities invalid under the Tenth Amendment.&quot; Thecourt has not defined what it means by &quot;extraordinarydefects,&quot; but surely the fact that 98% of House incumbentsare routinely re-elected and that one out of five incumbentsran with no major-party opposition in 1990 might qualify.Where the incumbent is almost the pre-ordained winner in anelection, there is no effective competition of ideas orcandidates and incumbents are less responsive to the will ofthe electorate. On this basis, term limits merely ensure afair election system and the &quot;republican form of government&quot;guaranteed the states under the Constitution.   Should the court rule against term limits by the states,numerous other ballot access restrictions will likely bepassed that have many of the same effects as term limits. Oneoption would limit an incumbents' access to the ballot.States could allow an incumbent who has served a set numberof years in the same office to run again, but only as a&quot;write-in&quot; candidate. Presumably, if an incumbent were trulyeffective and popular he wouldn't find that a crushingobstacle. Two sitting U.S. House Members won their firstterms as write-in candidates. Incumbents would certainly havethe resources to educate voters in write-in procedures.   Another option would require candidates to have &quot;ballotstatements&quot; appear next to their names. Each candidate wouldhave to answer the question: &quot;Will you adhere to a -- yearterm limit?&quot; The answer would appear on the ballot so voterswould know a candidate's views on term limits. Many suchballot restrictions have been upheld by the courts.   Incumbents should take heed. If they count only on thecourts to safeguard their political castles, they may be infor a rude surprise.   ---   Mr. Mellor is president and general counsel of theInstitute for Justice, a Washington, D.C., litigation andeducational organization.</TEXT></DOC>
