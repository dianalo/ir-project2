Liberty customers will be able to begin collecting their deposits today, up to the $100,000 federal insurance limit, at the insolvent thrift's offices in Albuquerque and Raton, N.M., For deposits above that amount, account holders will receive a pro rata share of the proceeds as the institution's assets are liquidated.    The Bank Board said it resorted to a direct payout because it couldn't arrange an &quot;acceptable acquisition&quot; of the thrift, which had $150 million in assets and $165 million in liabilities as of March 31.    Liberty was the 123rd thrift to be closed or acquired in 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
