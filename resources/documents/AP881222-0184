The six member nations endorsed Saudi-sponsored talks between theSoviet Union and Afghan rebels amid speculation that oil giant SaudiArabia was moving toward resuming diplomatic ties with Moscow aftera 50-year break.   Attending the four-day summit were King Fahd of Saudi Arabia,Sultan Qaboos of Oman, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah of Kuwait,Sheik Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, Sheik Zayed bin Sultan AlNahyan of the United Arab Emirates and Sheik Isa bin Salman AlKhalifa of Bahrain.   They stressed their resolve to strengthen collective defensecapabilities and boosted economic integration plans with a ``ManamaDeclaration'' calling for speeded-up efforts toward a gulf commonmarket.   In a closing communique read by council Secretary-GeneralAbdullah Bishara of Kuwait, the group said it backed efforts by U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to promote a peace treatybetween Iran and Iraq to formally end their 8-year-old war. Iran andIraq agreed to a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in August.   The summit appealed for world support for an internationalconference on the Palestinian question to pave the way for a lastingArab-Israeli peace and an independent Palestinian state. It said thePalestine Liberation Organization must take part in such aconference.   The Gulf Cooperation Council was formed mainly as an economicalliance eight months after the gulf war broke out in September1980. But the conflict prompted efforts for military integration aswell.   Among steps approved by the council in its drive for a gulfcommon market was one entitling a citizen of any member nation toown shares in companies in another member country.   The six leaders requested an Arab League foreign ministers'conference in a new push to end Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war.   They expressed support for Egypt's reinstatement into the22-member Arab League, nearly a decade after Egypt's membership wassuspended to protest its 1979 peace treaty with Israel.   The leaders pledged to abide by oil production quotas agreed bythe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in November, totake effect Jan.1, and urged other OPEC member states to observetheir quotas.   Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait belong to the13-member cartel. Bahrain and Oman do not, but all six depend on oilrevenues.   The summit ``affirmed the necessity of cooperation between OPECand other oil producers outside the organization, considering thatstability of (oil) prices in a collective responsibility.''   Runaway overproduction by some OPEC members in recent months hasdriven oil prices below OPEC's benchmark level of $18 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
