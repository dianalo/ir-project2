The crossing is at the divided village of Sarp in the Black Sea province of Artvin. The gate will be opened later this year after a bridge is built over the Coruh River that forms the border.    The two other crossings are in Dogukapi in Kars and in the Agri province.    Most of the travelers using the gates are citizens with relatives on the other side of the border. </TEXT></DOC>
