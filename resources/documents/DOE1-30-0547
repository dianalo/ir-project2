Existing data are insufficient to determine an AcceptableDaily Intake (ADI) or a carcinogenic potency factor for Bromobenzenesas a class. 1,4-Dibromobenzene, 1,2,4-Tribromobenzene and Hexabromobenzenehave been determined to be systemic toxicants. An Acceptable Daily Intake(ADI), defined as the amount of a chemical to which humans can be exposedon a daily basis over an extended period of time (usually a lifetime)without suffering a deleterious effect, for 1,4-Dibromobenzene is .01(mg/kg bw/day), for 1,2,4-Tribromobezene is .005 (mg/kg bw/day) and forHexabromobenzene is .002 (mg/kg bw/day) for oral exposure.</TEXT></DOC>
