Nevertheless, Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, and counsel ArthurLiman said they feel the arrangement was correct that led toMcFarlane's plea of guilty on Friday to misdemeanor charges that henad misled Congress.   Mitchell and Liman, interviewed on the ``CBS This Morning''program, said they expect McFarlane's testimony will be helpful inthe prosecution and indictment of others involved in sales of U.S.arms to Iran and the diversion of profits to the Contra rebelsfighting the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.   McFarlane said Sunday that even though he has promised tocooperate with independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, he is unable toprovide any new information.   ``In saying I expect to testify, it's neither for nor againstreally anyone,'' McFarlane said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With DavidBrinkley.'' ``It's to say what I've already said on the record andthere's nothing new that I know of to change what's there. And asfar as I know that's all there is.''   Asked why Walsh would want him, McFarlane responded:   ``I suppose that he wants to hold everyone who did somethingwrong accountable and he's ceratainly done that with me, but itisn't a matter of being able to embellish what I've already said.''But both men say they think Indepedent Counsel Lawrence Walsh madethe right decision to allow McFarlane to plead guilty to lessercharges than committing perjury to Congress.   Interviewed today, Liman said, ``I think that the McFarlane pleawas an obstacle to be cleared by the independent counsel and Iwould expect him to take other action soon.''   Mitchell, although saying he agreed that McFarlane's testimonyis not likely to produce new information, said that ``his testimonywill be useful, I believe, according to the special prosecdutor, intestifying in any future trials that may occur.'   ``I think Judge Walsh really was not seeking so much hiscooperation as the principle that there was no justification forlying to or misleading Congress in the Iran-Contra affair,'' addedLiman.   McFarlane pleaded guilty to the four counts by falsely assuringlawmakers that members of his staff, specifically Lt. Col. OliverL. North, had not been involved in private efforts to arm theNicarguan rebels during a statutory ban on direct U.S. aid to theContras.   Each of the four counts carries a maximum penalty of one year inprison and a $1,000 fine.   As part of the plea agreement, McFarlane agreed to cooperatewith Walsh's inquiry into the secret sale of U.S. arms to Iran andthe diversion of profits to the Contras.   McFarlane, who resigned as President Reagan's national securityadviser in December 1985, traveled to Tehran in May 1986 with Northon a mission to deliver spare missile parts and persuade Iranianofficials to help obtain the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon.   The grand jury that Walsh impaneled 14 months ago is preparingto return indictments in the next several weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
