But with the Democratic primary a little more than two weeksaway, it's far from clear that he's overtaken the man seeking tobecome the city's first black mayor.   Koch has cut back on his well-known acerbic rhetoric, is spending$200,000 a week on television commercials, and has been seeking outother political leaders.   ``Ed Koch keeps publicly and privately pleading for my support,''Herman Badillo, a prominent Hispanic political leader and formercongressman, said last week. ``David Dinkins hasn't called.''   Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president, is Koch's chiefopponent in the Sept. 12 Democratic primary, and while Badillohasn't made his endorsement yet, his preference seems clear. ``Thefirst rule of politics,'' he said, ``is that you've got to ask.''   Koch has been doing a lot of asking this summer, most of it withhis trademark unselfconsciousness, and his efforts seem to be payingoff.   ``What we had to do was make the turnaround. We'd been in adescending posture, to say the least, for at least a year,'' saidDavid Garth, Koch's longtime strategist. ``Now it's a very closerace between Dinkins and Koch.''   But Dinkins still leads in the polls, and some analysts say themayor remains a hobbled candidate.   Two polls of likely voters last week showed Dinkins at 42percent, with Koch getting 33 percent or 34 percent. The other twoDemocrats were in the single digits, with about 10 percent undecided.   ``Koch had to burp up a little bit because he couldn't get anylower than he was,'' said Norman Adler, a consultant for theTeamsters union, which backs Dinkins. ``The mayor's worst enemy isnot Dinkins. It's the mayor.''   The two other Democrats are Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin andformer transit chief Richard Ravitch. Contestants for the Republicannomination are former federal prosecutor Rudolph W. Giuliani andcosmetics heir and former ambassador Ronald Lauder.   Unpopularity dogs Koch. He suffers from concern over soaringcrime, drug abuse and long-running corruption scandals. Votersexpress fatigue with his nearly 12-year tenure; in April, 58 percentwished he would not run.   Yet Koch knows how to court the electorate. The mainstay of hisrecovery has been a steady diet of television advertisements _$200,000 a week's worth since July 1 _ featuring citizens toutinghis accomplishments.   The mayor's image appears only in a small photo at the close. Theeffect is to play down Koch's personality while playing up hisexperience.   ``What the mayor has done right is to moderate his rhetoric. Heis talking more about performance. He is not engaging in anypersonal attacks,'' said Paul Crotty, his campaign manager. ``Hesays he is a kinder, gentler Koch, and he has been for the betterpart of the year.''   Koch still would likely lose a kind-and-gentle contest withDinkins. Understated, non-combative, Dinkins has spent more timecollecting endorsements than dueling opponents.   For Dinkins, ``The unacknowledged campaign slogan for the lastsix months is operative for the last three weeks: Slow and steadywins the race,'' said Mark Green, an unpaid adviser and formerDemocratic candidate for the U.S. Senate. ``It's neither in Dinkins'character nor the campaign's need to throw a lot of last-second hailMary passes.''   Dinkins has sharpened his style somewhat, charging Koch withdivisiveness and mismanagement and painting him, in a television ad,as a patron of housing for the wealthy. But Dinkins' message,overall, remains mild; one ad's tag line proclaims, ``You don't haveto be loud to be strong.''   The approach has its critics. ``Dinkins has just been too weak acandidate,'' said Badillo, who has had fallings-out with bothDinkins and Koch in past political wars. ``He's been too timid. He'snot been effective. And he's taken the Hispanic community forgranted.''   Although ethnic politics have not played a dominant role, eachcandidate has sought to expand his base. An ad for Dinkins stresseshis support for Israel and his criticism of Islamic minister LouisFarrakhan. Koch, who is Jewish, has ads that are peopled heavilywith blacks and Hispanics.   ``We're counting on a healthy proportion of the African-Americanvote,'' said David Fishlow, spokesman for Dinkins. ``But we alsohave lots of white and Hispanic areas targeted for get-out-the-voteoperations.''   Getting out the vote is key in the primary. Dinkins, with strongunion support, expects 7,000 volunteers to hand out literature, workthe telephones and take voters to the polls. Koch expects 2,000volunteers.   ``David Dinkins does have a tactical advantage on Election Daybecause he does have troops. On the other hand we have a tacticaladvantage in our incumbency,'' said Crotty. ``We've always believedthat as you got closer and closer to the primary, Koch would lookbetter and better.''</TEXT></DOC>
