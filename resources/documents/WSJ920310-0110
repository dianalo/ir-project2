Lawton Chiles, and therein lies awarning for wanna-be presidents.   Mr. Chiles handily ousted the Republican governor, BobMartinez, in 1990 while running as a neoliberal. He didn'tcall himself that, but if the term means a belief in applyinggovernment widely, though creatively, while eschewing the oldwelfare-state formulas, then Gov. Chiles is a pretty goodfit.</LP><TEXT>   The former U.S. senator is strong on &quot;public-privatepartnerships&quot; to leverage the effect of state expenditures.He wants to streamline and decentralize government. He's gothis $91 million version of &quot;Healthy Start&quot; for children. Heseeks to broaden the tax base.   In short, Gov. Chiles is following the basic playbook ofintellectuals and politicians who say they've learned fromthe Democratic Party's setbacks but recoil at Reaganiteexcesses. Newspaper editorialists love his ideas. But there'sa problem. After demanding a $1.35 billion tax increase, asthe price of his civic renewal, he's wildly unpopular withthe people.   Even at Bob Martinez's nadir, his ratings were never thisbad, according to Robert Joffee of the Mason-Dixon Floridapolling firm. Fewer than one in six Floridians believe thatGov. Chiles has made state government more efficient.Two-thirds oppose a tax increase.   Last week the Legislature passed a budget without raisingtaxes. It's unacceptable to Gov. Chiles. The legislators alsoare hammering out new districts in which they all must runthis year, and with an eye to what happened in New Jersey,none wish to commit political suicide.   Many governors have skidded in surveys as they've moved tosquare recessionary revenues with the incessant demand forpublic-sector enlargement. Miffed recipient constituenciescan be bought off later when there's more in the state till.Animus over a tax increase may stick longer, particularlywhen a candidate such as Mr. Chiles in 1990 promised to&quot;downsize&quot; the bureaucracy to balance the budget.   Florida's story isn't just the tribulations of onereforming populist caught in a vise. After growing byone-third during the 1980s, to become the fourth-largeststate, it has pooped out in the 1990s worse than the nationas a whole. Unemployment has been 8.6% since the turn of theyear, and the 42.6% rise in the number of food-stamprecipients led the U.S. in 1991.   What happened? Domestic tourism fell off, with arrivalsdown 3.5% last year even though Latin American and cruisetraffic increased. Visitations generate a fifth of theFlorida economy. The Pentagon builddown has hurt, too: In1989, Florida had the fourth-largest DefenseDepartment-related payroll in the nation. Construction isunusually important, and it sagged along with real estate inthe late '80s. (Growth controls and development fees figuredin that.) Finally, declining yields on fixed-income assetshave curbed the entertainment and recreation spending of manyretirees.   However, poor-mouthing doesn't tell the whole story. Aselsewhere, government kept growing after the private economyturned. As late as last month, Florida general-fund taxrevenues were rising nearly 9% above February 1991. Whatgives?   Spending is up, despite ballyhooed budget cuts. Medicaidfor young and old knows no bounds. But the problem doesn'tstop there, or start with Mr. Chiles. Former Gov. Martinez,now busy as czar in the losing U.S. &quot;drug war,&quot; was sogenerous with taxpayer funds that by 1989, Florida's publicexpenditures as a percentage of personal income had risennearly 11% since 1986 (more than four times the U.S.average). In '86, by that measure, it was the fifthleast-burdened state.   The fiscal fight in Florida today is centered on theschools, with the usual intense pressure being exerted bytax-paid personnel and PTAs on students and their parents.Polling data last year already showed the classroom was mostfavored to get more public money.   But a birth-rate bulge, as in California, Texas and Utah,has had the schools in Florida waxing for a decade. Untillately, spending grew far faster than student population. Andthe emphasis hasn't been entirely on teaching. The state haswhat may be the nation's most over-developed high-schoolfootball programs -- more so than in Texas, some believe.(Still, according to Lawrence Silver of the booming RaymondJames brokerage firm in St. Petersburg, who served on a studypanel, eliminating the whole athletic budget in his county'sschools wouldn't even save 3%).   A big-business group, Florida TaxWatch, emphasizes thecostly growth in district-level administration -- nationally,the &quot;educational blob.&quot; While teacher ranks grew steadilywith student population until this year, or 23% from 1985-90,explosive increases were seen in &quot;assistants for instruction&quot;(496%), &quot;assistant subject specialists&quot; (342%) and&quot;non-policy facilities&quot; overseers (200%). All of thesedistrict posts are paid, on average, more than faculty.   Teacher pay did rise more than 21% in the three schoolyears prior to this one. It now averages $31,070 for the10-month job. Salaries and faculty size now aren't growingapace with enrollment, but there's little evidence oflayoffs. You wouldn't know that from the teacher-unionuproar.   Gov. Chiles led the teachers and their placards (&quot;Pay Nowor Pay Later&quot;) in a march on the capitol two weeks agodemanding the conservative Senate yield to his $1.35 billiontax increase so the schools can get $838 million. The measureincludes an extension of the sales tax to various personalservices and power utilities (a broader such effort undid Mr.Martinez), and higher levies on corporations and investmentsby the wealthy.   Gov. Chiles sought to sell the increase (his &quot;investmentbudget&quot;) as costing a middle-class family the equivalent of alarge pepperoni pizza each month. (Higher earners would payfor additional toppings; the poor would get off with a plaincheese pie.) Few bought a slice of it.   If and when the popular taste for this cooking returns,Floridians can expect to be served up the state's firstincome tax. But veteran anti-tax guerrillas in hard-pressedDade County (Miami) boast they have even the current Chilesplan corked with the threat of an angry electorate. St.Petersburg Times political reporter Bill Moss, while moresympathetic to the governor, notes a widespread wonder: &quot;Howcomes there's no blood in the streets in Tallahassee?&quot; whenthe rest of the state suffers.   The fact is Gov. Chiles, blocked from most of his reformsby statehouse parochialism and attentive to his own interestgroups, has been unable to downsize. His predicament mirrorsthat of the next U.S. president. Whatever the returnstonight, a candidate such as Bill Clinton -- who, like hisfellow Southern governor, is backed by public-employee unions-- might take heed of the other Florida results.</TEXT></DOC>
