About 30 small mountain villages in central and southern Italyand 10 on the island of Sicily were still isolated Sunday by snow,up to two six-feet deep in some places. The snow blocked blockedroads and passes.   Four of the missing were aboard the oceanography research vesselPosillipo-Loran, missing and presumed sunk in the storm-tossed seaoff Naples. Waves as high as 21 feet hampered the search for thecrew.   The body of a fisherman whose boat apparently was swamped duringthe storm washed up on a beach near Rome early Sunday. Authoritieswere still looking for the other man aboard the boat, who waspresumed drowned.   Italian news reports said five other deaths from trafficaccidents and heart failure had been attributed to the snow and cold.   The thermometer dipped as low as six degrees below zero in theDolomites in far northern Italy and to freezing as far south asSicily. None of the snow fell on Rome, but the city was gripped byfreezing temperatures.   In Vatican City, Pope John Paul II on Sunday blessed nativitydolls during a traditional ceremony at St. Peter's Square, where twofountains that normally shoot streams of water were locked in ice.</TEXT></DOC>
