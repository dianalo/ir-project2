But the service, studying proposals for the new fiscal-yearbudget, is fighting to spare at least 14 aircraft carriers fromWhite House pressures to trim the military's most favored weaponsprograms.   President Bush, who is slated to deliver his budget to Congresson Jan. 22, may be called upon to make the final decisions on anysuggested cuts, given their controversial nature.   ``We're robbing Peter to pay Paul,'' the Pentagon official saidof the current budget-juggling exercise. He spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The Fiscal 1991 spending plan will be a key barometer of thePentagon's ability to respond to pressures from budget cutters onCapitol Hill and in the Office of Management and Budget.   White House budget planners have told Defense Secretary DickCheney he can spend a little more than $292 billion in the newbudget year, which begins next Oct. 1. That means Pentagon spendingwon't keep pace with inflation, which the administration hasprojected will increase at an average rate of 4.1 percent.   The Navy, like other services, is being forced to trim programsit holds to be successful _ such as the Trident _ in order to meetthese goals, said the senior official.   The official said the service is ``seriously considering''stretching out the annual purchases of the strategic Trident substo every other year.   The sub's billion-dollar price tag has made it easy prey forlawmakers advocating less lavish spending on strategic nuclearweapons programs amid the warming of relations with the SovietUnion.   In November, the Electric Boat Division of General DynamicsCorp. in Groton, Conn., won a contract to build the 17th Tridentsubmarine.   But due to its high cost and complexity, funds for the submarineare stretched out over several years.   Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III has told Rep. John G.Rowland, R-Conn., that he expects to request full funding for the18th Trident submarine in the fiscal 1991 budget.   But the letter made no mention about long-term procurement fundsfor additional submarines.   ``I'd put my money on some type of stretch-out,'' said anotherDefense Department official, asked about the future of the Tridentprogram.   The official said it was ``premature'' to talk about an end tothe program, and said that if an every-other-year purchase policyis finally adopted, ``it may not even compromise the long-termnumber'' of submarines, widely exepted to be 24.   The service's World War II-era battleships also have becometargets of budget cutters on Capitol Hill, particularly in theaftermath of last spring's explosion aboard the USS Iowa, whichclaimed 47 sailors' lives. The tragedy spawned a series ofcongressional hearings, where lawmakers voiced sharp criticism ofthe huge ship's safety procedures and personnel practices.   Even the chief of naval operations, Adm. Carlisle A. Trost,admitted at one hearing that the future of the four warships was``up for grabs'' in the budget debate. But the Navy leadership isloathe to let the warships go, the senior official said.   ``Nobody _ not the Army, not the Marine Corps, not the Navy,wants to give those ships up,'' the official contended, arguingthat their mobile firepower offers a major boost when a presidentcalls for a little ``gunship diplomacy.''   ``The '91 (budget) plan calls for putting two in mothballs. Butwe'd still have two and we want to hang on to those,'' he said.   The official argued against putting all four 58,000-ton vesselsin mothballs again, citing the high costs and problems that aroseduring their remodernization in the early 1980s.   The Navy was forced to ``call up old, retired sailors'' to helpin the rebuilding of the ships, the official said.   ``When it came to taking the propellers off the darn things,there was only one retired chief petty officer who knew how to doit _ and you had to use special explosive charges to do it,'' theofficial said.   The second DOD official noted that congressional pressure maywork against mothballing the battleships, since their home portswere to be dispersed among four states under a revised program.   ``Our phones rang off the hook'' from lawmakers unhappy aboutTrost's suggestion of the ships' possible demise, the official said.   The senior official said that the Navy is fighting to save atleast 14 aircraft carriers during the next fiscal year.   One carrier _ the World War II-era Midway _ is scheduled forretirement next year, which would bring the fleet from 15 to 14.   ``Tell me, which commitment are we supposed to walk away from?''the official asked, pointing out that the U.S. commitment to sailthe Indian Ocean and keep tabs on the potentially explosive PersianGulf haven't changed.   The official also said the requirements of the Navy mostprobably will increase as the service is asked to place more poweron the high seas to advance the nation's war against illicitnarcotics traffickers.</TEXT></DOC>
