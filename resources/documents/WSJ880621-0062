For most managers, they start early Monday and go on and on -- and on -- through the week. Senior executives spend an average 17 hours a week in meetings, a recent study found, plus six hours getting ready -- and more hours recovering.    &quot;There are too many of them, with not enough meaning,&quot; contends Harry Thompson, president of GenCorp Inc.'s reinforced-plastics division. Agrees Robert Lefton, president of Psychological Associates Inc., a St. Louis consulting firm: &quot;We're meeting managers to death.&quot;    Mr. Lefton recently attended a meeting at a large West Coast manufacturing company that had been scheduled to consider a major restructuring. Instead, the 18 executives present lapsed into a 90-minute discussion about what food to serve at an office party. &quot;I asked the guy sitting next to me to estimate the salaries of the people in the room, and figured out that conversation cost the company $2,200,&quot; he says.    Yet meetings can't be missed. Even when there's no clear agenda, corporate pow-wows are power arenas where careers are made and broken. It's here, in the conference room, that chief executives reveal their strengths and weaknesses and middle managers fight turf battles.    Meetings also reinforce the corporate culture. At International Business Machines Corp. it's sacrosanct to conduct a meeting without the symbol of that company's button-down, organization-minded culture: flip charts. And at Limited Inc., the specialty-retailing giant, meetings typically mirror the company's penchant for a rah-rah team spirit -- with cheers offered for goals met and pats on the back to help meet future objectives.    What follows is a survivor's guide for managers faced with meeting mania.    PLOTTING STRATEGY   No longer is it enough to pore over reams of reports and memos the night before you're due in the conference room. Now there are meetings to prepare for meetings -- and they're often the most crucial gatherings of all.    Consider the marketing manager at a consumer products company who was eager to launch a new advertising program. Rather than boldly broach the idea at a department confab, he met first with associates to garner support -- promising to back them on one of their pet projects if they backed him. When the department meeting occurred, associates and subordinates, whom the marketing manager also had coached, talked up the plan -- presenting a united front to bosses.    Generally, such preparation pays off. &quot;What you get is a ritual dance, an idea being ratified but made to look as if it's just been thought of,&quot; says Arnold Brown, an organizational consultant at Weiner, Edrich andamp; Brown Inc. in New York.    LEARN SMALL TALK   Expect to spend a lot of time at meetings waiting for the boss to show up. It's fashionable for senior executives to make a late entrance. Meetings scheduled for, say, 9 a.m. rarely begin until 9:20 at the earliest, even though that will automatically delay back-to-back meetings that fill managers' schedules.    One chief executive at a Fortune 500 manufacturer was perpetually at least a half-hour late to meetings, recalls Len Schlesinger, a former consultant to the company. And when he finally did arrive, he insisted he was on time. &quot;I'm not late because the meeting can't start without me,&quot; he declared.    Subordinates didn't dare protest, although the chief executive's self-centered tardiness didn't go over with all outsiders. Mr. Schlesinger, after an especially long wait, says he stared coldly at the CEO when the executive proclaimed that the meeting couldn't start without him, and retorted, &quot;I'll be intrigued to see if it ends when I leave, which I'm going to do right now.&quot; (Surprisingly, the CEO didn't use that brash criticism against Mr. Schlesinger, who subsequently became the executive's personal consultant).    WHEN LESS IS MORE   The more who attend a meeting, the slimmer the chances any work will get done. Everyone wants some air time -- if only to show how persuasive they can be -- and meetings with 10 or more participants tend to digress from their formal agendas and run hours longer than they should, says Robert Kelley, a professor at Carnegie-Mellon University's business school.    GenCorp's Mr. Thompson took along just two associates for a technical meeting with a customer -- only to face a room filled with 25 managers. &quot;The issues we needed to resolve weren't that deep, but they had people from every level of the organization, and each of them had to put their two cents in,&quot; he says. The result: The meeting Mr. Thompson figured would last two hours took all day.    TURF BATTLES -   Get ready for power struggles over who gets what assignment as a result of the meeting, whose ideas win out and who gets rewarded. At Chemical Bank in New York, Pat Cook, a former senior vice president, says that after a bank reorganization, she spent 80% of her time in meetings &quot;fighting turf battles so my staff could do its work.&quot; Top executives had broadly determined how the bank's major businesses would be restructured, but &quot;there were numerous details to work out about who exactly would control what work.&quot; That triggered a stream of meetings at which there was &quot;endless battling that often only resulted in analysis paralysis. Someone would decide we needed more data and order junior managers to do a study,&quot; says Ms. Cook, now an executive recruiter at Ward Howell International Inc.    Meetings don't necessarily promote truces between warring divisions or rival executives. Indeed, the vice president of marketing and the vice president of operations at a financial-services company attended the same meetings for five years without ever speaking to each other. Their refusal to communicate except by memo became known to superiors only after Psychological Associates' Mr. Lefton attended a meeting with them and asked why they spoke to everyone but each other. The company president &quot;almost fell out of his seat when they admitted they hadn't spoken in years,&quot; Mr. Lefton says.    THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE   If American managers often have trouble speaking to each other, the problems are only compounded when Americans meet with their foreign counterparts. William J. Madia, senior vice president of Battelle Memorial Institute, a private technology research center, says language barriers often leave his staff feeling confused and angry. The gulf has even threatened to destroy projects. &quot;My staff will come to me angry and say, 'Helmut said it was a dumb idea,'&quot; he says. &quot;Only after several more meetings do we realize that Helmut basically liked the idea but had a few concerns -- and didn't have the vocabulary to explain that.&quot;    LEADER OF THE PACK   Forget the notion that business meetings are designed to reach a group consensus. &quot;Meetings are really for the leader, and are intended to serve his or her purposes,&quot; contends Lynn Oppenheim, a psychologist at the Wharton Center for Applied Research.    Thus, chief executives often use meetings to reinforce their status as king of the hill. &quot;I've been at meetings where the chief executive has publicly and nastily berated his No. 2 man for doing something when the CEO was away -- simply to make clear who's in charge,&quot; says Mr. Brown, the organizational consultant.    For operating executives, meetings are crucial for determining which businesses get more or fewer resources -- a process that can be traumatic for middle managers who must defend their bottom-line results. A purchasing manager at a Cleveland manufacturer, for example, must attend a monthly meeting with about 15 colleagues and the senior operating executive that starts at 8:30 a.m. and continues until 7 or 8 p.m.    &quot;It's awful,&quot; he says. Before the meeting there is &quot;major preparation of charts, graphs, proposals,&quot; and during the meeting a review of all operations. Worst of all, the senior executive isn't reluctant &quot;to trash you if he doesn't like your results,&quot; the purchasing manager says. &quot;Once a month you face getting hit between the eyes with a two-by-four.&quot;    MOLDING THE MEETING   The reward for surviving meetings -- and climbing the corporate ladder in the process -- is being able to run meetings to your own liking. GenCorp's Mr. Thompson tries to limit meetings to an hour, and he invites only those who have a stake in what's being discussed. Jon Rotenstreich, president of Torchmark Corp., keeps meetings brief and to the point, sometimes by insisting everyone remain standing. &quot;It's amazing how quickly a meeting is over when you don't sit down and put your feet up,&quot; he says.    Mr. Schlesinger, the former consultant who now is executive vice president and chief operating officer of Au Bon Pain Co. in Boston, discarded the couch and conference table in his office and has pared his staff meetings to just three a week -- an hour-long meeting with one manufacturing unit, a two-hour brainstorming meeting with a start-up unit and a luncheon meeting with his two partners.    &quot;Once you get to the point of being able to call meetings, you can also not call them,&quot; he says.    ---                   'They're in a Meeting'   The average chief executive officer spends about 17 hours each week in meetings.
