Department of Defense.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Navy Official Kills IRM Consolidation for ReservesandM;A senior Navy official has killed a plan to consolidate IRM for the NavalReserve because it conflicted with the Bush administration's continuingDefense Management Review.andM;The plan would have combined two reserve systems and ADP support from theNaval Regional Data Automation Center in New Orleans (NARDAC NOLA) in a newcommand within the Naval Reserve Force.andM;The plan was endorsed by several high-ranking Navy officials but was stoppedin an Aug. 1 memo from Rear Adm.andP;  R.M.andP;  Walsh, assistant vice chief of navaloperations in the Pentagon.andM;Walsh's decision was supported in the preliminary findings of a review of thenew organization by the Naval Audit Service, which found the plan in conflictwith directives from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).andM;The auditors said establishing a new organization for the reserves conflictswith the intent of the OSD Corporate Information Management memorandum ofOct. 4, 1989, and the Defense Management Review Decisions (DMRDs) plans toconsolidate and reduce redundancy in DOD.andM;Walsh told the vice chief of naval operations the new organization would haveperformed functions identical to those of a central design activity (CDA).andO;In its final version, however, the new organization would have been only a&quot;support activity,&quot; not a CDA, Vice Adm.andP;  Jerry O. Tuttle, director of space,command and control, had said in a memo to the vice chief.andM;Center ConsolidationandM;CDAs and data processing centers are subject to consolidation across theboundaries of the military services, in accordance with the DMR.andP;  CDAs arethe organizations within the services that develop systems for use by two ormore commands.andP;  NARDAC NOLA is both an ADP center and a design center.andM;The effort to form a new Naval Reserve organization began last year when astudy team of IRM officials examined reserve system problems.andM;The Naval Reserve Personnel Center also maintains a New Orleans-based systemthat would have been included in the new organization.andP;  The attempt tocombine the directorate, personnel system and NARDAC support under a newreserve command was first characterized by its backers as creation of acentral design activity.andM;Rear Adm.andP;  J.E.andP;  Taylor, director of the Naval Reserve, chronicled managementproblems with reserve systems in a March memo to the vice chief of navaloperations supporting the plan.andM;&quot;The increasing inability to assign, pay and mobilize selected reservists dueto fragmented management of reserve information systems has precipitated acritical requirement to consolidate the various reserve IRM systems into onemanagement structure,&quot; Taylor said.andM;Taylor's memo endorsed the recommendation of the study group and called forthe consolidation of IRM for the reserves in a new Echelon III Central DesignActivity command&quot; under the New Orleans-based Naval Reserve Force Command.andM;Taylor's decision was endorsed by Rear Adm.andP;  S.F.andP;  Gallo, commander of theNaval Military Personnel Command, Vice Adm.andP;  J.M.andP;  Boorda, deputy chief ofnaval operations (manpower, personnel and training), and Tuttle.andM;Tuttle said that instead of moving the NARDAC into the new organization thecenter should remain in the plan only in a support capacity -- which meantthe new organization would not qualify as a CDA.andM;&quot;We have discussed this issue with Rear Adms.andP;  Taylor and Gallo and are inagreement on not creating a new central design activity,&quot; Tuttle wrote in hismemo to the vice chief of naval operations.andM;&quot;Thus we recommend the new organization be characterized as a supportactivity to consolidate oversight of Naval Reserve information systems,define requirements and to execute policy in a single chain of command.andP;  Itshould not be considered a central design activity.&quot;andM;But the audit service reviewed Tuttle's plan for the organization and labeledit a &quot;duplicate design activity.&quot;andP;  The auditors' preliminary report said, &quot;Ifallowed to proceed, this plan will result in uneconomical operations,inefficient use of resources, and the duplication of effort with NARDACNOLA.&quot;andM;Doomed PlanandM;Walsh told the vice chief that in any case the plan should be killed becausefunctions performed by the proposed organization conform to CDA definition.andO;&quot;If consolidated effort does not result in CDA, I question the utility ofcreating another command or independent shore activity with a primary missionof managing Naval Reserve information systems.&quot;andM;When a Navy consolidation team working in the Pentagon reported to OSD, theyrecommended leaving NARDAC NOLA in place to serve a variety of active andreserve component functions.andM;As proposed in May, the OSD plan calls for the elimination of NARDAC NOLA.andO;Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood is expected to approve a DOD-wideconsolidation plan this fall, officials have said.andM;Regardless of what plan the Pentagon finally issues, there seems to be littledisagreement as to the need for a new approach to Naval Reserve IRM.andM;In November, according to an internal report, Tuttle formed a group thatidentified more than 170 discrepancies between reserve functional needs andautomated systems serving them.andM;Flaws found ranged from &quot;extremely difficult&quot; interfaces between systems to&quot;mistakes in computer programs,&quot; the report said.andM;Pay for 4,000 reservists in December 1989 was late, and processing backlogsranged from 9,000 to 20,000 jobs monthly, according to Taylor's memo.andM;In March 1989, a 12-member Navy study group composed of IRM officialsreported that sound &quot;principles of operation&quot; for Navy reserve systemsrequired a closer relationship between active and reserve facilities in NewOrleans, where the Naval Reserve Forces Command is based.andM;The group said that beginning in 1986 the reserves had begun taking effectivesteps to create distributed systems to support manpower, personnel andtraining functions under the Naval Reserve Command Management InformationStrategy (RESCOMMIS).andM;However, the study group found that the relationship between the reserves andNARDAC NOLA was strained.andM;In a recent interview, the reserve's director of information systems, EdAtes, described RESCOMMIS as a continuing set of systems developments andupgrades in which modules are delivered as they are fully completed and paidfor on a pay-as-you-go basis.andM;Through RESCOMMIS, the Navy has automated daily business matters that aretracked via the records the service keeps on weekend training activities inreserve units [GCN, July 23].andO;</TEXT></DOC>
