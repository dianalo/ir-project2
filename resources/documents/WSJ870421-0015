With the U.S. relying on imports for almost 40% of its oil -- and with that dependence growing -- &quot;it's important that we look at whatever resources we do have for the future,&quot; Mr. Hodel said.    In a formal recommendation to Congress, Mr. Hodel called for less restriction on drilling in the area than Assistant Secretary William Horn had suggested in an earlier, draft proposal. The secretary dropped Mr. Horn's proposal that the U.S. delay drilling in a caribou calving area. Environmentalists attacked Mr. Hodel's recommendation, while business and oil interests praised it.    Mr. Hodel's announcement kicks off a national debate over whether to exploit or preserve the environmentally fragile area on Alaska's North Slope. The 1.5 million-acre coastal plain is sandwiched between the mountains of the Brooks Range and the icy waters of the Beaufort Sea. It makes up 8% of the wildlife refuge, which Congress created in 1980. Oil leasing there is barred unless Congress specifically approves it.    Geologists say the area is the most promising unexplored onshore prospect for oil and gas in the U.S. According to the Interior Department, they say it has about a 5% chance of holding more oil than the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently accounts for 20% of U.S. production.    Environmental groups claim petroleum development there would harm wildlife. Mainly they warn of harm to the 180,000 migratory caribou that visit the area every summer to produce their young.    Randall Snodgrass, Alaska coordinator for the Wilderness Society, an environmental group, protested Mr. Hodel's recommendation as &quot;a step backwards into the dark ages of (Former Interior Secretary) James Watt.&quot; He said that leading caribou biologists had recommended protecting the most heavily used calving area of the refuge.    Mr. Hodel omitted from his report an estimate contained in the draft released by Mr. Horn last November that development &quot;could result in a major population decline and changes in distribution of 20% to 40%&quot; for the caribou herd. During a news conference, Secretary Hodel called that &quot;an error,&quot; asserting that the potential for decline in the caribou population can't be quantified. His report acknowledged that a decline could occur, but said that &quot;no appreciable population decline is expected as a result of oil development.&quot;    The caribou herd is the major source of food for several small villages in Alaska and Canada. Those villages and the Canadian government have opposed oil development in the refuge because of concerns about its impact on the caribou.    But oil companies and the Eskimo-owned Arctic Slope Regional Corp., which owns some of the land in the refuge, have pressed for broad leasing. Secretary Hodel agreed with their contention that exploration and development can proceed with little or no damage to wildlife. He noted that the caribou herd that grazes around Prudhoe Bay has tripled since oil development started there.    The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil industry, says concerns about harm to wildlife were voiced before the Trans Alaska Pipeline was built, and &quot;time has proved them wrong.&quot;    Major environmental groups either oppose oil exploration on the plain or favor further studies that would delay a leasing decision until after President Reagan leaves office. They say a larger, migratory caribou herd that uses the wildlife refuge plain -- called the &quot;Porcupine&quot; herd after a river in Canada it migrates past -- is more vulnerable than the herd near Prudhoe Bay.    The Interior Department said there is about one chance in five of finding economically recoverable oil under the coastal plain. Estimates of possible recoverable reserves in the area average 3.2 billion barrels and there is a 5% chance that 9.2 billion barrels could be recovered, which would make the area almost as rich as the nation's largest oil field at Prudhoe Bay.    Secretary Hodel said the area's potential reserves &quot;would provide tremendous economic benefits to our country,&quot; and are &quot;vital to our national security.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
