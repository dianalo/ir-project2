The significance of welding engineering for the construction andmaintenance of nuclear power stations cannot be rated high enough, afact that is clearly expressed by the lectures, poster sessions, andworkshops of the colloquium. Quite a number of interesting new findingshave been presented. At a stage of development that is entering the periodof technical maturity and normality, - shown by the operating statisticsof German nuclear power plants that are far above average worldwide -nuclear engineering is losing acceptance by the general public. Thisis why the expert knowledge accumulated over the years past has to beeffectively used for mastering the difficult time that lies ahead. Thecolloquium's contributions focussed on themes such as interaction betweenmaterials and filler metals, testing and safety, welding repair work,and maintenance.</TEXT></DOC>
