Not that it's easy. You do need a few hundred million dollars,quick access to information, a good computer program and awillingness to push the buy or sell button. Given all that, youhave a chance at another fortune.   Your activities have almost nothing to do with understanding thecompanies whose shares you buy or sell, or of assessing theirfundamental values, or measuring their management or determining ifthey can remain competitive.   Your purpose as a program trader is not so much to invest in thepotential earnings of corporations as it is to use the marketplaceas a tool. While you need not understand companies, you mustunderstand how to work the market.   Your focus is not just short-term in the usual sense of theword, which might mean a few months, but brief-term in the sensethat you deal with tiny price variations that might come and go ina matter of minutes.   Some critics say the various program trading techniques are buta step away from manipulation. They say the public, sensing this,will stay away from stocks, just as reasonable humans and animalsstay clear of the elephant herd.   In recent days, Donald Regan, former head of Merrill Lynch, saidsuch actdivities should be outlawed, and former Attorney GeneralNicholas Katzenbach suggested the public may come to view themarket as controlled rather than free.   Congress is upset. Much of Wall Street is also disturbed, andthe New York Stock Exchange has won approval from the Securitiesand Exchange Commission to curtail program trading whenever the DowJones industrial average moves 50 points in a day.   Much of the concern relates to extreme volatility that criticsattribute to program trading, which often kicks in automaticallywhen certain criteria are reached, thus exacerbating what otherwisemight be minor price changes.   Program trading was among practices cited in the collapse ofOct. 19 and in the 100-point-plus selloff in a few hours last week.Not only is it associated with big moves, rightly or wrongly, butwith reversals as well.   Institutions with computers, trading power, information andprograms can make quick money on volatility. But volatilitycontradicts one of the basic promises of organized marketplaces,that is, an orderly flow of transactions.   A loss of confidence in organized markets is deadly. Reduceconfidence and you reduce participation. Reduce participation andit means smaller commissions and maybe lower prices, too.   Evidence of lowered confidence abounds today, measured by suchthings as unstable prices, money left on the sidelines rather thancommitted to stocks, and shrunken price-earnings ratios.   Wright Investors Service points out that the price-earningsmultiple _ the number of times earnings at which stocks sell _ isnow down to about 13 times 1988 earnings for the Standard andamp; Poor's500-stock index. Last summer it was 20.   This and other evidence undoubtedly was considered by theSecurities and Exchange Commission when it cited ``the fragilenature of public confidence'' in approving the Big Board'slimitations on program trading.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv AMs Saturday April 23</NOTE></DOC>
