The bill vetoed Wednesday by Reagan called for a 10-yearassessment of the health and well-being of Americans and theAmerican diet with special focus on the elderly, pregnant women,infants, children and the homeless.   Under the bill, the secretaries of agriculture and health andhuman services would have reviewed in advance any federal advice toconsumers on what and what not to eat. The provision was designed tomake the federal government speak with one voice on nutrition andsafety issues.   ``We believe the veto of this legislation was unfortunate andnecessary,'' the statement said. ``We will press for passage of thislegislation at the outset of the 101st Congress,'' which meets inJanuary.   Reagan said in vetoing the measure that the ``administrationstrongly supports the principal goals of this legislation andreaffirms its commitment to use existing authority to achieve theseends.''   He said in a statement, however, that ``enactment of the billwould set up federal nutrition efforts on the wrong course.''   ``The bill would create a substantial amount of unnecessary andcomplex federal bureaucracy that would hamper the achievement of thebill's goals,'' Reagan said.   The congressional statement was signed by Senate AgricultureCommittee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., and House AgricultureCommittee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas, as well asSens. John Glenn, D-Ohio; Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Jeff Bingaman,D-Ariz.; and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Reps. Robert Roe, D-N.J.;George Brown, D-Calif.; Leon Panetta, D-Calif.; Doug Walgren, D-Pa.,and Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y.   Their statement quoted Scott Balin, American Heart Associationvice president and legislative counsel, as saying: ``The president'sveto of (the bill) does a serious disservice to the health andwelfare of the American people.''   ``We concur,'' the lawmakers said.</TEXT></DOC>
