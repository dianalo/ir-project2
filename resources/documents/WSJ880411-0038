The GSA suspended Gould in August 1987 from bidding on government contracts because of alleged &quot;serious improprieties&quot; involving certain contracts from 1982 to 1984. Gould contested allegations that it set higher prices for satellite digital-imaging devices sold to the government than those sold to commercial customers.    The GSA later limited the suspension to the division, enabling government agencies and prime contractors to resume contract bidding and award activities with other Gould units.    Gould, which makes electronic systems products, said that a resolution of related issues is under review by the Justice Department.    A spokesman for GSA couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
