Markets forspecific petroleum products are reviewed and reasons are suggested forchanges in prices. For gasoline, sales have increased only slightly overthe past few years, while the price has decreased by 12%. One reasonfor this is that the gasoline market has been taken away to some extentby diesel fuel. Aviation fuel's place in the market has not declinedas much as for other products, and with the foreseen boom in the airlinebusiness, the market for this fuel will grow and become an increasinglysignificant part of the refinery business. An end of the sales declinefor heating oil is suggested, because homeowners have little incentive,given current prices for alternate fuels, to convert to those fuels orto electricity. Motor gasoline supply is forecast to stay tight in theUSA, enabling Canada to export its excess. The overall trend seems tobe toward higher refined-fuel consumption in the future, a short-termweakness in crude oil prices, with recovery in the mid-1990s when demandwill be at a higher level and supply will have weakened. A better rateof return in the early 1990s is foreseen to bring about additions torefinery capacity. 21 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
