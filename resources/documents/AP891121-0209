SWINTON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A variety of activists on environmental, energyand social issues are drafting a political program to create anational Green political party as early as next year, organizerssay.   Modeled after Green parties in Europe, the party would seek tobuild nationwide policy on environmental and social issues that itsays get inadequate attention from the Republican and Democraticparties.   But Green planners are divided on whether their new party shouldmake an early run at national office, traditionally almostimpossible for American third parties, or first concentrate itsefforts on capturing local and state offices.   The Green Committees of Correspondence, a federation of about200 groups nationwide, mailed a 36-page list of proposed stands to3,500 people this fall, said Jim Richmond, coordinator for thegroup's national clearinghouse in Kansas City, Mo.   The Greens, as they call themselves, plan to ratify the finalplatform at a September 1990 meeting in Boulder, Colo. Meanwhile,the 200 groups are planning regional meetings to debate stands on19 issues, including land use, water, social justice, energy,health, education and finance.   ``It's activists and just regular folks of all stripes who areconcerned what direction this planet is headed in,'' Richmond saidof the 4-year-old group.   Born from the remnants of Vietnam war protesters and theenvironmental and anti-nuclear movements that appeared in the1960s, the largely white, well-educated Greens are far behindEuropean parties with the same name, said writer Brian Tokar, anorganizer.   Tokar, a toxic chemical and energy consultant, said the U.S. andCanadian Greens movements have been held back by the politicalsystems in each country.   Many European countries use a system of proportionalrepresentation in parliamentary elections, which allows even smallparties to get into Parliament if they win a minor percentage ofthe vote nationwide. Fringe parties have a harder time under theU.S. and Canadian systems, which elect representatives by district.   European Greens, united by polluted rivers and forests dyingfrom acid rain, won 30 seats this year in the 475-seat EuropeanParliament.   West Germany has the largest Greens contingent _ 42 of the 519federal parliamentarians. They also are in the legislatures ofBelgium, Italy, Austria and the Netherlands.   ``European Greens are basically defined by four pillars,'' saidTokar. Those are: ecology, social responsibility,community-oriented democracy and the non-violent movement _ wherethey are often seen demonstrating against nuclear missiles.   ``Greens in this country strongly embrace those principles, butwe've sought to elaborate on them,'' Tokar said from hisPlainfield, Vt., home.   The draft political program emphasizes:   _Creating environmental and economic policy that is not harmfulto the United States or the world.   _Decentralization, bringing decision-making back from thefederal and state level to local communities and the people whoselives it affects.   _An end to oppression based on race, sex and economics.   _Focusing on how the nation can work in harmony with the worldcommunity and nature.   ``The centerpiece is to rethink our relationship to the earth,''said John Rensenbrink, professor of political science at BowdoinCollege in Maine, another organizer.   Issues such as the destruction of the Earth's protecting ozonelayer are related to any number of government decisions in areas ofenergy, health, education and finance, he said.   A handful of people guide the group, which opposes the conceptof hierarchy. Decisions are made by committees of representatives,and a national leadership probably will not be chosen until theU.S. Greens jump into politics, he said.   As they continue to organize, Greens are forming clubs atuniversities and have state organizations in Michigan, California,Georgia, Maine, Wisconsin and Massachusetts, Rensenbrink said.   However, the would-be political party is hindered by divisionson several issues.   _Green principles call for restraining capitalism where it harmsthe environment or community life. But conservative Greens, whojoined to fight pollution, believe in a national economy driven byrelatively free capitalism, Tokar said.   _Greens members debating the proposed national platform areleaning toward a pro-choice abortion stance _ but some members areanti-abortion, said Richmond and Rensenbrink.   _Some Greens want a national party to organize on the state andlocal level, while others want to field a national candidate,Greens leaders said.   While the Greens are closest ideologically to liberal Democrats,Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Ginny Terzano said herparty is not worried.   ``The bottom line is that the Democratic Party has a strongplatform,'' she said, adding that it includes environmental andhuman rights issues.   Patrick Stroh, a New York University instructor in Americanpolitics, said the Greens may be able to push the issues theychampion up on the agenda of the established parties.   But he expects the winner-take-all election system coupled withdifficulty raising money from their grassroots, activistconstituency will keep the Greens all but invisible in U.S.politics. Third parties usually are most successful in localelections.   ``My overall assessment of their chances is very, very gloomy,''Stroh said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday AMs, Nov. 27</NOTE></DOC>
