(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal health officials will testwater from a city pool closed Tuesday in a search for the cause ofa rare respiratory problem diagnosed in four lifeguards.   ``I have my fingers and toes crossed that maybe this will giveus the answers we're looking for,'' said Pierrette Ray, the city'srisk-management officer.   Two lifeguards were diagnosed last month and two were diagnosedlast week with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a rare allergicreaction to prolonged exposure to various organic dusts andchemicals.   ``They're sick in that they feel tired all the time, just likeif you have a real bad case of the flu,'' Ms. Ray said.   The four lifeguards also have runny noses and runny eyes. Threewere assigned other city jobs and one quit to return to school.   ``In my mind there's no doubt there's a problem with the pool.But we don't know what it is,'' said Dr. Cecile Rose of theNational Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine inDenver. She diagnosed three of the four cases.   The national Centers for Disease Control and Harvard UniversityMedical Center will test water samples shipped them Monday for asmall protozoa called acanthamoeba, which has been associated withthe disease, said Govinda Visvesvara, research biologist with theCDC's division of parasitic diseases.   Some types of the protozoa are resistant to chlorine.   Water and air tests so far have turned up no cause for theillnesses. Results of the additional tests were expected in two tothree weeks.   The indoor pool was closed pending the additional test resultsand to avoid any harm to the pool's 19 other lifeguards, who willbe tested, Ms. Ray said.</TEXT></DOC>
