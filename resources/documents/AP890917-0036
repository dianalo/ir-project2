The bank said 21 industrial countries, from Luxembourg to theUnited States, increased their production by a combined 4.2 percent.Since their populations increase slowly, the average income of eachcitizen went up almost as much.   Some countries in Asia had much bigger increases in output, butpopulations grow faster there, holding down per capita growth.   The bank is owned by 151 governments, with the United Statesholding the largest block of shares.   Bank representatives gather here this week for the annual meetingof the bank and its sister organization, the International MonetaryFund. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady will represent the UnitedStates and President Bush is expected to speak.   A major topic will be progress made with Brady's new attempt tocut the burden of Third World countries' $1.3 trillion debt and the$131 billion they had to pay on it last year. He wants banks toforgive some debt or lower interest rates instead of just lendingnew money. The first deals have been worked out for Mexico and thePhilippines. Critics call them too small to let the debtor countrieskeep the money they need to create jobs, raise their low incomes andbuy goods from the United States and others.   ``The central goal of the World Bank is the reduction ofpoverty,'' the annual report said. ``Ways to achieve that are at theheart of the bank's activities.''   It concentrated heavily on loans to countries in southern Africa.Except for the Republic of South Africa, which does not borrow fromthe bank, that is one of the world's poorest areas.   The World Bank gets most of its funds from profits generated onloans _ just over $1.09 billion in the past year. Since no dividendsare paid, all the profits are plowed back into the bank's lending.Officials point out that the bank's object is to raise livingstandards in the borrowing countries, not to make money.   Its annual economic survey concentrated on low-income countriesand found that China and India were the fastest growing in thatcategory _ China with 11.2 percent growth and India with 8 percent.   India remained the biggest borrower from the bank, as it has beenin recent years, taking about $3 billion. Despite its record ofgrowth, India remains one of the poorest countries. The bankestimated the income of the average Indian both at $300 dollars in1987, the most recent figure available. The Chinese average was $290.   ``The newly industrialized economies of East Asia continued theirstrong growth, also over 8 percent as a group,'' the bank said.   The newly industrialized group includes such countries as SouthKorea with a $2,690 average income in 1987 and Singapore with a$7,940 average.   ``It is also notable that a number of `second-tier' newlyindustrializing countries _ Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand inparticular _ are moving into higher performance categories,'' thereport said.   Production grew by only 1.4 percent in Latin America and theCaribbean. That was slower than the growth of population, so averageincomes were down again. In southern Africa, production growthreached 3 percent, but the high birth rate resulted in a anotherdrop of average incomes.</TEXT></DOC>
