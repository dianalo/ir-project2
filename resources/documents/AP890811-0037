Diabetes was the underlying reported cause in 37,178 deaths inthe United States in 1986, the latest year for which finalstatistics are available, the national Centers for Disease Controlsaid Thursday.   Two reasons, the CDC said, lead researchers to believe thatdiabetes is behind many more deaths than that. The disease waslisted as a contributory cause of death on four times as many deathcertificates, while half the death certificates for people with thenon-insulin-dependent form of diabetes didn't mention the disease.   ``Thus, diabetes may be associated with approximately eighttimes as many deaths'' as indicated by the 37,178 reported _ orabout 297,000 deaths, the CDC said.   Besides being potentially fatal, diabetes _ in which the bodycan't properly handle sugars and starches _ also can cause kidneydisease, blindness and other serious complications.   The CDC estimates that in 1986, 10.5 million Americans haddiabetes. The Atlanta-based agency said nearly half _ 4.9 million _were undiagnosed cases in people who didn't know they werediabetic. CDC researcher Dr. Robert Hahn said undiagnosed cases areprojected from surveys involving blood tests.   The CDC said more than one in five diabetics have at least oneof three other conditions that can seriously affect their health:smoking, high blood pressure and overweight.   Twenty-seven percent of diabetics smoke, 47 percent have highblood pressure and 22 percent are at least 30 percent overweight,the CDC said. Researchers project that among diabetics, 39,000deaths each year are attributed to the additional problem ofsmoking, 30,000 are attributed to high blood pressure and 12,000are attributed to obesity.   Hahn said the highest additional risk for diabetics comes fromsmoking.   ``Among diabetics who smoke, the risk of dying (in a given year)is 2.3 times higher than for diabetics who don't smoke,'' he said.   Meanwhile, Hahn said, death rates from diabetes have declinedslowly during the 1980s, from 15.9 such deaths per 100,000 peoplein 1979 to 15.4 in 1986.   In the 37,178 reported diabetes fatalities in 1986, the highestrate was in Delaware, which reported 26.3 such deaths for every100,000 population. The lowest was in Nevada, with a rate of 11.6per 100,000.   But geographic region was not necessarily a clue to diabetesmortality rates: just north of Louisiana, second in the nation at22.1, was Arkansas, 47th at 12.4.   The CDC also reported Thursday that diabetes accounts for alarge number of ``end-stage'' kidney disease cases _ serious caseswhich require dialysis or transplants in order for patients to live.   Of 33,393 end-stage kidney disease cases reported to Medicareofficials in 1987, the CDC said, 28 percent were attributed todiabetes.   The agency noted that blacks, American Indians andMexican-Americans have diabetes end-stage kidney disease ratesbetween three and seven times higher than whites.</TEXT></DOC>
