The chairman and chief executive officer of San Diego Gas andamp; Electric Co. insisted that the company sign a definitive merger agreement with Tucson Electric Power Co. before breathing a word about negotiations to the public.    Mr. Page was right to be fearful. The ball has rolled away, just when he thought he had it in hand. Barely five weeks after the merger pact, SCEcorp, the parent of neighboring Southern California Edison Co., has proposed its own merger on attractive terms that could end San Diego Gas's independence and change life as Mr. Page has planned it.    Mr. Page, who hasn't decided whether to accept SCEcorp's offer or continue efforts to merge with Tucson Electric, has only himself to blame. In 10 years at San Diego Gas, seven of them as chief executive, he has changed the company from a blighted utility to one worth fighting over.    &quot;When I came here in 1978, we were headed into the financial tank,&quot; says Mr. Page, who is 55 years old. Since then, he has turned the company around, changing its philosophy on everything from power generation to personnel.    The lanky, redheaded Mr. Page has proved to be a revolutionary in the executive suite. &quot;He's one of the most creative utility executives in the country,&quot; says Arlon Tussing, a Seattle-based consultant.    Under his guidance, San Diego Gas became the first major utility to declare that it would just as happily buy electricity from someone else as generate power itself. Delighting in the uproar this caused in the industry, Mr. Page still keeps with him a four-year-old newspaper article in which he said that San Diego Gas won't ever again build major power plants from scratch.    Mr. Page set San Diego Gas to building a major transmission line to utilities in nearby Arizona, where there is a surplus of power. Today, the company buys electricity from nearby Mexico and from Canada, as well as from distant U.S. utilities. Last year, 38% of its electricity came from outside generating sources, compared with 18% in 1981, when Mr. Page became chief executive.    The company's financial position has improved as well, with common equity now counting for 45% of its total capital compared with 32% in 1981. Bond rating agencies have boosted its credit rating.    A stickler for detail, Mr. Page has poked into almost every corner of the company, even insisting that San Diego Gas keep its truck fleet in better shape.    Sensing that the company's management was remote, Mr. Page has demanded that all executives spend time in the field with subordinates. Vice presidents must put in between 5% and 15% of their hours mixing with the troops. &quot;You suffocate if you sit in a corporate office and wait for information,&quot; Mr. Page says.    More surprising to San Diegans, who were accustomed to his inaccessible predecessors, Mr. Page makes a point of meeting requests from newspapers and television stations for interviews. He even posed in 100-degree heat under a power line in the desert when a television crew demanded it.    Now the heat is in the executive suite. Should San Diego Gas merge with Tucson Electric, a much smaller utility, and continue under Mr. Page's guidance? Or should it become part of its giant neighbor, Southern California Edison?    Mr. Page says he is studying SCEcorp's offer with advisers. Should he decide to reject it, he can be counted on to make a very public fight. </TEXT></DOC>
