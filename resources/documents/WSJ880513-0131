The Chicago Board of Trade plans to launch a five-year Treasury note futures contract next Friday. The new product from the world's largest futures exchange will compete directly with a five-year note contract launched a year ago by the tiny Financial Instrument Exchange, or Finex, a division of the New York Cotton Exchange.    The Finex contract was one of the few successful futures contracts to make its debut in 1987, a year marked by the fizzling of futures exotica ranging from contracts based on corporate bonds to contracts based on propane. But trading volume in the Finex contract has been limping along at only about 1,800 contracts a day lately, and it risks being overrun by the CBOT contract.    &quot;I don't think, based on the volume we've seen, that there's a need for two identical contracts,&quot; said William Byers, director of futures research at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.    But others think the traders at the giant CBOT won't want to be bothered with such a financial flyspeck. &quot;I'm not convinced that the Board of Trade has enough interest among its locals to support the five-year T-note contract,&quot; said Sanjay Sathe, head of the Treasury division of Irving Trust Co. </TEXT></DOC>
