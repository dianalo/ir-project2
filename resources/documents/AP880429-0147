The legislation would cut off virtually all economic relationsbetween the United States and South Africa within a year. It isseen by supporters as building upon the limited sanctions imposedtwo years ago to force Pretoria to moderate its apartheid policy,which deprives majority blacks of political and civil rights.   But the measure is opposed by business interests as too harsh tohave its intended effect, and many Republicans who supportedlimited sanctions in 1986 have said they will fight the Democratsthis time.   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House ForeignAffairs Committee, had planned to begin work on the sanctions billFriday. He was forced to postpone his panel's meeting until nextweek, however, after the measure became entangled in a disputeabout a separate, Republican-sponsored bill to condemn the Marxistgovernment of Ethiopia.   ``I guess it reflects some of the rising political tensions'' ofthis election year, said Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., a seniorcommittee member.   Republicans were holding up the South Africa sanctions bill asleverage to first force action on the Ethiopian measure. That billurges President Reagan to cut off imports of Ethiopian coffee anddeny trade preferences if the Soviet-aligned government continuesto impede relief efforts for starving people in its northernprovinces.   Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam on April 6 orderedforeign relief workers out of the provinces of Tigray and Eritrea,where his forces are at war with secessionist rebels. Mengistu hasbeen accused of trying to starve his own people into submission,and more than 2 million people are reported to be at risk ofstarvation.   The Ethiopia sanctions measure, sponsored by Rep. Toby Roth,R-Wis., was to have been acted on Friday before the committeeturned to consideration of the South Africa sanctions bill. ButRep. Don Bonker, D-Wash., objected, saying the measure was poorlywritten and was being rushed through without proper referral to thetrade subcommittee, which he heads.   As the committee's meeting hit impasse and broke up, Republicanscried foul. ``It's a sad mark of politics and procedure,'' Rothsaid. ``We've got millions of people starving to death.''   He accused Bonker, who is running for the Senate in hisforestry-oriented state, of trying to use the situation to advancea pet bill imposing restrictions on exports of unprocessed logs.   Bonker had told reporters that bill might come before the fullForeign Affairs Committee this week, but that did not happen.Bonker denied any connection between the two bills.   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said he would continue to use Houserules to block consideration of the South Africa bill until theDemocratic-controlled committee acts on Ethiopian sanctions. ``TheEthiopian bill is much more significant at this point that SouthAfrica,'' he said.   But one Democrat said the Republicans were merely using everytactic they could to delay further action on South Africa, whichDemocrats see as a potent political issue in their favor.   ``When you're looking to sidetrack an issue, your best bet is tolight forest fires all around the place,'' said Rep. Gary Ackerman,D-N.Y. ``It's a testy time.''</TEXT></DOC>
