The dollar continued its month-long slide yesterday despite Treasury Secretary James Baker's prediction that the U.S. trade deficit will improve this year and the West German Bundesbank's announcement that it's cutting its discount rate to 3% today from 3.5%.    Washington had been urging the reduction since early last autumn, as a start toward stimulating more domestic demand, so West Germany could begin to absorb a larger share of world-wide exports.    The Bundesbank also reduced its Lombard rate by half a percentage point, to 5%. Mr. Baker said the Reagan administration is &quot;very pleased&quot; by the West German move.    But the Bundesbank's 18-member policy-making committee also moved to tighten the country's money supply and to increase bank reserve requirements in West Germany by 10% to drain excess liquidity related to the recent turmoil in the European Monetary System.    As a result, U.S. officials said the Bundesbank's action will have very little impact, either in stimulating the West German economy or in stabilizing the currency markets.    Currency traders also were plainly disappointed by the outcome of Wednesday night's meeting in Washington between Mr. Baker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. The two men agreed to monitor the exchange markets following what they called &quot;recent instances of temporary instability&quot; earlier this week.    Japanese sources said that Mr. Miyazawa asked Mr. Baker to begin regular U.S. intervention in the foreign-currency markets to support the dollar, but that Mr. Baker refused to make such a commitment. To protect Mr. Miyazawa from any immediate embarrassment, the U.S. did agree Wednesday to intervene yesterday if the dollar fell below 150 yen.    However, the U.S. decided the intervention wasn't necessary. The dollar was quoted at 151.93 yen in late New York trading yesterday; on the day, the currency declined more than 1% against both the yen and the mark.    In the absence of a U.S. commitment to help stabilize the dollar's decline, traders said they expect the currency to continue to drop.    &quot;The market is just continuing in the same mode as before,&quot; said Audrey A. McNiff, a trader at Irving Trust Co., New York. &quot;No tangibles came out of the meeting.&quot;    What appeared to disappoint the currency markets most was that neither the West German action nor the newest Baker-Miyazawa statement offered any promise of reducing the massive trade and payments imbalances that are plaguing the U.S. and its two major allies.    One U.S. official hinted, though, that the Baker-Miyazawa meeting may not prove as vapid as it first seemed. Although Mr. Baker rejected Japan's request for foreign-exchange intervention, &quot;I think (Mr. Miyazawa) may have gotten what he needs&quot; to prod Japan to stimulate its economy in line with U.S. hopes, the official said. Mr. Miyazawa may be able to prod the Bank of Japan to cut its discount rate, possibly as early as next week, and eventually to push for a modest increase in fiscal stimulus to the Japanese economy, he said.    Analysts said the West German discount-rate cut, which was followed by cuts in the Austrian and Swiss discount rates, makes a Japanese rate reduction more likely.    A growing differential between U.S. and other interest rates should in theory make U.S. securities more attractive to foreign investors. However, the risk of loss from the falling dollar offsets some of the attraction of the higher U.S. returns.    The administration did seem this week to have learned a lesson of its own about the danger of a free-falling dollar. Early last week, newspapers were filled with comments suggesting that administration officials were trying to &quot;talk&quot; the dollar down -- that is, to make statements designed to signal traders that the administration wanted the dollar's value to decline. Both Treasury and White House officials denied they had tried to send the markets such a message, but the fever intensified. By the middle of this week, the dollar was virtually in a free fall.    Washington's laissez-faire attitude puzzled and angered U.S. allies, whose exports are hurt by a falling dollar. Yesterday, Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl described apparent efforts by &quot;anonymous U.S. officials&quot; to talk the dollar down as &quot;extremely dangerous and playing with fire.&quot; He recalled the troubles caused by the plunging dollar in the late 1970s.    Senior administration officials by midweek were beginning to echo Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's warnings that a singular reliance on currency depreciation to narrow the trade deficit could pose risks for the domestic economy, possibly rekindling inflation, raising interest rates and making it more difficult for the U.S. to attract the foreign capital it needs to finance its budget deficit.    Mr. Baker told the House Budget Committee yesterday that &quot;no one in the administration would favor a free fall&quot; of the dollar. And he confirmed comments Mr. Volcker made on Wednesday that he and the Fed chairman have &quot;no fundamental difference&quot; in their views on the dollar and the way to tackle the trade deficit.    But it's unclear how, if at all, Mr. Baker can hammer out a compact under which all three major allies can work in concert to trim their trade imbalances -- America's estimated $170 billion deficit for 1986 and surpluses in Germany in Japan. Mr. Baker said yesterday that the falling dollar should start to reduce the trade deficit. In addition, most analysts believe that Japan and West Germany must spur domestic demand to increase their purchases from the U.S. and from developing countries.    But Mr. Miyazawa's inability to offer any new stimulative measures as part of a potential U.S.-Japanese currency accord this week -- and West Germany's continued reluctance to embark on similar growth measures -- doesn't augur well for any big compact, both U.S. and foreign officials concede.    In addition, Mr. Baker told Congress yesterday, the U.S. must reduce its budget deficit faster, a job both Congress and the administration find difficult.    The Treasury secretary has launched new international machinery for the major industrial democracies to use to coordinate their economic policies more effectively, but so far the effort has been slow to start. U.S. officials have begun exploring the possibility of calling yet another meeting, possibly as early as mid-February. &quot;It's something we ought to talk in private about with our trading partners and other industrial nations,&quot; Mr. Baker told the Budget Committee.    Mr. Baker spent part of yesterday afternoon briefing President Reagan on his meeting with Mr. Miyazawa late Wednesday. There was no immediate indication of how Mr. Reagan reacted to the report.    The discord among the U.S., Japan and West Germany created expectations in the currency markets yesterday of further dollar declines.    James S. Vick, senior corporate trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said, &quot;The administration seems to be putting a higher priority on averting protectionist legislation, which means allowing the dollar to go lower, and taking priority away from cooperating with other countries.&quot;    Mr. Vick said he believes the Reagan administration is willing to let the dollar keep falling until it has a negative impact on the U.S. credit markets. &quot;The administration will have to see some tangible damage to the U.S. securities market before they'll intervene&quot; to support the dollar, he said. &quot;Traders are going to keep pressure on the dollar,&quot; he said.    News that the U.S. economy grew a disappointing 1.7% in 1986's final three months reinforced bearish sentiment among traders yesterday.    Afternoon trading was especially quiet in New York as many operations shut down early because of a snowstorm.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8150 West German marks, down 1.3% from 1.8390 Wednesday.    As trading began Thursday in the Asia-Pacific region, however, the dollar rose to 1.8260 marks. It also climbed to 152.85 yen from yesterday's late New York rate of 151.93.    Michael Eastaway, chief dealer for Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney, Australia, attributed the dollar gains to &quot;Japanese buying on reported rumors that the Fed might intervene to support the dollar.&quot; He added, &quot;It's a real roller coaster again.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold for current delivery rose 20 cents an ounce, to $408.30, in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 3.6 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $407.75 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---   Also contributing to this article was Charles W.
