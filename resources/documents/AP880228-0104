Jack Kemp blasted thetwo GOP frontrunners on taxes.   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis won the Maine Democraticcaucuses, scoring another victory on his New England home turf, andJesse Jackson scored a surprisingly strong second, followed by anuncommitted bloc.   ``Today our message continued to shine,'' the Massachusettsgovernor said in a statement. ``Today's victory gives our nationalcampaign another push toward success on Super Tuesday.''   The state Republican party provided no official count, butvarious campaigns agreed Bush, who makes his summer home in Maine,was far ahead, with former television evangelist Pat Robertsonnext, followed by the uncommitteds.   ``I am delighted with what appears to be an overwhelming victoryin the Maine caucuses, assuring my campaign of all 22 nationaldelegates,'' Bush said from Washington.   The Maine caucuses pick delegates to the parties' stateconventions this spring, where national convention delegates arechosen.   Four of the six Democrats, meanwhile, gathered for a debate inHouston, where the absentees _ Dukakis and Rep. Richard Gephardt _came under fire for skipping the event.   At a Republican debate in Atlanta _ the first full-scale GOPface-off of the Southern campaign _ Dole took aim at Bush for theReagan administration's decision to trade arms for hostages in theIran-Contra affair. That, he said, was a big mistake.   ``We never should trade arms for hostages. We shouldn't issuethese reports and say we shouldn't trade arms for hostages _ thevice president's report _ and then later go to a meeting and sayit's all right. We shouldn't do those things,'' Dole said, holdingup a report on terrorism that was written by a presidentialcommission headed by Bush.   Bush did not respond directly, but did say ``mistakes weremade'' in the Iran-Contra affair.   Kemp, whose campaign has been faltering after poor showings inearly contests, accused Bush and Dole of supporting tax hikes.   ``They sound alike. They talk alike. They've supported everysingle tax increase over the last eight years,'' the New Yorkcongressman said. ``If they're nominated, the Reagan revolution isover, gone, dead.''   Dole hit back, saying: ``Jack's never met a deficit he didn'tlike.'' And Bush told the New York congressman: `You don't careabout deficits. You never have, and they're public enemy No. 1.''   Bush is planning to skip the League of Women Voters' debate nextSunday in Nashville, his campaign manager said.   ``At this time, there are no debates on the schedule,'' LeeAtwater told reporters after the Atlanta debate. ``We're simply ata point where we've got 20 states; you've got to maintain controlof your schedule.''   The GOP contest was sponsored by the AtlantaJournal-Constitution newspapers, which also organized a Democraticface-off on Saturday. There, Dukakis made stinging attacks onrivals Gephardt and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee.   Gore, who largely bypassed early contests in New Hampshire andIowa, is pinning his hopes on a strong showing on Super Tuesday,March 8. On that day, 20 states, mostly in the South, will holdprimaries or caucuses.   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, who disappointed many Democrats whenhe decided to sit out the presidential race, said Sunday he stillhasn't decided whether to lend his backing to his fellow Southerner.   ``I like Al Gore,'' Nunn said in an interview on NBC-TV's ``Meetthe Press.'' ``I like what he says on national security.''   But, he said, ``I also like Dick Gephardt. ... I'm not duckingit. I just haven't decided who I'm going to vote for yet. I likeGore and I like Gephardt.''   Gephardt and Dukakis, responsible for the sharpest sparringamong the Democrats lately, did not attend Sunday night'sDemocratic debate in Houston. Gary Hart attacked the absentees.   ``Apparently they don't care much about Texas and the South,''the former Colorado senator said. Those who did attend the debate,however, admitted they're getting a bit tired of such gatherings.   ``We really are kind of trapped in these 90-second sound bitestrying to say a thing that makes a difference,'' said Jackson.   ``There really is a problem in these debates, in that we have toanswere in 60 seconds, or 90 seconds, and in some debates 30seconds,'' said Paul Simon.   Dukakis campaigned Sunday from the deck of a fire boat inBaltimore's harbor, and pledged to make affordable housing apriority if elected. Maryland is one of the states voting on SuperTuesday.   Jackson, in Tampa, Fla., visited a crime-ridden neighborhood anddecried the despair and frustration that has led to clashes betweenresidents and police.   Jackson has pledged to raise the minimum wage, provide long-termhealth insurance for all Americans and to make fighting drugs histop priority.   ``The Sandinistas are not threatening the streets of Tampa thismorning,'' he said. ``The No. 1 threat is coke, crack and heroin.''   In another development, a poll published Sunday suggestedDukakis and Gephardt have the lead among Democrats in Texas, thebiggest Super Tuesday state. On the Republican side, Bush had aclear lead, with Dole a distant second.   The poll was conducted for the Houston Chronicle and the DallasMorning News.   Among 301 likely Democratic primary voters surveyed, Dukakis had22 percent; Gephardt 21 percent; Jackson 12 percent; Gore, 10percent; Hart, 8 percent; and Simon 1 percent.   Among Republicans, Bush had the support of 60 percent of the 298likely Republican primary voters surveyed. Dole had 14 percent;Robertson 8 percent; and Kemp 3 percent. Fourteen percent wereundecided.   The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 6 percentage points.It was conducted by University of Houston political scientistRichard Murray through the university's Center for Public Policy.</TEXT></DOC>
