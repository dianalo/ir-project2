CLIFFORD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Seven white police officers have sued thecity, charging that less qualified minority officers were promotedunfairly ahead of them under a court-ordered affirmative actionplan.   It could be the first test of a recent Supreme Court ruling thatreversed 20 years of affirmative action.   Attorney Robert E. Gyemant said Tuesday he filed the ``reversediscrimination'' suit against the city on behalf of the sevenofficers Monday in order to obtain ``a colorblind and sex-blindopportunity to advance.''   Gyemant said the officers, standing with him at a newsconference, would most or all be captains or lieutenants if theyhad been given an equal opportunity to advance. All are patrolofficers.   The suit, filed Monday in San Francisco Superior Court, claimsless qualified minority officers have been unfairly promoted inorder to meet racial quotas set by a 1979 court-ordered affirmativeaction plan.   The suit maintains that the city has violated a state civilrights law forbidding the use of race or sex as a basis in hiringand promotion.   ``All I want is the opportunity to compete fairly,'' saidOfficer Lawrence Ratti.   Also at the news conference were four white female officers whosaid they, too, suffered from discrimination. They are not involvedin the lawsuit.   Officer Vicki Quinn described the city's promotion policies as``a lottery.'' Quinn, a 13-year veteran of the force, said she wasone of the first women in the department who ``passed standardsheld for men.''   The lawsuit seeks back pay, punitive damages and an end to thealleged discrimination. The amount of damages sought was notrevealed.   The San Francisco suit may be the first test case for thelandmark U.S. Supreme Court decision involving Birmingham, Ala.,that permitted a legal challenge to a court-order affirmativeaction plan. The court decided that white firefighters inBirmingham, hired after a consent decree was approved, could fightthe preferential promotion of allegedly less qualified blackfirefighters.   Gyemant, who called racial discrimination ``awful,'' said hisclients should not be forced to pay the price to ``right wrongs''carried out before any of them were involved with the department.   City Attorney Louise Renne said the lawsuit ``is plowing oldground.''   ``This has been going on for 10 years,'' she said. ``Just aboutevery legal point that could possibly have been raised has been.''   But Gyemant responded: ``If it is old ground, then it certainlyis about time that we're able to deal with this in courts of law.''   Only one sergeant's examination has been given in the SanFrancisco Police Departmant in the last 10 years, and that wasdeclared recially discriminatory against whites by a federal judge,he said.   The lawsuit is not designed to fight steps taken to enddiscrimination, Gyemant said.   ``All we are saying is why make our clients pay for it. All theydid was serve the city well. That's what the lawsuit is allabout,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
