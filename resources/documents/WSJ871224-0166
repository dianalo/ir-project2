GreenbergerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTJUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)CONGRESS (CNG)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead thought he had a deal when he met with some American Jewish leaders last summer: They agreed to stop backing a bill barring Americans from acting on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the State Department pledged to close down the PLO's Washington office.    But Mr. Whitehead's summertime deal didn't stop the bill. Last week, as part of the State Department authorization bill, Congress overwhelmingly approved the measure, and President Reagan signed it Tuesday night. It requires the U.S. within 90 days to close the PLO's Washington office and its United Nations observer mission. As a result, Secretary of State George Shultz warns of a &quot;propaganda gain&quot; for the PLO. The U.S. stands to be embarrassed at the U.N., which might protest to the World Court. The U.N. General Assembly already has passed a resolution, 145-to-1, opposing the measure.    And even some of Israel's staunchest U.S. supporters, who had never considered the bill a top priority, are grumbling about supporting a measure that is seen as curtailing civil liberties.    &quot;Either you have a rule that says we regulate behavior, or, no matter what kind of rotten S.O.B. you are, you're allowed to say stupid, offensive things,&quot; says Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass.), who opposes the bill. And the American Civil Liberties Union, which is defending the PLO, says, &quot;This is about the rights of Americans to affiliate. We're entirely disinterested in the content of the message.&quot;    Despite such objections, the PLO bill kept moving full steam ahead because nobody had counted on the unbridled enthusiasm of Congress. PLO bashing makes good politics. Supporting the bill was a way to talk tough about terrorism and garner support from influential pro-Israel voters. It &quot;sends a message to the PLO that the United States supports a peaceful resolution to the Arab-Israel conflict, and rejects terrorists as inadmissible parties to negotiations,&quot; says Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, a GOP presidential contender who spearheaded the House effort.    It was Rep. Kemp who set off the chain of events that led to the meeting in Mr. Whitehead's office -- and a State Department flip-flop. In October 1986, following a terrorist incident in Jerusalem for which a PLO faction took responsibility, he urged Secretary Shultz to close the PLO's &quot;terrorist outposts on U.S. soil.&quot; Mr. Shultz responded that the PLO information office in Washington, which had been registered with the Justice Department since 1978 as a foreign agent, hadn't violated any U.S. laws and, as a result, &quot;was entitled to operate under the protection provided by the First Amendment of the Constitution.&quot;    But after Mr. Kemp's bill was introduced last April, followed by a companion bill in the Senate, Mr. Shultz found a way around the First Amendment. Foggy Bottom could designate the PLO office as a &quot;foreign mission,&quot; which the agency then could regulate. &quot;The Justice Department has advised us that the First Amendment would not bar the U.S. government from closing the (Washington) office, since it is operating as a foreign mission,&quot; he wrote Rep. Kemp.    Mr. Shultz added that closing the PLO's U.N. mission was a more complex matter because of certain U.S. treaty obligations. &quot;The issue might be referred by the U.N. to the World Court, where we would probably lose and the PLO would reap a propaganda gain,&quot; the secretary of state warned. Therefore, he suggested that the legislation should be dropped.    A month later, following Mr. Whitehead's meeting, the State Department notified the PLO's Washington office that it now was considered a foreign mission, and that it would be closed in 30 days. The department cited the PLO's involvement with international terrorism, including its affiliation with the terrorist Abu Abbas, who was responsible for the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro and the murder of a disabled American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer.    But Hasan Rahman, the 43-year-old head of the PLO's Washington office, insists that the department had other motives. &quot;This is a case of political harassment for the views we advocate,&quot; he says. The PLO office is staffed by six U.S. citizens, including Mr. Rahman, who became a citizen this year, and two foreigners with legal-resident status.    Until earlier this month, Mr. Rahman operated from a suite of offices, adorned with paintings by Palestinian artists and large photographs of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, with a $350,000 annual budget supplied by the PLO's Palestine National Fund. The group advocates a Palestinian state and a political settlement of the Mideast dispute, Mr. Rahman says. He adds that the office files regular reports with the Justice Department and has never violated U.S. rules.    Nevertheless, on Dec. 3, following a 45-day extension, the State Department told Mr. Rahman's landlord to stop providing electricity and water, telephone service was terminated and the office was shut down. The U.S. District Court here, without addressing the broader civil-liberties issues, ruled that the State Department's action was legal under the Foreign Missions Act. A further appeal is under way. Other legal actions are expected to challenge the U.S.'s right to close down the PLO's U.N. mission.    An aide to Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa), the primary Senate sponsor, says: &quot;We aren't trying to prevent discussion on the PLO. We're saying that unless you stop practicing terrorism, you've no right to be active in our country.&quot; He notes that the bill doesn't bar Americans from receiving &quot;informational material&quot; from the PLO, and that the measure is co-sponsored by such civil-liberties stalwarts as liberal Democratic Sens. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Paul Simon of Illinois, another presidential contender.    But opponents say the legislation is counterproductive. &quot;Allowing them (the PLO) to be defenders of legalism against us is very bad politics. It gives them an unearned posture as being pro-freedom,&quot; says Rep. Frank. </TEXT></DOC>
