The indescribable thrill of watching your $150 prescriptionsunglasses sail overboard, having your hair knot up like a 4-year-old'sshoelaces and getting your kidneys pounded to the consistency of chunky peanutbutter.;    But it's all worth it because when you're behind the wheel of afast, expensive powerboat, you're making a statement to the world.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  POWER CORRUPTS; POWERBOATS CORRUPT ABSOLUTELY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  David Grimes is a columnist for the Sarasota Herald-Tribune in Florida.  </MEMO><TEXT>     You're stating that you've arrived.;    You're stating that you enjoyliving life to the fullest.;    You're stating that you're an arrogant,pretentious, sexually insecure male who thinks a 300-horsepower phallicsymbol, lots of gold chains and a pair of elastic swim trunks that make youlook like you're smuggling a basket of fruit will cause beautiful women yourdaughter's age to become dizzy with lust to the point that they'll ignore yourself-absorbed personality and flabby body.;    This is not to say that thereis anything wrong with owning a powerboat.;    If I had the bucks, I'd buy onemyself. Maybe two. After all, it's always a good idea to have a back-uppowerboat in case you damage a propeller on the back of a manatee (aren't theya nuisance?) or the occupants of the small sailboat you capsized with yourwake.;    High-performance powerboats can provide wholesome fun for the entirefamily.;    The boats can comfortably accommodate as many as two people,assuming neither wants to sit down, and the rest rooms are as big as alloutdoors.;    Much intimacy can be achieved by screaming in each other's earso you can be heard over the roar of the engines, and hitting a sandbar at 80mph is a great way for a family to &quot;bond&quot; in an everlasting way.;    Toooften, reporters dwell on the negative aspects of powerboating -- the danger,the wasted fuel, the fact that these guys hang around with much better-lookingwomen than they do. I hope that I have succeeded in showing a more positive,compassionate side of this controversial topic.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID GRIMES  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910703  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  355  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 3, 199100185150,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
