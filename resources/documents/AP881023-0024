Besides New York, where he was indicted Friday, Marcos is thetarget of investigations or lawsuits in Honolulu, Los Angeles,Seattle, Washington, D.C., Alexandria, Va., and his homeland.   Most center on his enormous wealth and influence, how he got it,and how he used it after being exiled to Hawaii in 1986.   But there are also allegations of Marcos involvement in theslayings of two opponents of his regime in Seattle in 1981, tortureof opponents in his homeland and bribery in the sale of militaryequipment to his government.   John Bartko, an attorney for Marcos in San Francisco, called theNew York indictments ``probably the most complex case every filedin U.S. courts.''   Marcos' trial ``would be, without doubt, one of longest and mostardurous criminal proceedings in U.S. history. And they (theindictments) are just one facet of an incredibly complex case.''   Marcos, 71; his wife, Imelda, 59; and six others were indictedon federal racketeering charges, accused of looting more than $100million from the Philippines to buy art and real estate in New YorkCity. They were also charged with defrauding lending institutionsof more than $165 million in the purchase and financing of the realestate.   ``Paradoxical as it may seem, Imelda and I welcome theopportunity to show the whole world that these allegations ofdishonesty and criminal activity cannot be proven by ouraccusers,'' Marcos said in a statement. ``We are confident that wewill be vindicated.''   But as his lawyers prepare their defense, other investigationscontinue.   Dante B. Fascell, chairman of the House Foreign AffairsCommittee, said Saturday that Marcos has been subpoenaed to appearbefore the Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcomittee. TheVirginian-Pilot and Ledger-Star newspapers of Norfolk, Va.,reported the subcommittee was investigating allegations that Marcosfunneled millions of dollars into the 1980 and 1984 campaigns ofPresident Reagan and Vice President George Bush.   Richard Hibey, another Marcos attorney, confirmed that Marcoshas been subpoenaed but did not say whether he would appear.   Last August in Seattle, a federal judge ruled that Marcos andhis wife must stand trial in a lawsuit to determine whether theywere involved in the 1981 slayings of two anti-Marcos unionofficials there.   Marcos claimed head-of-state immunity, but U.S. District JudgeBarbara Rothstein ruled he lost that protection after fleeing toHawaii in February 1986 during the civilian-military revolt thatcatapulted Corazon Aquino to power. The ruling has been appealedand the case is expected to be tried next year.   Federal grand juries in Honolulu and Alexandria, Va., have beeninvestigating Marcos since shortly after his arrival in the UnitedStates.   The Honolulu investigation reportedly focuses on an alleged 1987plot to return Marcos to power, which was thwarted when Philippineofficials here alerted Aquino, and on an arms-smuggling plotallegedly hatched by Marcos.   The Virginia investigation involves possible bribery inU.S.-financed sales of military equipment to the Philippines duringMarcos' 20-year rule.   In the Philippines, 39 suits seeking to collect nearly $100billion are pending against Marcos.   No criminal charges have been filed there because Marcos hassaid he would demand his constitutional right to return to hishomeland and face his accusers in court. Mrs. Aquino has refused toallow Marcos' return.   ``Mr. Marcos will face criminal indictments in the Philippineseventually,'' said Tomas Gomez, Philippine Consul in Honolulu.``The long road to retribution and restitution has begun.''   Philippine officials, including Aquino, hailed the U.S.indictments because they could hasten recovery of his alleged``hidden wealth.'' The Philippine government claims much of thatwealth is sheltered in secret Swiss bank accounts. Swissauthorities had indicated they would wait for indictments _ notcivil proceedings _ before releasing information about frozenMarcos accounts.   Besides New York, the other main U.S. main battleground in the``hidden wealth'' hunt is California, where a $56.4 billionPhilippine suit led to the freezing by a federal judge of more than$215 million in alleged Marcos cash, real estate and other assets,including Swiss accounts. That suit has not been resolved.   Also unresolved is a $120 million suit filed in March 1986 bythe American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of alleged victims oftorture and arbitrary arrest by the Marcos regime.   In Honolulu, the Marcoses are being sued by a Philippinetreasure hunter who claims they stole from him a treasure worth $60billion that included a 2,000-pound gold statue of Buddha. Marcoscalled the suit ``fantasy.''</TEXT></DOC>
