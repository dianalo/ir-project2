Philip Morris's Kraft General Foods unit and othercompanies are using computerized sales information fromcheckout counters in calculating marketing departmentpaychecks. The better a promotional campaign's results, thefatter the bonus for its creators.   The data are &quot;one element&quot; in measuring performance, saysa Kraft personnel supervisor, who adds that the company alsolooks at other financial criteria when determining anindividual's pay.   Frank Schmidt, whose Agoura Hills, Calif., marketingcompany, F.B. Schmidt International, surveys marketers' payannually, says about 10% of the companies queried this yearacknowledge using scanner data. But he says the trend willaccelerate because the information is much more accurate thanother yardsticks. &quot;It really shows what the consumer hasbought.&quot;   Some marketing people will be frightened by technology'sinput on their salaries, but Mr. Schmidt says others &quot;aregetting good raises because they're able to demonstrate thattheir promotions work.&quot;   Bonuses for product managers last year ran between 10% and20% of base salary, Mr. Schmidt says. Another finding:Marketers selling products that rely heavily on image -- suchas cosmetics, beer and cigarettes -- tend to make more thanthose pushing food and other staples. Employers apparentlythink it takes more imagination to create ads selling eyeshadow than eyewash.   Sex remains a factor in figuring salaries. Last year, malemarketers made about 5% more overall than their femalecounterparts. But Mr. Schmidt says the gender differentialhas shrunk from 15% five years ago.                                                                                                          Cereal Premiums Aren't   Just for Kids Anymore                                                                                                          FOR YEARS, cereal companies have put trinkets in theirpackages to entice children. Now they're using premiums toattract adults.   Kellogg gives away prunes with purchases of All-Bran andgoes after gardeners with a European flower bulb offer onboxes of Mueslix. Its Asian-inspired Kenmei Rice Bran has atakeyour-choice &quot;Treasures of the Orient&quot; premium rangingfrom handpainted silk note cards to tins of tea.   Not to be outdone, General Mills shrink-wraps anabbreviated version of Money magazine on boxes of Total.Ralston Purina peddles Multi-Bran Chex with a family fitnesspocket guide from cyclist Greg LeMond, while RJR Nabisco putspackets of yeast on its 100% Bran.   &quot;Since incentives have been proved to work for kids, it'sonly natural that they'd be used for adult cereals,&quot; says aspokesman for the Association for Incentive Marketing, inUnion, N.J.   To grab the whole family, the flake-and-fiber folks alsoare serving up fast food along with their breakfast grains.Some General Mills packages include coupons for McDonald'sburgers or drinks, while Kellogg is pitching Pizza Hut pizzasand Dairy Queen sundaes.   Premium partnering with other national brands isincreasingly popular. Recent General Mills incentives includecandy bars from Nestle, its European cereal joint-venturemate, and child-sized L'Eggs tights from Sara Lee. It alsohooked up with Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing to offer 3Maudio and video tapes for multiple-box cereal purchases. Insome stores the tapes were available for the taking fromshopping carts parked near the cereal aisle.                                                                                                          Ex-Burger King Honcho   Has Legacy in the Bag                                                                                                          FAST-FOOD marketing veteran Gary Langstaff has one ofthose faces his former employer can't forget.   Months before he quit Burger King Corp. in February, Mr.Langstaff approved a new carryout bag festooned with 39cartoon faces. One is his.   The bearded former executive vice president is one of tworeal people in the crowd of caricatures. The other is his oldboss, Barry Gibbons, chief executive officer of the chain, aunit of Grand Metropolitan. Mr. Gibbons is pictured with ared phone to his ear, underlining the sack's &quot;call us withyour comments&quot; theme.   Why are Messrs. Langstaff and Gibbons among the crowd onthe bag? &quot;The idea was to have fun with it,&quot; a Burger Kingspokesman says. Others say it was a last-minute brainstorm byan advertising agency creative type. The company says it andMr. Langstaff parted amicably, so it has no regrets that heis on its bag. Good thing: It still has millions in stock,and about three million are used daily.   Mr. Langstaff, now a principal in Retail Resolve, amarketing concern based in Miami, says he has been recognized&quot;a couple of times&quot; by people at Burger King restaurants.&quot;They'd look at me and at the bag and ask if it was me. WhenI was with {Burger King}, I said `Yes.' After I wasn't thereI said `No.'&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          THE SKYWALK network linking downtown buildings in DesMoines, Iowa, has a new tenant looking for customers: achaplain who counsels workers, shoppers and others strollingthrough the enclosed passages. . . . InterCommunications, aCalifornia marketing communications agency, says fewer than10% of the press releases that newsrooms receive are read. Ofthose, only one in five is considered &quot;useful&quot; by assignmenteditors, the agency's survey found. . . .
