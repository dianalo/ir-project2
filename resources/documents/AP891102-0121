But the spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Rosa Pasos, denied that anylarge-scale operations were involved, and said most of the actionwas concentrated on rebels sneaking into Nicaragua from neighboringHonduras.   ``These are military operations against mercenary forces thathave been infiltrating,'' she added.   Pasos said most of the action is concentrated in the regionswhere the bulk of an estimated 2,500 Contras are scattered.   Pasos also confirmed a report by the Sandinista NationalLiberation Front newspaper Barricada that an army company backed bymilitias mounted the first attack against a group of about 30Contras in the area around Quilali.   She said the attack took place Wednesday, about two hours afterOrtega announced he would not renew the cease-fire, but refused topinpoint the area. She said she did not have immediate reports ofcasualties.   Barricada said today that combat units in 14 towns and villagesin northern Nicaragua began operations overnight against therebels, but gave few details.   Opposition leaders have been accusing Ortega of canceling thecease-fire because he feared holding free elections.   A rebel communique said: ``The breaking of the cease-fire by theSandinista army is already in effect because the Nicaraguanmilitary today intensified its attacks against our forces andpositions through widespread operations.''   The communique, distributed by the rebels' Nicaraguan Resistanceorganization in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, said the leftist governmentwas mounting attacks Wednesday with tanks, helicopter gunships andheavy artillery.   Ortega announced at news conference broadcast live to the nationearly in the day that he was suspending the unilateral cease-fire.   He said more than 1,100 rebels had infiltrated Nicaragua throughthe Honduran border during the past three weeks and that rebelattacks had ``increased dramatically.''   Later, the Defense Ministry said Contras killed eight people andwounded 14 in three attacks in the northern provinces of Matagalpaand Jinotega from Sunday to Tuesday. Three of the dead werecivilians who were kidnapped then killed, a ministry communiquesaid.   In an opinion piece in today's New York Times, Ortega contendedthe Contras were trying to subvert the electoral process because``they are as convinced as I am ... that the Nicaraguan people willgive the Sandinistas a landslide victory'' in elections planned forFeb. 25.   He said that during October, Contra units closed more than 50voter registration centers, preventing thousands of citizens fromregistering.   ``They targeted for assassination known Sandinista supporters _prominent community leaders, party activists and candidates formunicipal offices _ and slit their throats,'' Ortega wrote.   The rebel high command said Sandinista troops, using heavyartillery and backed by Soviet-made helicopters, attacked Wednesdayin La Sirena and Batitan, in the southern Atlantic coast provinceof Zelaya.   Interior Ministry troops made ``continuous attacks'' on rebelsat Sarawaca Hill in the northern province of Jinotega, at theborder with Honduras, the Tegucigalpa communique said.   Alfredo Cesar, a former director of the Nicaraguan Resistance,said he believed Ortega's decision to end the truce confirmed athesis of President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica.   ``The thesis is that the Sandinista Front is afraid of peace,''Cesar said, ``that the Sandinista Front prefers war and is afraidof the political process in general.''   Cesar ended seven years of exile and returned to Nicaraguaearlier this year to join in the electoral process. He is now aleading voice within the Sandinistas' main challenger, the 14-partycoalition National Opposition Union.   The coalition's vice presidential candidate, Virgilio Godoy,said the government's decision to suspend the cease-fire ``haslittle to do with the military situation and much to do with theelectoral situation.''   Ortega has said whether elections are held will depend onwhether President Bush and Congress agree to push fordemobilization of the Contras.   He called for meetings next week at the United Nations soagreement can be reached on a mechanism for dismantling theContras, who are based in Honduras.   Ortega and four other Central American presidents agreed Aug. 7to demobilize and relocate the rebels by Dec. 5. At the time, about12,000 rebels were in the Honduras camps.   Before announcing the recent infiltration of 1,100 rebels intoNicaragua, officials had said 2,000 to 3,000 rebels were in thecountry.   Ortega contends the Contras have routinely violated the trucesince it was signed in March 1988, a month after Congress suspendedmilitary aid to the rebels.   He has said that in the 19 months since, Contra attacks inNicaragua have killed more than 730 people and wounded more than1,000, mostly civilians.   The non-lethal aid package Congress approved for the Contras inMarch includes a clause providing for the suspension of aid shouldthe Contras initiate attacks in Nicaragua.   The aid, which includes food, medicine, boots and uniforms, isto run out just after the elections.</TEXT></DOC>
