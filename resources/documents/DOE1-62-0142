They don't believe they can survive an attack. Furthermore,he says the Soviets have never staged an evacuation exercise in any majorcity nor, even in smaller towns, has an entire community been evacuated.The author says there are numerous problems with the shelter programsas well. Very few existing shelters have any food stocks, only a fewmore have any water. There is little evidence that Soviet leaders haveplanned their economy with civil defense in mind. Nor - given the blatantinadequacies of Soviet civil defense programs, the marked vulnerabilitiesof the Soviet economy, and the intrinsic limitation and uncertaintiesabout civil defense generally - is there much basis for claiming thatSoviet leaders, even in desperate straits, would risk war with the UnitedStates while counting on civil defense measures to limit the damage wreakedon the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
