(product announcement)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Marsan, Carolyn Duffy.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Intel Corp introduces the one-of-a-kind Touchstone Delta System, amultimillion dollar supercomputer which computes 8.6 billionfloating point operations per second and outperforms vectorsupercomputers from Cray Research Inc. Featuring 528 of Intel'si860 microprocessors, the Delta System has a peak performancespeed of 32GFlops.andP;  The system will be used by researchers at theDefense Department, Energy Department and NASA for computingcomplex problems such as aerospace simulations, global climaticchange and weather modeling to name a few.andP;  Intel also plans tointroduce the Sigma System, a fourth and final prototype systembased on a new generation of the i860 chip.andP;  Featuring 2.5 milliontransistors, the 64-bit i860 XP will provide a performance high ofup to 100Mflops and a clock speed of 40 or 50 MHz.andP;  The Deltasystems is the product of six years of research collaborationbetween Caltech and Intel.andP;  It is jointly funded by the DefenseAdvanced Research Projects Agency and Intel.andP;  The system bringsIntel closer to its goal of developing teraflops machines by theend of the 90's.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Intel Corp.
