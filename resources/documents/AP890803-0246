Researchers Yehudit Chebat and Michel Revel of the WeizmannInstitute of Science reported that they have created a gene thatimmunizes cells, and that they have produced a line ofvirus-resistant hamster cells.   Cells were rendered immune by introducing an altered gene, whichtriggered the production of anti-viral enzymes, Revel said. ``Thenext step is immunizing a whole animal'' through a geneticengineering process known as transgenics.   That entails removing a newly fertilized egg from an animal,inserting the altered gene and reinserting the treated egg into afoster-mother. The newborn animal would be expected to have theimmunizing gene throughout its body.   It will then posses a genetically inspired resistance to a classof viruses called picornaviruses, which cause diseases such aspolio and the common cold in humans. The animal would pass on thisimmunity to its offspring.   Commercial production of virus-resistant animals, which mayprove ethically controversial, is years away.   ``his type of genetic engineering is also theoretically possiblewith humans,'' Revel said. ``But it would be ethicallyinconceivable to attempt such an experiment.''   Until now, the only genes that produced anti-viral enzymes werethose treated with interferon, a protein known for itsvirus-fighting abilities. The newly created gene operates withoutprompting from interferon.   The altered gene, known as the 258-synthesis, is also unique inthat it does not adversely affect the normal activities of thecell, a hurdle that had previously proved insurmountable, theresearchers said.   Revel predicted that with adequate funding the research teamwould be able to produce a fully resistant farm animal in two tofive years.   Similar research involving a different virus of the influenzafamily is being conducted at the University of Munich's Center forMolecular Biology. The 2-year-old project uses similar techniquesto genetically modify mice.   That experiment has proved inconclusive because the hoped-forresistance has not been strong enough, said Ernst Winnacker, theMunich center's director. In addition, creating genetically alteredanimals has aroused considerable controversy in West Germany,Winnacker said. ``We have a series of self-imposed guidelines ongenetic research. The West German Cabinet recently recommended thatthese guidelines be made into law.''   The limitations, unlikely to take effect for two years, wouldnot affect research under way, he said, adding he has no doubt``commercially producing genetically altered farm animals will beextremely controversial.''   Amos Shapira, an expert on bio-medical ethics at Israel's TelAviv University, said stringent precautions should be observed bythe scientists in cases where altering genes are involved. Headvocated limiting altered animals to the laboratory for severalgenerations to study potential side effects.   Revel said the genes used in his experiment are taken from ahuman.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Aug. 7</NOTE></DOC>
