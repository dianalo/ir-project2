 The following software listing is based upon press releasesfurnished by Microsoft prior to the actual announcement date.andP;  It is possiblethat other vendors, and other products, will also be included at the time ofannouncement.andP;  We apologize for any omissionsandM;Like the hardware part of the industry, the soft-ware side has also jumpedinto the Windows 3.0 world in a very big way.andP;  Listed below you will find thecompanies who announced products at the Microsoft event, as well as thosewhich we have received over the transom within the last few days.andP;  Pleasenote that each product which was announced at the event meets Microsoft'scriteria and the others may or may not.andP;  We have tried to categorize theproducts but some of them do not fit  'neatly' into a specific category.andP;  Forexample, some of the products listed in the PIMs section do not meet ourdefinition of a &quot;true' PIM, but we were unable to come up with yet anotherclassification for them.andP;  Similarly, some of the products listed in thedevelopment and utilities sections should really have been defined morespecifically but we decided not to break the categories down any further.andM;Microsoft's Criteria for inclusion of a software vendor in the announcementkit  is based upon the following:andM;1.andP;  The application must be written specifically to the Microsoft Windows 3.0APIs (in other words, not a simple compatibility upgrade on an existingWindows 2.1 application).andM;2.andP;  The applications must ship within approximately 60 days of the Windows3.0 announcement.andM;PIMsandM;I believe that this one segment of the Windows 3.0 market will be the hottestbattle ground of the year.andP;  PIMs are the products which REALLY make the mostof a user interface such as Windows 3.0.andP;  A PIM is really a group ofdifferent pieces all placed together and all pooling their information.andP;  Theprime functions of a PIM include: Calendering, To Do Lists, TelephoneDirectory, and all of the other organizational functions you want to haveconstantly at your finger tips.andP;  In this category there are only two entriesat the moment, IBM and Polaris.andP;  The Asymetrix DayBook which is being bundledwith Windows 3.0 by Microsoft, is a nice calendering program but does notprovide any of the other functions which must be included in order for it tobecome an Information Manger.andP;  Our descriptions of the two products are verylimited in this issue since we are preparing a head-to-head review ofcurrent, PackRat, and Agenda by Lotus (which we expected to see on theMicrosoft list but it was missing).andM;IBM Desktop Software, Current.andP;  This product is already the leading contenderfor the best PIM award.andP;  The Windows 3.0 version of the PIM is just as robustand full featured as its predecessor.andP;  Single user price is $395.andP;  Theupgrade to Version 1.1 will be at no charge to existing users and the productwill be available by the end of June.andP;  No IAN version is presently available.andM;Polaris Software, PackRat.andP;  The PackRat release for Windows 3.0 is alsoversion 3.0.andP;  Polaris has included many of the features already available intheir OS/ 2  PM version and added some group and networking features as well.andO;In addition there is also a network specific version of the productavailable.andP;  Pricing is $395, upgrades for $150, and the network version is$695 for three users.andP;  Word ProcessorsandM;NBI, Inc., Legacy.andP;  This product, which we have previewed, appears to be oneof the major contenders for the word processing market under Windows 3.0.andM;Legacy provides fully interactive WYSIWYG editing and layout modes, full textattribute support, automatic pagination, index and table of contentsgeneration, a spelling checker and thesaurus, full mail merge, and auto save.andO;Full two-way Dynamic Data Exchangc (DDE) is supported with programs such asExcel.andP;  (DDE, by the way, is one of the HOT topics that you will be hearing alot about with Windows 3.0.)andM;NBI has positioned this product to be both a high-end and fully functionalword processor as well as a product capable of providing many of thefunctions normally provided by Desk Top Publishing packages.andM;Microsoft, Windows for Word.andP;  As you would expect, Microsoft's product isalso ready and waiting for users.andP;  This version is an upgraded version of theone which runs under Windows 386 and will compete well in the marketplace.andM;Samna Corporation, Ami Professional.andP;  This word processor was not included inthe package of press releases we received.andP;  However, we have been workingwith Samna in a beta test capacity and know that the product is very close tobeing ready.andP;  We consider this product to be one of the top contenders forthe word processor of choice under Windows 3.0.andP;  It is fully functional,permits the integration of text and graphics, and fully supports DDE.andP;  Inaddition, it features a very rich set of import filters which translate manyof the more popular word processing formats to that used by Ami Professional.andM;Desktop PublishingandM;Xerox Desktop Software, Ventura Publisher.andP;  This very popular desktoppublishing package has been revamped for Windows 3.0.andP;  In its original formit was written to operate under the GEM (DRI) operating system.andP;  Some of thefeatures added in this release include support for Extended memory,permitting larger and more complex documents; automatic mouse scrolling foreasier screen access; support for the Windows Clipboard- and compatibilitywith printers and displays supported by Windows 3.0.andP;  The program requires a286 or 386 based system with a minimum of 2 MB of RAM and retails for $895.andM;Aldus, PageMaker for Windows.andP;  This product was not included in Microsoft'sPress Kit but we understand that it will be part of the  Microsoftannouncements.andP;  If not, it certainly will be available before very long.andM;Spreadsheets and Modeling SoftwareandM;Microsoft, Excel.andP;  This full-featured version of one of the most popularspreadsheet programs is available for Windows 3.0.andM;Informix Software, Inc., Wingz.andP;  Informix already has versions of thispowerful spreadsheet in the Macintosh, OS/2 PM, OPEN Look on Sun, MOTIF, andNextStep user interface platforms (Both of the last two are GUIs for the Unixworld).andP;

 Price not available.andM;Lotus Development Corporation, Lotus 1-2-3 G. Lotus was no where to be foundin the Microsoft Press Kit.andP;  We had assumed that 1-2-3-G would be part ofthis roll-out.andM;Bell Atlantic, Inc., Thinx Software.andP;  This software package is billed as thefirst &quot;intelligent graphics&quot; program for the Intel world.andP;  It providescomplete integration of data and images, enabling users to work withinformation on the computer in nearly the same way the human mind works.andP;  Itcreates a dynamic, relational interface between images and data, giving usersa powerful new planning, presentation, and decision-making tool.andP;  No price oravailability stated.andM;IMRS, Hyperion.andP;  This package appears to be more of a financial informationtool than a spreadsheet.andP;  1MRS describes it as,  A graphically-orientedfinancial data collection, consolidation, and reporting application, aimed atproviding a corporate-wide solution to financial information management.&quot;andP;  Nopricing included.andM;Meta Software Corporation, Design/IDF.andP;  This specialized program providesinteractive graphical and data dictionary support for the three primary IDEFmodeling methodologies: IDEFO, IDEF1, and IDEFIX.andP;

I am probably the only writerin the entire industry who will not feel compelled to write one.andP;  However,ten writers already have a head start-that is how many books were listed inthe Microsoft Press Kit.andM;Bantam has one by Peter Norton titled Programming Techniques, Howard Sams hasone called The Best Book of Microsoft Windows Features Version 3 by a unnamedauthor; Microsoft Press has three new ones, A Guide to Programming, AProgrammer's Reference, and one on Programming Tools; Osborne-McGrawHill doesnot want to be left out either so they have William H. Murray, III, and ChrisH. Pappas doing one called Windows Programming.- An Introduction; Sybex hasone called Fast Productivity with Microsoft Windows 3.0; and finally, QUE haschosen this announcement to provide us with two more of their &quot;instant&quot;books, Using Microsoft Windows, 2nd Edition, and A Complete Guide to the NewWindows 3.0.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
