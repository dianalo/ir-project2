Western Area Power Administration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">[Docket No. EF89-5041-000]</ITAG>Take notice that on December 28, 1988, the Deputy Secretary of the Departmentof Energy, by Rate Order No. WAPA-39, did confirm and approve on an interimbasis, to be effective on January 1, 1989, that being the first day ofthe January 1989 billing period, Western Area Power Administration's (Western)extension of Power and Transmission Rate Schedules PD-F2; PD-NT2; PD-NFT2;and PD-FCT2 for the Parker-Davis Project (P-DP). The power and transmissionrates will be in effect for a period of 5 years pending the Commission'sapproval of them, or substitute rates, on a final basis, or until superseded.The power repayment study (PRS) and supporting data on which the powerand transmission rates are based indicates that the existing rates aresufficient to maintain a level of revenues that is sufficient to recoverthe costs of producing and transmitting power and energy, maintaining thepower system in good repair, including the recovery of capital investments,and transferring surplus revenues to other Federal power and water projectsin accordance with applicable laws, over a reasonable period of years.A brief summary of the existing rates and the PRS results follows.<ITAG tagnum="74">Current Rate Schedules</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>PD-F2_Wholesale Firm Power: </T3>Capacity Charge, $1.87/kW/mo.; EnergyCharge, $4.28 mills/kWh; Annual Average Composite, $8.55 mills/kWh.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>PD-FDT2_Firm Transmission:</T3> $7.56/kW/yr. or $0.63/kW/mo.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>PD-NFT2_Nonfirm Transmission:</T3> 1.4 mills/kWh.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>PD-FCT2_Transmission Service for Colorado River Storage Project Powerand Energy:</T3> 3.78/kW/season or $0.63/kW/mo.</ITAG>Annual revenues for fiscal year 1987 were approximately $24.2 million,while average estimated operating revenues for the first 5 future years(FY 1988-FY 1992) are approximately $20 million. Revenues are impactedby two factors: (1) The amount of sales (kWh) and (2) the rates for suchsales. Energy sales for fiscal years 1988 through 2007 (termination ofcurrent contracts) are based on firm power and transmission contractualcommitments. The power and transmission rates now in effect are sufficientto recover the costs of producing and transmitting power and energy. Additionally,all Federally funded reimbursable construction of the P-DP facilities hasbeen recovered with appropriate interest.The PRS on which the rate extension is based differs in the treatment offuture replacements from the PRS on which the current rates were based.While the previous ratesetting PRS projected replacements for the entireterm of the study, the PRS for the rate extension projects replacementsfor the 5-future-year cost evaluation period only. In this way a presentlyunnecessary rate increase for this project that has been repaid is prevented.Additionally, since 1983, several events have occurred that are now reflectedin the PRS prepared for the rate extension. First, fuel replacement saleswere made utilizing Western's Boulder City Area Office's transmission systemwith the revenues from those sales shared among projects. Secondly, theP-DP is repaid, in part due to fuel replacement sales revenues as wellas sales greater than expected resulting from surplus water. Lastly, surplusrevenues are used during the 5-year cost evaluation period to repay budgetedinvestments and thereafter are transferred to another project as requiredby law.The Administrator of Western certifies that the existing rates are consistentwith applicable laws and that they are the lowest possible rates to thecustomers consistent with sound business principles. The rate order andassociated rate schedules are submitted by the Deputy Secretary for confirmationand approval on a final basis beginning January 1, 1989, through September30, 1992, pursuant to authority vested in the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission by Amendment No. 1 to Delegation Order No. 0204-108.<T3>Comment date:</T3> January 24, 1989, in accordance with Standard ParagraphE at the end of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Standard Paragraph</ITAG>E.
