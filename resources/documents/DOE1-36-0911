The force of it is, therefore, exceeding that of OPEC.This paper describes the reasons why the petroleum futures market hasbecome active though under the fixed price system of OPEC. The factorsmaking the petroleum futures market active include the political factorcaused by the distrust in OPEC, the economic factors such as the continuingeconomic imbalances in the world and the U.S., the increase of depositmoney for NYMEX, the increase of optional trading of crude oil followedby the presentation of new petroleum products and the generalizationof exchange of futures for physicals (EFP). Although OPEC and NYMEX areexisting together at present, the coexistence of these antithetical organizationsmay be difficult. A struggle of leadership in the crude oil price betweenboth organizations caused by Iran-Iraq War, uncertainty of dollar andconcern about inflation will reach the crucial moment.
