They weren't praying for help from the gridiron gods -- just sucking airon a 92-degree day in which they had spent more time than they bargained fortrying to stop the Giants.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PERRY'S BLOCK, ANDERSON'S RUN LIFT BEARS TO WINOVER GIANTS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The NFL / Week 3; Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;We didn't have much left late in the game,&quot; defensive end Trace Armstrongsaid. &quot;That's what it's all about. You've got to reach down and find somethingyou didn't know you had.&quot;;   What the Bears found was William &quot;TheRefrigerator&quot; Perry, a blocked field-goal attempt and an improbable 20-17victory over the defending Super Bowl champions.;   The surprising Bears are3-0, the Giants an equally surprising 1-2.;   &quot;Whether we played as good as wecan, I really don't care right now,&quot; Bears Coach Mike Ditka said. &quot;I don'tthink there's any quit in any of these guys, and I'm proud of that.&quot;;   NealAnderson's 42-yard touchdown run with 6 minutes, 39 seconds remaining hadgiven Chicago the 20-17 lead. But overtime seemed certain when Matt Bahr linedup for a 35-yard field goal with 15 seconds left.;   Bears quarterback JimHarbaugh was so sure, he wasn't even looking.;   &quot;I was loosening up,&quot;Harbaugh said. &quot;I said, 'For sure, this is going into overtime.' &quot;;   Surely,Bahr had made bigger field goals in his career -- such as the 42-yarder at thegun that gave the Giants a 15-13 victory over the 49ers in last season's NFCtitle game.;   Or his 21-yarder in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl forthe final points of a 20-19 victory over Buffalo.;   Missing Sunday's kick,Bahr said, &quot;was the last thing I expected.&quot;;   Think again. Snap back. Balldown. Kick up. Partially blocked by none other than Perry.;   &quot;He's thetallest guy on the team, you know,&quot; Ditka deadpanned. &quot;It hit him right in thestomach.&quot;;   Actually, Sunday's active roster included 17 Bears taller thanPerry. But none wider. Perry doesn't tip the scales, he pummels them, perhapsat close to 350 pounds. But someway, somehow, Perry had the hang time to get aBears' paw on Bahr's kick.;   At first, the much-maligned Perry declined tocomment on his heroics.;   &quot;Look at it on film,&quot; Perry told reporters as hedressed quickly and left the dressing room.;   Then he relented slightly.;  &quot;It was all 11 Bears defenders. It wasn't just me,&quot; he said. &quot;We pushed themback. I got my hand up and blocked it.&quot;;   End of in-depth interview.;   Moreimportant for the Bears, it was the end of the Giants' comeback.;   &quot;I thoughtthat we had outplayed them overall,&quot; Giants Coach Ray Handley said.;   So callthem lucky. The Bears admit as much. They have won three times by a combinedtotal of eight points, and have been outgained each time out. Those lookingfor works of art in Chicago should head for the Field Museum, not SoldierField this season.;   Artistic or not, it was still a Bears win.; BEARS 20,GIANTS 17; (box) THE HERO: Chicago defensive tackle William &quot;Refrigerator&quot;Perry blocked Matt Bahr's 35-yard field-goal attempt in the final seconds.;  (box) THE GOAT: The Giants' defense couldn't stop the Bears after New York hadrallied with 17 second-half points to take a 17-13 lead.;   (box) KEY PLAY:Bears tailback Neal Anderson burst down the left sideline for a 42-yard TD toput the Bears ahead 20-17 with 6 minutes, 39 seconds remaining.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  St. Louis Post-Dispatch  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Chicago  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910916  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  633  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, September 16, 199100260144,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
