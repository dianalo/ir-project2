Wedistinguish different spatial scales in the response of the mid-latitudesionosphere to the disturbance in the atmosphere/magnetosphere systemthat followed the arrival of the high speed solar wind front. The scalesrange from ''global'' to ''local''. The 5th of October is considereda typical quiet day and gives the baseline for disturbance assessment.The geomagnetic disturbance was persistent but on a rather moderate level.The mid-latitude ionosphere showed no global storm response but moderatedisturbances of various and changing degrees. There were distinct hemisphericdifferences and, in rather small longitude sectors, stormlike depressionswere observed, on different days in different sectors. An unusual morningpeak and a nighttime enhancement of ionization over a very narrow latituderange complement the list of the more outstanding ''local'' disturbancesof the SUNDIAL campaign. We investigated the status and the behaviourof the ionosphere by means of two types of measured data: a) parametersderived from ionosonde measurements (electron densities and characteristicheights), b) parameters derived from beacon satellite measurements (electroncontent).</TEXT></DOC>
