It is a well-known fact that in the case of 3-layer glazing unitsthe sealant is exposed to greater stress than is the case for doubleglazing units by changes in temperature and pressure. The purpose ofthe investigation was to establish how small a size of 3-layer glazingunits was permissible. A number of calculations have been made of glassstresses and deflections for various sizes of glazing units by changesin temperature and pressure. Moreover, a number of units have been exposedto accelerated aging experiments in accordance with DS 1094.4. The conclusionof the investigation is that for 3-layer glazing units it must be recommendedto observe the minimum edge lengths recommended by the Norwegian BuildingResearch Institue. Air space 12 + 12 mm, min. 0.8 m. Air space 9 + 9mm, min. 0.6 m. Air space 6 + 6 mm, min. 0.4 m.</TEXT></DOC>
