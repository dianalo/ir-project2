The case you cited involving the Superior Worm Brokers Exchange Inc. is a valid precedent for documenting scams in this country. Unfortunately, you have lumped all worm-farm operations in the same deceitful category as the Superior Worm Brokers and have given the strong impression that whenever you see a business opportunity offered by a worm-farming operation, &quot;grab your wallet and run.&quot;    By implication, you have included our company, Wiggle Worm Haven Inc., with the likes of Superior Worm Brokers, and we take great offense to that. You stated in your article that Superior claimed there was a demand for worms &quot;as ingredients in shampoo and dog food, as food in the Republic of China, as soil developer for nurseries and garden shops, and for sewage and waste disposal. All lies, federal prosecutors say.&quot; You then go on to quote K. Tate Chambers, the assistant U.S. attorney in Peoria, Ill., as saying there is no real market for worms except as bait.    We at Wiggle Worm Haven Inc. claim nothing more. We raise our cultured nightcrawlers exclusively for bait. Also, if you had looked into the subject of castings (worm manure), you would have found that any garden enthusiast will vouch for the nutritional value of castings. Nightcrawlers are natural soil builders, thus making castings the best organic potting soil around. Castings are about six times richer than normal soil.    People don't realize the enormous numbers involved in the national demand for fish bait. According to High/Low Research, 35 million people purchased a fishing license in 1984. It also states that 79% of these people say they fish 30-plus times per year. If these 79% were to use only one dozen worms on every trip, they would use almost 10 billion worms every year.    As you can see, the national demand for bait is immense. Wiggle Worm Haven Inc. has been in existence for 16 years and prides itself on hard work and honesty. We continue research and development on technology to further the advancement of the worm industry and are striving to instill credibility back into the vocabulary of worm-farming skeptics.    We believe that you owe it to your readers to clarify this misinformation.    Terri Murray   Media Director   Wiggle Worm Haven Inc.   Racine, Wis.</TEXT></DOC>
