Statistics Canada, a government agency, said theseasonally adjusted consumer price index in September wasunchanged from the previous month. In August, the index rose0.2%.</LP><TEXT>   Finance Minister Don Mazankowski said the latest pricedata suggest that &quot;we're on the right track.&quot;   To damp inflation, the Bank of Canada has pursued acomparatively tight monetary policy and allowed a sustainedrise in the Canadian dollar despite the protests of Canadianbusinessmen. The Canadian dollar closed Friday at 88.73 U.S.cents, its highest level in 13 years.   With the latest consumer price data, &quot;we can clearly seethe reward&quot; of the Bank of Canada's anti-inflation policy,said John Grant, chief economist at Wood Gundy Inc., aToronto-based securities company.   The central bank's declared aim is to bring inflation downgradually until price stability is achieved later in the1990s. Its initial target is to slow the year-over-year risein the consumer price index to 3% by the end of next year.But Mr. Grant said the central bank is &quot;ahead of schedule&quot;and he predicted that the year-over-year rise in consumerprices will slow to 2.5% by the end of 1992.   Before adjustment for seasonal influences, the consumerprice index in September was down 0.2% from August, but up5.4% from a year earlier. The year-over-year increase resultspartly from the introduction Jan. 1 of a 7% value-added taxon goods and services.   The Bank of Canada has allowed short-term interest ratesto decline gradually. But the yield on three-month Canadiantreasury bills Friday remained 55% higher than the yield onthree-month U.S. treasury bills.   Most Canadian banks, responding Friday to the latesteasing in short-term rates, announced cuts of half apercentage point in their prime lending rates to 9%,effective today. The move reduced the prime rate, thebenchmark for various lending rates, to its lowest level inmore than four years.   The Bank of Canada can allow short-term rates to declinefurther without jeopardizing its anti-inflation goals ortriggering a fall in the Canadian dollar, said JoshuaMendelsohn, a Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce economist.</TEXT></DOC>
