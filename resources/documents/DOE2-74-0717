On the basis of competitive bidding, a series-producedplant with a rated capacity of 300 kW was ordered from Denmark. The plantwas erected on a rock with favourable wind conditions at Kopparnaes,Inkoo, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland and it was connected to thelocal 30 kV grid in November 1986. The total investment cost of the plant,including earth work, grid connection etc., amounted to FIM 4.6 millionand the costs of the whole project to some FIM 5.4 million. On the siteof the wind power plant the wind speed averages 6.0 m/s, and when operatingwith technical availability of 95% the annual production is 400 MWh.In 1987, the production was one third less than could have been feasible.The outages resulted from small faults or malfunctions in the controlsystem difficult to locate, however. Vibration of the nacelle and itsinsufficient heating in the intense cold contributed to these failures.A small crack has been detected in welds of the attachment plates oftwo blades and there are some marks of wearing in the gear, but thesehave not prevented normal operation of the plant. From September 1987the technical availability has been over 90%. Measurements show thatthe quality of the electricity generated by the plant is sufficietlygood and that the plant does not cause any harmful television or radiointerference in its surroundings. The maximum noise disturbance distancemeasured was about 400 metres.</TEXT></DOC>
