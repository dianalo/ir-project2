Rebel leaders contend the commanders are corrupt and implicatedin human rights abuses.   The unusual gathering of the defense minister, air forcecommander, chief of the joint chiefs of staff and commanders of allbrigades and battalions _ two generals and 35 colonels in all _reaffirmed a rejection of the idea Thursday by President AlfredoCristiani.   ``We feel it appropriate to provide a strong, clear, unitedresponse to the proposal made by the FMLN in Costa Rica,'' saidGen. Humberto Larios, the defense minister.   He described the rebel demand that he and 16 other topcommanders be remoed as ``absurd, ridiculous and impossible.''   Representatives of the rightist government and the FarabundoMarti National Liberation Front, the guerrilla alliance, endedthree days of peace talks Wednesday in Costa Rica. No substantiveaccord was reached, but they agreed to another meeting next month.   An estimated 70,000 people have been killed, most of themcivilians, since the civil war began 10 years ago.   In a nationally broadcast address Thursday, Cristiani alsocalled the purge demand ``ridiculous.'' He accused the rebels ofusing the talks ``tactically'' in an effort to isolate thegovernment and divide the armed forces.   ``The FMLN has not demonstrated the political will to want toachieve peace,'' said Cristiani. ``It refuses to talk about acessation of hostilities. Its entire attitude is one ofprovocation.''   He said it was ``totally absurd'' for the guerrillas to demandthat any cease-fire agreement recognize their control of territoryand stipulate that Supreme Court judges be replaced.   ``We recognize the FMLN is a reality, that it exists, but it isa small reality and cannot oblige the government to change therepublic's constitutional system,'' Cristiani said.   Guerrilla forces control a swath of northern and eastern ElSalvador and are present to some degree in all 14 provinces.   The rebels say the government's insistence on an immediatecessation of hostilities without agreement on eventual reforms is adisguised call for surrender.</TEXT></DOC>
