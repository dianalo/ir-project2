Work was begun on new homes at an annual rate of 1,590,000 units last month, following a revised 2.5% slowdown in May to a 1,602,000-unit rate, the Commerce Department said. The May drop was previously reported as 2.7%.    The June decline, the fourth consecutive monthly slowdown, brought housing starts to their lowest pace since October 1984, when the rate also was 1,590,000 units. Starts haven't fallen for four months in a row since mid-1981.    Still, several economists suggested that the worst of the damage from higher interest rates may be over. &quot;We're seeing a bottoming out of the effect of the run-up of rates in April and May,&quot; said Martin Regalia, chief economist at the National Council of Savings Institutions. &quot;This is not a rosy report, but it's certainly much better than last month.&quot;    Mortgage rates have fallen since late May, although they remain above their level of early April. Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner said most of the decline in starts since February has been &quot;a direct result&quot; of the earlier rise in interest rates. But, noting the recent easing in rates, he predicted that &quot;further declines should spur single-family starts this summer and fall.&quot;    Accompanying the drop in starts was a rise in building permits, which generally are a good indication of future building activity. Permits gained 1.4% in June to a 1,514,000-unit annual pace after falling 6.6% to a 1,493,000-unit rate in May. James Christian, chief economist at the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, predicted that figures for July will show a further increase in permits.    Starts on single-family homes fell 2.4% last month to a 1,092,000-unit pace after a 7.4% drop in May to a 1,119,000-unit rate. Pointing to the single-family weakness, John Tuccillo, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said it is too soon to conclude that home-building is recovering.    &quot;We may be still seeing the effect of the interest (rate) spike, and July could rebound,&quot; he said. &quot;But the other alternative is that we're moving into a housing recession.&quot; He said the trend would be clearer after next month's figures are released.    Multiunit starts rose 3.1% in June to a 498,000-unit pace, after an 11% rise in May to a 483,000-unit pace.    The sharpest drop in starts came in the Northeast, where they fell 9.5% in June after an 8.5% rise in May. Starts rose 13.3% last month in the West after falling 6% the previous month. They dropped 6.8% in the Midwest after a 2% gain, and 2.1% in the South after a 6.9% decline.    The figures are adjusted for seasonal variation. </TEXT></DOC>
