Stockholm's chief prosecutor, Lars Ringberg, said he had insufficient evidence to continue the five-month inquiry. He said he was stymied by Swiss refusal to grant access to secret bank records.    Mr. Ringberg told reporters that Bofors, a subsidiary of Nobel Industrier Sverige AB, had paid at least 319 million Swedish kronor ($53.3 million) into the Swiss bank accounts of several companies. But he said he was unable to determine where the payments went. Determining who received the money is crucial in proving bribery under Swedish law, which prohibits companies paying fees to foreign officials to win contracts.    A Bofors spokesman said the investigation's conclusion supported the company's assertions that it had done nothing improper in winning Sweden's largest export order ever. &quot;We. . .did not use middlemen or pay any bribes,&quot; the spokesman said.    Since the allegations surfaced in April, Bofors has insisted that the payments constituted severance fees to legitimate Indian agents who helped arrange the contract, signed in 1986. A report by Sweden's National Audit Bureau supported the company's position but failed to quell the payments controversy.    In India, investigations into the allegations had a jarring effect on the political fortunes of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who was accused by some politicians of having benefited personally from the alleged Swedish bribe money. He has denied the allegations. Last week, on a visit to Sweden, Mr. Gandhi refused to answer questions about the Bofors case, saying he didn't want to interfere with a parliamentary investigation in New Delhi.    The allegations have enforced perceptions in this pacifist-minded country that the government hadn't kept control of its arms makers. When the India allegations surfaced, Bofors and its parent, Nobel, were mired in other scandals over shipments of war material that had been illegally diverted to Iran and other Mideast countries. </TEXT></DOC>
