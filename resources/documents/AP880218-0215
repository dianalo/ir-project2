Massey, president ofGranada Genetics Inc.   The technique involves removing a few cells from the cow embryoand examining them with a gene probe capable of detecting the Ychromosome, which is present only in male cells and indicates amale embryo, the company said.   Embryos designated male or female can then be shipped to clientsfor transplantation, the company said.   Producing cattle of the desired sex has obvious advantages todairy farmers, who need only females, Massey said. Because ofwidespread use of artificial insemination, one bull can sirethousands of calves.</TEXT></DOC>
