Panel sealing is accomplished by folding the      manufacturer's joint over a free end of the panel, applying an adhesive to      the manufacturer's joint while it is in overlying relation with the panel,      lifting the panel over the manufacturer's joint, and urging the panel into      engagement with the manufacturer's joint so as to become bonded thereto.      Top panel sealing in the foregoing manner proceeds without the necessity      of using the carton contents as a mandrel against which the manufacturer's      joint is otherwise ordinarily folded, thereby permitting the carton to be      erected and sealed along its manufacturer's joint in the absence of      product received within the carton. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The invention relates generally to apparatus and methods for packing      articles in a carton, and more particularly to apparatus and methods for      forming cartons from carton blanks and for filling such cartons, optimally      during the course of carton formation. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Related Art </PAR><PAR>  In many manufacturing and processing facilities, the goods or articles      being produced are individually wrapped or otherwise packaged to preserve      and maintain product integrity and quality until they are opened further      down the product distribution chain by the end user. In such instances, it      is desirable to package the goods in aggregate form within cartons prior      to transport to the end user distribution site in order to facilitate      handling of large quantities of product and to protect the product from      damage during the course of handling and transport at the origination and      destination sites. Goods to be packaged in this manner include many      pre-packaged and loose consumer goods such as foodstuffs (e.g., cereals)      and other boxed and canned goods, consumer electronics and supplies      therefor, and the like. The cartons are typically formed from generally      planar carton blanks which are optimally filled during the course of      carton formation. The carton blanks are generally comprised of four panels      which, when folded along score lines separating the panels, form the top,      base and sidewalls of a rectangular carton. A pair of flaps extend from      the sides of each panel to form the carton ends. A fifth panel or      manufacturer's joint extends from an end of one of the panels to allow for      carton sealing with an adhesive, tape, staples or other fastening means.      In instances where it is desirable to form a sealed carton, the goods are      used as a mandrel against which the carton blank manufacturer's joint is      folded, applied with a sealant such as hot melt adhesive, and secured      against the carton blank panel forming an exterior side of the carton.      Illustrative of the foregoing type of wrap-around carton packing apparatus      and methods is the Model 5WR carton packing system manufactured by      Schneider Packaging Equipment Company, Inc. of Brewerton, N.Y., the      assignee of the invention disclosed and claimed herein. </PAR><PAR>  Carton packing equipment of the type described above is oftentimes operated      at a high rate of carton blank folding and product throughput in order to      maximize product packing and shipping efficiency. During the course of      such high volume operation, as well as during even lower volume operating      cycles, adhesive sprayed by the apparatus toward the manufacturer's joint      incident to carton sealing can overshoot or run from the manufacturer's      joint onto the underlying product package to be encased by the carton.      Such adhesive spray overshoot or run-off is sometimes not visually      detected by equipment operators present during the course of product      packing and is therefore allowed to dry, resulting in an unsightly      adhesive residue on the product package which can adversely impact upon      the product's marketability once it reaches its destination and is      unpacked from its packing carton. Furthermore, product damage can result      in instances where the adhesive bonds together the product package and the      surrounding carton. For all of the foregoing reasons, it is desirable to      ensure proper application of the adhesive to the manufacturer's joint. At      the present time, proper adhesive application can best be obtained by      operating the pack apparatus at a less than optimal rate of throughput and      by instituting more frequent (and therefore costly) inspections and      servicing of the various apparatus components to ensure, among other      things, that buildup at the adhesive applicator is minimized so as to      lessen the occurrence of adhesive spray dispersion beyond the      predetermined spray pattern. However, these measures have the unfortunate      effect of reducing packing productivity and increasing operating expenses,      which offsets the benefit of having automatic packing machinery in the      first place. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In view of the foregoing limitations of the prior art, it is an object and      advantage of the disclosed invention to provide wrap-around carton packing      apparatus and methods which maximize packing efficiency as well as      minimizing product damage and loss resulting from adhesive overspray      during the course of carton sealing. These and other objects and      advantages of the disclosed invention will become apparent from the      following description when read in conjunction with the accompanying      drawings. </PAR><PAR>  In one aspect of the invention, a method is provided for packing one or      more articles within a carton. In the disclosed method, at least one      carton blank is provided having a plurality of panels and a manufacturer's      joint extending from an end of one of the panels located at a first of two      carton blank ends. The panels are folded to a generally J-shaped      configuration, and one or more articles to be packaged within the folded      carton blank is inserted therein. The panels are further folded around the      article to substantially surround the article so as to position the panel      at the carton blank second end adjacent to the manufacturer's joint. The      manufacturer's joint is folded toward the carton blank second end panel so      as to preferably overlie the second end panel, and means such as an      adhesive for securing the carton to the manufacturer's joint is applied.      The carton blank second end panel is folded over the manufacturer's joint      to secure the second end panel to the manufacturer's joint, thereby      enclosing the article within a sealed carton. Folding of the      manufacturer's joint in this manner can proceed without use of the carton      contents as a mandrel against which the second end panel is folded,      thereby minimizing the application of compressive force against the      contents of the carton. Further, the foregoing folding process positions      the manufacturer's joint along the interior surface of the carton, rather      than along its exterior surface, thereby enhancing stackability of the      carton and minimizing the presence of discontinuous surfaces against which      carton handling equipment and other neighboring cartons can become caught. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, side flaps extending from opposite sides of each panel are      folded and secured during carton blank folding so as to produce a sealed      carton having sealed ends. In instances where a generally      rectangular-shaped carton is to be fabricated, the carton blank is      comprised of two width and two length panels which are arranged in an      alternating configuration. Preferably, the manufacturer's joint extends      from a free end of one of the width panels in order that the spring bias      arising from folding of the manufacturer's joint toward the second end      (length) panel can be utilized to enhance adhesive engagement of the      manufacturer's joint with the overlying panel. </PAR><PAR>  In a second aspect of the invention, an apparatus is provided for folding      and sealing the manufacturer's joint of a carton blank. The apparatus      includes an assembly for pivotably displacing a free end of a carton blank      top panel to a position adjacent to a lower end of the manufacturer's      joint and for folding the manufacturer's joint rearwardly over the top      panel free end so as to orient the manufacturer's joint rearwardly. A      sealant applicator is operable to apply a suitable sealant such as hot      melt adhesive to the manufacturer's joint, preferably while the      manufacturer's joint is overlying the top panel free end. A lifting      assembly pivotably displaces the top panel free end away from the      manufacturer's joint to permit manufacturer's joint bending apparatus to      displace or tuck the manufacturer's joint rearward so as to underlie the      top panel, after which the top panel is urged downwardly by top panel      sealing apparatus into superposed engagement with the manufacturer's joint      so as to become bonded thereto. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred aspect of the manufacturer's joint folding aspect of the      invention, the top panel displacement assembly is operatively coupled or      slaved to operation of the manufacturer's joint folding assembly so that      the respective assemblies can be controlled by a single actuation device      such as a pressurized fluid (i.e., pneumatic) cylinder. Independently      controllable pressurized fluid cylinders can be provided for controlling      operation of the respective top panel lifting, manufacturer's joint      bending, and top panel sealing apparatus, the latter two of which can be      arranged so as to be operable along a common pivot axis. The top panel      lifting apparatus can further include apparatus such as rollers for      exerting a downward force against the top panel following top panel      sealing as the carton is advanced to further carton forming stations. The      rollers are preferably independently and resiliently mounted to      accommodate reaction forces exerted by the carton alone or in combination      with its contents, and can be adjustably tensioned to permit the equipment      user to vary the force to be exerted against the sealed top panel as the      carton is transported away from the top panel sealing assembly. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  Further objects and advantages of the disclosed invention will become      apparent from a reading of the following description when read in      conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective side view of a wrap-around carton packing machine      of the type with which the packing apparatus and methods of the disclosed      invention can be used; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is simplified overhead view of a carton packing system of the type      depicted in FIG. 1 modified so as to provide a linear array of carton      forming stations; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a side perspective view of a carton blank illustrating the steps      of carton erection, filling and sealing; and </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 4-10 illustrate in a sequential manner the operation of the packing      machinery for manufacturer's joint folding and sealing in the manner      embodied by the disclosed invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  With reference to the drawings, wherein like reference characters represent      like components throughout the various views, and with particular      reference to FIG. 1, there is depicted a wrap-around carton packing      machine, designated generally by reference character 10, such as the Model      5WR manufactured by Schneider Packaging Equipment Co., Inc. of Brewerton,      N.Y., which is illustrative of the prior art type of packing apparatus      whose performance can be improved by including the apparatus and methods      of the subject invention described below. The packing machine 10 is      comprised of a plurality of stations, designated generally by reference      characters 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20, that are mounted along a frame assembly      22. The first station, designated by reference character 12, provides for      the initial stages of carton erection from a cardboard carton blank 24.      Each carton blank 24 is comprised of a plurality of panels 25 which form      the top, base and sidewalls of the carton. The carton top and base are      formed from length panels 26, whereas the carton sidewalls are formed from      width panels 27 which are generally (but not necessarily) narrower than      are the length panels. The panels 25 are separated from one another by a      pre-fold or score line 28 to facilitate carton blank folding therealong.      The blank 24 typically further includes a plurality of flaps 29 which      extend from the ends of the panels. Major flaps 30 extend from the ends of      length panels 26, whereas minor flaps 31 extend from the ends of the width      panels 27. While each of the panels 25 is depicted in the drawings having      a flap 29 extending from its respective ends, it is to be appreciated that      the carton blank 24 can be configured differently from that described      above and depicted in the drawings in accordance with the type and      dimensions of the carton to be formed thereby. A fifth panel or      manufacturer's joint 32 extends from the width panel positioned at the end      of the blank 24 to permit the carton sealing. In a manner well known in      the packing art, a plurality of cardboard carton blanks 24 can be stored      at the station 12 and sequentially removed from storage by an appropriate      carton handling apparatus, designated generally by reference character 33,      for further processing by the machine 10 in the manner described below. </PAR><PAR>  The handling apparatus 33 can be in the form of a conventional mechanical      or vacuum-operable assembly of the type which is operable to engage and      remove a single carton blank from a stack of carton blanks. In the      illustrated machine 10, a vacuum-operable device is shown which uses      negative pressure for application to one side of the carton blank through      appropriate vacuum cups 34 that are engageable with the blank so as to      permit for carton blank displacement from a generally vertical orientation      at the station 12 toward a generally horizontal configuration in the      direction of the arrow so as to initiate the process of carton erection.      In a manner that is well known in the art and employed in the      above-referenced 5WR carton packing apparatus, the cardboard blank 24 is      directed against a preliminary box forming assembly 36 that is comprised      of a pair of laterally spaced upstanding rollers 37 and a pair of flap      folding scissor arms 38 positioned along the near (box carton back end)      side of the machine 10. The upstanding rollers 37 (only one of which is      visible in FIG. 1) are positioned such that the blank 24 if folded along      the score line 28a separating the lowermost width and length panels so      that these respective panels attain a generally perpendicular orientation      as the carton blank 24 is received within a carriage assembly 39 mounted      along carton conveyor 40. Upon receipt of the carton blank within the      carriage assembly 39, the carton blank assumes a generally J-shaped      configuration so as to permit for the receipt of goods therein at the      second (loading) station, indicated generally by reference character 14. </PAR><PAR>  Loading of the partially-assembled carton at the loading station 14 is      accomplished from a front end of the carton, as illustrated in FIG. 2.      Individually packaged consumer products such as soup cans, cereal boxes,      coffee cans and brick packs, and the like which are of generally small      dimensions, are packed in aggregate form within the carton to facilitate      handling of large quantities of the goods during the course of product      transport to a distribution center or retail store, at which the carton      can be opened and the goods removed therefrom for further processing      and/or sale. Once the preliminarily-formed carton has been loaded, it is      advanced along the conveyor 40 to a third station 16 for pre-breaking of      the manufacturer's joint 32, after which the carton blank is transported      to a forth station, designated generally by reference character 18, for      application of a suitable box sealant such as hot melt adhesive to the      manufacturer's joint 32 and top panel sealing thereto. The carton blank      major flaps 30 are sealed to the sides of the carton at the fifth station,      designated generally by reference character 20, thereby substantially      sealing the entire carton and the goods contained therein. </PAR><PAR>  In typical wrap-around carton packing apparatus such as the type described      above, the major flap folding and sealing station 20 is typically      positioned at a right angle to the manufacturer's joint gluing and folding      station 18, thereby necessitating a sudden and severe change in direction      of the carton and goods contained therein as the carton is advanced      through the apparatus. Such sudden and drastic changes in direction can      cause unsettling and shifting of the goods within the carton, and      furthermore necessitates the commitment of a considerable amount of square      footage of floor space to accommodate not only the stations of the packing      machine, but also further carton handling apparatus which come into play      following carton filling and sealing. For these reasons, the third and      fourth stations of the above-referenced carton packing apparatus have been      modified so as to permit for a new wrap-around carton packing system which      provides for a linear array of the aforementioned work stations 12, 14,      16, 18 and 20 in order that sudden and severe changes in direction of the      carton and contents contained therein can be avoided altogether and      packing plant floor space can be maximized. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, there is depicted in schematic form an      in-line wrap-around carton packing system in accordance with the teachings      of the disclosed invention, which can be included as an adaptation of      conventional wrap-around carton packing apparatus such as that described      above. As is shown in the respective drawing figures, a carton blank 24      having a pre-arranged configuration of panels 25 and flaps 29 is removed      from a stacked array 41 of cardboard carton blanks for folding and filling      in the manner described below. For the sake of clarity throughout the      following detailed description, the various components of the carton blank      24 will be identified by further specific reference characters. The carton      blank 24 is configured to provide a conventional four-sided rectangular      carton upon assembly. Accordingly, the carton blank includes a width panel      27a that is positioned at a first, lower end of the carton blank 24 and      adjacent to the manufacturer's joint 32. Side flaps 31a extend from both      sides of the panel 27a. Length panel 26a is positioned adjacent to the      width panel 27a and is separated therefrom by score line 28 a. Side flaps      30a extend from both sides of the length panel 26a. A second width panel      27b is separated from the length panel 26a by a second score line 28b.      Side flaps 31b extend from the sides of the width panel 27b. The second      length panel 26b is separated from the second width panel 27b by a third      score line 28c and includes two side flaps, designated by reference      character 30b. Although the manufacturer's joint 32 is depicted as      extending from the lowermost width panel 27a along score line 28d, it is      to be understood that the manufacturer's joint can alternatively be      configured so as to extend from a correspondingly positioned length panel      in accordance with the equipment user's preference and the orientation of      the packing machine. Placement of the manufacturer's joint adjacent to the      first width panel 27a is preferred, for it allows resilency in the      manufacturer's joint following its folding or pre-breaking in the manner      described below to facilitate bonding engagement with the overlying top      panel. </PAR><PAR>  As the cardboard carton blank 24 is directed from the substantially      vertical orientation depicted in the drawing to the generally horizontal      orientation in the manner described above, it engages the preliminary box      forming assembly 36 (FIG. 1) in such a fashion that score line 28a      separating the first width and length panels 27a and 26a, respectively,      engages the upstanding rollers 37 so as to cause the first width panel 27a      to assume a generally upright, perpendicular orientation with respect to      the first length panel 26a, which assumes the position as the carton base.      As the carton blank is further directed away from its initial vertical      orientation, it is received within the carriage assembly 39, a front end      39a of which provides for folding of the carton blank along the second      score line 28b so as to orient the second width panel 27b and attached      second length panel 26b along a plane which is generally perpendicular to      that of the carton base panel 26a, thereby providing a partially-formal      carton 42 having a J-shaped carton configuration. As carton folding is      proceeding, goods 44 such as canned goods, cereal boxes, industrial      products and the like are forwarded by a suitable in-feed conveyor 46 to      an accumulator conveyor 48 for delivery at station 14 in timed relation to      a partially assembled carton 42 at station 14 for loading therein through      the carton opening 52 defined by length panel side flaps 30a, 30b and      width panel side flaps 31a, 31b facing the accumulator 48 (FIG. 2). Once      the goods have been loaded into the partially-formed carton 42, the      carriage 39 transports the carton 42 to the manufacturer's joint      pre-breaking and sealing station 18 for further processing, as is      described below in connection with the description of FIGS. 4-6.      Preferably, folding of the manufacturer's joint does not proceed until      after the second length panel 26b is folded downward from its generally      vertical orientation to a generally horizontal orientation parallel to the      carton base (panel 26a) so as to protect the goods 44 received within the      carton 42 from glue overspray during the course of subsequent glue      application to the manufacturer's joint at the fourth station 18. Once      glue has been applied to the manufacturer's joint, the carton top panel      26b is elevated above the manufacturer's joint, which is urged downward as      the top panel 26b is superimposed thereover so as to bind the top panel to      the manufacturer's joint. Due to the upward resilient bias of the      manufacturer's joint arising from the pre-folding process at the third      station, resilient engagement between the manufacturer's joint and the top      panel is enhanced. Thereafter, the substantially completed carton 42 is      transported to the fifth station 20 for sealing of the major flaps 30a,      30b to corresponding side flaps 31a, 31b in a conventional manner, such as      by adhesive bonding, stapling, taping or the like. </PAR><PAR>  With reference to FIGS. 4 through 10, there are depicted aspects of the      manufacturer's joint pre-breaking station 16 and manufacturer's joint glue      application and top panel sealing station 18 of the subject invention      which permit configuration of a wrap-around carton packing machine in an      in-line configuration. As was noted previously, configuration of the      overall machine in an in-line manner affords an economy of floor space      utilization as well as the minimization of changes in direction of the      partially-assembled carton and goods contained therein during the course      of carton assembly. With particular reference to FIGS. 4 and 5, details of      the components comprising the third station 16 are depicted. The station      includes a frame assembly 58 comprising a pair laterally spaced vertical      supports 60 from which extend a corresponding one of a pair of upper      horizontal supports 62 and lower horizontal supports 64. Throughout the      following specification, reference will be made to frame structures in the      singular so as to more accurately reflect the subject matter of the      drawings. However, reference to frame structures in the singular is meant      to encompass the corresponding (undepicted) frame structures in the plane      of the drawing sheets, unless the context or description provides      otherwise. The lower horizontal support 64 adjacent to the back end of the      pre-formed carton 42 (i.e., the side nearest the viewer) projects into the      page so as to abut against the closed side flaps 31a and 31b to inhibit      product exit from the back end of the carton. Coupled to the upper      horizontal support 62 is the panel folding assembly, denoted generally by      reference character 66, for effecting top panel folding and manufacturer's      joint breaking in the manner described in detail below. The drawing also      illustrates the spatial relationship of the carton 42 carried within the      carriage assembly 39 with respect to the various components of the      station, most notably the panel folding assembly 66. In a manner well      known in the packing art, the carriage assembly 39 and partially assembled      carton 42 carried thereby are transported along the conveyor 40 to a      position in indexed relation to the panel folding assembly 66, the details      of which are illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5. In particular, FIG. 4      illustrates the configuration of the panel folding assembly components      upon carton receipt within the station, whereas FIG. 5 illustrates the      configuration of the folding assembly components following top panel      folding and manufacturer's joint folding or breakage thereagainst. </PAR><PAR>  With particular reference to FIG. 4, the carriage assembly 39, which      maintains the pre-formed carton 42 in a generally rectangular      configuration throughout its passage through the packing machine, is      comprised of a carrier chain 70 formed from a plurality of chain links 72      to which is attached by an appropriate bracket 73 a pair of      laterally-spaced front lugs 74 and rear lugs 76. The front and rear lug      pairs are spaced relative to one another in accordance with the dimensions      of the carton to be carried thereby. </PAR><PAR>  The panel folding assembly 66 is itself generally comprised of a generally      vertically-oriented pressurized fluid cylinder 78 such as a pneumatic      cylinder having a cylinder rod 80 reciprocably extensible therein. The      cylinder 78 is supported generally above the upper horizontal support 68      by a cylinder support assembly 82 that is comprised of a vertical support      84 that is connected at its lower end to a transversely-extending beam 86      which couples the support 84 to the two upper horizontal supports 62. The      cylinder 78 is connected to the vertical support 84 through a      horizontally-disposed plate member 88 to which a back end 90 of the      cylinder is connected through a conventional U-shaped bracket 92. The      bracket 92 defines a pair of laterally-spaced arms between which is      received a flange 94 extending from a back end of the cylinder. A hinge      pin 96 extends transversely through an aperture formed in the respective      aligned bracket arms and cylinder flange to couple the cylinder to the      support 84. </PAR><PAR>  Underlying the upper horizontal support 62 and supported thereby is a      sub-assembly 98 of mutually engageable gears for effecting manufacturer's      joint folding in a manner described below. The gear sub-assembly 98      includes a support bracket 100 from which depend a pair of front and rear      gear support flanges 102 and 104, respectively, of which a single one of      each pair is illustrated in the drawing. An axle 108 extends between the      pair of front flanges 102 and is supported by a bearing 107. An axle 106      extends between the rear flange pair 104 and is likewise supported by a      bearing 107. A spur gear 110 is fixedly mounted to the rear axle 106, the      rotation of which is operatively coupled or slaved to rotation movement of      a spur gear 112 fixedly mounted to the front axle 108. The rear and front      spur gears 110 and 112 each respectively carry a plurality of intermeshing      teeth 114 and 116 along at least a portion of their respective      peripheries. Fixedly coupled to the rear axle 106 are a plurality of panel      roller assemblies 117, each of which is comprised of a pair of laterally      spaced roller support arms 118 and a panel roller 120 that is coupled to      the respective support arms 118 through an axle 122. Preferably, a number      of panel roller assemblies 117 is mounted to the axle 106 that is      sufficient to extend substantially the entirety of the depth (i.e., the      dimension of the carton extending into the page of the drawings) of the      carton 42. A curved guide bar 124 extends from at least one of the arms      118 of each assembly 117 for the purpose of guiding the top panel 26b      downward as the panel rollers 120 are brought into engagement with the top      panel. </PAR><PAR>  A similar arrangement of panel roller assemblies to that recited for the      rear spur gear axle 106 is provided for the front spur gear axle 108. More      particularly, the roller assemblies 127 associated with the front spur      gear axle 108 include a pair of laterally-spaced roller support arms 128      that are fixedly mounted at one end thereof to the spur gear axle 108 and      carry a roller wheel 130 that is supported by an axle 132 extending      between the roller support arms 128 of each support arm pair. Extending      between the two pairs of paired support arms 128 is a curvilinear guide      bar 134 which extends from a support brace 136 in a direction counter to      that of movement of the carriage assembly 39 and carton 42 carried      thereby. Rotational control is imparted to the axle 108 and roller      assemblies 127 carried thereby from the actuation cylinder 78 through a      control arm 138 that is fixedly mounted at one end thereof to the axle 108      and is pivotably coupled at the second end thereof to a free end of the      reciprocably-extensible cylinder rod 80. Coupling between the control arm      138 and cylinder rod 80 is accomplished by conventional pivotable coupling      apparatus such as a hinge pin 140 that is extensible through aligned and      correspondingly dimensioned apertures formed in the control arm and rod. </PAR><PAR>  Operation of the top panel and manufacturer's joint folding station 16 of      the disclosed invention will now be described. A pre-manufactured carton      42 having a substantially J-shaped configuration is transported to the top      panel and manufacturer's joint folding station 16 by the carriage assembly      39. Upon attainment of a pre-determined position within the station 16,      the carriage stops in registration with the panel folding assembly 66. As      the carton 42 is advanced towards its registration position within the      station, the upwardly-extending top panel 26b is engaged by the      curvilinear guide bar 134 and is urged downwardly thereby. At this initial      stage of cylinder operation, the cylinder rod 80 is in the retracted      position, thereby positioning the respective associated roller assemblies      117 and 127 apart from one another so as to assume the position      illustrated in FIG. 4. With reference to this drawing, it is to be noted      that the roller assemblies 117 of the rear axle 106 are positioned at an      angle of approximately 60.degree. with respect to the vertical, whereas      the roller assemblies 127 are positioned at an angle of about 90.degree.      relative to the vertical. Upon actuation of the cylinder 78 so as to      outwardly extend the cylinder rod 80, rotational driving input is imparted      by the cylinder to the spur gear axle 108, thereby rotatably driving the      spur gear 112 fixedly mounted thereto in a counter-clockwise direction so      as to rotatably drive the slaved spur gear 110 in a clockwise direction,      thereby urging the respective roller assemblies 117 and 127 carried by the      respective spur gear axles 106 and 108 toward one another to the position      depicted in FIG. 5. As the spur gear 112 is rotatably driven in the      foregoing manner, the rollers 130 coupled thereto are pivoted into      engagement with the manufacturer's joint 32 and rolled thereagainst so as      to bend or &quot;break&quot; the joint along the score line 28d separating it from      the adjoining width panel 27a. As the rollers 130 are pivoted toward the      manufacturer's joint in the foregoing manner, rollers 120 associated with      the slaved spur gear 110 are pivoted toward the top panel 26b and, as a      result of the closer physical proximity to the top panel 26b, physically      engage the top panel along with the associated curvilinear guide bar 124      to urge the top panel 26b downwardly toward a generally parallel      orientation with respect to the carton base panel 26a. As a result of the      foregoing roller proximity, the top panel 26b is urged downward to its      desired, parallel orientation with the base panel prior to physical      engagement of the rollers 130 with the manufacturer's joint 32.      Accordingly, as the cylinder rod 80 is extended further from the cylinder      78, the rollers 130 are pivoted toward the manufacturer's joint 32 and      rolled thereagainst, thereby bending the manufacturer's joint over the      free end 142 of the top panel 26b, as shown in FIG. 5. Once the break has      been formed in the manufacturer's joint in the foregoing manner, the      cylinder rod 80 is retracted within the cylinder 78, thereby rotatably      driving the associated spur gear 112 in a clockwise direction to pivotably      displace the rollers 130 away from the manufacturer's joint from the      position depicted in FIG. 5 to the position depicted in FIG. 4. As the      spur gear 112 is rotatably driven in this manner, the slaved spur gear 110      is rotated in a counter-clockwise direction so as to pivotably displace      the rollers 120 and guide bar 124 associated therewith from the position      depicted in FIG. 5 to that depicted in FIG. 4. As the cylinder rod 80 is      further retracted within the cylinder 78, the carriage assembly 39 is      advanced in accordance with conventional timing control input to a      predetermined indexed position within the manufacturer's joint glue      application and top panel sealing station depicted in FIGS. 6-10. </PAR><PAR>  With reference to FIG. 6-10, and particularly to FIG. 6, the manufacturer's      joint gluing and top panel working apparatus is depicted as being      generally comprised of a station frame assembly 150 which supports the      following sub-assemblies: a manufacturer's folding and joint tucking      assembly 152, a top panel lifting assembly 154, a manufacturer's joint      sealing assembly 156, and a sealant application assembly 158, the details      of each assembly being described below. Sequential operation of the      foregoing assemblies is controlled in a conventional manner, such as with      a suitable arrangement of air tank(s), conduits and controlled valves (not      shown) so as to ensure proper sealing of the top panel to the      manufacturer's joint. The frame assembly 150 includes a pair of      laterally-spaced front and rear vertical supports 160 and 162,      respectively, which, in turn, support a pair of upper horizontal supports      164 and lower horizontal supports 166, of which a single one of each pair      is depicted in these side views. The respective horizontal supports 164      and 166 are mounted to the respective vertical supports 160 and 162 by      appropriate brackets 168 . The upper horizontal support 164 can be formed      continuously with the horizontal support 62 of the third station 16 (FIGS.      4 and 5) of the disclosed invention. The near lower horizontal support 166      projects into the page to abut against the closed side flaps 31a and 31b      of the carton 42 so as to inhibit product egress through the partially      open back side of the pre-formed carton 42. </PAR><PAR>  Each of the respective manufacturer's joint and top panel working      sub-assemblies 152, 154 and 156 is coupled to the station frame assembly      150, and particularly to the upper horizontal support 164 thereof. More      particularly, the manufacturer's joint tucking assembly 152 is coupled to      the upper horizontal support 164 through a sub-frame 170 which extends      generally transversely upwardly from the horizontal support 164. The      sub-frame 170 includes a beam 172 which extends upwardly from the      horizontal support 164 and is coupled thereto in a conventional manner at      a lower end of the beam by a bracket 174. First and second flanges 175 and      176 extend transversely from the beam 172 in mutually perpendicular planes      and support in the manner described below components of the respective top      panel lifting and manufacturer's joint folding and tucking assemblies 154      and 152, respectively. </PAR><PAR>  The manufacturer's joint tucking assembly 152 includes a pressurized fluid      cylinder 177 having a flanged back end 178 that is receivable within the      arms 179 of a generally U-shaped bracket 180. A hinge pin 181 extends      through an aperture formed in the bracket arms 179 and cylinder flange 178      to vertically mount the cylinder 177. A cylinder rod 182 is reciprocably      extensible within the cylinder 177. The free end of a cylinder rod 182 is      pivotably connected by a hinge pin 184 to one end of a connecting arm 186.      The other end of the connecting arm 186 is rigidly affixed to a      cylindrical sleeve 187 rotatably supported by a portion of an axle 188      extending between a pair of arms 189 depending from the horizontal support      164. Extending from the sleeve 187 is a spacer 190 to which is affixed one      end of a generally L-shaped bar 192, the lower, curved end 194 of which is      engagable with the manufacturer's joint 32 upon actuation of the cylinder      180 in the manner described below. </PAR><PAR>  The top panel lifting assembly 154 includes a pressurized fluid cylinder      200 from which extends a reciprocably-extensible cylinder rod 202. A back      end of the cylinder is provided with a flange 204 which is dimensioned so      as to be received between the arms 205 of a generally U-shaped bracket      206. A hinge pin 208 extends through an aperture formed within the flange      and bracket so as to pivotably support the cylinder 200 from the sub-frame      170. A free end of the cylinder rod 202 is connected by a hinge pin 210 to      the top panel tensioning sub-assembly 212 by a connecting arm 214. A lower      end of the connecting arm 214 is coupled to a transversely extending brace      216 which supports a plurality of pairs 217 of roller support plates 218      arranged parallel to one another, of which the end plate 218 of the end      plate pair 217 closest to the viewer is depicted. Each plate 218 is      provided with a plurality of laterally spaced, vertically disposed slots      220 through which extend an axle 222 which rotatably supports a roller      224. Brackets 226 positioned along a front and back end 218a, 218b of each      of the plates 218 mount a roller tensioning cord 228 which transverses a      serpentine path between adjacent roller axles 222 and tensioning pins 230      fixedly mounted to the plates 218 and extending perpendicularly therefrom      generally parallel to the axles 222. The tensioning cord 228 is preferably      in the form of a urethane rope and is adjustably positionable within each      of the brackets 226 so as to provide for an appropriate downward tension      upon the roller axles 222 and rollers 224 carried thereby in accordance      with the height of the carton 42 received within the station and the      extent (if any) to which the top panel is upwardly distended by the      contents of the carton. Because the urethane is stretchable and exhibits      an elastic memory, each roller 224 is independently responsive to      pressures exerted by the contents of the container so as to be displaced      away from the container top panel 26b upon displacement of the a given      roller axle 222 within the slot 220. Due to the elastic memory of the cord      228, however, the roller 224 is returned to the rest position with the      axle 222 at the lowermost portion the slot 220 upon the release of      pressure exerted against the roller. Tensioning of the rollers 224 in the      foregoing manner permits for the exertion of a user-selected range of      pressures against the carton top panel 26b as the carton 42 is advanced      through the station 18. </PAR><PAR>  The back end of the top panel tensioning sub-assembly 212 is pivotably      coupled to the upper horizontal support 164 through a generally inverted      U-shaped bracket 232 having a pair of laterally spaced arms 233 between      which is received a vertically-upstanding flange 234 extending from a      cross-brace 236 coupling each of the roller support plates 218. A pivot      pin 237 extends through a correspondingly dimensioned aperture extending      through the bracket arms 233 and flange 234 received therebetween so as to      pivotably support the back end of the top panel tensioning sub-assembly      212. Upon pivotable displacement of the top panel tensioning sub-assembly      212 in the manner described below, panel lifting arms 238 extending      rearwardly from a forward end of each of the outerlying roller support      plates 218 engage and elevate the top panel 26b above the manufacturer's      joint 32 so as to permit positioning of the manufacturer's joint      thereunder prior to top panel sealing. The lifting arms are coupled to the      respective end plates by brackets 240. Preferably, the upstream, free end      242 of each lifting arm 238 is inclined downwardly so as to facilitate      positioning of the lifting arm 238 underneath the corresponding flap 30b      as the partially assembled carton 42 is transported by the carriage 39 to      its registration position within the station. </PAR><PAR>  With particular reference to FIG. 7, details of the manufacturer's joint      sealing and sealant application assemblies 156 and 158, respectively, will      be described in conjunction with their respective modes of operation. The      manufacturer's joint sealing assembly 156 is generally supported by a      sub-frame 250 that includes a beam 252 which is vertically upstanding from      a cross-brace 253 extending between the horizontal supports 164 and is      coupled thereto by a mounting bracket 254. A flange 256 extends generally      transversely outwardly from the beam 252 at an upper end thereof. A      generally U-shaped inverted bracket 258 is mounted to the flange 256 and      is dimensioned to receive between the arms 259 thereof a flange 260      extending from a back end of a fluid-actuated cylinder 262. A hinge pin      264 extends through a correspondingly-dimensioned aperture formed in the      bracket arms 259 and a cylinder flange 260 so as to suspend the cylinder      262 in a generally vertical orientation. A cylinder rod 266 is      reciprocably extensible within the cylinder 262 and is pivotably coupled      to one end of a connecting rod 268 by a hinge pin 270. The second, free      end of a connecting rod is fixedly attached to the axle 188 described      above, such that reciprocable extension of the cylinder rod 266 effects      rotatable displacement of the axle 188 within the axle arms 189. Fixedly      coupled to the axle 188 and depending therefrom is a pair of      laterally-spaced roller support assemblies 271, each of which includes a      pair of spaced roller support arms 272. An axle 273 extends between the      support arms 272 and rotatably mounts a roller 274. Preferably, a      plurality of roller assemblies 271 are spaced along the length of the axle      188 so as to extend substantially the entirety of the depth of the top      panel 26b (exclusive of side flaps 30b). </PAR><PAR>  The manufacturer's sealant application assembly 158 is comprised of a      plurality of spray modules 280, such as the model M3967 manufactured by      Nordson Corp. of Amherst, Ohio, which are operable to emit a sealant spray      in a predetermined pattern 282. The spray modules 280 are mounted along a      support manifold 284 which defines therein a sealant reservoir for supply      of the modules 280. The manifold 284 is coupled to the horizontal upper      support 164 by a plurality of mounting brackets 285 which extend across      the depth of the manifold into the plane of the page. Sealant is expelled      from the manifold 284 into the spray modules 280 in a conventional manner      upon the delivery of heated glue under pressure through line 286, which is      coupled to the manifold through an appropriate fluid fitting 288. </PAR><PAR>  Operation of the manufacturer's joint sealant application and top panel      folding stations will be described in connection with the sequential      illustrations in FIGS. 6-10. The carriage 39 is operable in the manner      described above to transport a partially-formed carton 42 to a point of      registration within the station, as indicated by FIG. 6. Thereafter, the      manufacturer's joint tucking assembly 152 is operable in a conventional      manner to direct the generally L-shaped bar 192 into engagement with the      manufacturer's joint 32 so as to displace the manufacturer's joint      rearwardly to the position illustrated in FIG. 7. Pivotable displacement      of the L-shaped bar 192 is accomplished by extension of cylinder rod 182      outwardly from cylinder 177, thereby supplying rotational input to the      sleeve 187 and directing the bar 192 coupled to the sleeve to pivot in a      counter-clockwise direction so as to engage and displace the      manufacturer's joint in the foregoing manner. While the manufacturer's      joint 32 is held by the arm 192 in the position depicted in FIG. 7, the      sealant application assembly 158 is operable to emit a sealant spray from      the spray modules 280 thereof so as to deposit a suitable sealant such as      a hot melt adhesive upon an outer surface of the manufacturer's joint for      bonding with the top panel 26b in the manner described below. The spray of      sealant is effectuated upon the delivery of a suitable quantity and      pressure of fluid through the supply line 286, thereby directing sealant      from the reservoir within manifold 284 into the modules 280. The modules      280 are preferably arranged so as to be detachably mounted to the manifold      284 so as to permit for their servicing, replacement or re-configuration      thereon in accordance with such varied factors as the dimensions of the      manufacturer's joint upon which sealant is to be applied and the desired      pattern of sealant application. Once the sealant has been applied to the      manufacturer's joint, the cylinder 177 is operable to retract cylinder rod      182 therein, thereby effecting a clock-wise rotational input to sleeve 187      and the return on the L-shaped bar 192 to the position indicated in FIG.      6. </PAR><PAR>  Upon the completion of sealant spray application, the top panel lifting      assembly 154 is operable so as to direct elevation of the top panel 26b      from a position below the manufacturer's joint toward a position above it,      as illustrated in FIG. 8. The elevation of the top panel is accomplished      by retracting cylinder rod 202 within cylinder 200, thereby effecting a      pivotable upward displacement of the top panel tensioning sub-assembly 212      along pivot axle 237. As the top panel tensioning sub-assembly 212 is      displaced in the foregoing manner, the top panel lifting arms 238      depending therefrom are brought into engagement along the underside of the      top panel flaps 30b, thereby pivotably displacing the top panel 26a as      shown in the drawing. While the top panel tensioning sub-assembly 212 is      in the upwardly displaced position, the manufacturer's joint tucking      assembly 152 is operable so as to reciprocably extend cylinder rod 182      from cylinder 177, thereby imparting counter-clockwise rotational input to      axle sleeve 187 and engagement of the L-shaped arm 192 with the      manufacturer's joint 32 so as to displace it to a position underlying the      free end of the top panel 26a, as shown in FIG. 9. Once the manufacturer's      joint has been displaced so as to underlie the top panel 26a, the top      panel lifting assembly is operable to extend cylinder rod 202 from      cylinder 200 so as to lower the top panel tensioning sub-assembly 212 and      urge the top panel 26a into engagement with the manufacturer's joint 32.      At about the time of downward displacement of the top panel tensioning      sub-assembly 212, cylinder rod 266 of the manufacturer's joint sealing      assembly 156 is extended from cylinder 262, thereby imparting a clockwise      rotational pivoting displacement of the axle 188 and associated top panel      rollers 274 thereof, and arm 192 is retracted to its home (retracted)      position. As the roller support arms 272 carrying the rollers 274 are      displaced to the generally vertically upstanding orientation depicted in      FIG. 10, the rollers are directed into engagement with the top panel 26a      so as to urge the top panel into frictional engagement with the      manufacturer's joint and the sealant associated therewith, thereby      effecting sealing of the carton top panel to the manufacturer's joint.      Following extension of the cylinder rod 266 and resultant clockwise      pivotable displacement of the roller arm 272 and associated roller 274 in      the foregoing manner, the cylinder rod 266 is retracted within cylinder      262, thereby imparting counter-clockwise rotational input to the axle 188      so as to pivotably displace the roller arms 274 and associated rollers      away from the top panel 26a to the rest position depicted in FIG. 9. Once      the roller 274 has been displaced away from the top panel in the foregoing      manner, the carriage assembly 39 can be commanded to transport the carton      42 from the manufacturer's joint folding station 18 in the direction of      the arrow A to permit for sealing of the major flaps 30a and 30b to the      carton side flaps 31a  and 31b. Major flap sealing can be accomplished in      any of a variety of conventional ways at a subsequent, downstream sealing      station. </PAR><PAR>  The foregoing method and apparatus enable the manufacturer's joint to be      sealed to the carton in a manner which more completely protects product      within the carton from sealant overspray and which permits the      manufacturer's joint to be folded along an interior surface of the carton,      thereby rendering a carton having a substantially uniform, smooth exterior      surface which facilitates carton handling and stacking. The foregoing      method and apparatus also provide for carton packing which can proceed      along a substantially linear path from carton erection to filling and      sealing, thereby maximizing the efficiency of floor space utilization and      eliminating altogether the occurrence of sudden and extreme shifts in      angular orientation of the carton and goods contained therein. It will be      appreciated that the various panel working assemblies of the subject      invention can be controlled by any of a variety of conventional control      means, such as pneumatic control means commonly associated with packing      apparatus. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
