Troops fired at citizens in at least one incident late Sunday,and protesters were reported blocking streets in Shanghai, China'slargest city. There were no troops there, according to Shanghairadio.   The slaughter that left at least 500 dead, perhaps thousands,drew worldwide condemnation but failed to completely quell the7-week-old student-led campaign.   Chinese sources said senior leader Deng Xiaoping ordered thebloody invasion from a hospital where he is seriously ill withprostate cancer. `Even if they're functioning out of ignorance,they are still participating and must be suppressed,'' Deng, 84,was quoted as saying of the protesters.   The sources were from the office of Li Xiannian, the formerpresident and now the head of an important advisory body. Officialsnever have confirmed Deng is seriously ill.   Tens of thousands of troops were stationed around the 100-acreTiananmen Square. As many as 200,000 more were believed camped inthe outskirts of the city.   Other areas of the capital were dominated by hundreds ofthousands of angry citizens who bolstered barricades to restricttroop movements.   Chinese students marched tearfully in Taipei, Paris, London, SanFrancisco, New York, Los Angeles, Oslo and Vancouver. In Hong Kong,which will revert to Chinese rule in 1997, about 200,000 peoplerallied to mourn the Beijing slaughter.   The military entered the city to enforce martial law, declaredMay 20 but not enforced then because of a government power strugglecaused by the protest movement. The struggle pitted hardliners suchas Deng and Premier Li Peng against moderates such as CommunistParty leader Zhao Ziyang, who reportedly lost his post.   Soldiers began shooting, beating and running over Beijingresidents late Saturday as they finally started their deadly pushto Tiananman Square, where students were in the third week of asit-in. Flames from burning military vehicles seized by protesterslit up the sky, and bodies were scattered in the streets.   On Sunday evening, about 100 troops charged into a residentialarea just north of the square, shooting into narrow alleyways aswomen clutched their babies and people fell to the pavement. Afterthe attack, residents came out again and taunted the soldiers withcries of ``fascist!''   Thousands of people returned to the Xidan intersection about amile west of the square to re-erect barriers and set fire tomilitary vehicles and buses.   People blocked some roads with large trucks, others with simplefood stalls.   ``Before this happened we loved the party,'' said one40-year-old worker. ``Now we oppose the party. We deeply oppose theparty.''   The worker was one of thousands walking through the FuxingHospital in western Beijing, where 21 bodies were laid haphazardlyon the floor.   About 200 yards west of the hospital, at the Muxidiintersection, was a large abandoned convoy of military vehiclesthat had been torched. Flames still shot out of some of the 70trucks, vans, and armored personnel carriers.   Muxidi was the scene of a pitched battle Saturday night, withtroops bombarding citizens with tear gas and gunfire beforeblasting through their barricades.   ``It was horrible. They killed old folks and small children,''said one weeping old man.   Except for the area around Tiananmen, the city was generallyfree of troops, although there were reports the army planned tomove into the university campus area in the northwest.   Troops shot indiscrimately during the march to Tiananman.Citizens responded by hurling rocks. No casualty toll wasavailable, but a doctor said 500 people died and others said thedeath toll may be in the thousands. Several thousand were hurt.   One doctor said he was aware of a young man who was strangled bytroops with chains.   Official government announcements on the army attack, airedrepeatedly on national television, said the troops ``suppressed acounterrevolutionary riot'' and achieved a ``great victory in thestruggle to end turmoil in the capital.''   The Beijing municipal government said soldiers and police``strictly observed discipline'' and said ``their heroic acts andglorious exploits have won fervent praise and strong support fromthe masses of students and citizens.''   The reports said three soldiers were killed and more than 1,000injured by ``thugs,'' but did not mention casualties among thepopulace.   An announcer for the English-language Radio Beijing, monitoredin Washington, said thousands of people, mostly civilians, werekilled. The station later switched announcers and returned toreading government pronouncements.   The evening news showed a tank knocking down the ``Goddess ofDemocracy,'' a 33-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty thatwas put up by students.   The student-led protests began April 15, with students callingfor talks with the government on bringing greater social freedomsand ending official corruption. Regular citizens joined theprotests, and at times 1 million people poured through the streets.   On March 13, students began a round-the-clock occupation ofTiananman. Martial law was declared seven days later, but effortsby troops to move against the students were thwarted peacefully byhuge throngs who massed around convoys, urging soldiers not tofight them.   Two staffers of the American television network CBS,correspondent Richard Roth and cameraman Derek Williams, werereleased Sunday night after being detained in Tiananmen, thenetwork's office said.   A reporter for the French magazine Paris Match was slightlywounded when a ricocheted bullet hit him and a Japanesephotographer was shot in the foot. Two Reuters correspondents weredetained. One was blindfolded, roughed up and held for six hours.</TEXT></DOC>
