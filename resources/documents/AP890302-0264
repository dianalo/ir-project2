They say that conflicting testimony, a discredited witness andstock-trading complexity has cast doubt on a case, which is seen asa test of the government's ability to convince juries of Wall Streetcrimes.   ``This is a government stretch,'' said Gerald Lefcourt, aprominent securities fraud defense attorney. ``It's a case thatprobably wouldn't have been brought a few years ago.''   So far, few signs of government strength in the case haveemerged. A mistrial was declared in January after a prosecutorwithheld evidence, albeit unintentionally. The defense haschallenged the integrity of the star witness. Testimony hasn'texactly captivated jurors, who often appear confused or bored.   GAF and its vice chairman, James Sherwin, are charged withillegally trying to manipulate the stock of Union Carbide Corp. inOctober 1986 to maximize profits from the planned sale of a largeblock of shares. The indictment also charges securities fraud,conspiracy and wire fraud.   The government closed its case Tuesday with a witnesscontradicting testimony of brokerage firm founder Boyd L. Jefferies,an admitted felon who is the government's main source of evidence.He is expected to testify in other fraud trials as part of a pleadeal with the government.   ``It clearly cannot help the government's case that its two majorwitnesses are testifying inconsistently on what appear to beimportant points,'' said Robert Morvillo, another securities frauddefense attorney.   The GAF trial is one of the few criminal stock manipulation casesto reach a jury involving a company traded on the New York StockExchange; the last was the trial of Edward Gilbert, convicted in1981. He was known as the ``boy wonder'' of Wall Street beforerunning into trouble in the early 1960s.   Earlier manipulation cases, prevalent during boom market years inthe 1960s, typically involved lightly traded stock of smallcompanies. It is far more difficult to alter the price of a stockthat trades in large volume.   The GAF case is thorny, lawyers said, because it involves just afew days of trading in Union Carbide rather than a long-term patternof manipulation. Also, the stock price was only marginally affectedin the alleged deal and the accused didn't profit.   Lefcourt said he believes criminal charges in such a case wouldbe logical ``if somebody is trying to manipulate a stock and makes afortune and clearly is doing something to hurt the public investor.You don't see that here.''   The prosecution also must show that the defendants conspired tointentionally manipulate the stock. The combined factors have madesome lawyers wonder why the government made GAF its test case.   ``The difficult part of this one is you've got one trade and aswearing match between the different interested parties on what thepurpose was,'' said Peter Romatowski, a former head of thesecurities fraud section in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.   ``The purpose is everything _ what was in the people's minds whenthe trade was conducted,'' said Romatowski, now a private attorney.   After the defense moved for dismissal Tuesday, U.S. DistrictJudge Mary Johnson Lowe said the case posed the problem ofdistinguishing between a manipulative trade and one thatlegitimately causes a stock price change. But she refused to throwit out.   The GAF case also is important because it tests informationsupplied by Boesky, the former arbitrager who paid the government$100 million to settle insider trading charges in late 1986.   Boesky fingered, among others, Jefferies, who agreed to pleadguilty to two securities law violations, quit his Los Angeles firmand testify against other alleged criminals. His testimony isconsidered critical to separate cases against speculator Salim B.Lewis and takeover investor Paul Bilzerian.   The GAF defense, led by attorney Arthur Liman, widely known fromthe 1987 Iran-contra hearings, has sought to paint Jefferies as afelon whose word can't be trusted. James Melton, chief broker atJefferies andamp; Co., contradicted Jefferies on several key points,including whether Sherwin ordered stock manipulation.   Some lawyers in Boesky-derived cases claim the government isabusing its discretion by bringing criminal charges instead of civilones.   ``I think you've got a new set of rules by virtue of the dealsthe government has made with Boesky, Jefferies and (investmentbanker Martin) Siegel, and the government needs to justify thosedeals,'' Morvillo said.</TEXT></DOC>
