Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK </IN><TEXT>   For the second time in six weeks, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. spent a chunk of its dwindling cash balance to liquidate a long-insolvent California thrift.    The FSLIC closed Farmers Savings, of Davis, Calif., and said it will begin issuing checks today to pay off the thrift's $324 million of insured deposits. The thrift had less than $1 million of uninsured deposits, the FSLIC said.    After the liquidation, the FSLIC's cash balance will fall to $2.08 billion. The FSLIC hopes to recover about $125 million by liquidating Farmers Savings' assets, leaving the insurance fund with a loss of $198.9 million on the closure.    Farmers Savings isn't related to Farmers Group Inc., a big Los Angeles-based insurance company.    The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates thrifts and controls the FSLIC, said it liquidated Farmers Savings rather than provide assistance for a sale or merger because Farmers lacked a retail deposit base that would be attractive to other thrifts.    &quot;It didn't have any franchise value to sell,&quot; said Roger Martin, a Bank Board member who was in Davis yesterday for the liquidation. Mr. Martin said Farmers Savings was targeted for closing because it was paying high rates to attract deposits, therefore driving up the deposit costs of other thrifts.    Farmers Savings was paying an average deposit rate of 8.95%, or 1.57 percentage points above the thrift industry's national average cost of funds of 7.38%. Farmers also was frequently included in a weekly list of thrifts paying the highest rates on various maturities of so-called &quot;jumbo&quot; certificates of deposit, with minimum amounts close to the deposit insurance limit of $100,000.    Mr. Martin acknowledged that closing Farmers Savings will have little effect on the rates paid for the rest of the thrift industry's nearly $1 trillion of deposits. But he said that several Bank Board actions in recent months will have a cumulative effect on the industry's cost of funds.    Mr. Martin cited the Bank Board's recent mergers of insolvent thrifts in Texas and its liquidation on June 6 of two insolvent Southern California thrifts. The liquidation of American Diversified Savings Bank and North America Savings andamp; Loan Association, both based in Costa Mesa, Calif., required the FSLIC to pay out $1.35 billion in cash. Mr. Martin said the payouts are 98% complete.    All three of the liquidated California thrifts were declared insolvent several years ago and placed in the Bank Board's management consignment program. Under that program, a thrift's managers are thrown out and succeeded by managers on loan from a healthy thrift or by consultants chosen by the regulators. Farmers Savings was placed in the program in 1985.    Mr. Martin also said that all three of the liquidated thrifts were originally state-chartered and had enjoyed broad investment powers under California law. He attributed their failure, in part, to a shortage of state thrift examiners in California several years ago.    Farmers Savings was at the top of a list of 24 likely candidates for liquidation compiled recently by Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., thrift consultant. When the list was published by the American Banker, a trade newspaper, Bank Board officials said the probability of thrifts on the list being liquidated was &quot;very low.&quot;    Eighteen of the thrifts on Mr. Ely's list are in the Southwest, where the Bank Board is trying to avoid liquidations. And Mr. Ely, in an interview yesterday, said that large liquidations are unlikely.    &quot;We might see some small liquidations, but the biggies just aren't in the cards, given the lack of cash in the FSLIC,&quot; Mr. Ely said. </TEXT></DOC>
