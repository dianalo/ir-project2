Civil aviation authorities said there was no need tosuspend the A320, as flight recorders from the crashedairliner gave no initial indication that a technical faultcaused the disaster. But the Union of Flight Engineers andTechnicians at Air Inter said it wants the A320s to be&quot;halted as long as the real causes of the accident are notknown&quot; and until remedies are implemented.</LP><TEXT>   The union has long been critical of the A320 because ituses a two-pilot cockpit crew instead of the traditionalthree-person crew that includes an engineer.   The plane's makers acknowledged yesterday that A320spreviously had problems with a navigation computer. However,an Airbus Industrie spokesman said that &quot;this is an old thingwhich has been treated and resolved.&quot; He wouldn't comment onthe nature of the problem and declined to speculate onwhether it had any bearing on the crash.   Pilots disputed Airbus's assurance that the problem hadbeen resolved. A safety committee of the pilots' trade unionsaid air crews twice reported faulty navigation data lastyear in the A320 -- the model that plowed without warninginto the Vosges mountains Monday as it was preparing to landat Strasbourg.</TEXT></DOC>
