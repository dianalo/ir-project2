There are several moduletypes, including those based on crystalline silicon, thin film materials,both single junction and multijunction, and those using sunlight concentration.All these types show the potential for both efficiency improvements andcost reduction, with module costs of around $2/Wp likely within the nextfew years. The rate of development of any particular technology dependsboth on its level of success in the market and that of photovoltaic modulesin general. It is to be expected that several types of module will provecost competitive, due to the varied requirements of the many applicationsof photovoltaic systems.</TEXT></DOC>
