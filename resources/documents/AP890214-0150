A lawyer for Central American immigrants said the sight of aprison will intimidate some people from applying for refugee status.   The applicants will not be locked in the minimum-security PortIsabel Service Processing Center, but INS District Director Omer G.Sewell said detention is being considered as a way to manage morethan 100,000 Central Americans expected to pour into southern Texasthis year.   ``There are a number of alternatives that are being considered,and as Attorney General (Richard) Thornburgh said, detention was oneof them,'' Sewell said.   He said a dispute with Harlingen officials over garbage, humanwaste and fire code violations at the asylum office speeded uppreviously made plans to move to the rural INS detention centersoutheast of the city.   But he said the INS could continue to process hundreds of asylumapplicants in town if it chose to. ``We want to be good citizens inthis community as well,'' Sewell said.   The city evicted the agency from a former furniture store on theedge of town Friday and chained the doors. The city also obtained atemporary restraining order in state court to prevent the agencyfrom reopening an unsafe and unsanitary facility.   INS officials responded Monday by obtaining a federal restrainingorder to regain access to the building, where they cut the chains.   Sewell said the INS will go on using that building to process theapplications of people seeking amnesty under the 1986 immigrationreform law.   Beginning Wednesday, however, all political asylum claims must besubmitted at the rural detention center. Asylum can be granted toimmigrants fleeing political or other forms of persecution.   Asylum processing will take place at a building outside thedouble-fenced detention area, Sewell said. As of Tuesday, 425undocumented aliens were detained there, most of them pendingdeportation proceedings.   City Manager Gavino Sotelo welcomed the move but called it a``partial solution.'' He said the INS needs to detain asylumapplicants who otherwise will continue to strain local communitieswith their need for shelter and assistance.   ``They need to address this problem the way they did withrefugees from Vietnam, Cuba and Haiti,'' Sotelo said.   During an influx of Cubans and Haitians in the early 1980s, thegovernment used facilities similar to the detention center insouthern Texas, Sewell said.   The center, on approximately 400 acres near the Laguna AtascosaNational Wildlife Refuge, also has an immigration court, he said.   At the current rate of 2,000 or more Central Americans a weekcrossing the border illegally near Brownsville, Sewell said heexpects more than 100,000 asylum-seeking immigrants to pass throughthe area this year.   ``Hopefully we'll get control of the situation and there won't bethis large-scale need for processing asylum applicants,'' Sewellsaid.   The remote location and prison setting will discourage peoplefrom seeking asylum, said Mark Schneider, an attorney with theHarlingen-based Proyecto Libertad legal aid office for CentralAmericans.   ``It's going to be a return to the old days, where people wentunderground instead of working through the system,'' said Schneider,one of a group of immigration attorneys who on Jan. 6 sued the INSover a policy that restricted asylum-seekers to southern Texas whiletheir cases for refugee status were under review.   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela issued a restraining order Jan.9 allowing the immigrants to pursue their claims at their intendedU.S. destinations, but Vela has said he probably will allow the INSto resume the no-travel policy next Monday.   The policy, which took effect Dec. 16, was blamed for a suddenincrease of homeless Central Americans living in makeshift tents andcondemned buildings in Texas' already impoverished Lower Rio GrandeValley.   Health, safety and traffic concerns expressed by communityleaders in Harlingen at that time led to immigration officialsplanning the move of the asylum processing, Sewell said.</TEXT></DOC>
