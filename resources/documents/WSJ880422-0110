Familar faces leap out at him page after page.    &quot;We basically know all of them,&quot; says the brigadier, who heads the intelligence division in the security branch of the South African police. &quot;We're up to date.&quot;    The book is bulging with mug shots of 4,000 people the police suspect have left the country to be trained as African National Congress guerrillas. For the police, it is a photo guide to revolution.    &quot;When any of them come into the country, we know it,&quot; says Brigadier Stadler. &quot;The basic problem of the ANC is that they cannot operate inside South Africa.&quot;    Nearly two years into the state of emergency, South Africa's security forces are confident they have ANC guerrillas on the run, despite a spate of recent minor bomb explosions in Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town. &quot;If the ANC is of the opinion that they can overthrow South Africa by violence,&quot; says Brigadier Stadler, &quot;then they've got another think coming.&quot;    Police officials concede that during the two years of continuous unrest beginning in late 1984, the ANC was able to achieve a freedom of movement it didn't previously enjoy. An increasing number of insurgents were being trained at home, and cells of ANC cadres burgeoned in most of the major townships. The number of terrorist attacks multiplied.    But, using wide emergency powers and a widespread network of informers, the police believe they have regained the upper hand. Under Section 29 of the Internal Security Act, police can detain people, without charging them, for interrogation. Since the imposition of the state of emergency in June 1986, thousands of activists have been detained. Not coincidentally, the police scored a series of major victories against the ANC last year, busting up important underground cells in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Pretoria and arresting 80 foreign-trained guerrillas and killing another 26 -- all the while adding pictures to the ANC photo album.    &quot;I can assure you, we get a lot of information this way,&quot; says Brigadier Stadler.    Another way -- perhaps even more significant -- is through informers. The townships are full of them; some trade information with the police to stay out of jail themselves, while others, mainly ex-ANC members who have defected or been arrested, are employed by the police outright.    At police headquarters in a Pretoria shopping arcade, Brigadier Stadler introduces a black man identified only as Peter. Dressed in a blue three-piece suit, Peter says he has been working for the police since 1981 when he returned to South Africa from his ANC post in a neighboring state. His job is to identify any ANC members he spots in the townships, as well as to deter blacks from joining the ANC. A day or two before the interview, Peter had fingered a couple of ANC operatives who had recently slipped into South Africa.    &quot;Peter saw someone who had been trained outside,&quot; says Brigadier Stadler. &quot;He called the police and said where to pick them up.&quot;    Peter's conversion, from a ragtag ANC guerrilla to a smartly dressed security agent, is fairly typical of the scores of informers working for the police. Peter (a name given him by the police) left South Africa, like hundreds of other young blacks, following the 1976 black student uprising in Soweto. He applied for political asylum in Botswana, where ANC representatives gave him a pseudonym and a crash-course in ANC ideology.    It wasn't long before he went to ANC headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, and from there he was assigned to a training camp in Angola. Training alongside Cuban and Angolan soldiers fighting in the Angolan civil war, Peter spent months learning how to be an urban guerrilla. What he remembers most, though, is the squalid condition of the camps. &quot;Each of us had five to 10 bouts of malaria or diarrhea,&quot; he recalls. &quot;We all suffered from food poisoning.&quot;    Eventually, he was assigned to one of the ANC's regional headquarters in southern Africa. He won't say which one, to protect his identity. There, his task was to facilitate the infiltration of guerrillas into South Africa. But he soon became disillusioned with the ANC's lack of success.    Peter says he also became troubled by contradictions he saw in the ANC. For instance, he says, the organization would call for unity in the liberation struggle, but then tell its cadres not to have anything to do with other black organizations. And, he complains, while ANC officials in Lusaka were jetting around the world, soldiers in the field were wearing ill-fitting clothes and getting a pittance for food.    &quot;Finally you realize you're on your own, fighting a losing battle,&quot; he says. He grew to hate and fear the ANC so much, he says, that he forged a passport, crossed over into South Africa and gave himself up to the police.    Today, he earns 1,200 rand ($550) a month and enjoys all the employment benefits of policemen. He even talks like the other policemen: The ANC, he says, is controlled by communists and manipulated by Moscow, which wants to turn South Africa into a Marxist state.    But Peter and his fellow ANC defectors can go beyond that standard rhetoric with a line that is much more valuable to the police: &quot;If I would see my younger relative joining the ANC,&quot; he says, &quot;I'd tell him to go back home, that he shouldn't go through the same things I did.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;The Long Struggle: The ANC Is Banned, But It Is in the Hearts of a Nation's Blacks --- In South Africa, the Group Survives Assassinations, Government Crackdowns --- The Black, Green and Gold&quot; -- WSJ April 22, 1988)   ---                    Pretoria vs. the ANC    South Africa's tally against foreign-trained guerrrillas    YEAR                  ARRESTED               KILLED    1976                       0                    0    1977                      15                    2    1978                      29                    4    1979                      22                    1    1980                      25                    5    1981                      17                    5    1982                      14                   11    1983                      28                   18    1984                      59                   19    1985                      21                   15    1986                      52                   40    1987                      80                   26   Source: South African Police</TEXT></DOC>
