Just don't try it at thenew Greer Park skateboard bowl.;    On Tuesday, city council members shiedaway from an outright ban on drinking in all parks citywide. Instead, theyagreed unanimously to prohibit the consumption of alcohol only at theskateboard park. Under the ordinance, drinking still would be allowed inpicnic areas at Greer Park.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DRINKING AND SKATEBOARDING DON'T MIX, P.A.DECIDES  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;I don't want to send a message to kids that alcohol in parks is synonymouswith fun in parks,&quot; said Vice Mayor Gary Fazzino. &quot;I'm particularly concernedabout alcohol use at a facility that is devoted almost solely to minors -- theskateboard park. But the time is not right for a stronger proposal. Thesupport just isn't there.&quot;;    Concerned that many nearby cities restrictdrinking in parks, Fazzino and other council members had urged that Palo Altoadopt its own ban.;    But staff members argued that such a ban might undulylimit or curtail alcohol consumption at private and city-sponsored events atparks.;    Police department officials also said that adequate laws alreadyexist to deal with alcohol problems in parks, including those prohibitingminors from possessing alcohol in public places and regulating publicdrunkenness.;    Drinking is currently allowed in all parks except Lytton andCogswell plazas downtown. Police said they respond to about 13 calls a yearabout drinking in parks, most at Cogswell Plaza and El Camino Park.;    ThePalo Alto Municipal Golf Course has a licensed bar that serves alcohol. Andbeer, wine and champagne are allowed when the city's community centers, theBaylands and Foothills parks interpretive centers and the Palo Alto CulturalCenter are rented for private parties, as long as $1 million in liabilityinsurance coverage is secured. Consumption of alcohol is also allowed in parksat city-sponsored events such as the annual Chili Cook-Off and the MusicFestival.;    Residents argued that banning alcohol would diminish theirenjoyment of the parks. Others also argued that a ban would not solve theprimary problem.;    &quot;Increasing accessibility to shelters and detox programsis the way to solve the problem of drinking in parks,&quot; said Jim Burklo,director of the Urban Ministry, which runs a shelter and counseling programsfor the homeless. &quot;You have to consider where these people will go if they aredriven out of El Camino Park. Will they disappear? The answer is no.&quot;;   Skateboarders, though, who are eager to make the city's new concrete bowl amodel for other cities, applauded the ban at Greer Park's skateboard bowl.;   &quot;I have no desire to skate with anyone who has been drinking,&quot; said MartinRinard, who regularly skates at the Greer Park bowl. &quot;I think this ban is anappropriate action.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CAROLYN JUNG, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910530  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  471  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 30, 199100151046,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
