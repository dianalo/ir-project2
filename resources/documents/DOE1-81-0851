The source of informationfor this paper is the National Inventory Update of Abandoned Mine Landsfor Indiana. Three types of subsidence occur in Indiana: pit, trough,and shaft. Pit subsidence has caused the vast majority of Extreme DangerSubsidence Problems. The average depth of subsidence is 105 ft. and 78%of these problems are in areas where the overburden is less than 165ft. thick. The mining of The Springfield and Seelyville Coal Seams accountsfor more than 50% of the problems. Both seams usually have poor qualityroofs of shale and poor quality clay floor materials; the SeelyvilleSeam has a particularly mobile underclay. Early mining techniques ofirregular room configuration and insufficient pillar support have hada profound influence on subsidence. The average year that mine productionbegan is 1909, when many of these early mining techniques were stillbeing employed in Indiana. The outlook for subsidence in Indiana is thatthe problems will persist and their numbers may increase as the yearsput more stress on the older mines.</TEXT></DOC>
