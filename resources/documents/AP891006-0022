But even as Judgment Day fell Thursday for a fallen Bakker,electronic evangelism beamed resiliency amid the spatter of scandal.   ``TV evangelism is not dead. It's damaged, and it's changedpermanently,'' said religious historian David Harrell of theUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham. ``But there clearly is anaudience buying the product these people are selling, which isministering to lonely, alienated people.   ``Because some of these great men had warts, it's not going tocause the faithful to lose their faith.''   Jimmy Swaggart lost 69 percent of his viewership and 72 percentof the enrollment at his Bible college after revelations in 1988that he paid a prostitute to pose naked and talk dirty.   Faith healer Oral Roberts, burdened with a $25 million debt, isclosing his City of Faith Hospital and medical school in Tulsa,Okla. Two years ago, before scandals raised skepticism, Robertstold his flock that a 900-foot-tall Jesus had appeared in a visionand God would ``call me home'' if believers didn't send in $8million. He got the money.   Jerry Falwell raised more money than ever this year, thanks tobrisk sales of cassette tapes for home Bible study. But the MoralMajority founder, who dismantled that conservative political arm inAugust, has dropped from the top 10 televangelists in TV ratingsbecause of a 52 percent slip in viewership.   Pat Robertson, the failed Republican presidential candidate,returned to ``The 700 Club'' last year after revenues fell byone-third. He has recovered his losses, and contributions are neartheir 1986 peak of $139 million, according to spokesmen at hisChristian Broadcasting Network.   ``The fallout has affected everyone in religious broadcasting tosome degree, but God is still on the throne,'' said Robert Cook,executive director of the 1,300-member National ReligiousBroadcasters, an umbrella group for the $2-billion-a-year industry.   Earlier this year, the Internal Revenue Service began auditing23 TV ministries and said tax exemptions for some could be injeopardy.   Even before the IRS action, the NRB expelled Swaggart andtightened its rules, insisting each member make public yearlyaudits of donations and spending.   The NRB says that at the local level, the electronic church isflourishing, with the number of Christian TV stations growing morethan 50 percent to 336 in three years and the number of radiostations increasing 8 percent to 1,485.   But overall credibility suffered because of Bakker's andSwaggart's misdeeds.   Shortly after the scandals, only 23 percent of Americans said TVevangelists could be trusted with money, a Gallup poll showed. In aNew York Times-CBS News Poll, 75 percent of regular viewers of TVevangelists thought they were too concerned with money, andone-third of the contributors had an unfavorable opinion of TVministries.   ``People don't want to write blank checks anymore,'' saidRichard Yao of Fundamentalists Anonymous, a New York watchdog groupfounded in 1985 by people who had quit evangelical churches.   In 1987, the group inducted Swaggart into its Hall of Infamy asa ``a one-man horror show,'' derided Roberts for ``spiritualextortion,'' described Falwell as an ``overexposed and fadingstar,'' and called Robertson ``the reverend who would be king.''   The newest inductee will be Bakker, whom Yao called ``one of thebiggest con men of the century.''   Bakker, 49, was convicted Thursday of wire fraud, mail fraud andconspiracy for diverting more than $3.7 million in PTL money tosupport a lavish lifestyle.   His downfall began with his 1987 confession to having had asexual tryst with New York church secretary Jessica Hahn. Heallegedly tried to buy her silence with $265,000; she later baredher soul and her body for $1 million in Playboy magazine.   Penthouse featured prostitute Debra Murphree recreating theposes she said Swaggart paid her to do in motels.   Swaggart tearfully confessed in 1988 to ``moral failure.''Defrocked by the Assemblies of God and ordered to stay away fromtelevision for a year, he instead took a three-month TV break _ andsaw his audience nose-dive from 2 million households to 923,000,according to Arbitron, the TV rating service. This year, he is seenin 628,000 households.   Falwell's revenues this year were $135 million, up $47 millionfrom the previous year, because of cassette sales and other non-TVrevenue. Falwell took over PTL from Bakker but failed to keep itout of bankruptcy court.   ``It was our greatest growth ever,'' Falwell spokesman MarkDeMoss said of the favorable revenues. ``We finally feel farremoved from the situation we found ourselves in the middle of twoyears ago.''   Robertson also has rebounded. Ratings are up 18 percent sinceRobertson returned to ``The 700 Club'' 15 months ago. He also isbuilding a $21 million conference center in Virginia Beach, Va.   ``It was a chastening thing, a cleansing thing,'' spokesmanDavid Hummel said of the scandals. ``We've weathered the storm.''</TEXT></DOC>
