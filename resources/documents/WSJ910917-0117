The disclosure by Germany's second-largest bank adds freshmomentum to allegations of widespread abuses within Germany'sloosely regulated securities industry.

All fiveresigned last Thursday after they were confronted with thefindings of the audit.   &quot;They were found to have worked for their own benefit, andnot in the interests of the bank and its customers,&quot; said aDresdner Bank spokesman. However, he emphasized that theiractivities didn't result in any monetary losses for DresdnerBank or its customers.   The bank didn't provide names, the sums involved or anyother details. But bank sources said the employees acted forpersonal gain by placing new issues among friends andrelatives, and acted on prior knowledge of customer orders.   German law doesn't specify insider trading as illegal,although certain activities can be prosecuted if traders aresuspected of having manipulated prices or committed fraud.Dresdner Bank said it doesn't plan to file charges againstthe bond traders.   But the Frankfurt state prosecutor's office said itcouldn't rule out including the employees of Dresdner Bank inits own tax-fraud investigation in the German securitiescommunity.   Separately, the Insider Commission, which enforces thevoluntary trading rules of the self-regulated Frankfurt stockexchange, said three traders for Deutsche Bank and a Germanfinancial broadcast journalist were exonerated from anonymouscharges that they manipulated trading in stock options.Deutsche Bank had fired one of the employees this summer, butfor reasons it claimed were unrelated to securities trading.   The Insider Commission consists of a retired judge andfour assistants from banking and industry. The panel said itcould find no evidence that the exchange's voluntary insiderrules had been violated. In the past 10 years, it has beenable to prove one case of insider trading.</TEXT></DOC>
