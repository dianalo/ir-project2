But now NTT faces restructuring and possible dismemberment,partly because of links to one of the worst political scandals inJapan's postwar history.   Critics and former officials blame NTT's problems on confusionabout whether it really has become private. The government stillowns three-quarters of NTT's stock, and its employees are subjectto the same restrictions as public servants.   ``The most serious mistake was the government tried to satisfyeveryone, including politicians, government agencies and NTT'slabor union,'' said Yoichi Sando, an analyst at Asahi ResearchCenter, a private thinktank.   ``That left NTT in an ambiguous status of half-public andhalf-private in the past four years,'' he said. ``NTT wasconsistently under pressure to fulfil these two contradictoryroles.''   NTT appeared to be successfully transforming itself into acompetitive company after the government privatized it in April1985, following trends in the United States and Britain to promotecompetition in telecommunications.   It has has undergone major changes since then, reducing its workforce by more than 10 percent and launching many new services.   ``We would never be able to make those drastic changes if weremained government-owned,'' Haruo Yamaguchi, president and chiefexecutive of NTT, told the Associated Press in an interview. ``Theprivatization was certainly a major turning point in our company's43-year history.''   The privatized NTT became the most profitable company in Japanwith record earnings of 496.7 billion yen or about $3.8 billion in1987. It was also the most popular company among new universitygraduates seeking jobs in 1987 and 1988 because of what they saw asits stability and progressive image.   But big trouble surfaced when NTT's link to a major briberyscandal surfaced last year. It has led to the arrests of formerchairman Hisashi Shinto and three other senior executives sinceFebruary.   Prosecutors are also investigating the company's lobbyingpractices with politicians, and there is some expectation that NTTwill somehow be restructured or broken up.   The price of the utility's stock, once the most popular issue onthe Tokyo Stock Exchange, has been stuck around 1.5-million-yen ashare, or $11,360, less than half its peak of 3.18 million yen ashare in April 1987.   Critics say NTT has been victimized by conflicting interests ofpoliticians and bureaucrats.   Hajime Nakayama, a former official of the Ministry of Posts andTelecommunications, which supervises NTT, said the ministry wasunder strong pressure to deregulate the communication market.   But when the ministry suggested breaking up NTT into regionalcompetitors and reducing parliamentary oversight, he said, ``we metwith opposition from politicians and government officials who havea large stake in NTT.''   The company was left in the awkward position of having tocompete with other companies while being required to aid the samerivals in the name of fair competition.   NTT president Yamaguchi said the unclear status sometimeshindered his ability to run the company effectively.   ``I am aware we really have no other choice but to let thegovenment decide what they will do with us,'' he said. ``Butfrankly, I wish they would leave us alone and let us run thecompany on our own, or don't privatize it at all.''   Critics say the firm's alleged involvement in the bribery affairsymbolizes its dilemma. Shinto and other executives were chargedwith receiving bribes from an information-based conglomerate calledRecruit, which leased equipment from NTT and bought two U.S.-madesupercomputers from it.   But legal experts say the alleged bribes would have been anordinary business practice if the deal took place between twoprivate companies.   The 1985 law that changed NTT's status says its workers remain``semi-public servants'' and prohibits them from receiving moneyand valuables.   After the arrests of the senior officials, NTT employeesexpressed confusion about their status. Some were surprised thatthey were still subject to the same laws as politicians and publicservants, though they no longer enjoy the privileges of publicservants.   ``The arrest of the chairman reminded many of us that we are notall that private as we thought we were,'' said Takao Nakajima, ahead of the firm's advertising section.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday, April 23</NOTE></DOC>
