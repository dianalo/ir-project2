The amendments were printed Friday in a supplement to the KenyaGazette.   Parliament voted unanimously Aug. 2 to amend the constitution toempower the president to fire a High Court judge or Court ofAppeals judge without reason and without having to go through atribunal process.   It gave the head of state the same power to fire members of thePublic Service Commission.   Parliament also changed the constitution to allow police to holda capital crime suspect for 14 days instead of the previous 24hours before bringing him to court.   Traditionally, there is a 14-day waiting period between the timea constitutional change is proposed and debate in Parliament. Butthe measures sailed through the chamber unopposed five days afterthe attorney general proposed them.   Lawyers and clergymen fought the changes, saying they woulderode the checks and balances between the executive and thejudiciary and undermine individual liberties.   Kenya, by law, is a one-party state and approval of theconstitutional changes had been expected.</TEXT></DOC>
