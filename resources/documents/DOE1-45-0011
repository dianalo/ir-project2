Bacteriacontaining a gene (kdsA) which codes for a temperature-sensitive KDO-8-phosphatesynthetase were plated at the restrictive temperature of 42{sup 0}C onmedium containing 5 mM KDO. Since bacteria containing the kdsA lesionare unable to grown at 42{sup 0}C due to inhibition of lipopolysaccharide(LPS) synthesis and accumulation of lipid A precursor, this method alloweddirect, positive selection of mutants capable of utilizing exogenousKDO for LPS synthesis. Spontaneous mutants, selected at a frequency ofabout 10{sup -6}, required exogenous KDO for growth at 42{sup 0}C. Thegrowth rate at 42{sup 0}C was nearly normal in the presence of 20 mMKDO and was directly proportional to KDO concentrations below 20 mM.Exogenous KDO also suppressed accumulation of lipid A precursor. Theapparent K/sub m/ for KDO accumulation was 23 mM, and the maximum rateof transport was calculated to be 505 pmol of DKO per min per 10{sup8} cells. Bacteria incorporated exogenous [{sup 3}H]KDO exclusively intoLPS, with less that 10% dilution in specific activity due to residualendogenous KDO synthesis. The mutation giving rise to the ability toaccumulate exogenous KDO was extremely useful in the direct screeningfor new mutations in the kdsA gene after localized mutagenesis. Fivemutations in kdsA were isolated, four of which were new alleles as determinedby on fine-structure analysis. The ability to introduce labeled ({sup3}H, {sup 13}C, and {sup 14}C) KDO in vivo should simplify and extendthe analysis of this critical metabolic pathway in gram-negative bacteria.</TEXT></DOC>
