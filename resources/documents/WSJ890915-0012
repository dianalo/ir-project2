The proposal had split the profession down the middle and generated a lot of violent arguments for and against such &quot;plain paper&quot; statements. But a key committee of the 286,000-member American Institute of Certified Public Accountants dropped the proposal last Friday after holding an all-day hearing the day before, at which the &quot;plain paper&quot; approach was supported and vilified.    &quot;Frankly, I had mixed emotions about the proposal, because some clients may need it, but the committee felt it wasn't worth the potential of compromising professional standards and quality,&quot; said Kenneth Huffman, a member of the institute's seven-member accounting and review services committee. The committee dropped the proposal by a 6-0 vote with one member not present.    Robert Israeloff, a strong supporter of the proposal, said that of 1,200 small business clients at Israeloff, Trattner andamp; Co., where he is executive partner, about 500 would like to have the option for &quot;plain paper&quot; statements. &quot;With computers spitting out monthly and quarterly statements, it could save companies up to 20% in costs for accountants to keep their names off the financial statments,&quot; Mr. Israeloff said.    Under the proposal, these &quot;plain paper&quot; quarterly or monthly statements wouldn't have included the CPA firm's name, logo or watermark, and each page would have noted the statements don't adhere to generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Such &quot;plain paper&quot; statements couldn't have been issued for annual financial statements, which under securities laws must be audited and signed by the outside auditor.    Accountants note that financial statements that don't adhere to GAAP, which comprises the body of professional standards, are much less expensive to produce and can be useful for internal purposes for small, closely held companies that can't afford a full-scale audit.    But during the hearings on the &quot;plain paper&quot; statements, many accountants expressed fear that disassociating the accountant's name from the financial statement could lead to many abuses and could worsen the liability problems of the accountants.    In a letter to the institute, Carlon Preate, a partner of Parente, Randolph, Orlando, Carey andamp; Associates, an accounting firm in Scranton, Pa., was strongly opposed to the proposal. Mr. Preate said, &quot;This new service represents a step backward to the days of 'internal use only' financial statements that always found their way into the hands of bankers, creditors and other outside parties who would place reliance on such data.&quot;    It would also &quot;subject CPAs to increased litigation as well as increase the competition from those accountants who don't provide quality service, but who are only interest in 'low balling' their fees to obtain work,&quot; Mr. Preate said.    Mr. Israeloff, who also heads the executive committee of the institute's private-companies practice section, which has been pushing the proposal, strongly disagrees. &quot;If the 'plain paper' statement is prepared with due professional care and is only for the client's use, it serves a need for small business that won't go away,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't be surprised to see this proposal surface again.&quot;    Accountants have long prepared financial statements for their clients that don't require a full audit; such statements are less expensive. But these compilations of financial data or limited reviews of such data have always required the accountant's signature, even though they aren't audits.    At the hearing last week, one accountant said that some accounting firms, worried about their liability exposure in issuing certain sales and earnings forecasts called prospective financial statements, are putting the data into a computer but asking the client to press the &quot;print&quot; button. Some accountants say that in this way, the CPA firm can shed the responsibility for the statement if it proves faulty and hopefully avoid a lawsuit by disgruntled investors, suppliers or vendors. </TEXT></DOC>
