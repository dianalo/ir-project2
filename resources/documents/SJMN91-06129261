Congresswould enact other crime legislation this summer, he said.;    Bush, at amorning news conference, reiterated that he will only back restrictions onguns as part of his larger package of crime-fighting measures. &quot;We are opposedto them alone,&quot; he said.;    Bush favors making it easier for prosecutors touse evidence obtained without warrants, relaxing the habeas corpus rules andexpanding the application of the death penalty to more federal crimes.;   &quot;Some of the suggestions he's made are controversial,&quot; said Foley. &quot;Just goingon and multiplying federal offenses that carry the death penalty does verylittle to deter serious crime in the United States. It's mostly symbolic.&quot;;   Bush and Foley commented as both NRA and gun-control advocates were huntingfor the handful of votes that will decide whether the House will ditch theBrady bill in favor of the NRA plan to allow instant computer checks ofcriminal records of prospective gun purchasers.;    &quot;If I were going to betall my money -- which isn't much -- I wouldn't know what to do. It's thatclose,&quot; Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a leading Brady bill advocate, saidTuesday.;    An influential opponent of the bill, Rep. John D. Dingell,D-Mich., said the measure was losing support as people looked at it moreclosely. &quot;It is my expectation that when the vote is cast, we'll win,&quot; saidDingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.;    Foley andother House leaders decided Tuesday to allow Rep. Harley O. Staggers Jr.,D-W.Va., to offer the NRA plan as a substitute to the Brady bill. If itpasses, lawmakers may not get a direct vote on the waiting period.;    Schumersaid the vote still would present a clear choice to lawmakers.;    &quot;A voteagainst Staggers will be a vote for Brady,&quot; he said.;    The Brady bill isnamed for former White House press secretary James Brady, who was shot in thehead in a 1981 attack on then-President Reagan.;    The waiting period wouldgive authorities time to run checks on prospective gun purchasers, but wouldnot require it.;    Brady, who is permanently disabled, and his wife Sarahhave traveled nationwide touting the legislation and have won endorsementsfrom police organizations and Reagan himself, a longtime NRA supporter. Italso has been endorsed by former presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter.;    NRAsupporters held a news conference Tuesday to tell reporters the Brady billwould do nothing to deter crime, not only because the checks were not requiredbut also because criminals get their handguns illegally.;    But Brady backersmaintained that a national computer check system is years away and that theStaggers amendment was just a way of blocking their bill.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910508  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  578  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 8, 199100129261,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
