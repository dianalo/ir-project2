The victory was the third straight for Gonzalez, a 47-year-oldlabor lawyer who became prime minister in 1982 and has presidedover the fastest growing economy in Europe.   El Pais, the nation's leading daily newspaper, said in aneditorial: ``The voters have clearly decided they want to continueto be governed by the Socialists. But they demand, no less clearly,a change in style.''   It said the results of Sunday's election showed the publicagreed with those who accuse the government of not meeting thedemands of labor, allowing public services to deteriorate andshowing arrogance in its exercise of power.   Defections to the left reduced the Socialists to 176 members inthe 350-seat Cortes, the lower house of Parliament where the powerlies, eight fewer than in 1986. Their share of the popular votefell from 43.4 percent to 39.55.   The chief beneficiary of the 800,000-vote decline in Socialistsupport was the United Left coalition of the Communists and otherparties, which doubled its 1986 tally and gained 10 seats for atotal of 17.   Conservatives of the Popular Party gained one seat to 106. TheDemocratic Social Center of former Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez won14 seats, down five from 1986.   Socialist losses were most striking in cities, where thedeterioration and overloading of public services has become mostevident.   For the first time since Spain returned to democratic governmentafter the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, theSocialists lost to the conservatives in Madrid and the surroundingarea.   Julio Anguita, Communist leader of the United Left, campaignedagainst economic policies that emphasize economic growth overgovernment spending as the way to reduce an unemployment rate of 17percent, highest in Europe.   Anguita, former mayor of Cordoba, said a general strike thatvirtually shut down the country Dec. 14 demonstrated disappointmentwith Gonzalez' pro-business strategy.   Surveys indicate, however, that most Spaniards believe they livebetter today than in 1982, when Gonzalez took office and faced astagnant economy, with annual inflation of 14 percent. Inflation is7 percent, up two points from last year.   ABC, a conservative daily, called the vote ``a tough electorallesson'' for the Socialists, and the new, left-of-center El Mundosaid: ``The Socialists will have to govern in a different way.''   El Periodico de Cataluna, a Barcelona paper, said the Socialistsmust do a better job of ``sharing the pie of well-being with thosewho are less fortunate.''   On Spanish National Radio, Education Minister Javier Solana saidthe government got the message.   ``We would be a politically insensitive party if we didn't learnthe lessons taught by the election results,'' he said. ``Will we goin the direction of more social spending? Within the possibilities,obviously yes.''   Solana said spending on social programs in the past two yearshad grown 60 percent faster than the economy, which has averagednearly 4.5 percent annual growth.   ``Since the economy can now continue to grow, we expect socialspending to follow suit,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
