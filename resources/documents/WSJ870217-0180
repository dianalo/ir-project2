ZweigStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MHCBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Signaling a new, hard-line approach toward cost control, Manufacturers Hanover Corp. notified about 150 middle managers in one of its operations units that they will be dismissed soon.    Sources at the bank said this move is significant in that earlier staff cuts in the U.S. had been achieved largely through attrition, rather than through outright termination of employees performing satisfactorily.    A spokesman for the New York-based banking company, the parent of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., said the dismissals are part of a &quot;larger plan&quot; of financial and organizational restructuring and will yield annual savings of about $6 million.    He said that the managers, including officers as high as the vice president level, are being dismissed as part of a move to decentralize the bank's back-office operations. In addition, 50 clerical jobs were eliminated following the consolidation of two data-processing facilities, but the spokesman said the company expected to be able to find jobs for most of these employees in other units. However, only about one fourth of the managers, who are said to have earned from about $25,000 to $60,000 or more annually, are expected to find positions elsewhere in the company, he said. The employees were notified of their dismissal in late January.    In a bid to bolster its lackluster earnings, Manufacturers Hanover has been restructuring its business operations over the past two years to cut costs and eliminate unprofitable activities. In 1985, it reorganized into five principal business units, giving newly appointed unit heads broad authority to run their operations. But despite its apparent progress in controlling costs, Manufacturers continues to be criticized by analysts for what they say is its &quot;paternalistic&quot; attitude toward employees. For years, Manufacturers was known for rarely laying off or firing workers as long as they performed satisfactorily.    The spokesman declined to specify how many more employees would be fired. &quot;It's being approached on a business unit by business unit basis,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;no across-the-board reductions are planned.&quot;    At year-end 1986, Manufacturers employed 30,316 people, down 1,817 from the year before. In 1986, personnel-related expenses totaled $1.06 billion, up 6.2% from $999.3 million in 1985. Last month, the company reported fourth-quarter net income of $75.4 million, or $1.57 a share, after a one-time charge, down from $108.3 million, or $2.30 a share, a year earlier.    Because of increased costs, intensified competition and other pressures on profitability, a number of U.S. banks have initiated programs to reduce staff levels. </TEXT></DOC>
