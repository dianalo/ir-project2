Several thousand people who had participated in demonstrationsdemanding democracy went to rebel-controlled zones near the borderwith Thailand when Gen. Saw Maung seized power Sept. 18 and crushedthe protests.   His government claims some of those who fled went to the rebelsto receive military training and weapons. The government urged allof them to return and said it would act only against those who hadcommitted criminal offenses.   As of Thursday 919 people, most of them students, have returnedhome, government spokesman Kyaw Sann told a news briefing.   He denied reports that large numbers of people who took part inthe anti-government demonstrations had been imprisoned.   ``There are no political prisoners,'' he said. ``Those detainedare involved in violation of existing laws. Except for those who areinvolved in serious offenses most were released afterinterrogation.''   Kyaw Sann was asked about demands by some political parties thatthe nightime curfew and the ban on public demonstrations be lifted.He said the law and order situation has improved but not enough toremove those restrictions.   Opposition parties also have called for the reinstatement ofgovernment employees fired by the military government.   Kyaw Sann said no action was taken against government workers``for simply taking part in demonstrations. Action was taken onlyagainst those who exceeded the permissible regulations. Most of themwere pensioned off and some dismissed.'' He did not say how manyworkers had been fired.</TEXT></DOC>
