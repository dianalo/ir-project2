Florida Citrus Mutual stated that establishment ofthese tolerances and approval for use of the insecticide avermectin B<T2>1</T2> on citrus to control rust mite would be economically beneficialto Florida citrus growers. Florida Citrus Mutual based this conclusionon their interpretation of data demonstrating that this insecticide canbe applied at very low application rates without loss of effectiveness,is compatible with oil and copper and as such is an excellent choice foruse in the summer when rust mite on citrus is most important, and thatthe insecticide had no detrimental effects on natural enemies and non-targetorganisms.No other comments were received in response to the notices of filing.A tolerance has been established for avermectin B<T2>1</T2> and its delta-8,9-isomer on cottonseed (see the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 31, 1989 (54 FR 23209)), with an expirationdate of March 31, 1993, to cover residues expected to be present for 1year after the period of conditional registration. To be consistent withthe tolerances of avermectin B<T2>1</T2> and its delta-8,9-isomers on cottonseed, EPA is establishingtolerances for this pesticide on citrus, whole fruit; cattle meat and meatbyproducts; and milk in 40 CFR 180.449; for citrus oil in 40 CFR 185.300;and for dired citrus pulp in 40 CFR 186.300, with an expiration date ofMarch 31, 1993.In the May 31, 1989 <T4>Federal Register</T4>, EPA issued a conditional registration for avermectinB<T2>1</T2> with an expiration date of March 31, 1992. The registrationwas made conditional since certain data were lacking. In order to evaluatethe effects of avermectin B<T2>1</T2> on fish, mammals, and aquatic invertebrates and evaluate theeffects in or on soil, several data requirements must be fulfilled duringthe period of conditional registration. Such requirements include a fishlife-cycle study (section 72-5) which must be submitted to the Agency byOctober 1991; a simulated aquatic biological field study (section 72-7)which is due by October 1991; a simulated mammalian field test (section71-5) which is due by October 1991; results of the analyses of the threeremaining soil core replicates (field dissipation study_section 164-1)which must be submitted by July 24, 1989; and an adsorption/desorptionstudy (section 163-1) which must be submitted by June 1990.The data submitted in the petitions and other relevant material have beenevaluated. The toxicology data considered in support of the tolerancesinclude a 12-month oral toxicity study in dogs with a no-observed-effectlevel (NOEL) of 0.25 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg)/day; a 24-month rat chronicfeeding/oncogenicity study with a NOEL of 1.5 mg/kg/day with no oncogeniceffects observed at dose levels up to and including 2.0 mg/kg/day, thehighest does tested (HDT); a 22-month mouse chronic toxicity/oncogenicitystudy with a NOEL of 4 mg/kg/day with no oncogenic effects observed atdose levels up to and including 8 mg/kg/day (HDT); and a two-generationrat reproduction study with a NOEL of 0.12 mg/kg/day. At a dose level of0.40 mg/kg/day (HDT), the toxic effects observed in this study were increasednumber of dead pups at birth, decreased viability and lactation indices,decreased pup body weights, and retinal anomalies in some offspring. AvermectinB<T2>1</T2> was negative for mutagenic effects in the Ames assay, V-79 mammaliancell assay, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovarycells, and in vivo cytogenic assay in male mice. In a rat in vitro hepatocytemutagenicity assay, avermectin B<T2>1</T2> at doses of 0.3 and 0.6 millimoles produced an increase in single-strandDNA breaks. However, when the assay was carried out in vivo at 10.6 mg/kg,no mutagenic effects were observed in hepatocytes of rats. No teratogeniceffects were observed in rats at dose levels up to and including 1.6 mg/kg/day(HDT). No teratogenic effects were observed in a rabbit teratology studywith dose levels up to and including 1.0 mg/kg/day. However, in a seriesof developmental toxicity studies, avermectin B<T2>1</T2> produced maternal toxicity (lethality) and developmental toxicity(cleft palate) in CF<T2>1</T2> mice. The NOEL for maternal toxicity was 0.05 mg/kg/day, andfor developmental toxicity was 0.2        mg/kg/day.The delta-8,9-isomer avermectin B<T2>1</T2> is a plant photodegradate which processes avermectin-like toxicologicalactivity. Since this isomer is not produced in animals, additional toxicologystudies were conducted on this isomer. These studies include a series ofdevelopmental toxicity studies on rats and mice. The delta-8,9-isomer wasnegative for teratogenicity in rats at doses up to and including 1.0 mg/kg/day(HDT). However, in CF<T2>1</T2> mice the delta-8,9-isomer, like avermectin B<T2>1</T2>, produced maternal toxicity (lethality) and developmental toxicity(cleft palate). The NOEL for maternal toxicity was 0.10 mg/kg/day, andthe NOEL for developmental toxicity was 0.06 mg/kg/day. The delta-8,9-isomerdid not produce adverse reproductive effects in a one-generation rat reproductionstudy at doses up to and including 0.4 mg/kg/day (HDT) and was also negativein the Ames mutagenicity assay at doses up to 3,000 andCx.18;g/plate.Because of the developmental effects seen in animal studies, Agency usedthe two-generation rat reproduction study with a safety factor of 300 toassess chronic dietary exposure and establish an acceptable daily intake(ADI). The 300-fold safety factor was employed to account for (1) inter-and intra-species differences, (2) pup death observed in the reproductionstudy, (3) maternal toxicity (lethality) NOEL = 0.05 mg/kg/day, and (4)cleft palate in the mouse teratology study with the isomer, NOEL = 0.06mg/kg. The ADI, based on a NOEL of 0.12 mg/kg/day from a two-generationrat reproduction study and a safety factor of 300, is 0.0004 mg/kg/bodyweight (bwt)/day. Residue estimates used in exposure calculations werebased upon processing studies, field trial data, and animal feeding studies.The estimated exposure for the overall U.S. population resulting from theproposed tolerance on citrus (PP8F3592 and FAP8H5550) plus the publishedtolerance on cottonseed is 0.000115 mg/kg body weight/day, which representsapproximately 29 percent of the ADI. The two most highly exposed populationsubgroups, non-nursing infants and children 1 to 6 years old, had estimatedexposures of 0.000258 mg/kg body weight/day (64 percent of the ADI), and0.000298 mg/kg body weight/day (75 percent of the ADI), respectively.Additionally, a dietary acute exposure analysis for this tolerance andpending tolerances for this chemical was conducted using the NOEL of 0.06mg/kg/day for developmental toxicity in CF<T2>1</T2> mice for the delta-8,9-isomer. The Tolerance Assessment System(TAS) subgroup of interest in this analysis is women aged 13 and above,which is the TAS subgroup most closely approximating women of child-bearingage. The margins of safety for the average woman of child-bearing age wascalculated to be 1,579; none of the target population is expected to havean MOS of less than 125, even assuming tolerance level residues.Nondietary margins of safety for these effects (maternal toxicity and developmentaltoxicity) were also calculated for persons engaged in the application ofavermectin to citrus (mixers/loaders/applicators and harvesters) and werefound to exceed 100 in all instances.The metabolism of the chemical in plants and livestock for these RAC usesis adequately understood. Adequate analytical methods (HDLC_FluorescenceMethods) are available for enforcement. Prior to publication in the <T3>Pesticide Analytical Manual,</T3> Vol. II, the enforcement methodologyis being made available in the interim to anyone who is interested in pesticideenforcement when requested from: By mail:<ITAG tagnum="15">Calvin Furlow, Public Information Branch (H-7506C), Field OperationsDivision, Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency,401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.</ITAG>Office location and telephone number:<ITAG tagnum="15">Rm. 242, CM andplusmin;2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA22202, (703)-557-4432.</ITAG>The tolerances established by amending 40 CFR Parts 180, 185 and 186 willbe adequate to cover residues in or on citrus fruit, cattle meat, meatbyproducts, and milk, and citrus oil and dried citrus pulp.There are currently no actions pending against the registration of thisproduct.Based on the above information and data considered, the Agency concludesthat the tolerances are useful for the purposes for which they are soughtand that they will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerancesare established as set forth below with an expiration date of March 31,1993. After receipt and evaluation of the data required to support theconditional registration of avermectin B<T2>1</T2> and its delta-8,9-isomer, the Agency will consider establishingpermanent tolerances without an expiration date for residues of the chemicaland its metabolite.Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days afterthe date of publication in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> file written objections with the Hearing Clerk(address above). Such objections should be submitted in quintuplicate andspecify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the groundsfor the objections. If a hearing is requested, the objections must statethe issues for the hearing. A hearing will be granted if the objectionsare legally sufficient to justify the relief sought.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164 (5 U.S.C. 601-612)), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from the tolerance requirements do not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.A certification statement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Parts 180, 185 and 186</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Food additives,Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 25, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
