The moratorium prevents construction of any minimalls, except by special permit from the city's zoning administrator, and is meant to give city planners time to come up with stiff design standards that are expected to hinder minimall development.    &quot;These developments are frequently the site of loitering, littering, noise, traffic congestion and unsightly parking areas,&quot; the city said in its measure. Los Angeles-area homeowners' groups, local merchants and law enforcement officials have pressed the city to implement legislation to halt such development.    The moratorium requires Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's signature and is expected to take effect in about five weeks, a Bradley spokesman said.    Many Los Angeles-area minimall developers say they will continue to build after the moratorium is lifted. But, as previously reported, industry observers say the minimall boom is beginning to fade in the face of public opposition and increasing economic pressures from rising vacancy rates and diminished tax breaks. </TEXT></DOC>
