As the Kremlin reimposescensorship, their efforts to stretch the limits of glasnosthave been sharply curtailed. Some of their programs have beentaken off the air altogether.   But for Alexander Nevzorov, this seems to be the best oftimes. For three years, his program, &quot;600 Seconds,&quot; shown onLeningrad TV nightly, has attracted a popular following withits sensational reports on local crime and corruption. Sincethe Kremlin's recent bloody crackdown in the Balticrepublics, Mr. Nevzorov has been on the air more than ever,with some of his broadcasts rerun several times, not just inLeningrad but nationwide.</LP><TEXT>   The reason: Mr. Nevzorov has abruptly transformed himselffrom a hero of glasnost into an apologist for the Red Army.   His turnabout shows just how vulnerable the Soviet pressis to prevailing political winds and to pressure, some of hiscolleagues suggest, from the KGB secret police and CommunistParty hard-liners.   When Mr. Nevzorov turned up in Lithuania last month,wearing his trademark leather jacket and accompanied by hisyouthful, ragtag camera crew, local residents expected him torefute the official media's pro-Moscow stance. Instead, Mr.Nevzorov made a melodramatic film praising the Soviet armyfor its &quot;heroism&quot; in putting a stop to the &quot;rampage&quot; and&quot;ethnic hysteria&quot; allegedly stirred up by Lithuania'spro-independence government.   To the strains of Wagner, he reported that the 14Lithuanians who were crushed by tanks or shot by paratroopsin the Jan. 13 crackdown in Vilnius actually died in &quot;trafficaccidents&quot; or of &quot;heart attacks.&quot;   Later last month, Mr. Nevzorov was back in the Baltics,this time interviewing ethnic Russians in Estonia who claimthe pro-independence government is treating them like&quot;prisoners.&quot; Videotaped images showed shiploads of Russianrefugees fleeing the republic, while a sinister voicewhispered, &quot;They are getting ready.&quot;   Mr. Nevzorov's colleagues say he wasn't even in Vilniusfor the Jan. 13 showdown, but arrived the following day andstaged much of his so-called documentary. The liberal Unionof Cinematographers called his Vilnius broadcast a&quot;falsification&quot; and appealed to TV viewers: &quot;Don't believeit] You are being deceived.&quot; Paul Paupaias, Lithuania'sinformation minister, fumes, &quot;It's a terrible and awful thingto make a Hollywood play out of the tragic events thatoccurred in Vilnius.&quot;   With hindsight, Mr. Nevzorov's colleagues now say that hisnational reputation as a hero of glasnost was alwaysoverdone. A self-proclaimed monarchist, he has increasinglyused &quot;600 Seconds&quot; to criticize Leningrad democrats. Someeven believe he has ties to the KGB, which enabled him andhis camera crew to get to the scene of sensational crimespromptly.   Mr. Nevzorov refused to be interviewed for this article,and a handful of teen-agers outside his office made it clearthat foreign correspondents weren't welcome.   But his associates in Leningrad, and many others, point toa speech he made at a Leningrad factory in December.According to a transcript published in a Leningrad eveningpaper, Mr. Nevzorov said: &quot;I have many friends in the KGB,even if it is unfashionable now to admit that.&quot; He describedthe KGB as &quot;upright and noble people,&quot; and said hisgrandfather Georgy had been an agent. But he added that hehimself wasn't.   Was Mr. Nevzorov's report from Lithuania scripted by hisKGB friends? &quot;Only he knows, and the leaders of the KGB,&quot;shrugs Alexander Zhukhov, a crime reporter in Leningrad, whoused to be friendly with Mr. Nevzorov. &quot;But I can saydefinitely that in order to do such a report, one must feelsupport from those who have an interest in the report.&quot;   Leningrad's Communist Party chief, Boris Gidaspov, wasapparently interested enough to give Mr. Nevzorov freepublicity. Days before the Vilnius broadcast, Mr. Gidaspovsaid in a TV address that &quot;our Sasha Nevzorov&quot; would soonreport the &quot;objective&quot; truth from Lithuania.   Indeed, &quot;600 Seconds&quot; frequently attacked thedemocratically elected Leningrad City Council that is at oddswith Mr. Gidaspov. It regularly features film footage ofmurdered children, starving army veterans and racketeersstashing stolen weapons, along with manufactured images ofthings such as burning crosses and blood-red graffiti reading&quot;uneasy times.&quot; All this, some critics now say, was anattempt to show that the Leningrad council was incapable ofmaintaining order.   In his defense, Mr. Nevzorov's staff offer a stack oftelegrams, allegedly from Russians thanking Mr. Nevzorov forhis support of their compatriots in the Baltics. Some of thissupport may be genuine: Several old women lined up at theLeningrad TV reception hall last week, waiting, they said, tocall &quot;600 Seconds and tell their problems to &quot;dear Sasha.&quot;   But for journalists who are struggling to maintain eventhe limited independence they achieved under glasnost, Mr.Nevzorov has become an object of bitter irony. His popularitystems from his willingness to criticize, a right that theywere denied in the 1970s, when Mr. Nevzorov was working as astuntman in the movies. Now they say he is, wittingly orunwittingly, being used by those who want to control thepress again.   &quot;Glasnost,&quot; says Kirill Nabutov, a Leningrad journalistwho knows Mr. Nevzorov, &quot;is like ration coupons. There arecoupons, but there is no meat in the stores. Glasnost is aration coupon for free speech, but there is no free speech.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
