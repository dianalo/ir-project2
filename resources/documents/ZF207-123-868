(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Reality of ISDNandM;The idea of ISDN is pretty well established, but the reality is somethingelse again.andP;  Today, ISDN consists of a collection of three-quarters-completestandards, a smattering of trials and initial commercial applications, and alimited selection of prototype products, mostly for telephone companies, notPC users.andM;Basically, ISDN is the brainchild of the Consultative Committee forInternational Telegraphy and Telephony, or CCITT.andP;  Every four years, thisinternational standards body publishes a handbook that functions as thestandards bible, laying out the intricate protocols and rules the telephonenetwork should adhere to in order for it to function internationally.andM;The CCITT describes ISDN as &quot;a limited set of standard interfaces to adigital communications network.andP;  The result: a network providing end userswith voice, data, and certain image services on end-to-end digital circuits,using an international standard for interfaces that is accepted bycommunications carriers, users, and systems manufacturers.&quot;andM;That's quite a mouthful, even for technophiles.andM;Two InterfacesandM;What it boils down to is two main configurations for sending and receivingdigital information, whether it's voice, data, or image.andM;The Basic Rate Inteface, designed for small businesses and home users, bringsdata transmission capability right to the desktop via twisted-pair copperwires--ordinary phone lines.andP;  It consists of two &quot;B,&quot; or bearer, channels,Each of which operates at 64 kilobits per second--much faster thanconventional modems.andP;  Users can employ both channels simultaneously to sendany kind of information.andP;  The Basic Rate Interface also supplies a 16Kbpsdelta, or &quot;D,&quot; channel for &quot;traffic cop&quot; control of the communications.andP;  TheD channel was added so control functions would not interface with informationtransmissions on the B channels.andP;  The configuration of the Basic RateInterface has led people to call it 2B+D.andM;The Basic Rate Interface runs through two physical connection interfaces: the&quot;U&quot; interface uses a single twisted pair of copper wires, just as an ordinarytelephone line does, while the &quot;T&quot; interface uses two twisted pairs.andM;For users who need to transmit more data, ISDN also includes a Primary RateInterface, intended for large corporations that now send information viaprivate networks.andP;  The Primary Rate Interface consists of 23 64Kbps Bchannels and one 64Kbps D channel.andP;  It is commonly referred to as 23B+D.andM;The TrialsandM;Telephone switch vendors, telephone carriers, and small band of intrepidcompanies are slowly trying out these new ideas in ISDN trials and theinitial commercial applications around th country and all over the world.andM;ATandamp;T is working with regional Bell operating companies on more than ten ISDNprojects in the United States.andP;  Customers include the McDonald's Corporation,in Oak Brook, Illinois; the 3M Corporation, in Minneapolis; Shearson LehmanHutton, in New York; and Tenneco Gas Pipeline, in Houston.andP;  Competing switchvendor Northern Telecom claims to have more than 60 trials underway,involving nearly 5,000 ISDN connections.andP;  Other central office switchcompanies, such as Siemens AG, L. M. Ericsson, and NEC, have also sponsoredISDN trials.andM;At ATandamp;T's Tenneco application, handled in conjunction with Southwestern Bell,nearly 2,200 ISDN lines connect about 600 PCs to ISDN for access to databasessuch as the Dow Jones News/Retrieval service and Telenet.andP;  The PCs areequipped with telephones that work as ISDN terminal adapters and do thenecessary ISDN encoding and multiplexing.andP;  An ISDN link to a 9,600-bps modempool speeds access to outside databases.andM;Tenneco also transfers files between PCs on the ISDN B channel at 19.2Kbps.andO;According to manager of telecommunications Russell Roy, a five-page letterthat took about a minute and a half to transmit using Southwestern Bell'sCentrex service takes just 4.5 seconds using the ISDN B channel.andM;The speed increase comes from faster connections as well as fastertransmission.andP;  &quot;By just dialing a four-digit number, the PC equipped with anISDN terminal adapter telephone automatically knows, through its RS-232interface, that it's accessing another data terminal,&quot; Roy says.andM;The U.S.andP;  National Bank of Oregon uses 200 Basic Rate Interface ISDN linesprovided by a Northern Telecom DMS 100 switch at the local Pacific NorthwestBell central office.andP;  Earl Vogt, the bank's telecommunications manager, saysthe pilot project has been using ISDN for voice and data applications sinceMarch 1987.andP;  Vogt's operation uses ISDN to transfer files locally between PCAT clones and to transmit production information to Pacific Northwest Bell.andM;&quot;We have seen considerable improvement over our dial-up lines with the ISDN.andO;The 64Kbps B channels move our information much faster.andP;  And what was reallynice,&quot; Vogt says, &quot;was that it worked!&quot;andM;Illinois Bell, which provides ISDN service to McDonald's, says the hamburgermaker's new campus building is the first to be completely ISDN-wired, withapproximately 900 lines.andM;Jim Bielanski, manager of technical evaluation for Illinois Bell, says thatMcDonald's originally used ISDN PCs to upload and download files.andP;  &quot;What theyfound was the ISDN file transfer was a vast improvement over modem use,&quot;Bielanski says.andP;  McDonald's also uses ISDN to send still video pictures at9.6Kbps in 12 to 15 seconds, &quot;an impossibility for standard 1,200- or2,400-bp modem transmission,&quot; according to Bielanski.andM;Despite all this activity, the United States still trails ISDN developmentsin Japan and Europe.andP;  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) already plans tooffer commercial ISDN service and sell ISDN telephones and facsimilemachines.andP;  In Europe, Siemens AG is involved in a number of West Germantrials, while IBM is working on ISDN trials in Germany and Norway.andP;  Andthat's only the beginning.andM;The EquipmentandM;One reason many trials are beginning now is that it took a while for ISDNend-user equipment to become available.andP;  Initial ISDN development centered onproducts for telephone carriers, not end users.andM;In the next couple of years, however, vendors are expected to introduce ISDNterminal adapters, bridges, and gateways; equipment to help large privatenetworks migrate to ISDN; and other customer-premise equipment for end users.andM;David Gilbert of Apple says that the real market for ISDN PC products isstill two years away.andP;  &quot;We don't have any commercial products yet,&quot; he notes,&quot;but who does?andP;  When the service providers are ready, there will be anavalanche of products.&quot;andM;The first few products are already appearing.andP;  IBM launched its $1,550 7820ISDN Terminal Adapter last fall.andP;  The 7820 works with the PC, the PS/2, and anumber of IBM terminals to support the ISDN Basic Rule Interface via IBM'sSystems Network Architecture (SNA) approach.andM;ATandamp;T has introduced a line of ISDN phones and terminals and is using itsSeries 7500 ISDN terminals along with ATandamp;T PC 6386 computers for PC-to-PCfile transfer and packet switching at the Network Systems ISDN trial inAtlanta.andM;ATandamp;T is also reportedly working on a new direct PC-to-ISDN interface.andP;  Thecompany would produce its own boards and attempt to make the interface anindustry standard.andM;Competitor Northern Telecom has introduced a PC terminal adapter card calledthe PCTA.andP;  The company plans to add a Macintosh version later this year.andO;Working with the four-wire ISDN T interface and IBM's NetBIOS, the PCTAsupplies 3270 emulation and lets users access a host computer via a PC NetLAN through an ISDN packet-switched network.andP;  Northern Telecom is seling the$800 terminal adapter cards to telephone companies for distribution to endusers.andM;Modem maker Hayes Microcomputer has announced the Hayes ISDN PC Card, aboard-level terminal adapter for PCs that permits full access to ISDN's BasicRate Interface.andP;  The company says that the card will also adapt a standardtelephone to ISDN for digitized voice transmission.andM;In the long run, ISDN will mean more than cards to add on to existing PCs.andO;Several years ago, for example, Fujitsu demonstrated working models of anISDN PC designed to let more than one person work on a document at the sametime--what Apple's Gilbert calls collaborative computing.andP;  The demonstrationunit featured a light pen, and when one person wrote on the screen, themarkings showed up instantaneously on the screen of another machine linkedvia ISDN.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
