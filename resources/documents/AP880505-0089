Nine Americans, three Britons and six others were still believedto be captive in Lebanon.   After a morning of scattered sharp reaction, Interior MinisterCharles Pasqua today retorted to reporters:   ``We have not accorded any funds of any sort to anyone, not afranc, not a dollar, not a deutschmark, not a yen.''   Most French politicians publicly hailed the release, calling itabove politics even though it came four days before Chirac facesincumbent Francois Mitterrand in presidential elections.   But Jean-Marie Le Pen, of the extreme right National Front, whopolled 14.4 percent in first-round voting, said he was struck thateveryone cried victory over a ``defeat'' for France.   ``There is the other side of this, a death and the price that Iwould like to know,'' he said. ``There is only one way to deal withterrorists, that used in Ouvea.''   As the hostages were returned from Beirut today, troops stormedinsurgents on the French New Caledonian island of Ouvea to free 22gendarmes held hostage. Two members of a French assault team and 15Melanesian kidnappers were killed, according to Bernard Pons,French minister for overseas territories.   A fourth French hostage in Lebanon, Michel Seurat, is believedto have died of cancer in captivity.   Harsh reaction came from Britain. Prime Minister MargaretThatcher refuses to treat with terrorists. Peter Temple-Morris,member of parliament and a Lebanon specialist in Thatcher'sConservative Party, said:   ``No responsible nation and no responsible government, and I saythat directly to the French government and the French people,should deal with terrorism.''   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., he went on:   ``I very much disapprove (of the French action). I think it'scorrupt both in electoral terms and...general terms. I think it'sthoroughly bad.''   He blamed the deal on France's system which, on Sunday, pits apresident and his prime minister against one another for thepresidency.   By Chirac's approach, he said, ``Governments throughout theworld had better give way to terrorism and let the terroristscompletely take over.''   John Waite, cousin of Terry Waite, the Church of England envoydetained since Jan. 20, 1987, echoed Temple-Morris' criticism.   ``Unfortunately when deals are done by countries like Francethen (others') position is made worse because they are isolatedbecause we are the only country it seems who is not doing deals.''   David Owen, leader of the Social Democratic Party, called theFrench deal ``brazen and cynical.''   Chirac confronted the charges after greeting the hostagesoutside Paris. On nationwide television, he declared:   ``We have never ceased to act with dignity and honor, conformingstrictly to values shared with other countries, adhering strictlythe grand principles of our foreign policy, to those of ourfriends.''   Pierre Beregovoy, a Socialist and Mitterrand's campaigndirector, praised ``conditions that do honor to our country.''   But among ordinary Frenchmen, many private remarks reflectedthat of a senior Western diplomat: ``I wonder how much he paid?''   In a brief but pointed statement, the U.S. State Department saidit was awaiting details but added: ``We would be concerned by anysign that concessions were made. We believe concessions encouragefuture kidnappings and could prolong captivity of other hostages.''   Another British Conservative legislator, Hugo Summerson, urgedsummoning the French ambassador for an explanation. ``The French... have always looked after their own interests in a ratherselfish way,'' he said.   Chirac himself refused to discuss negotiations leading to therelease of the three, the last French hostages in Lebanon. SinceJune 1986, pro-Iranian groups have freed 10 Frenchmen.   Weeks ago, sources close to Chirac reported that France agreedto repay to Iran the remaining two-thirds of a disputed $1 billionloan contracted with the deposed shah, and that Iran was preparedto broker a release.   The most persistent speculation, never confirmed, was thatFrance also agreed to alter the balance of arms supplied to Iraqand Iran and to add a cash payment.   Chirac's aides, confronting criticism head-on, remarkedprivately that the United States might draw a lesson from France.   The French premier personally oversaw negotiations, working withPasqua, and repeatedly pressed senior Iranian officials who wereinstrumental in obtaining the release.   The remaining hostages include nine Americans believed to beprisoners of Islamic zealots in Lebanon. The longest held is TerryAnderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Circuitous secret manuevers, including arms sales to Iran, cameto light dramatically in November 1986 and weakened the Reaganadministration's position.   French political analysts are divided on the effect of thetiming, days before an election which polls suggest Chirac wouldlose.   As soon as he announced the hostage release at a campaign rallyin Strasbourg, his followers began chanting, ``We're going to win!We're going to win!''   But some analysts predicted a hostile backlash from people whosuspected Chirac himself had influenced the timing to give himselfa badly needed boost in the final stretch.   Islamic fundamentalists may have decided to give theconservative candidate an edge because Mitterrand is regarded as aclose friend of Israel. But it was Chirac who first negotiated armssales to Iraq, in his previous term as premier in the 1970s.</TEXT></DOC>
