The 95-memberinstallation team went through 20 large pizzas, 240 cups of coffee, and 1,000cans of soda.andP;  The mostly volunteer team were high-level executives whose&quot;day jobs&quot; are in the networking community, but who got their feet wetanalyzing protocols.andP;  (For more on assembling the Interop ShowNet, see&quot;Mission Impossible&quot; in October's LAN Magazine.)andM;And unlike other exhibitions, Interop sponsored six demonstration networksplus the show network, a place for vendors to prove that their productsreally did interoperate with other vendor's products.andP;  This year, thedemonstration networks included 10BaseT, or Ethernet over telephone wire;Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), or 100Mbps fiber network; OpenSystems Interconnect (OSI), Open Network Computing/Network Filing System(ONC/nfs) for distributed computing products in a multivendor system;Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), a new wide area protocol for routers; SwitchedMulti-Megabit Data Services (SMDS), how we are going to move data over thewide area in the future; and Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), amethod integrated voice and data services.andM;Also unlike many exhibitions, Interop offers topnotch speakers.andP;  Attendeesdon't come to listen to marketing executives rattle off their product'sfeatures.andP;  They come to hear Jeffrey Case, the person who wrote the SimpleNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP), which is today's &quot;hot&quot; management method.andO;They come to hear Vint Cerf, the father of Internet.andP;  They come to hear thetechnology inventors and leaders.andM;And while Networld, just weeks before Interop, was packed with attendees, thepervasive sentiment was &quot;just another trade show.&quot;andP;  At Networld, fewground-breaking products were debuted.andP;  At Intercop, however, booths werejammed full of eager attendees who came to see the latest and greatestnetwork management product of FDDI router.andP;  Excitement filled the air.andM;10BaseT in the PitandM;Most people wandering past the 10BaseT demo network were drawn to theflashing police light.andP;  (Fortunately, there was no accompanying siren.)andP;  Theflag hangning above the booth welcomed visitors to &quot;Networking Hell.&quot;andM;&quot;It's amazing how many people will stop and look at flashing lights,&quot;remarked one innocent bystander at an adjacent booth.andP;  Indeed, once drawn inby the flashing police light, people were mesmerized by the LEDs that flashedwhen packets traveled over the 10BaseT network.andM;The 10BaseT network tested the mettle of products from 14 vendors.andP;  Inaddition to showing attendees how 10BaseT made it simplified to add, move,and change the locations of servers, workstations, and other LAN devices,running motors, ringing telephone switches, and buzzing florescent lightsdemonstrated that twisted-pair Ethernet was immune to electromagneticinterference.andP;  Despite the interference, five DOS workstations, one OS/2 LANManager file server, two routers, and five hubs from different vendors playedtogether easily.andM;10BaseT is (finally) the IEEE standard for running 10Mbps Ethernet overunshielded twisted-pair or ordinary telephone wire.andM;Rallying Around FDDIandM;While 10BaseT vendors often squabbled about whose implementation afforded thegreatest distances, was the most robust, the easiest to manage, the mostflexible, or the most inexpensive, vendors of FDDI products show remarkablecooperation.andP;  FDDI is a new ANSI standard for 100Mbps fiber-optic networks.andO;Thirty-seven FDDI vendors banded together to demonstrate that theircompetitive products would happily coexist.andM;Each FDDI vendor was connected to a dual-backbone ring.andP;  FDDI's dual-ringconfiguration offers fault tolerance.andP;  If one fiber is severed, traffic isshunted to the secondary ring.andP;  If both fibers are cut, the network loopsback around into two distinct networks.andP;  Although some devices will beprevented from communicating, many will be able to communicate.andM;More than 100 devices were connected as either dual- or single-attachmentstations.andP;  A dual-attachment station connects to both fibers of the ring; asingle attachment connects to one fiber.andP;  The booth included networkmanagement equipment, concentrators, and many reels of bright orangefiber-optic cable.andP;  Other equipment included bridges, routers, networkmonitors, gateways, network measurement tools, and user devices.andP;  Ethernetsub-networks were attached.andM;A lot can go wrong when there are 100 products from 37 vendors on a network.andO;The FDDI network had its share of downtime, but getting the FDDI network upand running was indeed a feat, especially considering that it is very newtechnology.andM;The demonstration network wasn't the only hotbed of FDDI activity.andP;  Mostpeople think of FDDI as a backbone technology, and most corporations installit as a backbone.andP;  Network Peripherals (San Jose, Calif.) has a differentconception; it thinks FDDI should be affordable and practical for theworkgroup, too.andM;Enter the era of workgroup FDDI.andP;  Network Peripherals debuted two FDDIinterface boards for the PC.andP;  One card works with AT bus machines; the otherworks with EISA bus machines.andP;  Unlike many FDDI cards, Network Peripherals'cards are single boards, based on a highly integrated, second-generationdesign.andP;  Network operating system drivers are available for Novell NetWare386 and 2.1x, Microsoft LAN Manager 2.0 and Sun PC-NFS.andP;  The boards can beused with single- or dual-attachment FDDI stations.andM;Both cards implement the station management (SMT) functions.andP;  SMT functionsare embedded in an onboard processor to boost performance.andP;  The AT card costs$3,495.andP;  The EISA card costs $3,995.andM;FDDI is an expensive technology.andP;  Network Peripherals makes it moreaffordable to the PC user, but many work station users simply cannot make theinvestment.andP;  What do you do when the speed of the Ethernet is limiting theoverall throughput of your application, but your company's investment inEthernet is so great it can't immediately migrate to FDDI?andM;Talk to Synernetics, the North Billerica, Mass., company that annouced theLANplexor multiplexors for FDDI AND Ethernet.andP;  Synernetics contends that theLANplexor product group signficantly increases the performance of workjstations and servers by improving data throughout and network availabity.andM;LANplexor operates with Ethernet concentrators, bridging, and the company'sExpress products.andP;  Expressing is a method of operating multiple lower speedLAN segments in parallel and multiplexing them onto an FDDI.andP;  EthernetExpress connects Ethernet stations to individual Ethernet  segments.andP;  Eachmodule combines Ethernet and FDDI by cross-connecting eight Ethernets and anFDDI.andM;LANplex 5000 is a modular multiplexor.andP;  It has three parallel FDDI paths,three Ethernet paths, three Token Ring paths, and a high-speed VM-Ebus.andP;  Itsupports up to 88 Ethernet Express ports or 42 FDDI concentrator ports.andP;  TheEthernet Express module, the FDDI Concentrator Module, or the FDDI EnterpriseAccess Module can plug into the hub.andM;The Ethernet Express module has eight ports for Ethernet segments.andP;  It canfilter up to 590,000 packets per second(pps), which is the maximum for eightEthernets and one FDDI.andP;  It can forward up to 60,000 pps.andM;The FFDI  module has four ports for single- or dual-attach stations.andP;  TheFDDI Enterprise Access Module connects LANplex 5000S to an FDDI network andpermits those FDDI attachments to be managed.andM;If the LANplex 5000 is too much, try the 2000 series.andP;  The LANplex 2110 hasonly eight Ethernet Express ports and two FDDI ports, yet it can be managedby Synernetics' FDDI and SNMP management system like the higher end 5000product.andM;LANplex will be available during the second quarter of 1991.andP;  Prices for theLANplex 5000 depend upon the particular configuration, but start at $24,900.andO;The LANplex 2110 costs $19,900.andP;  Viewplex, the management application, costs$19,900.andM;Making Far Away CloserandM;Switched Multi-Megabit Data Service (SMDS) or Integrated Services DigitalNetwork (ISDN) may be in your network's future.andP;  With users demandinginternetworking for all offices, fast, inexpensive wide area services areincreasingly critical.andM;Both the Basic and Primary Rate ISDN services were shown.andP;  The Basic Ratedefines two 64Kbps &quot;B&quot; channels and one 16Kbps &quot;D&quot; channel.andP;  The Primary Ratedefines 23 &quot;B&quot; channels plus one 64Kbps &quot;D&quot; channel.andP;  The demo used both liveand simulated ISDN.andP;  Banyan workstations communicated with each other overISDN.andP;  Two Unix workstations were local as well.andP;  PCs at the University ofMichigan were also able to communicate with the Interop ISDN network.andM;If ISDN means &quot;I still Don't kNoW&quot; to you, maybe SMDS is the speedy wide areanetwork medium for you.andP;  SMDS is a &quot;fast packet&quot; service that can be used toconnect distant computer and communication systems.andP;  A fast packet systemsswitches information at very high speeds using short, fixed lenght, addressedpackets.andP;  The fast packet's advanate is it can allocate bandwidthintantaneously, rather than pre-allocating channels, as is done with thetraditional packet switching method-X.25.andP;  This means in fast packet, thebandwidth is used more efficiently.andM;Eventually, SMDS will allow data, images, and graphics to be transmitted overthe public switched at speed up to 45Mbps, although initial trials are at1.5Mbps.andP;  Plus, it promises to be economical.andP;  The tecnology is coming out ofBelicore, the research arm of the Regional Bell Operating Companies, so itpromises to be consistent from one region to another.andM;Two ATandamp;T divisions, Network Systems and Business Special Services Accunet,provided the underlying SMDS services.andP;  Applications, including access toradiology images, multimedia production, document storagfe and retrieval, andnetwork management, interconnected California, New York, New Jersey,Missouri, and Georgia.andM;Stratacom (Campbeel, Calif.,) announced frame relay services for its IPXFastPacket networking services.andP;  The service conforms to CCITT and ANSIstandards and the common frame relay interface announced by Stratcom,Northern Telecom, DEC, and also disco Systems.andP;  Frame relay  can be used tointerconnect high-speed, bursty data traffic.andP;  It improves networkperformance through reduced delays, more efficient bandwidth utilization, andlower equipment costs.andM;The IPX frame relay service is provided by a new Stratcom PacketAssembler/Disassembler (PAD).andP;  This PAD translates from bridges or routersinto cells or fast packets for trasmission over a private T-1 network.andP;  Atthe receiving end, the cells are translated into frames and relayed to thedestination.andM;The Frame Relay PAD costs $12,500.andP;  For existing Stratacom customers, theupgrade costs $1,500.andM;PPP: Another Acronym You Need To LearnandM;Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is the newest acronym you need to know.andO;Following the rule of new terms, PPP is both longer and more difficult topronounce.andP;  PPP is the latest Internet Request For Comment (RFC) for serialline networking.andP;  It's important because it is going to allow routers fromdifferent vendors to work together over serial lines.andP;  Vendors are alreadybeginning to implemented PPP.andM;Without PPP, you need the same manufacturer's router on both sides of aserial line, since no standard method exists to packetize router data over aserial line.andP;  With PPP, you can mix and match different vendors' routers onboth sides of a serial line.andP;  PPP is not needed for local connections, suchas Ethernal or Token Ring, or even X.25 connections.andM;PPP was highlighted in two demos: synchronous router interoperability andasynchronous PPP.andP;  The synchronous demo showed how you can build backbonesthat include high-speed lines and multivendor bridges and routers.andP;  PPP is amethod of multiplexing protocols, thereby allowing multiple protocols toexist simultaneously on the same link.andP;  For routers, PPP includes a field toidentify the packet type so it can be handed to the correct data packetdatagram when it arrives on the other side of the serial line.andP;  SynchronousPPP is for use with line speeds up to 2.048Mbps.andM;Asynchronous PPP makes connectivity possible at very low speeds.andP;  Previously,when using 9.6Kbps to 19.2Kbps lines, connections had limited capabilities.andO;With PPP, devices can run over dial-up modems, since PPP transfers additionalinformation regarding who called, character mappings, and linkauthentication.andP;  It also negotiates the parameters, such as compressionfeatures, of the two devices.andM;PPP is not yet a standard, but many vendors are moving to support it.andO;Participants of the synchronous demo included 3Com, cisco Systems, NetworkSystems, and Telebit.andP;  Interactive, Telebit, and Xylogics performed theasynchronous demo.andM;GOSIP: The Talk of the TownandM;Interop without OSI would be like peanut butter without jelly.andP;  Still, theTCP/IP vs.andP;  OSI debate certainly has quieted over the years.andP;  The OSI networkdrew the smallest crowd of the six Interop showcase networks.andP;  Nevertheless,with the first generation of the Government OSI Profile (GOSIP 1) now ineffect, standards committees, researchers, and vendors are making progress onOSI.andM;All products in the demo were real, working products.andP;  In the past, most OSIdemonstrations were built with prototype products.andP;  The OSJ showcase was thefirst demonstration of shipping GOSIP-compliant products.andP;  OSI just may be&quot;open for business,&quot; as the demo's slogan claimed.andM;The OSI demonstration was truly a global, multiprotocol network.andP;  TheEthernet backbone running OSI protocols was connected to an FDDI backbonerunning TCP/IP, which in turn was joined to a 10BaseT segment.andP;  The networkon the show floor was connected to remote networks in the United Kingdom,Australia, Scotland, Germany, France, and Ireland, via X.25 packet-switchedgateways.andP;  The network included six hosts, running either TP4 and theConnection-Oriented transport or TP0 and the Connectionless transport; 11routers; and six modems.andP;  Twenty-two vendors participated.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
