Youlook ahead and see before you an endless succession offive-day weeks, nine-to-five days, the tedium broken only bya few weeks' vacation each year.   But look again. Corporate America has begun to rewrite therules. With your company's blessing, you might work part timewhile getting your M.B.A., then work full time but withflexible hours after the birth of your first child. Burnedout at 50? Take a paid sabbatical to climb a mountain. And,as you near retirement, share a job with the replacement youwill train.</LP><TEXT>   All these options -- and a lot more -- are available on alimited basis today, but they are expected to become morepervasive in the near future. Faced with a tight labormarket, employers need to recruit and retain talentedworkers. And employees, especially the growing numbers ofwomen in the work force, are demanding more flexibility. &quot;Thebenefit of the '90s is time off,&quot; says Michael Connors,senior vice president for human resources of American ExpressCo.'s Travel Related Services unit. &quot;The power of two incomesis making nonfinancial rewards such as flexible schedulingand leaves even more valuable a motivator than highersalaries.&quot;   Snapshots of how these options are being handled at somepioneering companies provide a glimpse of how how many of usmay well be working in the future.                                                                                                          Part-Time Work                                                                                                          Part-time work is by far the most common flexiblescheduling arrangement. Long used to reduce labor costs andto staff for peak periods, it is increasingly seen as a wayto keep valued professionals in the loop until they canreturn full time. The Bureau of Labor Statistics counts 3.2million professional-level part-timers, of whom fewer than amillion are managers.   Janet McLaughlin, Corning Inc.'s manager of strategiccorporate education, is one of those rarities. Hired eightyears ago as a part-timer, she asked to keep that statusafter she was named a supervisor. &quot;I told them that if itdidn't work, I'd gladly step down,&quot; she says. No onecomplained, and today, after four promotions, she isresponsible for Corning's management training, supervising astaff of five.   Ms. McLaughlin works four days a week, taking Wednesdaysoff to be with her two young children. She finds thisschedule meshes well with managerial duties. &quot;People needstart-up at the beginning of the week and closure at theend,&quot; she says, &quot;but in the middle of the week they're busyand it seems very manageable.&quot; If need be, she switches herday off and figures that by limiting her travel, she sees herstaff about as much as managers who take more frequentbusiness trips. But there's little free time in her schedule.What she misses most, she says, is informal time -- such asrehashing meetings with colleagues. &quot;The only way that kindof informality happens,&quot; she says, &quot;is if I structure it.&quot;   The success of trailblazers like Ms. McLaughlin ledCorning to formally offer a medley of flexible schedulingoptions to its work force two years ago. Some 40 salariedemployees now work part time; over 1,000 work full time buthave flexible hours.   &quot;We see the biggest value in our retention figures,&quot; saysThomas Blumer, Corning's director of quality management and,until recently, director of human resources. Prior to 1988,Corning's annual attrition costs for women and minoritieswere running nearly $4 million ahead of those for men. Sincethe introduction of flexible scheduling as part of a broad&quot;work and family&quot; initiative, those attrition costs have beenhalved, saving $2 million a year. &quot;I don't know whether beingmore flexible was the whole answer,&quot; Mr. Blumer says, &quot;butit's part of it.&quot;                                                                                                          Job Sharing                                                                                                          Job sharing, whereby a pair of part-time employees shareone job, one salary and usually one set of benefits, is stillavailable mostly at the clerical level, and even there to arelative few. But Northeast Utilities Service Co. andSteelcase Inc. have had happy results with both professionaland hourly workers, and men as well as women.   Neither company permits supervisors to share jobs. &quot;We'renot quite ready to ask people to report to two bosses,&quot; saysMike Brown, director of employee relations at NortheastUtilities, which employs 54 job-sharing pairs. But there arefew other hard-and-fast caveats; the arrangements arenegotiated case by case.   Mr. Brown has analyzed the cost-effectiveness of jobsharing. In only one area -- doubledunemployment-compensation taxes -- did a job-share team costmore than a full-timer. And he says the job sharers' betterattendance and productivity more than offset that addedexpense. While a full-time employee seldom works full tiltall day, he explains, two job sharers each give four hours of&quot;full-bore production.&quot;   Both companies stress that job-sharing success depends onthe chemistry between the two partners. Ideally, they lookfor two people who complement each other's skills.   Patricia Konwinski and Martha O'Brien, senior recruitersfor Steelcase's marketing division, are one of 46 job-shareteams at the company's Grand Rapids, Mich., headquarters.They each work on every job opening, Ms. O'Brien for thefirst half of the week, Ms. Konwinski the latter half. Theyconfer over lunch on Wednesdays. The pair, both mothers, saythey generally agree in their assessments of job candidatesand find that one may notice something that the other hasoverlooked.   &quot;Our job is one of the least likely you'd say could beshared,&quot; says Ms. Konwinski, noting that it doesn't breakdown into discrete tasks that are finished at the end of aday. &quot;But we've made it work because of good communication. Ifeel like I can pick up where she left off and not miss abeat.&quot;   One of their recruits vouches for their system: &quot;Formonths I had dealt with Marty, but when the job offer wasextended it was Patty's day to work. She knew everything --it was seamless.&quot;   Their boss, Dick Becker, manager of employment for salesand marketing, concurs. He admits having had initialreservations about continuity and managing the workload. Butin their case, he says, &quot;one and one equals three and ahalf.&quot; Besides, he says, &quot;we kept two very valuable people inthe work force when we could have lost both of them.&quot;   Ms. Konwinski, now pregnant with her third child, doesn'trule out returning to full-time work someday and feels thatjob-sharing won't hamper her long-term advancementopportunities. Indeed, she and her partner have been promotedas a team.   Do they ever resent submerging their individual identitiesand achievements to the team? Ms. Konwinski says no. &quot;We areboth so strongly oriented to keeping this situation intact,&quot;she says, &quot;that competition hasn't come into play.&quot;                                                                                                          Flextime/Compressed Workweek                                                                                                          Many companies now allow full-time employees to adjusttheir starting and quitting times, usually around a set ofcore hours when everyone is expected to be on the job.Because it doesn't involve a reduction in hours, flextime ispopular with men as well as women. Nor does it usuallyrequire the complicated redesign of jobs or benefit plans,and thus it can be a low-cost morale builder.   Like other flexible arrangements, however, it can bethreatening to managers, who worry about maintaining adequatestaffing, scheduling meetings, and lack of supervision.&quot;There is a level of discomfort,&quot; says Kathleen Christensen,an associate professor at City University of New York,referring to flexible plans in general. Ms. Christensen,author of a 1988 study by the Conference Board on flexiblescheduling, adds that &quot;traditional management techniquesdon't seem entirely operable when people are not alwayspresent or are on different schedules.&quot;   Significantly, however, very few of the programs have beenrescinded. One reason: giving employees more control of theirtime appears to yield payoffs in productivity and retention.&quot;Companies have begun to realize these options are allstrategic tools, not just new goodies for the employees,&quot;says Barney Olmstead, co-director of New Ways to Work, a SanFrancisco research group.   Hewlett-Packard Co. was the first U.S. company to offerflextime, initiating it in 1973. Unlike many &quot;inflexible&quot;flextime plans, Hewlett-Packard's allows employees toreadjust their hours on short notice. At Aetna Life andamp;Casualty Co., some jobs can be done during any hoursacceptable to both employee and supervisor. &quot;Conceivably, aperson could work from 10 p.m. to 6:10 a.m. Wednesday throughSunday,&quot; suggests an Aetna supervisors' manual issued toencourage flexibility.   The compressed workweek is a different sort of full-timeflexibility. This option -- in which participants typicallywork four 10-hour days with three days off -- often springsfrom the need to continuously staff a particular operation,such as computer services. When, for example, an Aetnaproject was nearing deadline and running out of office space,managers asked for volunteers to work a compressed week. Twoteams, one working a three-day week and another working fourdays, coped with the cramped space while keeping the projectgoing seven days a week. (The volunteers' only complaint:spending too much money on their long weekends.)                                                                                                          Extended Leaves                                                                                                          Employee child-care and elder-care responsibilities areprompting many corporations to loosen unpaid-leave policies.When Aetna followed up on employees who had taken maternitydisability three years ago, it found that 23% had left thecompany after their babies were born. &quot;And those who leftwere the higher performers,&quot; says Sherry Herchenroether,manager of family services. A year later, after Aetnaintroduced a six-month unpaid family leave, such attritionwas cut in half.   Elder care is cited by many employers as a growing problemfor both male and female employees. At Northeast Utilities,nearly 30% of employees surveyed in 1987 had responsibilityfor caring for an elderly relative. And the utility's workforce is 80% male.   When torn between their jobs and a crisis involving anelderly parent or a sick child, American workers areincreasingly choosing to leave their jobs, employers say. Mr.Connors at American Express Travel Related Services sees thisas a recent and abrupt shift in values. &quot;Even in the late'80s,&quot; he says, &quot;I'm not sure we'd have thought employeeswould make those choices.&quot; His company, which permitsemployees up to 12 weeks of family leave without jeopardizingtheir jobs, is preparing to announce a set of new flexibilityinitiatives aimed at easing work-family conflicts.   At a handful of companies, extended leaves are grantedpurely for self-renewal. At Tandem Computers Inc., based inCupertino, Calif., all employees are eligible for a six-weekpaid sabbatical after four years on the job.   One employee used the time to hike through the Himalayas;others have attended cooking school, studied the piano orremodeled their homes.   Longer sabbaticals -- up to 10 weeks -- can be arranged ifan employee volunteers for a public-service project approvedby management. One software designer spent four weeks inZimbabwe last summer conducting a public-health survey.Tandem paid her travel and living expenses.   Sabbaticals reduce job burnout and serve as an effectiverecruiting and retention tool in the competitive SiliconValley job market, says Dee DiPietro, Tandem's manager ofhealth and welfare. Another benefit: Tandem insists thatsabbatical-bound employees train their replacements so thatco-workers gain new skills while filling in. Somehard-chargers are uneasy about taking off for an extendedperiod, Ms. DiPietro concedes. &quot;They have to get used to thefact that life will go on without them for a while,&quot; shesays.                                                                                                          Contract Work                                                                                                          Contingent employment grew in the turbulent 1980s, as manycompanies sought to avoid layoffs, control labor costs andhandle fluctuating work flow by creating a second tier oftemporary or independently contracted workers. Such employeeshave loose ties to the corporation and aren't eligible forthe fringe benefits accorded the &quot;core&quot; work force.   The outlook, according to the Conference Board survey, isfor expanded use of in-house temporary pools of formeremployees, coupled with slackening use of outside contractorsand temporaries. And though pension and Social Securityrestrictions limit their participation now, retirees promiseto be a rich source of experienced labor in the future, assupply diminishes.   Travelers Cos., for example, recently modified its pensionplan to double the number of hours pensioners can workannually without jeopardizing benefits. Travelers alsomaintains a job bank for its own retirees and those fromother Hartfordarea companies. About 250 retired temporarieswork at Travelers during any given week. Placements are madeby two job-sharing retiree teams, including one 81-year-oldwoman.   John Huntley, a former Travelers vice president, retiredon a Friday in 1987 and registered with the job bank thefollowing Tuesday. &quot;I took Monday to do all the things Inever had time to do,&quot; he says with a laugh. Hired as theactuary for a Travelers-owned company that was being sold, heworked about half-time in 1988 and, as the sale nearedcompletion, gradually fewer hours after that.   By using Mr. Huntley, Travelers was spared the need tohire a full-timer for a short-term project. And though heworked enough to lose Social Security benefits in 1988, Mr.Huntley found the job &quot;an excellent way to wind down intoretirement.&quot;   ---   Ms. Graham is a feature writer and editor based in TheWall Street Journal's New York bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
