Four months after being sold for $55 million, 58-year-old KFAC iscasting off Beethoven, Brahms and Bizet for the beat of contemporarypop music, leaving the nation's No. 2 radio market with no full-timecommercial classical station.   ``It's a great tragedy,'' said Robert Goldfarb, KFAC's departingvice president for programming and operations.   From its debut in 1931, KFAC-AM, and later FM, was distinguishedas a citadel for the symphonic arts.   But that legacy was to end at 1 p.m. today, and classical radiooutlets elsewhere are hearing the same tune.   Melodious orchestral maneuvers aren't soothing the numbercrunchers who have become increasingly influential in the radiobusiness, now that stations regularly trade hands for tens ofmillions of dollars.   ``Can any fringe format _ not just classical _ survive thesekinds of selling prices?'' asked Bob Caulfield, president andgeneral manager of Milwaukee classical station WFMR.   KFAC's new owners, Evergreen Media of Irving, Texas, hope theprogramming change will yield an audience five times larger thanKFAC's. Although KFAC enjoyed a loyal following and generatedprofits of up to $3 million a year, it never attracted more than afraction of local listeners.   ``Economics have dictated that this change is necessary tomake,'' said KFAC's new general manager, Jim de Castro.   Since there's limited space on the dial, an established stationwith a powerful signal offers a new owner the prospect of sizablecapital appreciation and healthy tax writeoffs.   No matter how well-managed, a typical classical station willrarely attract more than 2 or 3 percent of listeners. A hot rockstation can grab more than three times that.   While most classical stations are unlikely to change formatssoon, commercial classical broadcasters are having to tune in to therealities of this marketplace.   ``I don't think anyone in the commercial radio business in theclassical music field hasn't realized that we have to play by thesame rules that all of our competitors are playing by. We've got togenerate attractive bottom lines,'' said Caulfield.   That may mean reinventing the classical format.   ``The perception ... is that classical radio is dull and boringand you have to have majored in it in college before you can turnthe radio on,'' said Matthew Field, senior vice president andgeneral manager of New York City's WNCN. ``And a lot of stations donothing to turn that idea around. This is no longer a time for ivorytower thinking.''   Although it has attracted critics, WNCN has sought to enliven itsclassical format with a morning drive-time team, comedy skits, aclassical ``hit''-oriented playlist, European vacation giveaways andguest disc jockeys like actor John Cleese and ``Phantom of theOpera'' star Michael Crawford.   Field said the station, bought by GAF for $2.2 million in 1976,is profitable and should make about $2 million this year.   Contests and promotions aside, it could be that many people'sinterest in classical music stops at third-grade piano lessons.   ``It's true ... that classical stations can't make enough moneyto be worth the value of the asset. Why is that? It's because therearen't enough people who like classical music,'' said Goldfarb.``Radio stations would be happy to program classical music if enoughpeople wanted to listen to it.''   In California, with 686 commercial and public stations, there areonly 27 classical stations, down from 29 in 1988. In New York state,of 431 stations 18 are classical _ down from 19 a year ago and onlythree more than big-band.   Rather than a large audience, what classical stations offeradvertisers are sophisticated, upscale listeners.   ``The retailers and the merchants realize that we deliver lesswaste audience,'' said John Ver Standig, president of Ver StandigBroadcasting, owner of WGMS in Washington. ``We deliver almostexclusively a demographic that both by age and by income is theprime buyer for any merchant that is selling anything of value.''   Despite the audience's quality, it still isn't big enough forsome.   ``Many stations are now bought and sold more as speculative movesthan bona fide intents to operate and own a broadcast service,''said Mike Langner, past president of the Concert Music BroadcastersAssociation.   ``The speculators are driving out the broadcasters.''</TEXT></DOC>
