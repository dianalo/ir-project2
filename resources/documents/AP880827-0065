She is confident her Pakistan People's Party will win electionsscheduled for Nov. 16 and hopeful that democracy will be restoredafter 11 years of military rule.   When President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq died Aug. 17 in a plane crashthat some officials blamed on sabotage, Ms. Bhutto urged politicalleaders to act responsibly to avoid provoking a military coup.   ``I have no doubt that in free and open elections, the PakistanPeople's Party will take a majority,'' Ms. Bhutto recently toldWestern reporters at her home.   The 35-year-old opposition leader is the daughter and politicalheir of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the last freely elected primeminister, who was ousted by Zia in a 1977 military coup and orderedhanged two years later.   Bhutto had two sons and another daughter, but he doted onBenazir and groomed her in the hope that she might one day be thecounterpart to India's late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.   ``My father taught each one of us to believe that it's notimportant whether you are a man or a woman, what is important iswhat sort of person you are,'' said Ms. Bhutto, who studied atRadcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass., before studying law atOxford.   Ms. Bhutto returned to Pakistan to lead the unsuccessfulstruggle to stop her father's execution. After his death, shedenounced Zia's military rule and spent five years in jail or underhouse arrest before she was allowed to go into self-imposed exilein Europe.   Despite the suffering inflicted on her family by Zia, Ms. Bhuttosaid she was not motivated by revenge.   ``My mother became ill and couldn't lead the struggle. Thepeople who had been jailed or tortured under the general looked tome and I saw I had a duty to them,'' she said.   Since her return from self-exile in 1986, Ms. Bhutto has spokenat rallies attended by hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis. Theychant her name, wait for hours to catch a glimpse of her and listenspellbound as she speaks.   Some Pakistanis, including many in the army and the governmentbureaucracy, remember her father as a tyrant who crushed hisopponents. But millions of poor Pakistanis still think of Bhutto asa hero who sought to lead them out of deep poverty and oppression.They regard Ms. Bhutto as a daughter faithful to his memory andpromises.   Bhuttoism, the creed developed by the prime minister, was avague mix of democracy, socialism and Islam. ``Food, clothing andshelter for all,'' was Bhutto's most popular slogan.   Ms. Bhutto remains a committed populist and has promised toredistribute 10 million acres of state land to landless peasants ifshe takes power.   But the policies that attract the downtrodden frightenPakistan's more conservative voters.   ``Our political message has been based on social and economicjustice so women, minorities and the working classes have looked tous. Now we are trying to make a bridge between our traditionalconstituents and the middle class,'' Ms. Bhutto said.   She has said that Western-style capitalism is the key toPakistan's development and that her party will work to attractforeign investment, but she promised no sweeping nationalizations.   Although the shift to the center puts her in conflict with theleft-wing, anti-American wing of her party, it enables her tonegotiate with the moderate-conservative Muslim League, a potentialcoalition partner.   Pakistan's prime minister is selected from the party that wins amajority in the National Assembly. Ms. Bhutto's party is expectedto take the largest number of votes, but the Muslim League also isexpected to draw substantial support.   The Muslim League was considered a Zia tool until its leader,Mohammad Khan Junejo, was ousted as prime minister by Zia in May.Now the party is in serious disarray, but Junego is expected torally his supporters behind him and attract independent votes.   If he is not allied with Ms. Bhutto by November, Junejo could bea formidable opponent to her bid for prime minister.   Ms. Bhutto said if she is elected, she would also resolve theethnic and sectarian disputes that threaten to turn Pakistan intothe Lebanon of the subcontinent.   Shiite Moslems, who make up 5 percent of the population, havebeen in conflict with the majority Sunni Moslems over Pakistan'sforeign policy and domestic law.   Armed groups in the southern province of Sind are demandingautonomy and say they are treated unfairly by the centralgovernment, which is dominated by Punjabis. Zia, a Sunni Moslem,was from the northern Punjab province.   Ms. Bhutto blamed Zia for the divisions and said that bydissolving the national assembly and restricting political partieshe eliminated avenues for resolving disputes.   ``By restoring a political culture, reintroducing arepresentative parliament and by being a national party, we canpull these people together from the different regions to talk,``she said. ``My father did it in the 1970s and we can do it now,although it won't happen overnight.''   Ms. Bhutto, who married a Karachi businessman in December in atraditional Islamic arranged marriage, is expecting her first child.   News reports say the baby is due in December, but sources closeto the family, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the babywould arrive in the next six weeks.   Ms. Bhutto declined to discuss her pregnancy, but she said Ziaset the elections for November ``as an inconvenience to my health.''   ``You can't really interfere too much with nature,'' she said.``But I do believe motherhood and politics do not conflict. We allgrew up believing in careers.''</TEXT></DOC>
