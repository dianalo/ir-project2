Seaman family members, who hold about 5.9 million, or 43%, of the Carle Place, N.Y.-based furniture retailer's 13.6 million shares outstanding, have agreed to tender their stake, the New York investment firm said.    A cash tender offer for as many as 10.5 million, or 77%, of Seaman's shares is set to begin Monday, and is subject to availability of financing, among other things. Upon completion of the offer, all shares still outstanding will be converted to the right to receive $26 face amount of 15% subordinated debentures, Kohlberg said.    Should the share price of the offer change, Seaman family members have granted SFC Holdings Inc., a new Kohlberg unit, an option to buy their shares for the same price that other holders will be offered.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Seaman shares jumped $8 to close at $22.25, with almost 2.3 million shares changing hands.    Martin L. Roth, an analyst with Herzog, Heine, Geduld Inc. in New York, said he was surprised that the 54-year-old company is going private only two years after its initial public offering. &quot;The company doesn't need money, and going public has been good for the family and the other shareholders,&quot; he said. &quot;The stock has always sold at an attractive price in relation to earnings and book value,&quot; he added.    In response, a Seaman spokesman said, &quot;The company has expressed the desire to go private.&quot;    For the fiscal year ended April 30, Seaman's net income rose 35% to $15.2 million, or $1.12 a share, from a year earlier. Revenue rose 33% to $224.8 million.    Kohlberg said that interest on the debentures, which will be issued by SFC Holdings, will be payable semi-annually. For the first five years, it will be paid either in cash or in additional debentures at SFC Holdings' option. SFC Holdings will have the right to redeem the debentures at any time at 100% of face amount, plus accrued interest, Kohlberg added. Seaman will be merged with an SFC Holdings unit.    Seaman management will be offered the opportunity to invest in SFC Holdings, Kohlberg said. Morton Seaman, president and chief executive officer, will retain one or both of those posts.    Salomon Brothers Inc. is acting as financial adviser to SFC Holdings and will serve as dealer-manager for the offer.    In a leveraged buy-out, investors acquire a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired concern. </TEXT></DOC>
