The first part assumes that waterdisplaces oil in a piston-like manner resulting in a two-bank configuration.Analytical solutions are provided for the general piston-like displacementproblem and comparisons are made between these solutions and the availablecomposite model solutions. The two-bank part lays the groundwork forstudying a more realistic two-phase displacement process where thereis a gradual saturation change in the flooded region. The second partrigorously examines the effects of saturation gradients on injectivityand falloff tests. Analytical solutions, including wellbore storage andskin, are developed which describe pressure and saturation distributionsduring injection and falloff periods. The results are verified by comparingthem with the results from a numerical simulator. The study shows thatthe existence of saturation gradients has considerable effects on thefalloff data.</TEXT></DOC>
