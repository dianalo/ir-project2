Gigot calls NASA an &quot;arthritic bureaucracy&quot;that should be reformed, and argues that &quot;space is tooimportant to leave to NASA.&quot; I say that NASA is too importantto our country's enterprise in space to be dismissed withsuch glibness and airy distortion of the facts.   Mr. Gigot slings many arrows, but aims them badly.Consider the following:</LP><TEXT>   He says Vice President Dan Quayle and White House Chief ofStaff John Sununu convened a caucus of &quot;spacenon-conformists&quot; who allegedly spoke of the need for &quot;newthinking&quot; at NASA. Who were those nonconformists? Former NASAofficials all: Thomas Paine, a former administrator; HansMark, a former deputy administrator; Bruce Murray, a formerdirector of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory; Gene Cernan, aformer astronaut. All except Mr. Cernan had considerableinfluence on NASA's policy and institutional evolution. Mr.Paine headed a presidential commission that laid out thecourse NASA is taking now on the Space Exploration Initiativeto return to the moon permanently and send humans to exploreMars. For the first time, with President Bush's blessing,NASA is planning for events 30 years into the future, whenpeople will land on Mars. If that's not new thinking, whatis?   He criticizes NASA's &quot;gold-plated giantism,&quot; an echo ofthe criticism being leveled at big science projects. In theearly days of the space program, there was so little we knewand so much to be learned about space that we could send upsmall, simple satellites and reap a bounty of knowledge. Butafter more than three decades, we've pretty much solved theeasy problems. The difficult ones remain. And they requiremore weight, more time and more money.   Mature science requires expertise. Mr. Gigot discussesNASA's aging work force, but fails to mention that NASA istaking steps to infuse younger people into middle managementand above. Is he suggesting it scrap the experience and skillof many who not only got us to the Moon, but also designedand guided our spacecraft through the solar system andbeyond?   The article states that NASA designed the space shuttle to&quot;have its own space-launch monopoly . . . and won't evenconsider space-launch alternatives.&quot; Not true. NASA neverconceived of the shuttle as its space-launch monopoly. Thetruth is, NASA would have a mixed fleet of shuttles andexpendable rockets today had not President Reagan taken NASAout of the expendable-launch business to encourage acommercial space-launch industry. What's more, NASA is nowworking to develop an Advanced Launch System to provide aheavy-lift capability for the Space Exploration Initiativeand other projects.   Mr. Gigot implies that if the Bush administration doesn'treform NASA (he fails to state how) or kill it, the nationwill be faced with no future in space. This is balderdash.Rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater, we needto provide nourishment in the form of a stable andpredictable budget so that growth and maturation cancontinue.   Vera Hirschberg   Senior Public Affairs Officer   National Aeronautics and Space Administration   Washington   ---   There are too many NASA-bashers jumping in for their shareof self-gratification at the expense of a very competentagency suffering a few setbacks. NASA has accomplished 10consecutive near-perfect Space Shuttle missions sinceSeptember 1989, including the deployment and retrieval ofcomplex payloads such as Galileo, the Long Duration ExposureFacility, numerous national security payloads and otherscientific and technical experiments. The Voyager spacecraftgave us up-close views of other planets.   The Hubble Telescope and the shuttle problems aresolvable. NASA has mechanisms in place to fix the problems.One of its hallmarks is that it rises to any challenge andovercomes it. And by the way, those &quot;old and fat&quot; engineerscould be making three times their salaries in privateindustry; instead, they've dedicated themselves to federalservice. That dedication has continued to push the U.S. tothe forefront of aerospace technology and world leadership inspace.   If NASA is becoming too bureaucratic, it is becauseCongress, the Office of Management and Budget and the mediahave scrutinized, criticized and threatened the agency atevery turn. NASA officials have taken the initiative to keepCongress, the OMB and the public informed about its currentproblems. They should be applauded, not chastised for it.They are willing to admit publicly when there is a problem,and they dig in to solve it. The people of NASA do notdeserve the cheap shots Mr. Gigot aimed at them.   Lorraine K. Walton   Stafford, Va.   ---   Mr. Gigot's conclusions about the fundamental problemunderlying the huge cost overruns and bungled projects atNASA are right on the mark. Socialism, especially on anational scale, works no better in the U.S. than it does inEastern Europe. However, it's not true that &quot;Congress can'tsee much beyond {NASA's} budget&quot; to true reform. In June1989, Rep. Ron Packard of California introduced the SpaceTransportation Services Purchase Act, which now has more than40 House co-sponsors of widely varying ideologicalpersuasion. A version of this bill recently was attached tothis year's NASA authorization bill. The intent of the billis to break up NASA's space-transportation monopoly, creatinga true space-transportation industry that will have theincentive and freedom to lower costs. Lower launch costs areessential to the creation of an economically viable spaceindustry and a real space frontier.   Bruce Murray is correct in pointing out that NASA'scharter does not include the operation and ownership of aspace-launch monopoly. It is rather to conduct space-scienceresearch and exploration, analogous to the activities ofexplorers such as Lewis and Clark and the mission of the U.S.Geological Survey. Space is as important to the future ofAmerica as the Western frontier was a century ago.   If Sen. Albert Gore is anything but &quot;putty in NASA'shands&quot; he should take the first step toward really reformingNASA by introducing a Senate version of the Packard bill.   Mark A. Voelker   President   Tucson Space Society   Tucson, Ariz.</TEXT></DOC>
