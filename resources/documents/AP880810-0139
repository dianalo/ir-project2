Thousands of radical students, meanwhile, clashed with riotpolice in Seoul and provincial cities Wednesday, protesting policeactions blocking a cross-country march and talks with North Koreanyouths on national unification.   About 34,000 police were deployed to block demonstrations atabout 30 universities. About 300 students were arrested, but policesaid most would be released after questioning.   Policy-makers of the governing Democratic Justice Party and thethree main opposition parties met with National Assembly SpeakerKim Chae-sun and proposed that an Aug. 17 meeting sought by NorthKorea be delayed by two days.   ``Our letter stating the points will be sent to North Korea onFriday,'' Lee Dong-bok, chief secretary to the Assembly speaker,said after the meeting.   In a letter sent to South Korea Tuesday, communist North Koreaproposed that a joint meeting of the two countries' legislaturesconvene before Sept. 1 to discuss the North's bid to become co-hostof the Olympic Games in Seoul and draft a non-aggression pact.   North Korea also proposed that a working meeting be held at thetruce site of Panmunjom on Aug. 17, attended by three to fivedelegates from each side, to prepare for full parliamentary talks.   The North Korean letter also demanded the inclusion ofrepresentatives of all walks of life in the proposed parliamentarytalks.   Seoul officials believe North Korea wants South Korean dissidentgroups involved in the talks. The officials criticize the NorthKorean demand as implying that South Korea's legislature does notrepresent the 41 million people in the South.   The oficials also said the Aug. 19 working meeting, if held,should include the agenda, the type of talks and the size ofdelegations in full talks.   North Korea said only logistical arrangements such ascommunications and safe passage of delegates traveling to the otherside for talks should be discussed.   Working parliamentary contacts between the two countries brokedown in 1985.   South Korean newspapers said the North Korean proposals areaimed at stirring social unrest before the Olympics, which startSept. 17.   The Chosun Ilbo daily called the joint parliamentary talks``nothing but a mass rally that can be politically exploited by theNorth.''   North Korea has said it will boycott the Olympics unless itsdemand is met to be co-host of the Games. The International OlympicCommittee has rejected the North Korean demand.   Several thousands radical students staged demonstrations inSeoul and other parts of the country on Wednesday, protesting apolice blockade of their attempts at a cross-country unificationmarch.   The students are calling for talks on Monday with North Koreanyouths at Panmunjom on national unification. An attempt by studentsto march to Panmunjom was blocked by police on June 10.</TEXT></DOC>
