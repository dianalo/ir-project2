(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Maryland has become the first state to banthe sale of inexpensive handguns, including ``Saturday NightSpecials,'' but voters probably will have the final say on whetherthe law actually goes into effect.   With 200 police officers from five states present, Gov. WilliamDonald Schaefer on Monday signed the law forbidding manufacture andsale of the weapons.   ``This is the first time a legislature has stood up and said,`These guns are wrong,''' said Schaefer.   Well before the ceremony, opponents were gathering signatures tohold a referendum on the law in November's general election.   ``I'm confident that we are going to have the numbers that weneed for the ballot,'' said Fred Griisser, spokesman for theMaryland Committee Against the Gun Ban. The committee must have thesignatures of 33,044 registered voters by June 30 to put the issueon the ballot.   Griisser was less confident about the outcome of a referendum,saying gun groups face ``an uphill battle'' in explaining the law's``true nature'' to voters.   He said the statute bans all handguns, not just Saturday NightSpecials, and complained it does not require that any guns beapproved for sale by a review board established by the law.   Gun control supporters said Maryland's law and the expectedreferendum are crucial to efforts to ban Saturday Night Specials inother states.   ``It's important that we win. It's critical, and I'm sure wewill win,'' said Sarah Brady, who attended the signing ceremonywith her husband, White House press secretary James Brady.   ``I'd like to see other states like dominoes fall into line,''said Brady, who was wounded by a Saturday Night Special in JohnHinckley's 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan. Bradyhas been in a wheelchair ever since.   Mrs. Brady accused the law's opponents of spreading falseinformation that the bill would ban all handguns, and said it isaimed only at Saturday Night Specials.   The Bradys joined state leaders and 200 uniformed policeofficers from Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia and WestVirginia on the steps of the State House for the signing.   Schaefer called the measure a step toward stopping ``thesenseless killing on our streets.''   Saturday Night Specials have been used to kill 250,000 peopleand wound 1{ million in the last 20 years, said Mrs. Brady, whocalled the law ``a great step for public safety.''   The law makes it illegal after Jan. 1, 1990, to sell ormanufacture a gun in Maryland unless it is on a list prepared bythe newly created nine-member review board. The law does notmention Saturday Night Specials, but directs the board to excludeeasily concealed, inaccurate, unsafe and poorly made handguns.   The law also allows the board to ban plastic guns that can beslipped through metal detectors.   Manufacturers can be fined up to $10,000 and dealers and gunowners up to $2,500 per violation. Each time a gun is made or soldconstitutes a separate violation.   Mrs. Brady, who has been campaigning for tougher gun laws sinceher husband was shot, said Maryland's approach solves the difficultproblem of trying to define Saturday Night Specials by leaving thedecision to a review board.   The board will consist of three civilians, the superintendent ofstate police and one representative each of a state prosecutorsassociation, the Maryland Association of Chiefs of Police,Marylanders Against Handgun Abuse, the National Rifle Associationand a Maryland gun manufacturer.</TEXT></DOC>
