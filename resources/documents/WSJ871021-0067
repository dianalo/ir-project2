That's what everybody seems to be asking following Monday's stock-market crash. Do I buy? Do I sell? Do I forget about changing jobs? Do I pull my house off the market? What do I do about my small business?    Sorry, but nobody is going to tell you for sure. But Wall Street Journal reporters did ask dozens of prominent business people -- and a few others -- what advice they would give on these and similar questions. Here are some of their answers.    'Stay on the Sidelines   Until the Dust Settles'   Irving Shapiro, former chairman of Du Pont Co. and a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom, says: &quot;This is not a time for panic by sensible citizens. This is a period of irrationality and the average person should stay on the sidelines until the dust settles.    &quot;We're not facing problems like we did in 1929. The basics are strong. The economy is healthy. Companies are not in deep distress. Pension funds are in good shape. Our problems are in government and there should be political pressure to resolve major public-policy issues, like the deficit and the trade imbalance.&quot;    Workers with low job security shouldn't borrow money because if a recession occurs, they might lose their jobs, he says. &quot;A new element of risk has been added to the decision-making process,&quot; he says. &quot;I wouldn't be rushing in to buy a house because the prices might go down. I would ask if a $10,000 vacation trip was necessary because you might have a greater need for the cash, like paying tuition, buying stocks later or picking up another investment.    'Safest Investment   Is Treasury Notes'   Professor John Kenneth Galbraith, Harvard University, says: &quot;I'm always reluctant to give investment advice because I'm always reluctant to take it myself.&quot;    Having said that, Mr. Galbraith adds that for people trying to decide where to put cash, &quot;One can say with some slight assurance that the safest investment at the moment is Treasury notes.&quot;    He adds: &quot;I would strongly advise anybody contemplating a luxury apartment on the Upper East Side or a house in the Hamptons to wait a few months. The supply will definitely increase.&quot;    'Prices We'll Probably   Never See Again'   Multi-millionaire investor Paul Bilzerian has simple advice for the small guy: Buy stocks, any stocks. &quot;They are selling at prices we probably will never see again,&quot; says Mr. Bilzerian, of Tampa, Fla.    &quot;For the small investor, I'd say that right now you can look at anything you want. In most cases they've taken all the fat out of every one of them.&quot;    Mr. Bilzerian says he has taken advantage of the market downturn to increase his stake in a takeover target and expects to be &quot;close to 10%&quot; by the end of yesterday or today. He declines to name the target, but says &quot;we're going to launch a deal next week.&quot;    Mr. Bilzerian says he doesn't think other markets, such as credit markets, should be greatly affected by the crash. &quot;I don't see any liquidity problems, any cash crunch,&quot; he says. Interest rates should stay about the same, he says.    He doesn't think people should defer career moves or spending plans. &quot;I see very little chance of a severe recession. I think the economy's moving along beautifully,&quot; he says.    &quot;The people who can stand back and be more reflective and look at the values, I think, will do very well,&quot; he adds. &quot;The people who panicked, unfortunately, are the people who are already dead.&quot;    'No One Knows What's   Going to Happen'   New York real-estate magnate and casino operator Donald Trump advises individuals and small business owners to &quot;sit back and watch.&quot;    &quot;I invested in the stock market this morning, but unless you have lots of money to speculate, it's better just to have a good time and watch,&quot; Mr. Trump says. &quot;The market's going to be really crazy in the next few days. No one really knows what's going to happen.&quot;    'Batten Down the Hatches   And Cut Excessive Spending'   Jeno Paulucci, a Florida businessman who made a fortune in frozen pizza and canned chop suey, says, &quot;It's time to batten down the hatches and cut waste and excessive spending. There are tough times ahead.&quot;    He says the first thing he did this morning was to call the president of each of his companies and tell them &quot;go over everything and cut costs without committing hari-kari.&quot; He adds: &quot;It's the difference between surviving and going under.&quot;    He advises: &quot;Whatever business you're in, stay liquid. The stock market not only creates a loss of portfolio -- worse are the ripples or shocks that hurt the economy which could take years to come back. We recall well the businesses in 1929 that were doing well but got into trouble because they were highly leveraged.&quot;    Mr. Paulucci terms the stock market &quot;the greatest Las Vegas there is. People shouldn't be in the market unless they can afford to lose half of what they put in or have the staying power to wait four to five years for a stock to pay off.    &quot;Me, when I go to Las Vegas I take one hundred dollars. And if I lose it I go up to my room and cry a lot because I don't like to lose.&quot;    'With Credit You Can   Stay In Business'   Armand Hammer, chairman and chief executive officer of Occidental Petroleum Corp., says &quot;you can't compare this with '29. In '29 they had a 10% margin and people were wiped out. You didn't have unemployment insurance, you didn't have social security. I see no need to panic.&quot;    Dr. Hammer says that if a small investor is &quot;crazy enough to panic, then he'll lose. I'd say hold on to your stocks if they've got an assured dividend. That's the key to the whole thing.    &quot;The best thing a small-business man can do is to make sure that his bank credit lines are in place, because the banks are going to be supported. He must be liquid. That doesn't just mean cash in the bank but access to credit. With credit you can stay in business.    'Worst Possible Time   To Change Jobs'   Joyce Brothers, the psychologist and newspaper columnist, says, &quot;Just as in a storm, birds nest, this is a time for the general population to nest.&quot;    On job changes, for instance, Dr. Brothers says: &quot;This is the worst possible time. Don't leap now because your new boss may be more panicky than your old one.&quot;    But Ms. Brothers remains fundamentally optimistic about the market. &quot;I think it's a very temporary thing and in three months we'll look back and laugh at it.&quot;    'Even on a New Road,   There Will Be Some Bumps'   Financier Meshulam Riklis says small investors with a regular investment plan shouldn't stop buying stocks.    &quot;If you are going to get scared when the market is down, it means you are never going to buy stocks at a bargain.&quot;    &quot;Yes, there will be some bumps. Even when you ride your bicycle on a newly surfaced road there will be bumps,&quot; says the chairman of Rapid-American Corp.    However, the wheeler-dealer who long ago was a stock analyst and broker wasn't affected by the market's collapse. &quot;I am personally not invested in the stock market. It is a very risky business and that is why I buy bonds.&quot;    'I've Never Tried to Give   People Financial Advice'   Ross Perot, the outspoken founder of Electronic Data Systems and Dallas entrepeneur, has been out of the stock market himself for about a year, but staunchly refused to dispense any generic advice to others. &quot;I've never ever tried to give people financial advice through the newspapers -- I'm afraid they'll listen to me,&quot; he said. &quot;I'd need to look at each and every person or business situation under a microscope.    &quot;I've been out for a year, but I didn't get out because I was smart. I got out becuase I was too dumb to understand what the heck might be really going on.&quot;    'Don't Put Blame   Where It Doesn't Belong'   Lois Wyse, president of Wyse Advertising Inc., Cleveland, and author of &quot;Company Manners&quot; and other advice books, says she can't give investing advice but urges people to &quot;make sure your health doesn't suffer and hold tight to the relationships that matter. Don't put blame where it doesn't belong, either at home or at work. In times of stress there's a tendency to do just that, and you have to work doubly hard to maintain relationships. You need to assure everybody in your life that you still love them, even if they're now part of the newly poor.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
