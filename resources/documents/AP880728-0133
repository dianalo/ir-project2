Despite the differences, the informal talks resulted in a broadconvergence of views on key issues and on the urgent need for apolitical settlement, said a closing statement from IndonesianForeign Minister Ali Alatas, who hosted the gathering.   Participating were Vietnam, its ally Laos, the Vietnam-backedCambodian government, the three guerrilla groups fighting Vietnam'soccupation and the pro-guerrilla Association of Southeast AsianNations: Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singaporeand Brunei.   Their representatives gathered at the old presidential palace inBogor, 40 miles outside Jakarta.   Khieu Samphan, leader of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla faction,called Vietnam's contention that the Cambodian meeting had reachedbroad agreement ``a shameless lie'' aimed at perpetuating itsoccupation of Cambodia ``forever through its puppet regime.''   He accused Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, ofrejecting all guerrilla peace proposals at the talks. Vietnam, hesaid, must unconditionally withdraw from Cambodia instead oflinking a pullout to demands that steps be taken to insure theKhmer Rouge does not return to power.   Thach's statements to reporters were aimed at ``deceiving theinternational community'' he added.   Meanwhile, Hun Sen, the Cambodian leader, told a news conferencethat his party and the guerrilla resistance ``have made efforts tofind common ground. It was a pity that the Khmer Rouge rejected ourproposal.''   He said they proposed a national reconciliation council with theformer guerrilla alliance leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, incharge that would include political but not military participationby the Khmer Rouge.   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 to halt bloody attackson its western border by the Khmer Rouge, who had killed hundredsof thousands of people in trying to transform Cambodia into aprimitive agrarian society during its 1975-79 rule.   The communist Khmer Rouge is now allied in a guerrilla coalitionwith the forces of Sihanouk, Cambodia's former monarch, and SonSann of the non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front.   Thach said Wednesday the talks had resolved ``the most difficultproblems'' and there was agreement in general terms though not ondetails. One agreement was the need for steps to prevent a KhmerRouge return, he said.   On Thursday, Thach said he was ``half-happy'' with the talks anddeclared Vietnam was ``determined to have a political solutionbefore 1990,'' its self-imposed deadline for withdrawing its morethan 100,000 occupation troops.   A desire to avoid a post-1990 civil war led the conflictingparties to the Bogor talks.   The participants agreed to form working groups of seniorofficials of all sides to study issues of contention and, by year'send, make recommendations for another round of talks.   Even Singapore's hard-line foreign minister, Suppiah Dhanabalan,called the talks ``a very important psychological breakthrough,''as the first meeting among all the warring parties.   Meanwhile, Hun Sen, head of the Phnom Phen government, confirmedhe would meet with Sihanouk in Paris in October for a third roundof talks. They met in France in December and January, and Sihanoukcanceled a planned third round.   Sihanouk, who ruled Cambodia from 1941-70 and is widelyconsidered essential to a future government, recently resigned aspresident of the resistance coalition, saying the Khmer Rouge waskilling his men.   Sihanouk refused to go to Bogor, where the talks were held. Buthe reclaimed center stage by meeting Wednesday in Jakarta with hisguerrilla partners and Hun Sen. His son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh,represented Sihanouk at Bogor.   The statement issued by Alatas, the host, said participantsagreed the two key issues of the Cambodian problem ``are thewithdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Kampuchea, to be carried outwithin the context of an overall political solution and theprevention of the recurrence of genocidal policies and practices ofthe Pol Pot (Khmer Rouge) regime and to ensure the cessation of allforeign interference and external arms supplies to the opposingKampuchean forces.'' They also agreed on the need for definitetimetables and an international presence to supervise theseprocesses, it said.   Alatas said no official communique was issued because the talkswere informal. Diplomatic sources said Singapore and Thailand, thetwo hardest-line states on the issue, were upset by what they sawas Vietnam besting the others, and led opposition to a communique.</TEXT></DOC>
