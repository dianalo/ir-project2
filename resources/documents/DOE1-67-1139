Extensive use is made of multiplexingthrough optical fibres to a FASTBUS readout system. The low repetitionrate of the SLC allows a relatively simple software-based trigger. Hardwareand software processors within the acquisition modules are used to reducethe large volume of data per event and to calibrate the electronics.A farm of microprocessors is used for full reconstruction of a sampleof events prior to transmission to the host.</TEXT></DOC>
