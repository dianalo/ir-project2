Country by country statistics, mostly for the period 1977to 1987, are given and trends and regional patterns are extracted. Foroil, data on reserves, production, consumption, crude oil and productprices, refinery capacities and throughputs, and trade movements arelisted. Data on the reserves, production and consumption of coal, andthe consumption of nuclear energy and hydroelectricity are tabulated.Finally, world total primary energy consumption data is given for theperiod 1968-1987, illustrating a continuing climb and showing an increasein demand of 2.8% for 1987; this is for commercially graded fuels onlyand excludes such fuels as wood, peat and animal waste for which reliablestatistics are not available. A breakdown into consumption by fuel showsa 1.4% increase in demand in the oil sector, compared with 3% for 1986,reflecting the recovery in oil prices and consequent enhanced competitivenessof other fuels. Local consumption rose by nearly 3%, nearly half of thisaccounted for by the centrally planned economies, and nuclear energydemand increased by more than 7% continuing a rising trend.
