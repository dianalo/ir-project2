The rule, the last in a set of five regulations issuedsince 1984, will demand the biggest expenditures from theelectric, gas and sanitary service industries, chemicalplants and petroleum refineries.</LP><TEXT>   The latest regulation, covering more than half of thehazardous waste generated today, requires that contaminationby more than 300 chemicals, toxicity and other hazardouscharacteristics be reduced before sludge or waste water canbe disposed of in landfills, deep wells or other facilitiesby at least May 1992.   The EPA said the rules will keep &quot;significant quantities&quot;of hazardous wastes off the land, help prevent groundwatercontamination and encourage companies to reduce the amount ofwastes they generate. But environmental groups charged thatthe agency buckled under to chemical and other interests bysetting standards that don't always require industry to usethe best available technology, such as incineration orsolidification techniques, to treat hazardous wastes beforedisposal.   Karen Florini, an attorney with the Environmental DefenseFund, called the rule &quot;extremely lax&quot; and said the EPA is&quot;abandoning a golden opportunity for pollution prevention.&quot;She said environmental groups are considering filing alawsuit.   In writing the rules, the EPA was under pressure from bothindustries that generate wastes and hazardous-waste treatmentcompanies that would have profited from tougher regulation.</TEXT></DOC>
