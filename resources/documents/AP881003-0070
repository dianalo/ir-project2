No pickup.</NOTE><DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rivalries between intelligence agencieshave sabotaged efforts to help free foreign hostages, the spiritualleader of an umbrella group believed to be holding the hostagessaid in an interview published today.   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual guide of theIranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, also said the issue ofthe hostages had become political rather than humanitarian.   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella group for undergroundShiite extremist factions holding most of the 17 foreigners missingafter being kidnapped in Lebanon since March 1985.   Fadlallah told the English-language Monday Morning magazine that``the struggle of intelligence services and of states is such as toset at nought our best efforts'' on behalf of the hostages.   ``The issue was until recently a humanitarian one with politicaldimensions,'' Fadlallah was quoted as saying. ``Now it has becomewholly political, so a discussion of it necessarily implies adiscussion of relations between the states involved and thekidnappers.'' He did not elaborate.   Fadlallah was responding to a question about reports thatAmerican hostages will be released soon and that the kidnappers ofAnglican Church envoy Terry Waite were awaiting specific responsesfrom the British government.   The Christian-controlled local news agency al-Markazia on Sundayissued advance excerpts of the Fadlallah interview with MondayMorning. The broadcast quoted Fadlallah as saying that the hostageordeal was nearing its end.   ``When the hostage question shifts to high-level talks betweenbig powers, and they start speaking of deadlines, that means thequestion is nearing its end,'' Fadlallah was quoted as saying.   That quote did not appear in the interview published by themagazine and there was no explanation for the discrepency.   In Jerusalem, the editor of an Israeli newspaper said Sundaythat negotiators for the United States and Iran were holding talksnear Geneva on the release of eight Amercan hostages and oneBritish hostage.   Hesh Kestin, managing editor of the Nation newspaper, said thetalks included delegations representing Iran and the United Statesand ``a mixed group'' of intermediaries. He did not elaborate.   The Nation, an English-language weekly that began publication amonth ago, reported Friday that the United States has struck asecret deal with Iran, promising economic aid and arms sales inexchange for the release of eight of the nine American hostages inLebanon.   It said the deal would include the release of frozen Iranianassets in U.S. banks and the resumption of diplomatic relations.   President Reagan, White House officials and the State Departmentall denied the report.   According to the Nation, which quoted unidentified sources inGeneva, Iran would secure the release of five American hostages onor around Oct. 7. A second group of hostages, including threeAmericans and a Briton _ possibly Waite _ would be released a weeklater, the report said.   All are believed held by Shiite Moslem groups loyal to Iran.   The newspaper report said the U.S. put aside its demand thatTehran release Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, one of the nineAmericans, because officials were convinced Iran does not controlthe kidnappers holding him.   Seventeen foreign hostages are held in Lebanon. The hostage heldlongest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Waite disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while trying tonegotiate the release of hostages.   In Beirut on Saturday, kidnappers holding three Americaneducators and an Indian professor said they would release onehostage as a good-will gesture.   The group, the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine,did not say in its statement which of the hostages it would free,or when.</TEXT></DOC>
