It has spent 11 years selling healthful livingto its own employees -- to save money.   Cost containment has been a major goal of its wellnessprogram since day oneand that goal has apparently been met.Johnson andamp; Johnson says that last year the program saved $378per employee by lowering absenteeism and by slowing the risein the company's health-care expenses. The cost of theprogram, which offers checkups and encourages healthiereating and exercise habits, is $200 per employee.</LP><TEXT>   Jandamp;J is one of only a handful of companies that have madecomprehensive examinations of the costs and benefits of theirprograms. It is precisely because of this lack of hard datathat many other corporate wellness programs are vulnerable tocost-cutting pressure, one expert says. &quot;In a rough economicclimate, one of the first things that is cut is a healthprogram or a wellness program,&quot; says Roger Reed, whosupervises wellness programs for Blue Cross and Blue Shieldof Indiana. &quot;The reason is a lot of wellness-programadministrators haven't done a good job of documenting theresults.&quot;   That hasn't been the case with Johnson andamp; Johnson. Itsstudy took three years and involved 8,000 employees. Wellnesswas tested just as the company would experiment with a newdrug, with both a test group and a control group.   The company tracked medical costs and productivity of5,000 workers at three subsidiaries whose executives werewilling to give it a try. The control group consisted ofother units that didn't have such a program. During the firstyear, the wellness program cost more than it saved. In thesecond year, it broke even. And in the third year, it savedenough money to pay back the losses during the first year.   Health-care costs at Johnson andamp; Johnson, which isself-insured, have risen about 310% over the past decade. Butthese same costs spurted an estimated 460% at 30 similarcompanies that Jandamp;J tracks to determine its own wage andcompensation levels. Last year, Jandamp;J says, it spent $93.5million on medical costs, up 10% from 1988. That comparedwith a 20% rise at the other 30 concerns.   The wellness program has been enough of a success that Jandamp;Jbegan marketing it to other companies four years ago. So far,Johnson andamp; Johnson Health Management Inc. is providing varyinglevels of service to about 60 companies with a total of morethan 850,000 employees.   Outside experts generally give high marks to Johnson andamp;Johnson's internal program, but some criticize the emphasison cost containment. Edward J. Bernacki, vice president ofTenneco Inc., which has an aggressive wellness program of itsown, agrees that wellness programs save money over the longrun, but he contends that such a saving shouldn't be theprimary reason for starting one. &quot;I think it kind of cheapensa program,&quot; says Mr. Bernacki, &quot;to say we're doing it becausethere's a gain in it for the company.&quot;   At Johnson andamp; Johnson's headquarters here, employees canwork out in a first-floor gym, select &quot;healthy heart&quot; foodsin the cafeteria, and check their weight in restrooms. Theyare even encouraged to drop hints to fellow workers aboutlosing weight or giving up smoking.   &quot;We've developed an environment where it's OK for a workerto say, `John, you're putting on a few pounds,'&quot; says John S.Brown, Jandamp;J's vice president of employee relations. Mr. Brownshould know, because he just shed 40 pounds on a diet and, inturn, has been nagging his secretary to quit smoking.   Do employees not participating in the program feelpressured by such nagging? Anthony A. Herrmann, Johnson andamp;Johnson's vice president of health, safety and environmentalaffairs, suspects there may have been some resentment aboutthe approach, especially in the beginning. But he says it hasnever been a big issue and there hasn't been a &quot;hue or cry.&quot;   Lewis Maltby, who heads the American Civil LibertiesUnion's task force on work place civil liberties, laudedJohnson andamp; Johnson for having a wellness program, but he tookissue with the practice of encouraging employees to drophints. &quot;There is a danger that you'll go from helping peopledo something they want to do into coercing people,&quot; he says.   The goals of the program are pretty basic: Stop smoking,eat more fruit and fewer fatty foods, get some exercise, andbuckle up your seatbelt.   &quot;The way you change the health of the whole population isto get the whole population to make small changes in a lot ofareas,&quot; says Curtis S. Wilbur, a Johnson andamp; Johnson executivewho helped write a study on the wellness program.   The program, called Live for Life, is voluntary. Employeesjoining the program receive a 19-page questionnaire, part ofa health-risks profile. They must ponder such questions asthese:   How many times a week do you add salt to your food?   How many flights of stairs do you climb a day?   Have people ever annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?   How many close friends do you have? (The question on closefriends is part of a section examining the employee's mentalhealth. If responses to several of these questions indicatethe person is suffering from depression, he or she might bereferred for further counseling.)   The completed questionnaire is immediately analyzed bycomputer, which prints out a response that points out areaswhere employees may not have healthy habits.   A nurse practitioner then goes over the results of thesurvey with the employees, takes their blood pressure andtests their pulse while they ride an exercise bicycle.   The questionnaire and the session with the nurse canproduce big results in themselves. &quot;That kind of face-to-faceeducation is maybe the most important part of Live for Life,&quot;says David Calkins, an assistant professor at Harvard MedicalSchool, who has done research on health promotion. In fact, aJohnson andamp; Johnson study found that employees got about halfthe benefits of the wellness program just by going throughthe health-risks profile.   After the profile, Live for Life tries to persuadeemployees to act: to exercise, watch their diets and loseweight; to quit smoking; or to do whatever else might becalled for. Signs in hallways and brochures sent to employeespromote various programs, and workers win prizes forparticipating. Employees are asked to stop in for follow-uphealth-risks profiles.   The information garnered from the questionnaire isconfidential between the employee and the company's medicaldepartment. &quot;I think the levels of participation would not beanywhere as high if we had not paid attention to this issueof confidentiality,&quot; says Dr. Herrmann.   Live for Life now is available to all 35,000 Jandamp;J employeesin the U.S. At headquarters here, nearly two-thirds of theworkers participate to some degree. The average employee, forinstance, exercises in the gym nearly twice a week.   Some have no desire to participate. &quot;I eat what I want. Ieat as much as I want, and my weight stays the same,&quot; saysHerbert Brown, the 56-year-old security supervisor, as hepolishes off a plate of bacon and eggs in the companycafeteria. And, come lunchtime, there are plenty of employeesordering cheeseburgers.   Those cheeseburgers have had their effect. During thecompany's three-year study, the average employee with accessto the wellness program lost only about a pound more thanother workers. The results are typical of mostweight-reduction programs, health experts say. It's not thattough to get people to lose weight, but it's very hard tokeep them from putting the pounds back on.   Smoking, however, is a different story. Slightly less than20% of Jandamp;J employees currently smoke, down from about 30% inthe late 1970s. &quot;If you can get people to stop smoking, youmake a big hit in a variety of risk factors,&quot; says Frank H.Barker, a vice president.   The problem is that the people who still smoke arehard-core, committed puffers. The company is taking the nextstep by making its corporate headquarters completelysmoke-free on Oct. 1. Some of its subsidiaries have alreadymade such a move.   Finally, Jandamp;J has begun combing its data base to identifyemployees with the highest risk factors, such as smoking,high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. Thestrategy: concentrate more resources on the minority ofpeople who are likely to account for the majority ofhealth-care costs.   ---                      Paying the Price                                                                                                          -- Average annual company cost, per employee, attributableto smoking, hypertension and poor diet, based on medicalclaims of more than 500,000 employees.
