The law providesthat the standards will be voluntary for new non-Federal buildings, butwill be mandatory for new Federal buildings.In today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, DOE promulgated final interim energy conservationmandatory performance standards for new Federal residential buildings.The interim standards require a Federal agency to establish an energy consumptiongoal for the design of a new Federal residential building using the computerizedcalculation procedure.Today, the Department is proposing several modifications to the COSTSAFRcomputer program (Version 2.0), and requesting public comment on theseproposals. These modifications include: (1) The addition of a credit forthree different massive wall configurations - mass on the inside of theinsulation, mass integral with the insulation, and mass on the outsideof the insulation; (2) the addition of new energy data to the window glazingoptions, including low-emissivity (Low-E) glazings; and, (3) the additionof an alternative compliance procedure that allows bidders on Federal residentialprojects to utilize innovative designs and energy conservation optionsnot presently found in the computer program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Written comments on the Proposed Modifications to the FinalInterim Rule for Mandatory Energy Conservation Performance Standards forNew Federal Residential Buildings should be received by the Departmentby November 23, 1988.A public briefing will be held in Washington, DC on September 29, 1988,9:30 a.m., at the U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue,SW., Room 1E-245.

The interim standards for new Federal residential buildingsare required by the Energy Conservation Standards for New Buildings Actof 1976, as amended, (Act) 42 U.S.C. 6831 <T3>et seq.</T3>In response to its request for public comment on the proposed interim standards,DOE received over two hundred individual comments. Approximately 75% ofthose commenting suggested that DOE recognize the energy conservation benefitof wall thermal mass in the COSTSAFR computer program. Virtually everyperson who commented on this issue was opposed to the COSTSAFR programbecause it gave no recognition to the energy conserving benefits of moremassive masonry construction or to the technical difficulty and increasedcosts of installing R-11 insulation in a masonry wall, especially in moderateto warm climates, where they asserted, it was not needed.Those who commented stated that failure to consider masonry's durability,low maintenance, structural characteristics and fire protection (as opposedto fire resistance) would result in increased expenditure of tax dollarson construction, operation and maintenance of Federal residential buildings.They indicated that failure to recognize the benefits of thermal mass inCOSTSAFR would produce severe negative economic impacts for the masonryindustry by placing builders, who wish to utilize other than light frameconstruction, at a serious disadvantage in competing for military and otherFederally-funded housing construction programs.They indicated that failure to recognize the benefits of thermal mass inCOSTSAFR would produce severe negative economic impacts for the masonryindustry by placing builders, who wish to utilize other than light frameconstruction, at a serious disadvantage in competing for military and otherFederally-funded housing construction programs.Those who commented, citing the October 31, 1985, DOE publication of aNotice of Inquiry in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (50 FR 45469), in which the Department statedthat it had completed its research on energy conservation benefits of thermalmass use in residences, and the subsequent use of the research resultsin proposed American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and AirConditioningEngineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) standards and in a computer program (PEAR) developedby Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL), did not accept DOE statements thatdata were not available to include thermal mass options in the proposedinterim standards.Most suggested that the interim standards be delayed until they appropriatelyand accurately included provisions for thermal mass options, or that DOEshould defer to private sector standard development activities currentlybeing conducted by ASHRAE.DOE found that thermal mass is not typically selected by Federal agenciesto be included in their residential construction projects. For this reason,and the lack of building industry consensus about how to reflect the energyconservation benefits of thermal mass in the design of residential buildings,during the initial development of COSTSAFR, thermal mass was not includedin the original version. However, DOE now believes that their is adequateindustry consensus on how to fairly reflect the energy conservation benefitsof thermal mass in residential construction and has decided to includethermal mass options in the COSTSAFR computer program.After developing the thermal mass algorithms and formulae necessary toproperly update the COSTSAFR computer program, DOE is formally requestingcomments on the thermal mass revisions to COSTSAFR.Updated information on passive solar design and other window glazing optionsare also included in the proposed changes to COSTSAFR. New energy datawould be incorporated into the computer program for all site-built prototypewindow glass options. This includes clear, heat absorbing, and reflectiveglazings. Low-E glass would also be added to the program. A new sun-temperedsection (formerly passive solar) would be completely modified with newdata. The moveable insulation energy data would remain unchanged.Finally, DOE received several comments that the point system generatedby the COSTSAFR computer program was too prescriptive and did not allowfor innovative or unusual energy conservation design solutions. Therefore,DOE is proposing an alternate means of compliance. The alternate methodwould accommodate different energy conservation designs, materials, andconstruction techniques, and yet remain consistent with the basic frameworkand economic assumptions of the computer program.Details of the proposed modifications to the COSTSAFR computer programmay be found in Section III of this Notice. DOE requests public commenton each of the modifications. Based on the public comment, DOE will makemodifications to the computer program and distribute the new version ofthe COSTSAFR computer program to Federal agencies and other interestedindividuals and groups, and also make it available through the Departmentof Commerce's National Technical Information Service.<ITAG tagnum="26">I.

Background</ITAG>Originally enacted on August 14, 1976 as Title III of the Energy Conservationand Production Act, Pub. L. 94-385, 90 Stat. 1144 <T3>et seq., </T3>42 U.S.C. 6831, (August 14, 1976), the Act required theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to develop, promulgate,implement and enforce compliance with performance standards to improvethe energy efficiency of all new buildings in the nation. On August 4,1977, the Act was amended by section 304(a), 42 U.S.C. 7154, of the Departmentof Energy Organization Act, Pub. L. 95-91, 91 Stat. 565 <T3>et seq.</T3>, which transferred from HUD to DOE the responsibilityto develop and promulgate the standards. The amendments to the Act didnot change HUD's implementation responsibilities.In November 1979, DOE published proposed performance standards in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>44 FR 68120 (November 28, 1979). The noticewas cotroversial and generated over 1,800 comments totalling 40,000 pages.The comments included technical and other substantive criticisms of theperformance standards.Less than a year after the publication of the proposed standards, the Actwas again amended. Section 326, 94 Stat. 1649, of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-399 (October 8, 1980) required thatDOE promulgate interim standards by August 1, 1981 and extended the promulgationdate of the final standards to April 1, 1983. The interim standards wereonly to apply to new Federal buildings. In addition, the Act required demonstrationprojects to be conducted in at least two geographical areas.In August 1981, Congress again amended the Act. Subtitle D of Title 10of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub. L. 97-35, 95 Stat. 621,amended the Act to create the term ``voluntary performance standards'',eliminated the provision for a possible statutory sanction for noncompliance,added a provision that, except for Federal buildings, ``voluntary standardswill be developed solely as guidelines to provide technical assistancefor the design and construction of energy efficient buildings'', and extendedthe deadline for DOE to furnish reports on the demonstration projects toCongress.The legislative changes that have taken place since the original 1976 enactmentrequired DOE to make fundamental changes to the compliance aspects of thestandards. DOE retains the responsibility for developing performance standardsto achieve the maximum practicable improvements in energy efficiency anduse of non-depletable resources for all new buildings. However, developmentof these standards must now serve two purposes. The performance standardsserve one purpose for the Federal sector where the standards prescribemandatory design requirements. For non-Federal buildings, these performancestandards serve only as guidelines for the purpose of providing technicalassistance for the design and construction of energy efficient buildings.Accordingly, these performance standards serve a second purpose of providingsound technical information and examples of efficient design practicesfor voluntary use in the private sector. On August 20, 1986, the Department published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 29754) proposed interim mandatory energyconservation performance standards for new Federal residential buildings.On September 23, 1986, DOE published an addendum to the proposed standardsto correct data in the Technical Support Document issued concurrently withthe NOPR. On November 19, 1986, a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice was published announcing an extensionof the public comment period by fifty-nine days. In response to publiccomment and with the availability of additional technical information,DOE made revisions to the proposed interim standards and the micro-computerprogram, and its supporting documentation. The revised micro-computer programwas designated, COSTSAFR Version 2.0.The interim standards are being published in today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The interim standards require Federal agenciesto design new Federal residential buildings in accordance with the energyconservation requirements required by andSection; 435.303 of the interimstandards. The Federal agencies have until February 21, 1989 to place theinterim standards into effect. The interim standards do not regulate non-Federalconstruction. The interim standards have been developed specifically forFederal agencies that construct residential buildings. The calculationprocedures used to apply the interim standards to Federal residential constructionare not intended for use by the non-Federal sector.The interim standards will remain in effect until DOE promulgates finalstandards. By law, DOE is required to conduct a demonstration of the interimstandards, based on criteria established by the Act, and report its findingsto the Congress, prior to the development and promulgation of final standards.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of the Interim Standards</ITAG>The interim standards were developed to enable Federal agencies to designresidential buildings that are cost-effective to build and operate. Theyare intended to serve two purposes: (1) To be used as a mandatory standardfor all Federal agencies that design and construct residential buildings,and (2) to be able to serve as a voluntary guideline to the nation's builders.In order to meet these criteria, the useability of the interim standardswas considered a very high project priority.The interim standards are expressed in terms of this objective: Each Federalresidential building should be designed to include the combination of energyconservation measures that represents the practicable optimum life cycleenergy cost to the Federal government in a particular location. This isachieved by requiring that Federal officials use local construction, maintenanceand replacement costs, local climate data, and local fuel costs as inputsto a micro-computer program that will automatically construct an energy-efficientand cost-effective energy consumption goal for any of nine building unittypes.The most novel aspect of the interim standards, which distinguishes itfrom other standards, is that location-specific requirements can be generatedby the use of software and micro-computer technology. The use of micro-computertechnology was chosen partly on the basis of the emergence of the technologyover the period of the last few years and partly because of the ease inwhich energy and cost calculations are made. The use of micro-computershas become common among Federal agencies, and advantages in time savingsclearly justify the technology for use with building standards. Use ofmicro-computers eliminates the need for anyone to perform lengthy calculationsor make uninformed choices regarding the optimization of energy conservationmeasures.The interim standards mandate the use of a DOE-sponsored micro-computerprogram called COSTSAFR that was developed to make the selection of a setof optimal energy conservation measures and, consequently, the design ofcost-effective energy-efficient buildings a relatively simple process.One output from the COSTSAFR program is the data to be used in determiningcompliance with the interim standards. COSTSAFR is designed to providespecific information on the interaction of over 30 energy conservationmeasures in nearly any U.S. location. It enables a Federal agency to developcost-effective residential building standards for a single project, thusreducing the more general nature of previous standards. Finally, it isdesigned to be effective for any of several building types including single-family,small multi-family, and manufactured housing.COSTSAFR has been designed so that implementing officials, designers, andbuilders can easily tell if a proposed combination of measures will resultin energy conservation levels that meet or exceed an optimized level forcost-effective energy conservation in a building.The COSTSAFR program performs life cycle cost optimization for a broadset of energy conservation measures and determines the energy costs forthe resulting optimum set of measures. The result is a total point valuefor the energy conservation measures to be installed in the optimal house.COSTSAFR then prints out a point system for all energy conservation optionsindicating how various levels of each option perform relative to the optimumoption. This point system is the compliance tool provided to bidders whocan then select measures as they choose and know whether their combinationof energy conservation measures has met or exceeded the optimum levelsrequired by the interim standards. Those proposing respond by submittinga completed compliance form for each proposed model residence with therest of the bid package.Procedurally, to comply, a Federal procurement official will have to obtaina copy of the COSTSAFR software, its accompanying User's Manual and haveaccess to a micro-computer system which runs on the MS-DOS disk operatingsystem. The software and the User's Manual will lead the Federal officialthrough the steps of selecting a building prototype, location and fueltype; selecting the set of energy conservation measures that are to beconsidered; calculating the life cycle cost minimum for the prototypicalbuilding; and finally, calculating the points corresponding to alternativeenergy conservation options and printing them out in a set of complianceforms. The compliance forms are then made a part of the RFP package. Thebidder (proposer), using the compliance forms, must show that the intendeddesign is equivalent to or more efficient than its corresponding prototypicaldesign with its optimized set of energy conservation measures. The COSTSAFRprogram will be made available to all Federal agencies procuring residentialbuildings.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Description of the Proposed Modifications to COSTSAFR</ITAG>A. Thermal Mass WallsIt is proposed that thermal mass be added as an option in COSTSAFR in responseto the many public comments on the issue. The approach that would be usedrelies on the data and techniques developed by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory(LBL) for the <T3>Affordable Housing through Energy Conservation: A Guide to Designingand Constructing Energy Efficient Homes, </T3>and previously provided forpublic review and comment. LBL has studied the effect of thermal mass inwalls and has included the results in the residential housing data basethat was described in a <T4>Federal Register</T4> Notice of Inquiry on October 31, 1985 (50 FR45469) and may be found in the supporting documentation.Three different massive walls configurations have been modeled for theCOSTSAFR computer program modification: mass on the inside of the insulation,mass integral with the insulation, and mass on the outside of the insulation.A ranch-style prototype was used for the DOE 2.1 computer simulations ofthermal mass, with all components except the walls of the house held constant.These components are a 4-inch, carpet-covered slab foundation, R-30 ceiling,and double glazing with an area equivalent to 15% of the floor area.Heat capacity and steady-state thermal resistance typically can be independentin wall materials. A wall can be constructed to have high levels of heatstorage, or thermal resistance, or both. For thermal mass, LBL has considereddifferent heat capacities per square foot of wall area, including thosefor wood, concrete, and brick. In addition, the thickness of the mass wasvaried to give a large range of total heat capacities. Only two differentR-values were modeled in each of the three massive walls configurations.Table 1 shows the range of mass walls studied.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,s150,10,10,10,10</C><T4>TABLE 1 Mass Wall Characteristics</T4><H1>Insulation Location</H1><H1>Mass Conductivity (Btu/hr*ft-</H1>anddegrees;F)<H1>Mass Thickness (inches)</H1><H1>Heat Capacity (Btu/ft\2\-</H1>anddegrees;F)<H1>Wall R-value (hr*ft\2\</H1>anddegrees;F/Btu)<ITAG tagnum="1">Outside<D>0.5</D><D>4-8</D><D>3.3-13.3</D><D>5,20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Inside<D>0.5</D><D>4-8</D><D>3.3-13.3</D><D>5,20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Integral<D>0.03-0.13</D><D>4-8</D><D>3.3-13.3</D><D>5,10</D></ITAG></ITAG>In order to place a limit on the number of simulations needed, LBL separatedthe 45 base cities included in the data base into 12 zones. In all 45 cities,simulations were run for only three walls: A base wall, the base wall withadded mass, and the base wall with added mass and added insulation.Based on the initial runs, each of the cities were grouped into one ofthe 12 zones where the energy savings with the extra mass divided by thesavings with both extra mass and resistance are comparable. Therefore,the cities grouped into a zone are not necessarily in the same geographicregion. Also, it was possible for each of the 45 base cities to be assignedto a different zone for heating and cooling seasons.Each of the 12 zones were represented by a base city for which 51 DOE 2.1simulations were run, covering the range of wall properties listed in thetable above. From these results, regression coefficients were determined,for each of the three mass locations: outside, integral, and inside, andeach of the 12 zones, for both heating and cooling. These regression coefficientsare then used in the following equation:<ITAG tagnum="20">Equation 1.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">MASS WALL LOAD = C<T2>1</T2>+C<T2>2</T2>*EXP(C<T2>0</T2>*HC)+C<T2>3</T2>*U<T2>t</T2>+C<T2>4</T2>*EXP(C<T2>0</T2>*HC)*U<T2>t</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">C<T2>0</T2>....C<T2>4</T2> are regression coefficients.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">HC is the heat capacity (Btu/ft\2\*anddegrees;F).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">U<T2>t</T2> is the total wall U-value (Btu/hr*ft\2\*anddegrees;F).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">EXP indicates the exponential function.</ITAG>A quadratic regression equation based on the existing COSTSAFR wood framewall construction was used to interpolate the annual heating and coolingload on a wood frame wall for U-values between the ones in the data base.This load is calculated for the wall with the same total U-value as themass wall. The equation is:<ITAG tagnum="20">Equation 2.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">FRAME WALL LOAD = C<T2>5</T2>*U<T2>t</T2>\2\+C<T2>6</T2>*U<T2>t</T2>+C<T2>7</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">C<T2>5</T2>....C<T2>7</T2> are regression coefficients. </ITAG>The load for the wood frame wall and the load for the mass wall are addedtogether to obtain the total energy load for the mass wall:<ITAG tagnum="20">Equation 3.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">TOTAL MASS WALL LOAD = FRAME WALL LOAD + MASS WALL LOAD</ITAG>Data would be added to the COSTSAFR computer program energy data filesfor all seven site-built prototypes. No mass construction data has beendeveloped or added for manufactured homes (mobile homes). The added dataconsist of the seventeen regression coefficients for each location andseason. These coefficients are read into the program for the appropriatelocation and equations 1, 2, and 3 are used to determine the energy loadsfor a range of heat capacities and wall R-values. The energy loads arethen converted into points as discussed in Chapter 5 of the Interim FederalResidential Standard Technical Support Document.A new section would be added to the COSTSAFR point system for the masswall with a table similar in format to the window section. The bidder (proposer)would choose between the wood frame wall and the thermal mass wall. Forthe mass wall, the bidder (proposer) would choose values for the followingparameters: the heat capacity of the mass, the total wall R-value, andthe location of the insulation (outside, integral, or inside). The heatcapacity ranges from 4 to 20 (Btu/hr*ft\2\*anddegrees;F). The heat capacityis only for the massive material and does not include other materials inthe wall.To assist the bidder (proposer), a section would be added to the User'sManual with tabular data for the heat capacities and R-values of materialscommonly used in heavy-weight walls. This information was obtained fromthe ASHRAE Handbook, 1985 Fundamentals Volume. The bidder (proposer) woulduse the appropriate numbers from the ASHRAE Handbook tables and a worksheetin the User's Manual to calculate the wall R-value and the heat capacity.B. New Window DataNew energy data would be incorporated into the COSTSAFR program for allsite-built prototype window glazing options. This includes clear, heatabsorbing, and reflective glazings. Low-E glass would also be added tothe program. The sun- tempered (formerly passive solar) section would becompletely redone with new data. The moveable insulation energy data wouldremain unchanged.The energy data were generated by LBL in the form of regression equationsfor each of the 45 base locations and for both heating and cooling seasons.The energy load was split into two components: A conductive load and asolar load. For the conductive load, DOE-2.1 simulations were done forall site-built prototypes and locations, with equally distributed windowshaving a shading coefficient of 1.00 and an area 12% of the total floorarea. Window U-values of 1.10, 0.49, and 0.10 were simulated. The thermalintegrity of other components of the building were held at levels consistentwith the window levels. Parameters such as the thermostat set points andinternal gains were identical to the conditions in the simulations forthe original residential housing data base (Interim Federal ResidentialStandard Technical Support Document).The conductive loads are a function of the window U-value with the windowarea as a multiplier. The regression equation for the conductive load is:<ITAG tagnum="20">Equation 1.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CONDUCTIVE LOAD = AREA*(U<T2>1</T2>*C<T2>1</T2>*24hrs+U\2\*C<T2>2</T2>*576[24hrs\2\])</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">C<T2>1</T2> and C<T2>2</T2> are the regression coefficients, U is the U- value, and AREAis the window area. </ITAG>The solar load was determined by a set of 52 parametric simulations forthe ranch prototype in each of the 45 base locations. The shading coefficientwas varied from 1.00 to 0.00 and the total window area ranged from 8% to20% of the total floor area. Window areas in the four cardinal orientationswere varied from 1% to 14% of the floor area. A quadratic multi-variantregression equation was developed as a result of the simulations:<ITAG tagnum="20">Equation 2.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">SOLAR LOAD = ZETA*(1+C<T2>7</T2>*ZETA)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Equation 3.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">with ZETA = (C<T2>3</T2>*n+C<T2>4</T2>*e+C<T2>5</T2>*s*C<T2>6</T2>*w)*AREA*SC</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Where: C</ITAG><T2>3</T2>.....C<T2>7</T2> are regression coefficients<ITAG tagnum="26">SC = Shading coefficient (depends on layers)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">n,e,s,w = fraction of glazing with north, east, south, and west orientation,respectively. </ITAG>The total window energy load is simply a combination of the conductiveload and the solar load: <ITAG tagnum="20">Equation 4.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">WINDOW LOAD = CONDUCTIVE LOAD + SOLAR LOAD</ITAG>Data were produced by Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) for all the windowoptions from the window regression equations. WINDOW-2, a one dimensionalheat transfer computer program developed by LBL, that determines the shadingcoeeficient and U- value of the glass based on the weather conditions,the number of layers, the thickness of the air space, and the glass properties,was used to generate the U-values and shading coefficients for the varioustypes of glass. Glazing thermal and optical properties were obtained frommanufacturer product informa ation and the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals.Weather conditions for the heating season data consisted of 30anddegrees;Foutside temperature, 70anddegrees;F inside temperature, 10 mph outside airspeed, and no solar load (night time conditions). Cooling season weatherconditions were taken from the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals.The COSTSAFR compliance form format would be changed for the sun-tempered(formerly passive solar) section and a new low-E section. The main windowsection (E) in the compliance forms would be unchanged. This section wouldcontain the points for clear glass with equal areas in the four cardinaldirections with both conductive load and solar load incorporated. The heatabsorbing and reflective sections would also remain unchanged. The sectionfor low-E glazing would have the same format as the heat absorbing andreflective sections (i.e., modifying the points for clear glass).The new sun-tempered section would modify the window points for differentglazing area percentages in the cardinal directions. The points from thissection would be in addition to the points from the clear glass section.Due to the nature of the solar load equations, the point system user wouldhave to use three sets of equations in the sun-tempered section. First,they would enter the desired window areas (as a fraction of the total windowarea) in the four cardinal directions (see equations below). In the secondequation, the preliminary numbers are modified by the shading coefficientand the window area (as a fraction of the floor area). A table with shadingcoefficients for the different glass types would be provided in the User'sManual. The third set of calculations gives the points for the sun-tempereddesign. These calculations would be found as part of the COSTSAFR complianceform.<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert illus. 1</ITAG>C. Alternate Compliance Procedure.The standard method of compliance for the interim standards is with theuse of the COSTSAFR computer program and the compliance forms it produces.While this program covers a wide range of energy conservation options (ECOs),it does not have the ability to consider some unusual or innovative designs.Therefore, an alternate means of compliance is offered for such designs.The alternate method must be able to accommodate different designs, materials,and construction techniques, and yet remain consistent with the basic frameworkand economic assumptions of COSTSAFR.The COSTSAFR program is based upon energy data calculated by DOE-2.1 simulationsfor seven general house designs built with specific materials and by specificconstruction practices. DOE- 2.1 is a computerized and verified analysisand research tool developed by DOE and widely used by building design groups.COSTSAFR includes ECOs such as insulation levels, window options, fivetypes of heating equipment, and two types of water heating. If bidders(proposers) on a new Federal housing project choose to propose housingwith unique energy conservation design features, not included in COSTSAFR,then the alternate compliance method shall be necessary.To be consistent with the energy data base used by COSTSAFR, the alternatemethod uses DOE-2.1 simulations to calculate the yearly space conditioningenergy loads for the proposed house. The yearly load is adjusted by equipmentefficiency and fuel escalation rates to obtain the life cycle cost (LCC)for energy. To comply with the interim standards, the DOE-2.1 calculatedLCC of the proposed design would have to be equal to or less than the ``optimal''energy LCC calculated by COSTSAFR for the house type with the closest design.The optimal LCC has the combination of ECOs that produce the lowest total25 year life cycle cost.The Federal agency will run the COSTSAFR program and produce the complianceforms that are used to calculate the total life cycle energy cost. Necessaryinput for the COSTSAFR program includes:* price escalations and area cost multipliers;* housing location;* allowable foundations types;* the house type closest to the proposed design;* allowable HVAC equipment; and* applicable energy prices.The optimal life cycle energy cost would be determined by an EstimatedUnit Energy Cost equation in the compliance form. The optimal space conditioning,domestic hot water heating (DHW), and appliance (refrigerators and freezers)points along with the conditioned floor area would then be entered intothe appropriate equation, depending on the number of bedrooms in the design.The Estimated Unit Energy Cost would then be multiplied by 100 to obtainthe total discounted LCC for energy in dollars. This number would be providedto the bidder (proposer) as the goal for compliance to the interim standards.The bidder (proposer) would also be provided with the DHW and refrigerator/freezersection of the compliance forms.The bidder (proposer) would then run the DOE-2.1 simulation program withassumptions equivalent to the assumptions used in COSTSAFR wherever possible.(DOE-2.1, and not other similar computer programs such as BLAST, must beused to insure consistency in calculation procedures.) This includes usingthe same thermostat set points: 78anddegrees;F for cooling, 70anddegrees;Ffor heating, and a night setback of 60anddegrees;F for 12 PM to 6 AM. Windowshading, venting, and internal gain schedules would have to be consistentwith those used by COSTSAFR. DOE would provide an input file that specifiesthe input parameters that would be used by the bidder (proposer). The mostaccurate climate data available would have to be used. Either TRY (TestReference Year) or WYEC (Weather Year for Energy Conservation) climatedata would be recommended.The bidder (proposer) would then divide the DOE-2.1 calculated loads bythe efficiencies of the proposed HVAC equipment to determine the absoluteenergy loads. The bidder (proposer) would use the same efficiency measuresfound in COSTSAFR unless a Federal agency permits the use of other comparablemeasures for equipment not rated by existing Federally-approved methods.The load would then be multiplied by the appropriate fuel cost to obtainthe first year energy cost.Next, the first year energy cost would be adjusted to the 25 year lifecycle energy cost by multiplying by the Uniform Present Worth (UPW). Theproduct of the first year cost and the UPW gives the life cycle cost (seeequation 1). The proper UPW depends on the geographical region and thefuel type, and is provided by COSTSAFR in the input values that are printedat the end of each printout of the point system. The LCC would then bedetermined for both heating and cooling.<ITAG tagnum="26">Equation 1.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,0,0),tp0,p8,8/9,g1,t1,aw,s100,30</C><H1>Heating, Cooling Energy LCC =</H1><H1>Energy Load * Fuel Cost * UPW</H1><H2>Equipment Efficiency</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>The bidder (proposer) would also calculate water heating and refrigerator/freezerenergy LCCs by filling out the appropriate section of the COSTSAFR complianceforms.

If not,the proposed design must be modified until the energy cost criterion ismet.The bidder (proposer) would have to provide the Federal agency with thefollowing:* the DOE-2 Building Design Language (BDL) input file;* the DOE-2 output;* the DHW and Refrigerator/Freezer sections of the compliance forms; and* the proposed design's energy Life Cycle Cost with all calculations.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.

Procedural Requirements</ITAG>A. National Environmental Policy ActDOE prepared and issued an Environment Assesment (EA), DOE/EA-0300, forthe proposed interim standards under the Implementing Regulations of theCouncil of Environmental Quality for the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969, as amended. The EA addresses the possible incremental environmentalaffects attributable to the application of the proposed interim standardsto the design of Federal residential buildings. A Finding of No SignificantImpact (FONSI) was issued on April 17, 1976. DOE has determined that theproposed modification to the interim standards does not affect the assumptionsor results of the EA, and that the original FONSI is still valid.B. Executive Order No. 12291Section 3 of Executive Order No. 12291, 46 FR 13193, February 19, 1981,requires that DOE determine whether a proposed rule is a ``major rule,''as defined by section 1(b) of that Order, and prepare a preliminary regulatoryimpact analysis for rules which fall within that definition.DOE reviewed the Final Interim Rule, completed an ``Economic Analysis,''51 FR 29770, August 20, 1986, and concluded that the Final Interim Rulewas not a ``major rule'' under this Executive Order. DOE has determinedthat today's proposed amendments to the Final Interim Rule do not constitutea ``major rule'' either, because the amendments will not result in an annualaffect on the economy of $100 million or more, or certain other effectslisted in the Order. The amendments to the final interim rule will allowalternative credit for three massive wall configurations, new window glassoptions, and alternative compliance procedures that will allow utilizationof innovative designs and energy conservation options not presently foundin the computer program.Given the relatively small number of residential buildings affected bythe Final Interim Rule, as well as the optional nature of the proposedmodifications, DOE has determined that the modifications will not havesufficient effects such as to constitute a ``major rule'' within the meaningof Executive Order No. 12291.The proposed modifications to the Final Interim Rule was submitted to theDirector of the Office of Management and Budget for a 10 day review periodas required by section 3 (c)(3) of Executive Order No. 12291. The Directorhas concluded his review under that Executive Order.C. Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603, 604) requires DOE to considerthe effect its rulemaking will have on small business in the nation. DOEhas considered today's proposed modifications in light of DOE's analysisof the small business impacts of the Final Interim Rule, (51 FR 29700,August 20, 1986), including its impacts upon manufacturers of buildingand construction materials and equipment, architects, builders, constructioncompanies. These modifications are minimal, and by creating new optionsallowing for credit for certain configurations for massive walls, new windowglazing materials, and alternative compliance procedures for utilizationof innovative designs and energy conservation, will not increase the effectsof the Final Interim Rule to such a degree as to activate the provisionsof the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Consequently, pursuant to section 605(b)of that Act, DOE certifies that this proposed rulemaking will not havea significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.D. Paperwork Reduction ActNo information collection or record keeping requirements are imposed onthe public by these modifications to the Final Interim Rule. Accordingly,authorizations are not required under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>, as amended, or its implementing regulations, 5 CFR Part132.For the reasons set out in this preamble, 10 CFR Part 435 is proposed tobe amended as set forth below. <ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, August 2, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donna R.
