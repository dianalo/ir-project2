The proposed amendment would increase the feesand charges assessed by the Department for providing inspection and certificationof quota tobacco, the establishment of standards, and other services. Thefee would cover the increased cost of operating the program, includingadministrative and supervisory costs. Authority for these regulations iscontained in the Tobacco Inspection Act (7 U.S.C. 511-511q). The current fee of $.0055 per pound has been in effect since July 1, 1982,as published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(47 FR 51722) on June 23, 1982.The Department conducts a yearly review of the financial status of thisprogram to determine whether the fee is sufficient. Receipts for the 1988-89marketing season were approximately $7,875,000. Anticipated expenses forthat period are approximately $9,252,000. For the past three seasons, theincreased costs of the tobacco inspection program forced the departmentto draw upon funds in that program's reserve account. the major factorscausing the need for additional funds are increases in Government salaries,including a special salary rate for tobacco graders which was effectiveOctober 30, 1988, and increases in travel allowances and overall administrativecosts since 1982. An analysis of data available to the Department indicatesthat a fee of $.0067 per pound would cover expenses and maintain a reservethat would meet any reasonable contingency. Information on program incomeand expenses was presented to the National Advisory Committee for TobaccoInspection Services at its meeting on March 7, 1989, in Washington, DC.The National Advisory Committee, made up of 14 representatives from tobaccoproducer interest groups, was established under the Tobacco InspectionAct to advise the Secretary of Agriculture on the fees to be assessed,level of inspection service, and other related matters. The Committee adopteda motion, by a vote of eleven in favor and two opposed, to recommend tothe Secretary an increase in the fee to $.0070 per pound. However, basedon a recalculation of pounds under quota for the coming marketing season,a fee of $.0067 per pound is being proposed.The marketing season for tobacco does not coincide with the Federal fiscalyear. It is contemplated that the increased rate would be made effectiveon July 1, 1989, so as to treat all types of tobacco on an equal basis.This rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures established to implementExecutive Order 12291 and Departmental Regulation 1512-1 and has been determinedto be a ``nonmajor rule'' because it does not meet any of the criteriaestablished for major rules under the Executive order.Additionally, in conformance with the provisions of Pub. L. 96-354, theRegulatory Flexibility Act, full consideration has been given to the potentialeconomic impact upon small business. Most of the firms which would be affectedby this rule are small businesses. Small agricultural producers have beendefined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.2) as those havinggross annual revenues for the last three years of less than $500,000, andsmall agricultural service firms are defined as those whose gross annualreceipts are less than $3,500,000. The Administrator, Agricultural MarketingService, has determined that this action would not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule wouldnot substantially affect the normal movement of the commodity in the marketplace.Compliance with this proposed rule would not impose substantial directeconomic costs, recordkeeping, or personnel workload changes on small entities,and would not alter the market share or competitive positions of smallentities relative to the large entities and would in no way affect normalcompetition in the marketplace. Furthermore, the Department is requiredby law to fix and collect fees and charges to cover the Department's costin operating the tobacco inspection program.All persons who desire to submit written data, views, or arguments forconsideration in connection with this proposal may file them with the Director,Tobacco Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, United States Departmentof Agriculture, Room 502 Annex Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC,20090-6456, not later than June 2, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 29</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Tobacco.Accordingly, the department proposes to amend the regulations under theTobacco Inspection Act contained in 7 CFR part 29 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 29_TOBACCO INSPECTION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Regulations</ITAG>1.
