It happened in the 1970s when the government panicked itself into an &quot;energy crisis,&quot; and it is happening again. Ronald Reagan's top energy officials are crying about &quot;America's dependence on unstable sources of foreign oil&quot; and &quot;national security.&quot; The small saving grace of this phenomenon, however, is that it usually generates unintended comedy. This time it is Secretary of the Interior Don Hodel's fight with the caribou lobby.    On Monday Secretary Hodel recommended that Congress open to oil exploration 1.5 million acres along 104 miles of Alaska's coast on the Beaufort Sea (the only thing north of there is Santa Claus's home, the North Pole). The Interior Department estimates at least 600 million barrels and possibly as much as 9.2 billion barrels could be recovered. But environmental groups are asking, What about the threat to the Porcupine caribou herd? A representative of the Wilderness Society charged yesterday that &quot;Hodel is simply ignoring and reversing the findings of the top 13 caribou researchers in North America, who came together and affirmed the importance of the core-calving area.&quot;    Perhaps only in Washington would you find people with the inclination or time to argue at length about holding up exploration for 600 million barrels of oil to save a &quot;core-calving area.&quot; Not that everyone outside Washington can escape this nonsense. Environmentalism's left wing imposed 55-miles-per-hour speed limits and teensy-weensy cars on the nation. We take little comfort, then, in now seeing a conservative administration pushing its own nutty energy ideas as a way to obtain tax breaks for oil firms.    Opening up potential domestic U.S. oil reserves to exploration makes obvious sense. But why are Mr. Hodel and Secretary of Energy John Herrington trying to resurrect another &quot;energy crisis&quot;? Mr. Hodel has warned of lines at the gas pumps in &quot;two to five years.&quot; Mr. Herrington recently warned that the U.S. could be importing half of its oil by the 1990s (up from 33% at present). This poses a &quot;clear risk&quot; for national security. So Mr. Herrington asked the White House to propose a 27.5% annual depletion allowance for new oil wells and wells using &quot;enhanced-recovery&quot; methods.    What's in fact happening is that since President Reagan fully decontrolled oil in January 1981, the price mechanism has functioned efficiently -- but not in a way that pleases some U.S. oil producers and their Washington allies. Prices fell from nearly $40 a barrel. Prices have rebounded to about $18 a barrel, but oil lobbyists claim that prices aren't high enough to encourage new domestic exploration and development. So they want the federal government to intervene again -- in the name of &quot;national security.&quot;    The security warnings are a red herring. Given the amount of fuel available from Mexico, Canada and other nearby sources, it would be hard to imagine any oil threat that would put U.S. security at risk. It is indeed cheaper at this point to buy oil in the Middle East than it is to find it and pump it in the U.S. But that has been true for years. What we have learned in the 1980s is that oil-producing nations have a greater stake in selling their oil than the U.S. has in being able to buy it.    Messrs. Hodel and Herrington have advocated energy deregulation policies that are our best guarantee of plentiful energy. They should continue to do so, using whatever energy is left over to solve the caribou crisis. </TEXT></DOC>
