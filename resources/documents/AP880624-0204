The protest provoked a skirmish with American patrol boats, whoused hoses to douse anti-nuclear activists on the small craft.Greenpeace said the protest was to highlight claims thatnuclear-tipped Tomahawk sea-launched cruise missiles have beendeployed at the base.   The Greenpeace ship Sirius entered the base and launched twosmall rubber craft toward the moored submarine tender Frank Cable.Protesters then attached a large yellow float emblazoned with thewords ``Nuclear Free Seas'' to the ship's anchor chain, accordingto Steve Morgan, a British photographer recording the event forGreenpeace.   Two U.S. tugboats, one Italian tugboat, and three patrol boats _two American and one Italian _ moved in, according to a statementissued by the group in Rome.   The U.S. patrol boats doused two women on the yellow submarinewith fire hoses and rammed the float. Boathooks and knives wereused to puncture it and untie it from the Frank Cable, said Morgan.   He said the women braved the hose blasts and retied the partlydeflated float to the tender. But they were finally forced topaddle the crippled craft back to the mother ship.   There were no arrests or injuries, the group said.   Officials of the U.S. embassy in Rome had no comment on theepisode other than to acknowledge that it occurred. No one answeredthe phone at the base commander's office at La Maddalena.   A Greenpeace spokesman, Mike Ross, said the action was promptedby evidence obtained by researchers in Washington allegedly provingthat the Frank Cable has been carrying nuclear-tipped Tomahawkcruise missile since 1985.   A U.S. Navy spokesman in Naples, Lt. David Morris, said it isU.S. policy neither to confirm nor deny the presence of nuclearweapons on any naval vessel.   Former Italian Defense Minister Giovanni Spadolini has deniedthese allegations since they began to surface in 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
