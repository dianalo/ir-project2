In particular, the fragment excitation energy is consideredas a function of time after scission on the basis of different assumptions.It is shown that the fraction of neutrons evaporated during fragmentacceleration and their energy and angular distribution are very sensitiveto the time behaviour of the dissipation of deformation energy. The resultsare discussed with regard to studies of emission mechanisms and investigationsof the competition between fission and neutron emission in the case ofhighly excited fissionable nuclei.</TEXT></DOC>
