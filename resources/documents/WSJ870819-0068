As Britain's most famous lawyer, he's defended the famous and infamous, the rich and the very rich.    Now, Mr. Alexander faces one of the toughest challenges of his career: defending the notion that the City -- the financial district tarnished by recent insider-trading and share-fraud scandals -- should be allowed to continue regulating itself. As chairman of Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, the body of financial institutions that regulates takeover dealings in Britain, Mr. Alexander is the major defender of the self-regulatory system.    The panel so far has escaped the tightened statutory regime imposed on other rule makers in the City. To convince the government and an increasingly skeptical public that it should remain that way, Mr. Alexander must prove the City can effectively and honestly regulate itself.    If he fails, the system likely will be replaced with new securities laws. &quot;It won't be very long before we go to a more legalistic framework,&quot; says Michael Stallibrass, an executive director at Shearson Lehman Brothers International here. &quot;The perception outside the City is that the panel is responsible for people behaving properly.&quot;    Britain's takeover regulatory system &quot;is up for grabs,&quot; says Leo Herzel, a partner at Mayer, Brown andamp; Platt in Chicago. &quot;If they have another scandal or two, they are going to go to statutory regulation.&quot; Adds George Law, the director at the merchant bank Morgan Grenfell andamp; Co. responsible for legal compliance: &quot;Within the next five years it is quite possible that there will be a major scandal&quot; that will lead to regulation by statute.    Operating from a small office at London's stock exchange, the panel is staffed with roughly two dozen people drawn from the banks, brokers and big financial institutions it polices. Critics say it is a classic case of foxes policing the chicken coop, but Mr. Alexander disagrees.    &quot;Most of us feel that those things that went wrong in the City went wrong before new rules were introduced,&quot; he says. Self-regulation will work, he says, if &quot;we are as firm as the system demands.&quot;    The panel has never been busier than in the past 18 months, when it supervised #35.43 billion ($57 billion) in acquisitions, according to Acquisitions Monthly, a British magazine. London's securities firms are pledged to abide by the panel's decisions and its rules, known as the Takeover Code. The panel has almost unlimited discretion on how to apply the rules.    The code aims to ensure &quot;good standards of commercial behavior&quot; in takeovers, and its rules differ from U.S. securities laws in some important ways. For example, it usually requires bidders who want more than 29.9% of a target to make an offer for the entire company, a rule that generally protects small investors. Other rules limit such defensive tactics as &quot;poison pills,&quot; devices aimed at making hostile takeovers prohibitively expensive.    In the bygone clubbish world of the City, the lack of legal power made little difference: The panel ruled by intimidation. Its main weapon was its ability to freeze an offender out of the London markets. &quot;Life could get difficult if you ran afoul of the panel in the past,&quot; says Mr. Stallibrass. Those given the cold shoulder found that finance dried up and merchant banks refused to provide advice.    But in today's competitive world, &quot;why should an American investment bank care about getting rapped on the knuckles by these guys?&quot; asks an executive at a U.S. investment bank here. With so many international firms competing for business, even ostracized companies can get new issues floated and deals done.    Moreover, the panel has been viewed as wishy-washy. Members recall only a handful of occasions in the past few years when someone was declared persona non grata, the harshest sanction. Even that penalty sometimes was ineffective. In one case, a banned financier was allowed to return to the City; he then repeated his offenses. The lax stance led many firms &quot;to chance it, see if you can get away with it, and the chances are you will,&quot; says Robert Pennington, a professor of commercial law at the University of Birmingham.    The April appointment of Mr. Alexander was intended to toughen the panel's image, an effort some say was hurt by his defense of Mr. Collier, the investment banker who pleaded guilty last month to insider trading. Mr. Collier drew a lenient one-year suspended sentence and #25,000 ($40,000) fine. Mr. Alexander responds that he had a professional obligation to defend Mr. Collier, whom he took on as a client before his appointment to the panel.    Mr. Alexander doesn't shy away from controversy. He successfully defended the prime minister's controversial ban on unions at security installations. Last month, he won a #500,000 libel award for Jeffrey Archer, the novelist and politician, from a newspaper that said he had an affair with a prostitute.    Under Mr. Alexander, the panel has increased regulation. It has imposed fuller disclosure requirements. Other new rules will prohibit firms from representing persons or companies &quot;not likely&quot; to comply with takeover rules.    Mr. Alexander says his priority is to restore the panel's &quot;firm&quot; approach to regulation. &quot;We have to make sure that people are not overregulated, but we have to have the regulations in place and enforce them appropriately and where necessary vigorously,&quot; he says. Shearson's Mr. Stallibrass expects the physically and intellectually imposing Mr. Alexander, 50 years old, to return &quot;a bit of the intimidation&quot; lost by the panel.    Mr. Alexander argues that Britain's self-regulatory system has advantages over the American system. The British system &quot;gives us greater flexibility&quot; than America's statutory regulation, he says. &quot;We can change the rules very quickly if we need to,&quot; he adds, which means &quot;we don't have someone looking for a little way around the rules as soon as they come out.&quot;    Moreover, Britain's self-regulatory framework means there is much less litigation in U.K. takeover bids. Because the panel is staffed largely by deal makers on leave from City firms, regulation is up-to-date and effective, he claims. &quot;You don't have bureaucrats running around on the one side and City people on the other,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
