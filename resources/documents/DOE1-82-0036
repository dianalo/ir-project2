These studies have indicated that a barrage having an installedcapacity of some 500-600 MW or greater appears likely to be feasible,and to have the potential for producing energy at costs which would becompetitive with any alternative tidal energy source in the UK. Sucha barrage could also provide significant non-energy benefits, althoughevaluation of these awaits further studies. The environmental and navigationaspects are briefly outlined, and the estimated construction costs, programmesand economics for two alternative sites are summarised.</TEXT></DOC>
