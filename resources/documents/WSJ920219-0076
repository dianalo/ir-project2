(FDC)TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The government is taking the first steptoward a long-debated plan that would rescue not onlydepositors of failing savings-and-loans and banks, but alsotheir owners.   Proponents of the proposal contend that it would lightenthe load for taxpayers by tackling sick institutions beforethey become deeply insolvent. The plan, however, wouldn'twipe out the interests of current shareholders, as isnormally the case in a government takeover, so the plan, ineffect, would assist owners of the failing institutions.</LP><TEXT>   Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift Supervisionand the leading supporter of the plan, said that offeringgovernment assistance to failing thrifts, without a takeover,would keep local economies stable and expand credit access.&quot;The government liquidation process has had, I think, a veryserious effect on regional economies and maybe the country'seconomy,&quot; he asserted.   While regulators have aired the possibility beforeCongress for months, they signaled their intention to pursuethe proposal by publishing its broad outlines, probably laterthis week. The board that oversees the Sandamp;L cleanup hasscheduled a hearing on the plan next month.   Even considering a plan that would protect the interestsof owners of troubled thrifts would have been unthinkable ayear ago, when outrage was intense over the $220 billion(exclusive of interest) Sandamp;L mess. Now, however, the plan isone measure of the anxiety in Congress and governmentagencies about the weak economy and the credit shortage. Therecent banking bill included a nonbinding resolution advisingregulators to seek &quot;early resolutions&quot; of failinginstitutions if they saved money in the long run.   &quot;I think this is deja vu all over again,&quot; said Eric Hemel,thrift and banking analyst at First Boston Corp. and a formergovernment thrift agency economist. He said he doubted thatin the long run the government would save money on such&quot;early assisted mergers.&quot;   Under the plan, a troubled, but not insolvent, thriftwould agree to merge with another institution, with thegovernment providing cash to cover a capital shortage orshore up bad loans. To induce the owners of the troubledthrift to agree to the merger, the shareholders' equity wouldbe diluted, but wouldn't be wiped out entirely.   Albert Casey, the chief executive officer of theResolution Trust Corp., which sells failed Sandamp;Ls and theirassets, is skeptical about the plan and, in particular, itsfairness. &quot;Do you save just the big ones or spend the moneyto save more modest-sized, worthwhile institutions in smallercommunities?&quot; he asked. &quot;It's a very disturbing thing.&quot;   But the plan would solve a huge problem for Mr. Ryan.Under the law passed in 1989, the Sandamp;L cleanup agency willcease taking control of failed Sandamp;Ls in about 18 months. Afterthat, the industry-funded Savings Association Insurance Fund,or SAIF, will absorb losses on all thrift failures. But ifany of several large, troubled California thrifts, includingCalFed Inc. and Glenfed Inc., failed, their losses wouldimmediately swamp the SAIF fund.   &quot;The window to the Treasury closes next year,&quot; Mr. Ryansaid. &quot;I don't want to transfer institutions to the SAIFwhich have terminal conditions.&quot;   William Seidman, former chairman of the Federal DepositInsurance Corp., said regulators should have the authority toprotect shareholders at certain institutions. But heenvisions the plan as having limited use -- only for a selectfew large Sandamp;Ls. He conceded that choosing those Sandamp;Ls would bedifficult. &quot;Everyone and his brother will want to get underthat umbrella,&quot; he said. &quot;It's like you're dying and theyinvent a new drug.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
