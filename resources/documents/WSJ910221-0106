While Occidental's decision to pull out has gainedsupport from some senior Chinese officials, others in Beijingaren't so cooperative.   Total investment in the mine, in the northern province ofShanxi, is $750 million. Occidental holds 25% through IslandCreek of China Coal Ltd., which owns half of the mine'sshares. Island Creek is a 50-50 joint venture betweenOccidental and a unit of Bank of China. The other half isdivided between China National Coal Development Corp. andChina International Trust andamp; Investment Corp.   Occidental wants a speedy resolution of the matter partlyto limit its losses from the venture, which last year totaled$31 million. The company already has announced that it wouldwrite off the $250 million book value of the investment.   Occidental's withdrawal hinges mainly on getting either aforeign party or the Chinese government to buy its stake. Theprospects for the former are dim, given the mine's size, itspublicized problems, and weak outlook for international coalprices. The latter possibility is less desirable because theChinese aren't likely to make an attractive offer forOccidental's stake. If both avenues fail, the partners maydecide to liquidate the venture.                                                                                                          PROFITS LIKELY TO DROP IN JAPAN                                                                                                          Pretax earnings by Japan's corporations are likely todecline in the fiscal year beginning April 1 for the firsttime in five years as manufacturers suffer from higher costsand sluggish demand. Based on a survey of 178 companies,Sanwa Bank Ltd. predicts that pretax earnings will drop 3.8%in the fiscal year. Manufacturers' profits are expected todrop 10%, while non-manufacturers are expected to report again of 8.5%.                                                                                                          QUEBEC TO LIMIT SALE OF TOBACCO                                                                                                          The Quebec Order of Pharmacists, a regulatory body, bannedthe sale of tobacco in all drugstores in the province. Thenew rule, which requires ratification by the Quebecgovernment, would be the first such ban in Canada and isscheduled to take effect April 23. The ban includespharmacies and &quot;adjacent premises&quot; and prohibits pharmacistsfrom selling tobacco products &quot;directly or indirectly.&quot;                                                                                                          ADIDAS EXPANDS IN EUROPE                                                                                                          German sportswear group Adidas AG has formed subsidiariesin Poland and Czechoslovakia to meet demand for its productsin those markets. Adidas already has own-label shops inBudapest and is planning to set up the same type of franchisenetworks in Warsaw and Prague. Adidas produces shoes in bothcountries and expects to export 400,000 shoes from Poland anda million pairs from Czechoslovakia this year.                                                                                                          SHIPBUILDERS STRIKE IN GERMANY                                                                                                          Thousands of workers staged warning strikes in what oncewas East Germany's vibrant shipbuilding region, as officialsdebated whether to shut down money-losing companies. Some28,000 of 47,000 jobs in the shipyards and related businessesare expected to be cut. Strikes hit all the key shipbuildingcenters, including Schwerin, Rostock and Stralsund.                                                                                                          CHOCOLATE POISONED IN JAPAN                                                                                                          Japanese police have found 14 chocolate bars laced withinsecticide after threats were sent to the manufacturer. Theinsecticide could be deadly if taken in large amounts, but sofar police have had no reports of poisoning. Confectionaryconcern Meiji Seika Kaisha received a letter from a groupaccusing companies of squeezing money from consumers. Itlater received a phone call from a person who said chocolatebars had been injected with insecticide, but a companyspokesman said no demands had been made for cash. Policefound the poisoned chocolate in two supermarkets, one inTokyo and one in Chiba City, just outside Tokyo.                                                                                                          EC PROPOSES INSURANCE RULES                                                                                                          Consumers and companies will be allowed to buy and tradelife insurance throughout the European Community under a newproposal by the EC Commission.   For the consumer, the directive would mean greater choiceand lower prices. And while insurance firms would faceincreased competition, they would gain greater freedom inselling their products and investing their assets.   Under the proposal, any company licensed to sell lifeinsurance anywhere in the community would be allowed to offerthe same product throughout the EC, without furtherbureaucratic hassle.   Restrictions on what kind of policy can be offered in whatcountry would be replaced by commonly accepted standards.Price controls and rules that oblige insurance firms toinvest a certain percentage of their assets in localsecurities or government bonds would be abolished.
