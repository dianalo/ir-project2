Mr. Buthelezi, who claimsthat his Inkatha organization represents the nation's 7million Zulus, resisted every request from the Pretoriagovernment to negotiate so long as Nelson Mandela wasimprisoned. Never modest, Mr. Buthelezi now says, &quot;I haveprobably done more than any other single black leader tocreate circumstances in which you {Mr. Mandela} couldeventually be released.&quot; Nevertheless, this history is nothelping him with Mr. Mandela. On at least 50 occasions, Mr.Buthelezi has called on Mr. Mandela to meet with him, but thevisit has never come about.   Mr. Mandela's African National Congress appears to haveinstigated the current round of violence, in which nearly 800people have been killed in and around Johannesburg over thepast two months. The violence began on July 22, when ANCsupporters gathered outside a stadium where Zulu hosteldwellers were holding a legal Inkatha rally, and threw stonesand petrol bombs at them. After the rally, police escortedseven busloads of Zulus back to their hostel, where they wereambushed: At least 19 people died that day. Ever since, bothsides have justified their atrocities as &quot;self-defense.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Some of the tension between the ANC and Mr. Buthelezioriginates in the chief's strenuous opposition tointernational sanctions against South Africa. Mr. Buthelezisaid in 1988, &quot;What {the people} want is economic,educational and social upliftment, not poverty, ignorance anddisease. They want jobs, not hunger.&quot; When Mobil Oil pulledout of South Africa last year, he said: &quot;Every act ofwithdrawal is seen by us as a vote in favor of revolution.&quot;   But Mr. Buthelezi is no stooge for apartheid. As chiefminister of the homeland &quot;state&quot; of KwaZulu, he refused toaccept &quot;independence,&quot; and he is credited with thwartingPretoria's plan to turn the 10 homelands into foreigncountries and thus deprive blacks of their South Africancitizenship. And he has steadfastly called for one-person,one-vote Western democracy.   What bothers the ANC, most of whose leaders belong to theXhosa tribe, is that Mr. Buthelezi wants South Africa to benot just ruled by the black majority, but to enjoy a freeenterprise economy with lots of checks and balances ongovernment. During his meeting with President Bush earlierthis year, Mr. Buthelezi criticized the ANC's insistence on a&quot;one-off, big-bang approach&quot; to negotiations with a&quot;winner-take-all&quot; victory. He frankly addresses white fears:&quot;We are not anti-white. We are just anti-apartheid.&quot;   &quot;Run-of-the-mill white South Africans, by and large,prefer Buthelezi, compared with the radical elements in theANC and the South African Communist Party,&quot; says HelenSuzman, a leading anti-apartheid activist who retired lastyear after 36 years in parliament. &quot;I'm considered theclassical liberal,&quot; says Zach de Beer, leader of theDemocratic Party, &quot;but he's never made a policy statement Ididn't agree with.&quot;   &quot;He is far more realistic than the ANC,&quot; Mrs. Suzman says.&quot;He has a far better understanding of the urgent necessityfor economic growth and overseas investment here from runningan impoverished black area.&quot; The ANC flirts withnationalization, but Mr. Buthelezi has resoundingly rejectedit. &quot;I do not talk the language of nationalization because itis fatal talk.&quot; But he is a politician with a constituency toplease, a poor, black, rural constituency. He says thatownership of non-residential land is a &quot;privilege for thosewho can use it productively.&quot; He gives nods to a &quot;mixedeconomy,&quot; &quot;constructive redistribution of wealth&quot; and &quot;awhole range of support systems,&quot; although specifics have notbeen forthcoming.   Perhaps it is this vagueness that causes even Mr.Buthelezi's ardent admirers to have reservations about theman. His personality is part of the problem: &quot;He's the mostprickly, hypersensitive man I've ever known,&quot; Mr. de Beersays. When he visited exiled ANC leaders in Zambia, Mr. deBeer asked them whether they opposed Mr. Buthelezi because heled KwaZulu and was therefore a &quot;bantustan puppet&quot;? No, theyreplied, what bothered them was Mr. Buthelezi's insistence onreminding everyone of his royal blood. (He traces hisancestry to Shaka, founder of the Zulu nation.) &quot;They toldme, `he wants to be treated like a god, and we won't do it.'&quot;   It's well known in the South African press that any storyabout Mr. Buthelezi that even hints at criticism comes in forat least a blistering attack, if not a lawsuit. A few daysafter David Webster, a white leftist activist, was gunneddown in front of his home last year, Mr. Buthelezi wrote toone publication to attack Mr. Webster for calling Inkatha a&quot;Contra-type organization.&quot; Mr. Buthelezi did, at least,apologize for his timing.   &quot;I'd say there is a bottomless contempt for Buthelezi innewsrooms, but it's never reflected in publications,&quot; saysStephen Robinson, a London Daily Telegraph correspondent whowrote what he thought was a positive piece on Mr. Buthelezithat appeared in Frontline magazine. But Mr. Buthelezi suedfor defamation. &quot;South African newspapers always cave in onButhelezi.&quot; So Denis Beckett, the editor and publisher ofFrontline, decided to fight Mr. Buthelezi in court. Mr.Beckett and Frontline lost. &quot;And he didn't have the bloodygrace to relinquish the 12,000 rand $4,700 fine,&quot; Mr.Beckett says.   Like other journalists, Mr. Beckett fears that Mr.Buthelezi is schizophrenic in his belief in non-totalitarianideals. &quot;One minute he can be quite genuine about wantingmulti-party democracy and the next minute, if someone standsup in the KwaZulu legislature and says they oppose Inkatha,he says, `Stick it, man.'&quot;   Above all, Mr. Buthelezi hates to be marginalized orignored. &quot;Inkatha is now a force to be dealt with that cannotbe wished away,&quot; he says. &quot;We have a role to play which wewill play, come hell or high water.&quot; That statement is thecore of his supporters' defense of Mr. Buthelezi.   &quot;We're not saying he's a libertarian,&quot; says RussellCrystal, executive director of the South African branch ofthe International Freedom Foundation, a free-market thinktank based in Washington. But, Mr. Crystal adds, &quot;asocio-economic reorganization is a must, and I believe hewill allow the market to do it.&quot;   Since February 2, when President F.W. de Klerk unbannedall political organizations, Mr. Buthelezi has had to competein the open market for supporters. That task is gettingharder as his rural Zulu people have been moving into theurban centers and joining the big trade unions, which aremostly ANC-aligned. He has been urged to modernize, to drophis royalist and tribal trappings, in an effort to appeal toyounger Zulus and to whites. The formation of the new InkathaFreedom Party is seen as a move to that direction.   So an old joke has begun re-circulating in South Africa:The definition of an optimist is a white man learning Zulu; apessimist is a white man learning Xhosa.   ---   Ms. Sullivan covers politics for the Johannesburg-basedFinancial Mail.
