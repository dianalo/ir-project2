<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-96-0050 </DOCNO><TEXT>The spectra of nine different glass optical fibres and one plastic opticalfibre have been measured over the spectral range 300 to 1800 nm, priorto and after irradiating with /sup 60/Co {gamma}-rays. For the majorityof fibres the total irradiation dose was several tens of kGy (severalMrad). All of the fibres studied were of the multimode type having acore diameter {ge} 100 {mu}m and could, in principle, be used for datatransmission, remote spectroscopy or sensing applications. The majorityof fibres have 200 {mu}m diameter cores which are compatible with theHarwell 6000 series optical modules. The various fibres were found tohave quite different transmission characteristics in their unirradiatedstate. This combined with variations in their other optical propertiesmeans that no single fibre is best for all applications. After irradiationthe ultra-violet absorption edge moved towards longer wavelengths forall fibres, but by varying degrees. In many fibres a new absorption peakaround 600-630 nm was observed. The amount of radiation induced attenuationwas found to decrease with increasing wavelength beyond 700 nm for allfibres studied. Three glass fibres were shown to have particularly highlevels of attenuation after irradiation. The report also contains backgroundinformation on the different causes of attenuation in unirradiated opticalfibres.</TEXT></DOC>
