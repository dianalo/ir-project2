Analysts attributed Wednesday's rally largely to a bullish tradereport on oil production and to continued optimism that the13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will abideby its production-cutting pact that went into effect Jan. 1.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settledat $19.26 a barrel Wednesday, up 31 cents from Tuesday, when itgained 7 cents.   Wednesday's close was the highest since Nov. 3, 1987, when thenear-term contract settled on the exchange at $19.49 a barrel. Atthat time, there were concerns that the Iran-Iraq war couldseriously disrupt shipments of crude from the Persian Gulf.   Among refined contracts traded on the exchange Wednesday, theFebruary contract for home heating oil settled 1.56 cents higher at54.61 cents a gallon. The contract had fallen 0.11 cent on Tuesday.   February unleaded gasoline jumped 1.16 cents to settle at 52.26cents a gallon, after rising 0.19 cent Tuesday.   ``Traders are more confident in OPEC and they feel that OPEC willcontinue to get it together through the summer,'' said Bob Baker, anenergy analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   The oil cartel had agreed last fall to slash daily output to 18.5million barrels in an effort to prop up sagging worldwide oilprices. OPEC members have shown signs of sticking to that agreement,and prices have steadily risen since the first of the year.   Baker said a weekly report from the American Petroleum Instituteshowing a sharp decline in U.S. oil supplies also added a positivetone to the energy market Wednesday.   API, which represents the major U.S. oil producers and refiners,said oil imports last year jumped to the highest level since 1979.It said production fell to 8.1 million barrels a day, a nearly 3percent drop from 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
