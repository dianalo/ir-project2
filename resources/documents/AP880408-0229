Fort Worth-based Texas American and San Antonio-based NationalBancshares issued separate statements Thursday, labeling thediscussions as ``very preliminary.''   Bank officials would not say how much might be required from theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp.   ``We are not at the FDIC with a gun at our heads,'' said JosephM. Grant, Texas American chairman.   Grant said officials of the two banks, which began discussionslast fall, believe FDIC assistance is needed to attract capitalfrom investors.   Richard W. Calvert, chairman of National Bancshares, declined tosay why his bank believes it needs FDIC assistance.   If the two banks were combined, they would have $8 billion inassets ith 64 subsidiary banks and branches. Grant estimated thecompanies could save from combining duplicative support facilities.   According to 1987 figures released by the banks, Texas AmericanBancshares reported a net loss in income of $78 million last year,with $5.17 billion in assets and about $3.99 billion in loans.   National Bancshares Corp. of Texas reported a net loss of $64million last year, with assets of about $2.8 billion and $1.8billion in loans.   The companies' negotiations for federal assistance ``come as noreal surprise,'' said Paul Sachtleben, a former deputy regionaldirector of the FDIC who now works as a consultant at Bracewell andamp;Patterson, an Austin-based law firm.   ``Simply stated, you cannot raise capital today in Texas withoutFDIC assistance,'' Grant said.   In 1987, Republic Bank Corp. acquired InterFirst Corp., both ofDallas, and the companies did not request federal assistance. Thecombined First RepublicBank Corp. recently requested and received$1 billion from the FDIC to stem a runoff in deposits.   Dallas-based banking analyst Frank Anderson said the possiblemerger and federally assisted recapitalization of Texas Americanand National Bancshares ``puts the Texas banking industry that muchcloser to putting its problems behind it.''   Most of Texas American Bancshare's 25 subsidiary banks arelocated in Central and North Texas, including three units inDallas. National Bancshares' 12 subsidiary banks are located inCentral and South Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
