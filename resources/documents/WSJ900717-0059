Andthey might be able to pick up desirable airport gates androutes on the cheap.   Continental Airlines is generally considered too strappedto do much buying. United Airlines has the financial strengthat the moment, but is preoccupied with an on-again, off-againemployee-led buy-out attempt. And if the buy-out succeeds,United probably will have taken on too much debt to gobble upplanes or routes.   Opinion is divided on whether Northwest Airlines, recentlytaken private in a leveraged buy-out under the leadership ofAlfred A. Checchi, can afford to buy a rival major airline,or its assets.   Delta and American, by contrast, have decent balancesheets and can afford to buy planes or routes if they wish.Some money managers also like their stocks because they'rereasonably priced. Delta sells for only nine times the past12 months' per-share earnings. American sells for 12 timesearnings. Both multiples are below that of the average stock,reflecting the sluggish economy, fare wars and the industry'scyclical nature.   &quot;When some of the weaker sisters are left aside, the otherairlines will grow stronger,&quot; says Thomas Longman, airlineanalyst at Bear Stearns. It's &quot;likely that fares will moveupward when you don't have carriers that need to discountjust to stay in business.&quot;   Most money managers and analysts say that Delta would bethe chief beneficiary if Eastern stopped flying, whileAmerican would be the likeliest to pick up any turf vacatedby Pan Am or TWA. Eastern is Delta's biggest rival at theAtlanta hub airport, and also competes with Delta in Florida,offering aggressively low fares. When Eastern's employeesstruck in March 1989, Delta saw a quick 20% jump in revenue.   Another money manager warns against counting on a replay:Other competitors could fill Eastern's shoes. He thinks thebenefits from a major carrier's demise would be spread fairlyevenly across the entire industry. But the majority view isthat Delta would benefit most if Eastern falls. &quot;Clearly,Delta would be the beneficiary if Eastern goes away,&quot; saysNed Davis, president of Ned Davis Research in Nokomis, Fla.   Pan Am currently has about 14% of the traffic across theAtlantic. TWA has about 12%. Those routes could make atempting target for American or United, both of which nowhave transatlantic toeholds. American is &quot;making a concertedeffort to build up their east-west travel between NorthAmerica and Europe,&quot; says David Elias, a money manager inBuffalo, N.Y. &quot;If Pan Am did go under, they would probablypick up a lot of that business, and at very reasonableprices.&quot;   Pan Am, says Steve Lewins, who follows airline stocks forChancellor Capital Management, &quot;is attempting to make it toEurope 1992&quot; -- the scheduled date for the fall of most tradebarriers in Europe -- by selling off assets. &quot;They keepchopping up the furniture and throwing it into the fire,&quot;says Jeffrey S. Halis, a money manager with Gollust, Tierneyandamp; Oliver in New York. &quot;I don't think they have much left tosell.&quot;   Pan Am has expressed willingness to be sold. But moneymanagers say potential acquirers are biding their time,waiting for a truly low price. &quot;The people at American arevery clever tacticians,&quot; says Michael Stolper, a San Diegoinvestment consultant.   American doesn't need Pan Am's &quot;management, employees {or}computer systems,&quot; says Mr. Lewins. &quot;What it wants are theroutes, the gates, and the slots. I don't think {American CEORobert} Crandall wants the baggage. He's playing the waitinggame.&quot;   Mr. Lewins thinks TWA's routes would be a prize capturefor Northwest Airlines, which flies to Scandinavia andnorthern Europe. TWA concentrates on southern Europe,especially the Mediterranean. The routes &quot;fit together like aclamshell,&quot; he says. &quot;The two are perfect together.&quot;Northwest, however, &quot;is still having digestion problems&quot; fromthe leveraged buy-out, says Mr. Davis.   Kevin Murphy, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says it'sdangerous to predict the imminent demise of any airline.&quot;Airlines never die of a heart attack. They die a slowdeath,&quot; he says, citing Pan Am's 20-year decline. Still, hesees opportunities for strong carriers, saying Delta andAmerican could become the industry's &quot;flying fortresses.&quot;Michael W. Gunn, American's senior vice president formarketing, says it's &quot;premature to speculate&quot; about anypossible acquisitions.   Even for any acquirer, there are clouds on the horizon. Anacquisitive carrier's stock might take a short-term hitbecause of costs associated with a takeover, such as thetricky task of sorting out employee seniority. And someinvestors don't like airlines dead or alive. &quot;We avoidairlines like the plague,&quot; says Roger Engemann, a moneymanager in Pasadena, Calif. &quot;They're cyclical, highlyleveraged, and intensely competitive. It's the worst businessin the world.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
