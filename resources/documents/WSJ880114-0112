The Teachers Insurance andamp; Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund also filed shareholder resolutions with 20 U.S. companies whose stock it holds, urging the companies to withdraw from South Africa.    The teachers' fund said it is concerned about corporations whose withdrawal programs have provided for continuing economic links with South Africa. The fund revised its definition of withdrawal to include termination of marketing rights or obligations as well as licenses, franchises or other agreements to supply goods, materials, products, service or technology.    For the 1988 proxy season, the teachers' fund also called for the withdrawal from South Africa by 20 multinational companies that still have some direct investments there. Two of those companies -- Allegis Corp. and Cigna Corp. -- have since decided to withdraw.    This is the second year that the teacher's fund has filed similar shareholder resolutions. In 1987, the average vote for the resolution was 11.3% of the shares voted at 12 corporate meetings.    The fund has never divested itself of the stock it owns in companies that invest in South Africa, citing fiduciary concerns. </TEXT></DOC>
