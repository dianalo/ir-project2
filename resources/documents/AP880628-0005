Meese told a news conference that Congress has put ``so manylayers of requirements'' on Pentagon officials who ``have had toface up to the fact that budget planning cycles have been ignoredin the congressional appropriations.''   ``I think some of these (actions) have contributed to some ofthe contractors saying, `We've got to get ours now,' and resortingto some of these practices'' now under investigation, the attorneygeneral said.   The investigation being coordinated by Henry Hudson, the U.S.attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, is probingallegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of themformer military men, bribed Pentagon officials for contractingdetails that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions ofdollars.   Meese said the ``Pentagon has been so beset by a lot of things.... There are problems in the procurement process that are not thefault of the Pentagon.''   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,said that while he agrees there are too many regulations, many ofthem came from within the Pentagon rather than from Congress and hedisputed that such regulations caused the problems underinvestigation.   ``This was caused, from most of what I've heard, by pure oldfraud and corruption,'' Nunn said. ``I don't know of any rule orlaw that's passed that would entice someone to sell a governmentsecret for money.''   Meese said he met with Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci todiscuss sharing information with the Pentagon so that the militarycan determine whether it needs to take steps against defensecontractors or consultants.   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., recently urged more cooperationbetween Carlucci and Meese. Carlucci has said the Pentagon wouldnot necessarily wait for convictions in the current investigationbefore taking steps against contractors.   Although Meese answered reporter's questions on the probe, hedid not mention that he had removed himself Monday from alldecision-making in the case because his own lawyers arerepresenting clients involved in it. Justice Department spokesmanPat Korten confirmed Tuesday night in a telephone interview thatMeese had recused himself from the investigation.   The attorney general's law firm _ Miller, Cassidy, Larroca andamp;Lewin _ represents him in a lengthy investigation by independentcounsel James McKay of whether Meese used his public office toprovide favored treatment for friends or companies which may have,in turn, rewarded him or his family.   Elsewhere, the Defense Department's top contracting official,Robert Costello, tried last month to limit searches of defenseplants by investigators looking for corruption.   In a May 5 memo to Carlucci, a copy of which was obtained by TheAssociated Press, the undersecretary of defense for acquisitionssuggested that top Pentagon officials, including himself, be givenveto power over searches of contractor facilities.   Costello's anger was triggered by a search Feb. 25 at theElectronic andamp; Space Division of Emerson Electric Co. near St. Louis,in a fraud investigation that apparently is not related to thenationwide probe.   Meanwhile, sources familiar with the probe said investigatorsregard as significant potential evidence videotapes ofsurreptitiously recorded meetings between Defense Departmentpersonnel and industry consultants.   More than one of the tapes picked up an audible sound track ofthe conversation, said the sources, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The sources refused to say whether the tapes show money orconfidential government documents changing hands, but one said``the participants are doing more than talking.''   One source said ``there aren't that many videotapes, videotapesare not an extensive technique in the case,'' largely because ofthe difficulty of making arrangements to tape a meeting that mightbe taking place without much advance notice.   But the sources said the government regards the videotapes asimportant evidence when combined with extensive wiretapping thathas been the basic tool in the investigation to date.   Sources said over the weekend that among those appearing on thevideotapes are Navy official-turned-consultant Melvyn Paisley andcurrent Pentagon officials Victor Cohen and James Gaines, both ofwhom have been transferred from handling procurement issues whilethe investigation is under way.   ``The mere fact that the government videotapes or records ameeting or conversation doesn't make that meeting or conversationillegal,'' said Robert Plotkin, an attorney for Paisley. ``Theyused videotapes in the DeLorean case and he was acquitted.''   Automaker John Z. DeLorean was acquitted of cocaine-traffickingcharges in 1984 in a case in which FBI agents posing as drugdealers conducted videotaped discussions with him. Federal jurorssaid they felt DeLorean, who was trying at the time to save hisstruggling sports car company, had been entrapped.   Gaines' attorney, Michael Schatzow, deplored the leaking ofinformation about the investigation and videotapes, but otherwisedeclined to comment.   Over the weekend, sources said some videotapes show money beingpaid to Pentagon personnel, although they declined to specify whowas involved. Those sources said Gaines was videotaped at meetingsin which highly confidential documents relating to Pentagoncontracts allegedly changed hands.   Paisley was assistant secretary of the Navy for research,engineering and systems before leaving the government in 1987 tobecome a consultant to major defense contractors.   Cohen is top aide to a deputy assistant Air Force secretary incharge of buying tactical command, control, communications andcomputer systems. Gaines is deputy assistant Navy secretary foracquisition management.   In other developments:</TEXT><TEXT>   _Former Navy Secretary James H. Webb said investigators told himlast fall that Paisley and an unidentified member of Webb'sheadquarters staff were under investigation in the defense probe.Webb said he did not tell Carlucci about the matter because hefigured the FBI would tell him if and when it wished.   _At the White House, President Reagan got a third update Tuesdayon the status of the investigation. Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidreviewed several matters that have been discussed publicly, such asthe reassignment of certain employees.   The president ``wants the matter cleaned up as rapidly aspossible, both from the standpoint of the investigation ofindividuals and the procurement system at the Pentagon,'' Fitzwatersaid.   _The New York Times reported in Wednesday's editions that FBIagents had searched the home of Richard Seelmeyer, a formeradministrative assistant to the late Rep. Joseph P. Addabbo,D-N.Y., who was chairman of the House subcommittee on defenseappropriations before his death in April 1986.   The Times said the FBI also searched the Newark, N.J., officesof the Bryant Ticket Agency, which books seats at entertainmentevents.   Seelmeyer is the publisher of Capitol Hill Defense Digest, anewsletter about military matters. A telephone listing in BerwinHeights, Md., for Seelmeyer was busy Tuesday night.   Hudson has said that no current members of Congress are underinvestigation in the probe.   _Defense Department officials are reviewing formerly closedcases of alleged contract irregularities that involve people,companies or contracts identified in connection with the JusticeDepartment's probe and may reopen six of those cases, PentagonInspector General June Gibbs Brown told The Washington Post for astory in Wednesday's editions.   _Plotkin and E. Lawrence Barcella Jr., who represent Paisley andhis wife, Vicki, protested in a letter to prosecutor Hudson ``thealmost daily disclosure of secret investigative information thatsubject our clients to trial by innuendo and rumor before thissituation has even been presented to or considered for final actionby the grand jury.''   They said that Hudson's briefings last week for Reagan and formembers of Congress may have violated rules against disclosures ofmatters before grand juries, and in any event ``guarantee thatadditional disclosures are likely to occur.''   They also complained that investigators ``removed all relevantdocuments from the Paisleys' home and office, preventing them ortheir counsel from adequately reviewing the situation orsubstantively responding to the outlandish disclosures.''</TEXT></DOC>
