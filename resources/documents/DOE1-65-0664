Only counterionscan influence the emulsifying properties of ionic surfactants. When emulsionsare stabilized by nonionic surfactants, the presence of electrolyteslowers the level of stabilizing properties. When an ionic surfactantis incorporated into an adsorbed layer, the counterion increases thesurface area of the emulsion in proportion to the square of the counterionradius; if no salt is present, the ionic surfactant molecule occupiesan area of the emulsion that is exactly equal to the cross section ofthe surface-active ion.</TEXT></DOC>
