Over theyears some of the asbestos-containing material has worn down, becomingeasily crushable, or friable. Any disturbance sends microscopic fibersinto the air to be inhaled by those in the buildings. Children are especiallyvulnerable to the dangers of asbestos. They breathe more rapidly thanadults and tend to take air in through their mouths rather than theirnoses, which would filter out some of the fibers. And because childrenare smaller, they are more likely to come in contact with asbestos gatheredon the floor. According to surveys conducted by the Environmental ProtectionAgency, some 44,000 public and private schools, 733,000 public buildings,and many homes throughout the country contain friable asbestos. Manymore buildings contain nonfriable asbestos that may deteriorate in thefuture.</TEXT></DOC>
