The commission, by a 3-2 vote, voted to give the NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers authority to ban over-the-countertrading in exchange-listed stocks, a practice called ``third markettrading.''   Currently, when the New York Stock Exchange or another exchangehalts trading because of a pending announcement, the NASD can barits member firms from using the association's automated systems tooffer quotes on the stock.   However, it cannot bar brokerage firms from making a privatemarket while exchange trading is halted.   Some firms, such as Jeffries andamp; Co., have been willing to act asan intermediary for professional traders who want to buy and sellstock before announcements of takeovers, major contracts and othernews.   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder, in supporting the proposal, said itwould reduce the opportunity for insider trading. He also said hewas troubled by the current arrangement, which appears to favorprofessionals with more access to market information over smallinvestors.   Any perception that professional investors are being given anadvantage will harm efforts to encourage small investors, rattledby the October stock market crash, to return to the market.   The action was opposed by commissioners Charles C. Cox andJoseph A. Grundfest, who argued that it would unnecessarilyrestrict the freedom of the market.   Grundfest said stock holders have a right to reduce their riskby selling stock before an announcement and that a trader willingto take on the risk had a right to buy. He said the rights of smallinvestors would not necessarily be enhanced by restrictingprofessional traders.   Cox said he has seen no evidence that small investors have beenharmed by their inability to take part in ``third market trading.''   He said insider trading is rarely caused by the ability to tradea few minutes before a news release. ``You can always preventinsider trading by preventing trading, but obviously we are notgoing that far,'' he said.   Joining Ruder were commissioners Aulana L. Peters and Edward H.Fleischman. They acknowledged that expanding trading halts couldimpinge on the freedom of the market, but they said that concernwas outweighed by the need to protect investors.   In another matter, the commission voted 5-0 to ask Congress forauthority to issue subpoenas and take testimony on behalf ofsecurities regulators and foreign governments.   As part of an international effort to combat insider trading andother securities fraud, the SEC is asking foreign governments toassist the United States in pursuing evidence of violations. TheSEC needs additional authority from Congress to reciprocate.   The SEC and regulators in the Canadian provinces of Ontario,Quebec and British Columbia signed a cooperation agreement inJanuary. Ruder has said he is pursuing cooperation pacts with Japanand Great Britain.</TEXT></DOC>
