Jim Wright's seat in Texas becauseGOP officials ignored President Bush's offers to campaign there,charges White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.   ``The White House, from the very beginning, made it clear that wewere willing to send the president,'' Sununu said in an interviewpublished in today's editions of The Washington Times. ``We wantedto send the president.''   But Sununu said the Republican National Committee and theRepublican Congressional Committee ignored Bush's repeated offers.   Democrat Pete Geren won the seat, which was vacated when HouseSpeaker Wright resigned, in a Sept. 12 special election. Gerenearned 40,210 votes to Republican Dr. Robert Lanier's 38,590.   ``I was absolutely convinced from the beginning, and thepresident was convinced from the beginning, that a Texas election ina special election mode was winnable,'' Sununu told The Times.   Neither RNC Chairman Lee Atwater and congressional committeeChairman Ed Rollins was available for comment.   Someone at the White House actually rejected a Sept. 7congressional committee request for the president to make asatellite television appearance, John Buckley, the group's directorof communications, told The Times. That decision was reversed thenext day after Atwater telephones Sununu aboard an Air Force Oneflight to New Orleans, Buckley said.   Bush talked live with the GOP candidate via satellite at a forumof 400 supporters 48 hours before the polls opened.   ``My understanding is they got everything they asked for,'' saidLeslie Goodman, a spokeswoman for Atwater.</TEXT></DOC>
