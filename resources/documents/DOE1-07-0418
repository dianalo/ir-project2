The radiological risks calculatedinclude individual dose commitments, collective dose commitments, andlong-term (100-year) environmental dose commitments to a population followingrelease of radioactivity. To facilitate route-specific analysis, a state-leveldatabase was developed and incorporated into the model. Route-specificanalysis is demonstrated by the calculation of radiological risks resultingfrom various accident scenarios, as postulated by the recent US NuclearRegulatory Commission Modal Study, for four representative states selectedfrom various regions of the United States. 10 refs., 3 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
