LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors on Tuesday opened aninvestigation into fraud, influence peddling and financial scandalsallegedly involving the brother of former President Chun Doo-hwan.   The Prosecutor General's Office said at least 10 officials havebeen questioned in an investigation of whether Chun Kyung-hwan, ayounger brother of the former president, embezzled funds of theSaemaul Undong development group.   Top Saemaul officials are suspected of diverting private andgovernment subsidies to profit-oriented projects, land speculationand other illegal activities.   The former president left office Feb. 25 at the end of aseven-year term. He left Tuesday on a private visit to the UnitedStates, where he will meet President Reagan on Wednesday.   President Roh Tae-woo, who succeeded Chun, has pledged toeradicate abuses of power and corruption under previousgovernments. In a recent move to reduce the ex-president's power,Roh removed some Chun supporters from their posts.   Some political observers say the Roh government opened theinvestigation to disscredit the former president and improve thecurrent government's image.   There have been allegations of corruption by the Saemaul groupsince the former president seized power with military backing in1980 and installed his brother as Saemaul head.   The younger Chun resigned in 1987 after being linked togangsters.   Prosecutor Kang Won-il said government officials also were beinginvestigated to see if they had assisted or protected corruption.   ``My investigation team will unearth all malpractices and makepublic the results of the probe,'' Kang told reporters.   Dong-A Ilbo, an influential Seoul newspaper, said the youngerChun was responsible for a sharp drop in cattle prices in 1983 whenhe forced government officials to import cattle from the UnitedStates.   Saemaul was formed in 1971 to improve rural and urban livingstandards, but critics contend the country's authoritariangovernments have used the movement to promote government influence.   The Party for Peace and Democracy controlled by oppositionleader Kim Dae-jung charged that Roh also aided Saemaul officialswhen he was a government minister in 1982.   The opposition party demanded that Roh and other family membersof the former president be investigated.</TEXT></DOC>
