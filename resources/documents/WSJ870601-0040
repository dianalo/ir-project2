A White House decision late last week to stick with the draft treaty came as a setback to Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. Two weeks ago, he mounted a campaign to change the U.S. negotiating position to insist on total elimination of intermediate missiles.    The draft treaty was designed to meet Soviet demands to keep 100 intermediate-range missiles in Asia after all such systems have been removed from Europe. Mr. Weinberger has gained backing for the complete elimination from European allies, who fear that if the Soviets keep 100 warheads in Asia, they could move them back to Europe in a crisis.    Although President Reagan is said to prefer the full elimination of the weapons, the State Department and some White House advisers see risks in substituting a tougher proposal for the draft treaty offered earlier by the U.S. The arms talks would almost certainly be slowed if the U.S. changed its official position.    A senior Pentagon official suggested, however, that the Soviets still might be persuaded to agree to full elimination of the missiles in order to avoid the stringent inspections the U.S. is seeking to verify compliance with a treaty that would allow each side to keep some of the missiles. </TEXT></DOC>
