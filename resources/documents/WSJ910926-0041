Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren deniedthe delay represents a setback for Mr. Gates, but theincreased attention to the politicization issue could proveembarrassing to the former CIA deputy director who has beentapped by President Bush to head the agency.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Gates's credibility already has been challenged inregard to his role in the Iran-Contra affair, and thepoliticization issue is even more sensitive to some senatorsbecause of the potential impact on major policy decisions.Before becoming deputy director in 1986, Mr. Gates oversawthe CIA's intelligence division, and the studies done thenregarding the Soviet Union inevitably colored debate over thethreat to the U.S. and need to invest in the military buildupand Strategic Defense Initiative backed by the White House.   Mr. Gates's record as a taskmaster in the analysisdivision has contributed to the criticism he faces from pastcolleagues. But experts in his own field of Soviet studiesare among those challenging his performance. And a relatedissue is whether the CIA selectively declassified material asit suited the White House's purposes in winning support inCongress.   One of the most embarrassing episodes potentially is astill secret 1985 assessment of the Soviet role behind theattempted assassination of Pope John Paul II four yearsearlier. Mr. Gates is accused of misrepresenting theunderlying assumptions of the study in a letter thatcirculated inside the government. Among those receiving thedocuments was then Vice President Bush, who responded bypraising the product and Mr. Gates, according to peoplefamiliar with the documents.   The decision to hold public hearings came as the committeeheard the first testimony on the issue in a private sessionyesterday and last night. Mr. Gates, who was alreadyscheduled to be called back, will be given a chance to answerquestions in an open session as well. But the change inschedule ensures that the panel won't vote on hisconfirmation until after the Columbus Day recess.</TEXT></DOC>
