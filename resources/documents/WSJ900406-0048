The order blocks any strike at least until midnight May 5.It is another step in the strike-stopping procedures of theRailway Labor Act, under which the White House wouldeventually name an emergency panel that would developrecommendations for solving the health-cost issues and othermatters in dispute. White House officials have said thatPresident Bush is willing to name the emergency panel.</LP><TEXT>   The president may name the panel as soon as the MediationBoard notifies the White House that the negotiating impassethreatens to disrupt interstate commerce. That notificationis likely to occur soon.   An emergency panel usually has 30 days to come up withsettlement recommendations, but the railroads and the unionssay they would allow until Sept. 15, and longer if necessary.The parties also agreed they wouldn't take any action until30 days after the emergency board reports, and in any eventwon't act if Congress isn't in session. Congress typicallyintervenes if the Railway Labor Act fails to prevent astrike.</TEXT></DOC>
