Paul Simon finally jumped on the MichaelDukakis bandwagon Wednesday, formally ending his own dormant questfor the Democratic presidential nomination and nudging hisremaining delegates toward the certain nominee.   The Illinois senator, who had already seen roughly 40 of his 184delegates defect in the past month, promised to ``do everything Ican'' to get Dukakis elected.   ``The primaries and caucuses are now history. The verdict isin,'' said Simon. Dukakis ``clearly is more sensitive to thefundamental needs of our nation'' than George Bush.   In a bow to supporters of another Illinois hopeful, JesseJackson, who were angered when Simon suspended his campaign inApril instead of ending it, the senator said only, ``I will urgedelegates who have no strong commitment in any other direction tovote for Michael Dukakis.''   He said the Massachusetts governor's ``greatest asset was thathe was himself. He didn't try to become something else. He'sgenuine. He's not phony. I think somehow that came across.''   Echoing themes he built his own campaign around, Simon said,``Michael Dukakis has to make clear ... that he has a positiveprogram of jobs, for quality education, for long-term care, formoving away from the arms race, for things our party traditionallyhas stood for.''   ``I want to use whatever influence I have for the causes that mydelegates and I support,'' he said.   He said he supports Jackson's call for language in theDemocratic platform denouncing South Africa as a terrorist state, aposition Dukakis has been reluctant to take.   Simon suspended his faltering campaign on April 7 instead ofending it because ``I thought it would be a brokered convention,''he explained.   That prospect quickly evaporated. ``Conventional wisdom hasconventionally been wrong on just about everything,'' said Simon.   Speaking at a news conference at Democratic National Committeeheadquarters, he said the party was more unified than at any timesince 1964.   He said he was 99 percent certain his first run for thepresidency was also his last. Simon, who is up for re-election in1990, said, ``I don't want to be a Harold Stassen'' _ a referenceto the perennial candidate from Minnesota.   Simon expressed little interest in the No. 2 spot on the ticket.   Jackson has earned consideration, but the vice presidency is not``a blue ribbon or a red ribbon you give to someone who comes insecond in a race,'' he said.   Simon's hopes were buoyed by a close finish behind RichardGephardt in Iowa's caucuses last February. He finished third in NewHampshire, but sat out the Super Tuesday primaries across the Southand never recovered.   He encountered skepticism about how he would juggle his promisedpublic works, education and long-term care progams with a pledge tobalance the budget in three years.   Simon's campaign is $450,000 in debt, spokesman David Carle said.</TEXT></DOC>
