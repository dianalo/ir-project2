It's a time for dropping all pretense that what you are doing has a deeper significance than the act itself, or that is it relevant in any way to the real issues and problems of the day.    Such escapism is a fundamental human need, which is why the nation's capital becomes a ghost town in August. But this year, Washington didn't wait for August to take a vacation. From Capitol Hill to the White House, it hasn't seemed to be serious about serious things for months.    Consider the fight that tied the place in knots just as Congress was stampeding to adjournment in early August. The matter at hand was the savings-and-loan industry bailout and reform package, a matter necessitated by the deregulatory fecklessness of Congress and the administration earlier in the 1980s.    There was no disagreement that real money, ranging from $150 billion upward, was going to be required over the next several years to clean up the wreckage. Despite the ersatz populism trotted out regularly by Democrats and Republicans, almost everyone also promptly agreed that the taxpayers should shoulder the lion's share of the costs, rather than the institutions that had incurred them and caused the mess in the first place.    That left only one important debate unresolved. Should the total cost, which is real, be treated as real? Should it be put on budget, where it would show, or kept off budget, where everyone could pretend that this massive addition to the deficit didn't really exist? And if it were to be put on budget should it be counted as part of the fiscal '90 budget, thereby inevitably triggering Gramm-Rudman-Hollings sequestration provisions, or should it be treated as something separate and apart from the &quot;real&quot; deficit?    The last question was all but ignored. Almost everyone, regardless of label, agreed that this was a deficit that really wasn't a deficit. That automatically meant no one was dealing with the question as serious adults, representing equally serious constituents.    That left Congress and the White House to deadlock over the non-serious question of how much, if any, of the total annual cost of the bailout should be publicly attached to the budget for accounting, though not Gramm-Rudman, purposes. Watching grown men and women tying themselves in knots on that one was akin to witnessing preachers having a go at mud wrestling. Former congressional budget director Alice Rivlin put it with admirable clarity: &quot;Borrowing money is borrowing money,&quot; a fact of life legislated out of existence just before adjournment.    For today's public servants, President Bush chief among them, money is something you promise, not something you must provide either through new taxes or new budget cuts.    The voters having proved that they want to have their cake and eat it, too, the politicians are anxious to validate their wisdom. Cleaner air? Absolutely. Improved public-school education? Of course. A drug war? All out. A new leap into space? Tomorrow.    And the price tag for all this, not to mention the combination of cuts in other programs and additional revenue to pay it? A discreet cough, silence and a quick shuffle to the wings.    Finally, there has been the matter of the hostages in Lebanon and the larger question of terrorism and hostage-taking everywhere. Having been on vacation, I have been totally cut off from television and therefore untouched by the searing images of death and grief accompanying the latest tragedy, as they inevitably accompany every hostage &quot;crisis.&quot;    As a result, what strikes me from afar is a sense of deja vu, plus disbelief that, at least initially, officials and media fell into a mode of public rhetoric and behavior that was as familiar as it was futile.    By now, everyone ought to know that the U.S. has one million people at risk in the world every day of every year. We are a free people in a nation with far-flung economic and military interests. Our nation has real enemies, and our allies have real enemies who believe they can influence those allies through us. Hostage taking is therefore inevitable, made even more inevitable by the public drama we stage after every incident.    But whether the administration in office is &quot;tough&quot; or &quot;soft,&quot; there is virtually nothing it can do that is easy or without grave potential for loss of innocent life. Nor is any other nation's example of particular relevance to us. Israel is routinely &quot;tough,&quot; and it is as routinely the target of terrorism of one sort or another. France is widely understood to be &quot;soft,&quot; willing to buy its people out of captivity and otherwise deal with terrorists, but it is victimized neither more nor less often than other countries.    All of which should now be clear to just about everyone, from television anchors to men and women in the street to presidents. And that being clear, serious people might be expected to draw serious conclusions, not the least serious being that the president has no good options and therefore would be best advised to drop the subject and get on with the business of being president.    The alternative, which can best be described as incessant public dithering, is both hypocritical and counterproductive, in that it raises the value of hostage taking without increasing the likelihood of an acceptable solution.    But we are not serious on this matter, either, though President Bush shows signs of having learned a great deal about what not to do and say from the mistakes of his immediate predecessors. While he is still overly fond of musing aloud about the problem, most of what he has to say is restrained and sensible.    But it was President Bush, nonetheless, who approved the nonsense PR game of briefing the world on how the U.S. had been on the verge of tough military steps if another hostage had been killed.    That left the chilling, though improbable, implication that this president had actually learned nothing from the disastrous results of the last president's military sorties in the region.    A much more likely explanation is that on this, as on taxes, deficits and the lack of fit between promises and resources, the president and his staff simply don't believe the American people are ready to hear the unadorned truth about anything.    It is a lack of faith shared by Congress and demonstrated in repeated ways this year. Thus it has been as co-conspirators that Congress and president have taken a break they don't deserve or need.    They've both been on vacation from the hard choices and plain talk of honest governance all year.    ---   Mr. Carter is a political commentator who heads a television production firm. </TEXT></DOC>
