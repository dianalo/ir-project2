Charter said the sale-leaseback transactions under reviewwould generate about $45 million in net cash flow after thepayment of bank debt and transaction costs. J. RodneyLaughlin, executive vice president, human resources anddevelopment, declined to identify the prospectivesale-leaseback parties, &quot;because we're still looking atseveral proposals.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Charter also confirmed that a bond holder had filed alawsuit last week against the company in a federal districtcourt in Macon alleging that Charter had misrepresented itsfinancial condition in filings with the Securities andExchange Commision. A spokesman said the company hasn't yetreceived copies of two other similar suits that reportedlywere filed against it this week.   The giant psychiatric and general hospital concern alsosaid that it decided to bow out of a proposed hospitalmanagement contract in Saudi Arabia, because the biddingprocess was dragging on. &quot;We decided to withdraw and go aboutour business,&quot; said Mr. Laughlin, noting the Saudi projecthad become &quot;time consuming and expensive.&quot;   In a move aimed at reassuring the public in the wake of arecent spate of adverse publicity, Charter also said it is&quot;current with all debt obligations&quot; and noted that followingthe return of $6 million from a bid bond posted for the SaudiArabian project, it has $50 million in cash on hand and a $30million line of bank credit available.   Wall Street analysts generally hailed the sale-leasebackproposal as a positive and predictable step that would helpcash flow. &quot;Clearly the sale-leaseback is good,&quot; saidMeredith Adler, a First Boston Corp. analyst. &quot;The questionis, is it enough to help them to finance the building they'vealready done and to continue to make payments on the debt.&quot;She added that while the cancellation of the Saudi projectwas a minor move, it indicates the company's intention offocusing on its central problems.   Charter, in the face of a tightening market forpsychiatric hospital care, is struggling under $1.6 billionin debt from the 1988 management-led leveraged buyout of thecompany. The company said it is continuing to reduce costs --particularly in the area of marketing -- to try to get itselfback on track. &quot;We expect to see a good improvement inreducing expenses in the upcoming months,&quot; Mr. Laughlin said.   Charter's woes came to a head in March when the companysaid it was taking a $35 million special charge foraccounting irregularities that involved, among other things,a pervasive practice of inadequately reserving for bad debts.In June, it laid off 600 workers, about 3% of its workforce.</TEXT></DOC>
