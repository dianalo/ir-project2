The work specifically addresses the exposure-rateeffect in radon-daughter carcinogenesis; the induction-promotion relationshipsassociated with exposure to radon and cigarette-smoke mixtures; the roleof oncogenes in radon-induced cancers; the effects of radon on DNA aswell as on DNA repair processes; and the involvement of growth factorsand their receptors in radon-induced carcinogenesis. Preliminary experimentsshowed that oncogenes are activated in radon-induced lung tumors. Theyhave therefore begun further exposures pertinent to the oncogene andgrowth-factor studies. An in vitro radon cellular-exposure system wasdesigned, and cell exposures were initiated. Initiation-promotion-initiationstudies with radon and cigarette-smoke mixtures have also begun; andthey are compiling a radon health-effects bibliography.</TEXT></DOC>
