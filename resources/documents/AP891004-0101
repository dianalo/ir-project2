U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson sentenced Fawaz Younisto 30 years in prison for taking hostages, 20 years for aircraftpiracy and five years for conspiracy. The sentences are to runconcurrently.   Robinson could have imposed a term of life imprisonment, but henoted that no one on the plane had been killed. He said, however,that a lengthy prison term is required because time ``will neverwipe out what is in the minds'' of the passengers and crewsubjected to the hijacking.   Younis, who has spent the past two years in custody, could beeligible for parole in eight years, U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens saidafter the sentencing.   Stephens said the term is ``fair'' and ``substantial'' and thatit sends ``a clear message'' to people ``who would engage in actsof international terrorism.''   At his sentencing, the convicted hijacker asked the judge forleniency, saying he is not a terrorist and that he treated the twoAmericans aboard the airliner as ``friends.''   Younis was convicted March 14 of storming the Jordanian airlinerin Beirut with four other gunmen and holding the 70 passengers andcrew hostage for 30 hours. All aboard, including two Americans,were freed before the plane was blown up.   In 1987, Younis was lured aboard a yacht in the Mediterranean onthe pretext of a drug deal and grabbed by undercover FBI agents.U.S. officials have hailed the case as a strong signal that theUnited States will take whatever steps necessary to deal withterrorists.   Younis was found innocent of threatening violence againstpassengers, destroying a civilian aircraft and carrying explosivedevices aboard the plane.   ``Why does the American government want to depict me as aterrorist, and believe that I am a threat to it?'' Younis asked ina letter to the judge last week.   He said there is ``a huge difference between me, and thoseothers'' involved in terrorism.   Younis, a member of the Amal movement, said he was instructed byhis superiors to hijack an aircraft and fly it to Tunis, Tunisia,where a meeting of Arab League representatives was in progress.   During the hijacking, he read a declaration demanding the leaguedecide that one Arab nation allow all Palestinians to settle in thecountry and that Palestinians be removed from Lebanon.   ``The thorny problem for this court is that Mr. Younis haspreviously stated and continues to believe that his actions werepolitical in nature,'' his lawyer, Francis Carter, said in courtpapers.   In a memo to the judge last week, the U.S. attorney's officesaid Younis was one of the members of Amal who held Americanhostages in Beirut in connection with the hijacking of TWA Flight847, days after the hijacking of the Jordanian airliner.   In the TWA hijacking, Navy diver Robert Stethem was murdered.   Younis admitted he had been among the first to enter the TWAairliner when it landed at Beirut Airport, said the government'ssentencing memo.   Carter said Hezbollah terrorists, not the Amal movement,hijacked the TWA plane. The Amal, at the request of the U.S.government, worked to negotiate the release of the hostages, takingcustody of some to prevent all the passengers and crew from fallinginto the hands of Hezbollah, Carter said.   ``No one from the Amal movement was aboard the plane when ...Stethem was killed,'' Carter said.</TEXT></DOC>
