Reversing a two-decade policy that banned use of temporary helpsuppliers except for a few rare instances, the Office of PersonnelManagement said the new policy will increase agencies' flexibilityin times and areas of labor shortages.   The new policy, published Monday in the Federal Register andscheduled to become effective in December or January, amendsrulings in 1967 and 1968 that effectively prohibited usingtemporary help firms as a violation of civil service laws.   OPM Director Constance Horner, in an address Monday to theNational Association of Temporary Services at its convention inPhoenix, Ariz., contended the new policy will benefit federalemployees as well as the agencies they work for.   ``By permitting agencies to use temporaries ... we make it fareasier for managers to say `yes' to employees who need time off forfamily responsibilities,'' she said. ``And by allowing agencies touse temporary help services, we ensure that managers can get thereplacement help they need when they need it.''   Government employee unions immediately attacked the proposal,calling it the administration's latest attempt to contract out worknow performed by their civil service members.   Robert Tobias, president of the National Treasury EmployeesUnion, said the government would pay ``significantly more'' bycontracting with suppliers of temporary workers than if it hiredmore temporary workers directly by offering them higher pay.   Tobias said a beginning clerk-typist under civil service is nowpaid between $13,500 and $15,000 a year, or $6 to $7 an hour.   ``In the Washington area, temporary help suppliers are charginganywhere from $12 to $15 an hour for a person,'' he said. ``Itwould be a lot cheaper if they cut out the middleman and offered toincrease the pay by 20 percent.''   Under the new regulations, an agency could use temporary helpservices only in cases in which a regular federal employee isabsent because of emergency, accident, maternity leave or illness,or to fill a short-term gap when a worker is transferred or theirjob is being contracted out.   But temporary help services also could be relied upon if thework ``is in a shortage occupation which the agency is aggressivelyseeking to fill permanently.''   James Lafferty, an OPM spokesman, said the government is facinglarge shortages of clerical workers and secretaries in high-costcities where unemployment rates are low. Specifically, he citedWashington, New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago and SanFrancisco.   Red Evans, a spokesman for the National Federation of FederalEmployees, called the second provision a ``loophole'' that wouldallow widescale use of temporary workers and substantial abuses tothe detriment of a permanent civil service.   ``It's a copout as far as we're concerned,'' he said. ``They'rehaving a hard time filling these jobs because they don't payenough.''   Some agencies already have latitude to use temporary helpagencies in special circumstances. For example, the U.S. ForestService has been utilizing them since the end of World War II tosupplement their crews during peak fire seasons.   The new policy would limit the use of any one employee from atemporary help service to 45 working days during a six-monthperiod. Temporaries also could not be used more than 90 workingdays a year for a particular position or to displace any currentfederal employee.</TEXT></DOC>
