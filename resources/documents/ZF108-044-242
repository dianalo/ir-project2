Levin, principal in charge of data centertransformation for the Montvale, N.J., financial consultancy and systemsintegration firm of Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co.andM;Fortunately, Levin adds, you'll probably be able to cut staff without firinganybody, as the average attrition rate in corporate data centers is 25percent to 30 percent a year.andM;Three steps to automating the data center, according to Levin, arestreamlining the tape library, consolidating the print shop and automatingconsole management.andM;The tape library.andP;  &quot;We find,&quot; Levin says, &quot;that people typically mount about50 percent more tape than they need to.andP;  We find that 80 percent of the tapemounts are caused by 20 percent of the tapes.&quot;andM;Your job: Find better ways of handling that 20 percent.andP;  Combining severaltapes into one reel is a good possibility.andP;  &quot;Most data centers use only about10 feet of a reel of tape,&quot; Levin says.andP;  Another idea: Put the 20 percent ondirect-access disks, eliminating tape.andM;Also, eliminate &quot;foreign tapes&quot;--tapes that come in from outside the datacenter for processing--by convincing your company's clients and branchoffices to transmit data directly.andP;  Finally, once you've cut the number oftape mounts, consider automating the operation with robots.andP;  Levin likes thetape-mount robots sold by Storage Technology Corp., Louisville, Colo.andM;The print shop.andP;  &quot;There are two classifications of the paper printed in acompany,&quot; Levin says: reports for internal use only, like payroll, andreports that go to the general public, like bank statements.andM;Levin says, &quot;On a short-term basis, you can really attack the internalreports through the installation of automated output distribution.&quot;andP;  This issoftware that organizes reports by user or mail stop before printing.andM;Levin recommends automated distribution software sold by Essential SoftwareInc., Irvine, Calif.; Legent Corp., Pittsburgh; and Mobius Management SystemsInc., New Rochelle, N.Y.andM;Console management.andP;  It's not efficient to have people watching consolescreens to spot such things as network problems.andP;  Levin says studies by PeatMarwick show that operator errors cause half of network failures.andM;Nevertheless, many companies are slow to automate console management becausethe financial payback is not so immediate and dramatic as with automatedreport distribution.andP;  There is little reduction in staff or workload.andP;  &quot;Whatyou have to tell management to expect,&quot; Levin says, &quot;is that automatedconsole management will increase the availability of the network.&quot;andM;Automated console management products that Levin likes are sold by Legent, aswell as Candle Corp. and MVS Software, both of Los Angeles.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
