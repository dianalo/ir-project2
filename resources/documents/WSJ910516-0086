No formal announcement has been made, but staff from suchrelevant committees as Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, andJudiciary are expected to be tapped to provide someassessment of the evidence available. Speaker Thomas Foleymet with senior chairmen privately this week to discuss theissue. Given the sensitivity of the charges, his support wasseen as required before proceeding.</LP><TEXT>   The allegations have circulated in various forms forseveral years but gained new attention as a result of recentstatements by a former Carter administration official, GarySick, who worked in the White House during the hostagecrisis. In an opinion piece published in the April 15 NewYork Times, Mr. Sick outlined an alleged scheme whereby Iranheld the hostages until after the election and subsequentlyreceived shipments of arms from Israel.   President Bush, who ran with Mr. Reagan on the GOPpresidential ticket, has repeatedly denied any knowledge orpart in such an operation. Most of the attention has beenfocused on the role played by the late William Casey, asenior campaign official for Mr. Reagan who was later nameddirector of the Central Intelligence Agency.</TEXT></DOC>
