As a result of detained site-specificstudies conducted for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) projectin New Mexico, however, several potential problems which are unique tobedded salt deposits have emerged. These include 1) the need to delineatethe extent and rate of past dissolution and projections for the future,2) the origin and significance of brines often found underlying the saltbeds, 3) the rate and volume of migration of brine from the salt crystalstowards the heat producing waste canisters, 4) the creep rates and implicationsfor retrievability, and 5) the existence of potash and oil and gas resourceswith implications of human intrusion in the future. These questions willalso be faced for sites in salt domes with added complications due tomore complex structure and hydrology. The experience at WIPP shows thatthe site characterization process for high level waste repositories inbedded or dome salt should aim at identifying the important issues ofsite suitability early in the process and a clear program should be establishedto address these issues.</TEXT></DOC>
