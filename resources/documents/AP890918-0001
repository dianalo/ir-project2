Commonwealth Court President Judge James Crumlish Jr. alsoordered the city to immediately restore the program, which a budgetcutback forced officials to gut July 1.   Crumlish noted that failure to provide the services would riskinstitutionalization for the 7,750 retarded people enrolled beforethe budget cutback.   Crumlish ordered the state Public Welfare Department to ask theLegislature for the funds within 10 days and also to ``reimburse thecity for monies expended to reinstate and operate these programs.''   ``The crying needs of and imminent harm to the individuals atissue here, unable to speak themselves, cannot be ignored while theintricacies of the General Assembly budgetary process unfold,'' thejudge said.   By ordering the state to seek additional funds from theLegislature, the judge pointed out, the department will be able toretain services in other counties.   The lawsuit was the second the state has lost over thePhiladelphia program. During the last fiscal year, unhappy withdeficits in the program, the Legislature tried to withhold theappropriation, acquiescing only under court order.   ``We've won on the law,'' said attorney David Ferleger, whorepresents retarded people waiting for services. ``The judge saideverybody who is entitled to services should get them. It is a greatvictory, not only in Pennsylvania, but for retarded personseverywhere in this country.''   Vicki Smink, spokeswoman for the welfare department, said nodecision on an appeal has been made.   The program involves teaching and training the retarded in basiclife and social skills, such as feeding and dressing themselves andlearning a simple job.   The current injunction, sought by the city and joined by thePhiladelphia Police and Fire Association for Handicapped Children,affects only the mentally retarded receiving services before the newfiscal year started July 1.   The judge noted that the state Mental Health and MentalRetardation Act of 1966 provides that the commonwealth pay 90percent and each county the remaining 10 percent of the costs.   ``Philadelphia's programs have operated at a deficit since1982,'' Crumlish said in the nine-page opinion granting thepreliminary injunction. ``In each year, the city has found a way toavoid service cuts.''</TEXT></DOC>
