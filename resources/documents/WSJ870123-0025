Morton Thiokol's engineers have been scrambling to redesign the shuttle rocket to prevent the sort of hot-gas leak blamed for setting off the explosion that killed seven astronauts last Jan. 28.    A full-scale test of the redesigned rocket is planned for late July, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials say they still expect to meet an early-1988 deadline for a new shuttle launch.    Morton Thiokol is expected to discuss its redesign efforts at a news conference planned for Monday.    Meanwhile, public pressure continues on NASA to open up bidding to other potential suppliers of booster rockets for the shuttle. At a Senate subcommittee hearing yesterday, NASA drew fire from senators for failing to deeply involve companies other than Morton Thiokol in the process of redesigning the booster rocket.    Morton Thiokol's testimony on the matter came in a politically charged atmosphere, including an assertion by Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D., Tenn.) that NASA was paying the company hundreds of millions of dollars to rectify company    &quot;I'm worried about being locked in by contract with MortonThiokol to a continuation of a faulty design,&quot; Sen. ErnestHollings (D., S.C.) said at the hearing.   Four other companies are vying to share the booster-rocket business with Morton: Hercules Inc., Aerojet-General Corp., United Technologies Corp. and Atlantic Research Corp. A Hercules representative contended at the hearing that competition could lower the cost of the booster rocket as much as one-third. An official of United Technologies' Chemical Systems division said the company has studied ways of terminating the booster rockets in the event of a malfunction.    James Fletcher, NASA administrator, is scheduled by the end of March to recommend to Congress whether a second source for the rockets is needed. Whatever NASA's decision, revenues for contractors in general are certain to shrink. A NASA official said yesterday that the agency initially plans only three to five shuttle flights a year, &quot;nothing like the 16 to 25&quot; flights NASA had envisioned previously.    At stake for Morton is significant revenue: Katharine Plourde, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., estimates that the company's aerospace group posted about $20 million to $25 million in operating profit on $300 million in shuttle revenue in the year ended Sept. 30. The group's total pre-tax profit was $96.3 million on sales of $933.1 million.    Loss of any booster-rocket business also could damage the company's reputation and employee morale. The company's failure last year to win a development contract for a new B-1 bomber missile sparked fears among employees that Morton Thiokol's days as a government contractor were over. When the company won a small missile-development contract in December, &quot;there were people cheering and dancing in the hallways, screaming their heads off,&quot; said Rocky Raab, spokesman at the company's Wasatch, Utah, rocket facility.    In an effort to make a fresh start, Morton Thiokol has almost totally recast top management at the Wasatch plant, with nearly all those responsible for the ill-fated decision to launch the shuttle either retired or reassigned to non-shuttle operations.    The company's redesign of the booster rocket is aimed to prevent the problems of last January, when cold temperatures before the launch were blamed for preventing a rubber O-ring from sealing a joint and allowing hot gas to escape. The modified design includes three O-rings instead of two, as on the earlier rockets, as well as a heater to warm the joint.    James R. Thompson, a NASA official, expressed satisfaction yesterday with the redesign, but said the agency wants to see four full-scale tests of the rocket without any defects or problems before going ahead with the launch. </TEXT></DOC>
