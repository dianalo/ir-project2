The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries saysit will press ahead with efforts to establish closer ties withother oil producers. But the going is likely to be slow.   OPEC wants to persuade as many independent producers as possibleto join the cartel in restraining production as a means of boostingprices to OPEC's official target of $18 dollars a barrel.   Hisham Nazer, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, said Monday inVienna there was ``unanimous recognition in OPEC'' that it alonecannot keep supplies low enough to prevent prices from lagging.   Last week, a group of six independent producers led by Mexicomet with a committee of six OPEC oil ministers and presented anoffer: we'll cut our oil exports by 5 percent if you do likewise.   The two groups issued a joint communique declaring ``thebeginning of a new stage of cooperation'' among some of the world'sbiggest oil-producing countries.   But that's as far as it went. The non-OPEC officials left townand all 13 OPEC ministers spent four days debating the offer, onlyto suspend the talks after falling into a bitter impasse.   Cartel leaders said they were not explicitly rejecting thenon-OPEC offer, they just wanted more time to think it over.   The offer, by Mexico, Egypt, China, Oman, Malaysia and Oman, wasfor two months of production cuts starting May 1.   Now that the starting date has passed and the OPEC leaders havegone home, there is little chance that the two groups will get backto considering joint production cuts before next year. That'sbecause oil demand is expected to rise in the second half of thisyear, eliminating the incentive on both sides to grapple with theproblem of sharing any cutbacks.   This is likely to be welcomed in Washington. Energy SecretaryJohn Herrington has campaigned publicly against what he calledefforts to create a ``world OPEC.''   Even so, OPEC says it will try to sustain a dialogue withnon-OPEC exporters, including the Soviet Union, which ranks as theworld's largest oil producer. The United States is the world's No.2 producer.   ``It is important that we keep talking to them,'' RilwanuLukman, the OPEC president, said of the six independent exporterswho met in Vienna. ``The opportunity given to us is one that wecannot take lightly.''   The reasons are obvious. OPEC's capacity for influencing oilprices gradually has been eroded by the emergence of new oilproducers in all corners of the globe.   Ironically, it was the sudden and severe increases in OPEC oilprices in the 1970s that created the financial incentive forcountries to step up their search for oil. In recent years Norway,China, Angola, Colombia and many other nations have become oilexporters.   As production outside its control steadily rose, OPECreluctantly chose to cut its output in a vain attempt to preventprices from falling.   Today the cartel pumps about 17.5 million barrels a day,compared with a peak in 1978 of 31 million barrels daily. In thatsame period, non-OPEC output has jumped from about 22 millionbarrels daily to more than 28 million.   This year alone, non-OPEC oil output is expected to rise by800,000 barrels a day. OPEC's output probably will not grow at all.   All oil exporters naturally want as high a price for theirproduct as possible. But they seem to have little prospect forovercoming the political and economic differences that make formalcooperation with OPEC hard to achieve.   ``There just isn't a community of interest between them,'' saidPaul McDonald, a London-based oil consultant. ``You're either amember of OPEC or not; nobody's knocking down the door to joinOPEC.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Editors: Robert Burns has covered OPEC for The Associated Presssince 1982.</TEXT></DOC>
