Franklin Williams</BYLINE><DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   From time to time everyone forgets where heor she leaves the car keys, or the car. But can you imagineforgetting how to drive?   Whether it's an aged aunt, grandparent, or our own parents, manyof us have had some experience with older people who experiencefailing mental abilities. I am surprised how many people stillequate this loss with old age.   Thirty years of research on aging tells us that when memory lossinterferes with daily living, it is not normal but the result ofsome underlying disease. Identifying the disease isn't always easybut it is extremely important for the person with this problem tohave a medical evaluation. For some, the illness can be treated andthe memory loss and confusion clear up. For others, the cause is aprogressive brain disease, such as Alzheimer's disease.   Although there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease yet, thatdoesn't mean there is no treatment. Good medical care from someonewho knows the range of problems Alzheimer's patients have can helppatients live as normal a life as possible and make the job ofcaring for them much easier on their families.   We estimate that 4 million people in this country may now haveAlzheimer's disease, about 10 percent of the population over age65. Although uncommon in people in their 50s and 60s currentstudies indicate that by their ninth decade at least one of everyfour people will become afflicted. The economic burden is at least$80 billion a year _ enough to bankrupt a small nation.   Because many disorders mimic Alzheimer's, it is difficult todiagnose. In fact, diagnosis can only be made with 100 percentcertainty by examining brain tissue after a patient dies.Nonetheless, specialists at major medical centers now have an arrayof tests offering reliable diagnosis more than 90 percent of thetime, compared with 60 percent to 80 percent accuracy just 10 yearsago.   On the federal level, the National Institute on Aging funds 15Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers. And the U.S. Administrationon Aging and the Veterans Administration support long-term carecenters, important sources of research and training for those whodeal with dementia and other illnesses of aging.   On the state level, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, New Jersey, NewYork, California, Illinois, Maryland, Oklahoma and Virginia nowsupport specialized Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and treatmentcenters.   No one knows for sure what causes Alzheimer's disease. We doknow from tissue examined under a microscope that certain braincells stop working and die. Among the experimental treatments beingexplored are those looking at ways to stop or reverse brain celldeath. One especially exciting area involves use of substancesproduced in the brain that help nerve cells thrive. This may holdpromise for treating neurological diseases and brain damage frominjury.   Many important research advances have occurred in the past year.For example, an abnormal protein that accumulates in the Alzheimerbrain has been found in the skin and other organs, one more cluethat this is not simply a disease of the brain, and a possible steptoward a simple test for it.   Another area that is of practical value involves patient care.While average survival ranges between six and 10 years, someAlzheimer's patients live more than 20 years. As the diseaseprogresses, the need for continuous care puts great stress oncaregivers. Studies of patients and their caregivers are teachingus how families cope and helping to prepare health professionalsand policymakers to meet their needs.   In the meantime, organizations like the national, non-profitAlzheimer's Association offer patients and families servicesranging from support groups to information on the disease andreferrals to community services. And every state and community inthe United States has a government agency on aging to assist olderpeople. Over half the states have task forces or commissions tostudy the problem of Alzheimer's in their state. Many offerAlzheimer's Disease Resource Centers, some with toll-free numbers.States with large ethnic populations like California, the Districtof Columbia, New York, Florida and Texas have educational programstailored to minority caregivers' needs.   Public@private partnerships are also springing up to meet theneeds of caregivers. One example is the Administration on Aging,which is working with the Alzheimer's Association and the RobertWood Johnson Foundation to implement dementia day care andshort-term respite services. Workplace programs are being developedby private groups like the American Association of Retired Personsand the Washington Business Group on Health in recognition of thegrowing impact of dementia on employed caregivers.
