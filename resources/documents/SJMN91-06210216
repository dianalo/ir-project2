Realizing that she might be self-consciousabout it, I said: &quot;Michelle, what's that big ugly wound on your upper arm?&quot;Sensitivity is the cornerstone of journalism.;    It turned out that Michellehad been bitten by a horse. It was her own horse, and it bit her while she wastrying to feed it. This is a typical horse maneuver. Horses are the oppositeof dogs, gratitude-wise. You give a dog something totally wretched to eat,such as a toad part or a wad of pre-chewed Dentyne, and the dog willhenceforth view you as the Supreme Being. It will gaze on you for hours withrapt adoration and lick the ground you walk on and try to kill thepizza-delivery person if he comes anywhere near you. Whereas if you spendhours grooming a horse and lugging its food and water around, the horse willbe thinking: &quot;Should I chomp on this person's arm? Or should I merely blow acouple gallons of horse snot into this person's hair?&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  West  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HOLD YOUR HORSES  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     I don't trust horses. &quot;Never trust an animal with feet made from the samematerial as bowling balls&quot; is one of my mottoes. I never believed those scenesin Western movies when bad guys would tie the hero up, and his horse wouldtrot over and untie the knots with his teeth. A real horse would size up thesituation and stomp on the hero's feet.;    I don't blame horses for beinghostile. I myself would feel hostile toward somebody who was always sitting onme and yanking on my lips. But what I don't get is, how come they're sopopular? Especially with women?;    Now you're probably saying: &quot;Dave, you'rejust bitter because in fifth grade you had an intense crush on Susan Cartounand you wrote 'Sue' on your notebook inside a heart, but the name inside theheart on her notebook was 'Frosty,' an imaginary horse that she loved muchmore than you, despite the fact that, if Frosty ever had the chance, it wouldhave got imaginary snot in her hair.&quot;;    Yes, it's true that I am a littlebitter about that. Also I have not forgotten my first experience with a horse.I was 9 years old, at a farm, and I attempted to ride a pony. &quot;Pony&quot; is amisunderstood word. Many young people, having grown up watching the My LittlePony cartoon show, believe that a pony is a cute little pastel-colored critterwith a perky voice and a nurturing personality and a 1973 Farrah Fawcetthairstyle. Whereas, in fact, a typical pony is the same weight as anOldsmobile Cutlass Supreme but with no controls or moral code.;    Anyway,following my sister's directions, I put my foot into the metal thing hangingdown from the pony (technically, the &quot;fetlock&quot;), and instantly the pony, notwishing to be boarded at that time, trotted briskly off, with my leg attachedto it. I attempted to keep up by bouncing next to it on my other leg, like thefamous Western cinematic star Hopalong Dork, but finally, in a feat ofastonishing equestrian skill, I fell down backward and got dragged across thefield with my head bouncing gaily behind amongst the cow doots.;    I couldtell the pony enjoyed this immensely. It couldn't wait to get back to thestable and tell the other horses via Snort Language.;    &quot;You should have seenhis hair!&quot; snorted the pony. &quot;He'll need to shampoo with industrialsolvents!&quot;;    &quot;Next time,&quot; snorted one of the older horses, &quot;try stepping onhim. It's like dropping an anvil on a Hostess Twinkie.&quot;;    &quot;And the legalauthorities can't prosecute, because we're horses,&quot; snorted another.;    So Istayed off horses altogether until 20 years later, when I was courting mywife. We were in the Rocky Mountains, and they had rental horses, and shewanted to ride one. Naturally she loves horses. As a child, she used to ride aneighbor's horse bareback, an experience she remembers fondly even though sheadmits the horse would regularly try to decapitate her by running under lowtree branches at 27 miles per hour. I don't want to sound like a broken recordhere, but why is it that a woman will forgive homicidal behavior in a horse,yet be highly critical of a man for leaving the toilet seat up?;    Anyway, Iwas in Raging Hormone Courting Mode, meaning I would have wrestled a giantsnake to impress my wife-to-be, so I let her talk me into getting on thisrental horse. It turned its head around and looked at me with one of thosehorse eyeballs the size of a mature grapefruit, and I knew instantly what itwas thinking. It was thinking: &quot;Hey! It's Hopalong Dork!&quot; So while my wife'shorse trotted briskly off into the scenery, looking for low branches to rununder, my horse just stood there, eating and pooping, waiting for me to putone leg on the ground so it could suddenly take off and drag me to Oregon. SoI sat very still, like one of those statue generals, only more rigid. I'd saywe moved about 11 feet in two hours. Next time I am definitely renting thesnake.;    Fortunately my wife's horse was unable to kill her, and we gotmarried and lived happily ever after, except that she keeps saying that shewants us to go riding again. I don't know what to do. I think maybe tonightI'll fix her a candlelight dinner, give her some wine, and put on some soft,romantic music. Then, when the moment is just right, I will gently but firmlybite her upper arm.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Dave Barry column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910728  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  27  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  980  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday July 28, 199100210216,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
