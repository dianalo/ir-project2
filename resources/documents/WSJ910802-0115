But the U.K.'s main provider of telephone service alsosaid certain local and national rates, traditionallysubsidized by long-distance charges, would rise by as much as5%, and the fee for renting a home phone line would jumpnearly 8%.</LP><TEXT>   British Telecom's new pricing schedule would reduce thecompany's revenue by about 1% a year, or #100 million ($168.7million), if calling patterns remain identical, said AndyGreen, executive in charge of pricing.   But Mr. Green said he expects patterns to change ascustomers sign up for the new plans and increaselong-distance usage. He declined to predict the overalleffect, either on British Telecom's revenue or income, sayingit depended heavily on economic conditions.   Groups representing telephone users welcomed the businessdiscounts but criticized residential rate increases. Stockanalysts generally took the announcement in stride, but weremildly surprised by the aggressiveness of certain price cuts,such as the 20% drop on calls to the U.S. and Canada,worrying that they might hurt earnings.   In late trading Thursday on the London Stock Exchange,British Telecom stock fell 3.5 pence to 382.5 pence a share.   The British government decided in March to open the U.K.telephone network to competitors, ending a so-called duopolyheld by British Telecom and Mercury Communications Ltd., aunit of Cable andamp; Wireless PLC. The proposals included allowingmore companies to apply for licences to run local,long-distance and international services.   British Telecom controls about 95% of the domestictelephone market, with the balance held by Mercury.   The new rate schedule had been expected, and will becomeeffective Sept. 2. Mercury said Tuesday that it would adjustits prices to maintain discounts over British Telecom's newrates.   British Telecom, a former state monopoly, sought to playdown the residential rate increases by noting that the medianbill for home customers would still rise more slowly thaninflation, and that the company's rates as a whole would dropabout 1%. The company also said it would introduce automaticvolume discounts for homes and businesses, and a plan forpeople who rely on the telephone for emergencies, but don'tuse it much otherwise.   &quot;This is just a start, as far as we're concerned,&quot; Mr.Green said of the new prices and service options.   Under an agreement with Oftel, the U.K.'stelecommunications regulator, British Telecom is moving tobring its charges into line with the actual costs for eachservice it provides. Thus, savings may be passed along tocustomers who make many calls or use cost-effective serviceslike long distance, while the price of normal residentialservice will rise.</TEXT></DOC>
