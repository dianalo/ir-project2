Ortega's leftist Sandinista government and 20 opposition partiesin Nicaragua signed an accord Friday calling for the U.S.-backedrebel force to be dismantled.   The issue is expected to top the agenda when Ortega and thepresidents of Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and CostaRica today open three days of meetings in this Caribbean resort 200miles north of Tegucigalpa.   Contra leaders met Friday in Washington with President Bush, whoreiterated his support for their cause. The United States wants therebels to remain organized until after general elections next year.   In the accord signed Friday, the Sandinistas pledge to hold freeand fair elections Feb. 25, without any restraints on campaigningor news censorship. They also promise to suspend the military draftfrom September until after the balloting to prevent it frominterfering with electoral activity.   The Sandinistas initiated the negotiations to defuse complaintsby opposition leaders that their candidates were harassed inearlier elections, their movements constrained and their exposureto the public restricted by news censorship.   ``Even though the opposition is not completely satisfied, theelectoral process is being channeled toward what the oppositionwants,'' said Jaime Bonilla of the Independent Liberal Party,speaking for a coalition of 14 of the 20 parties.   ``The accord reflects the common will to contribute toward thepeace process at the summit.''   The summit of Central American presidents is a follow-up to aFebruary meeting in El Salvador. At that meeting, Nicaraguapromised to hold democratic elections next year and the fivepresidents agreed to devise a plan for disbanding the Contra force.   The 11,000 rebels and their families are living in Honduran basecamps. They began retreating to the camps near the Nicaraguanborder last year when U.S. military aid ran out.   The United States is expected to continue giving the Contrasnon-military aid until the elections.   The Bush administration has said it wants to see democraticchange in Nicaragua before the Contras disband. It has not madeclear if that means keeping the Contras together as a fightingforce until the elections.   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said Friday in Washington thatthe rebels support the same principles laid out in the agreement.``We are not opposed to the question of reintegrating ourselvesinto Nicaragua under democratic conditions. But those conditionshave to be negotiated,'' he said.   Matamoros said the rebels could stay in Honduras until allissues are resolved or return to Nicaragua under conditionsnegotiated with the Sandinistas.   Honduras wants the Contras out as soon as possible. PresidentJose Azcona Hoyo has said he will present a plan for theirimmediate demobilization at the summit.   The presidents at the summit also are to discuss having U.N.observers monitor the Honduras-El Salvador and Nicaragua-Hondurasborders.   Salvador's new rightist president, Alfredo Cristiani, has saidhe wants to link Contra demobilization to ending the 9-year-oldcivil war with leftist rebels in his country.   El Salvador says Nicaragua is arming the rebels. Nicaragua,which describes its support for the Salvadoran rebels as moral andlogistical, opposes linking the two issues.   The Tela summit will be the fifth held under a peace plan thatPresident Oscar Arias of Costa Rica drafted in August 1987 tonegotiate an end to Nicaragua's civil war and leftist insurrectionsin El Salvador and Guatemala.   Despite the regional language of the accord, the focus hasconsistently remained on Nicaragua.   The Contras have been at war with the Sandinistas since 1981,two years after a popular revolution toppled dictator AnastasioSomoza.   An estimated 50,000 people have died in Nicaragua's war whilethe Salvadoran conflict has claimed about 70,000 lives, most ofthem civilians.   Nearly three generations of political violence in Guatemala haveclaimed more than 100,000 lives, the vast majority of themcivilians.</TEXT></DOC>
