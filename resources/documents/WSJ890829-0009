The thrift-reform bill that Congress recently passed set up two insurance funds to be administered by the FDIC: the Bank Insurance Fund for the banks and the Savings Association Insurance Fund for the thrifts.    The bill bars thrifts from using the FDIC logo or decal, but the thrift industry claims that it doesn't expressly bar the phrasing in ads. A spokesman for the FDIC said earlier this month that the agency has reviewed the law &quot;and we find no bar&quot; to thrifts' use of the phrasing.    Some Sandamp;L's around the country already have begun running ads asserting their deposits are insured by the FDIC. As a result, banking groups have protested to federal regulators.    Mary-Liz Meany, spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association, says &quot;both {funds} are separate. There's no commingling of funds.&quot; But &quot;the thrifts have said we now have this loophole because we're both under the same administrative boss.&quot;    Ms. Meany says the thrift industry's interpretation of the law &quot;goes against congressional intent.&quot; Congress barred the use of the decal, she said, and &quot;it appears schizophrenic that they would allow the use of the phrasing in ads.&quot;    She says that such use &quot;might mislead consumers because they might think that there's just one fund insuring these deposits.&quot;    But Barney R. Beeksma, chairman of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, said in a letter to FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman that the law &quot;states clearly and without equivocation that the FDIC is the insurer of savings associations formerly covered&quot; by the defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. Ms. Meany says that &quot;banks have long felt that they should have exclusive use of the FDIC logo and reputation. They look at it as the industry's Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
