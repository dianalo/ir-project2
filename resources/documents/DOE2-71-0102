The present article summarizes the study results presentedin the report, named ICRP Publication 49, published by the task group.Publication 49 consists of seven chapters dealing with the introduction,development of brain and auxiliary organs of embryo primates, retardeddevelopment of central nerve system, ionizing radiation as factor interatogenesis of central nerve system, maximum susceptibility period,risk estimation for human being, and necessity of research. Radiationmay cause either organogenetic or histological disturbances dependingon the developmental stage of the brain. Results of animal tests canbe applied to studies on the morphogenetic disturbances in human beings.Data on embryos and fetuses that received radiation in Hiroshima or Nagasakiare currently used for the estimation of the risk of disturbance in thebrain of human embryos and fetuses. Risk estimation for the brain ofhuman embryo exposed to radiation is discussed. (Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
