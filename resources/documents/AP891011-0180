The three-hour meeting with Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu andtwo other church leaders came a day after de Klerk announced hisdecision to free eight longtime security prisoners, including sevenleaders of the outlawed African National Congress.   In Washington, the State Department welcomed the plans forrelease and urged ``the release of all political prisoners,including Nelson Mandela,'' the nation's most famous prisoner.   ``I hope today's meeting will be looked on as a milestone on thepositive road ahead,'' de Klerk said after the talks.   But Tutu, the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Allianceof Reformed Churches, and the Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretaryof the South African Council of Churches, said de Klerk declined togive clear-cut responses to their demands.   ``We made it clear we need results,'' Chikane said. ``Withoutresults, we can't have negotiations.''   The clergymen demanded the lifting of the state of emergency,legalization of the African National Congress and other bannedgroups, the release of all detainees and political prisoners, thelifting of restrictions on political activity, and clemency forprisoners on Death Row.   ``If these things happen, we'll say to our people: give them(the government) a chance. They are serious,'' Tutu said.   However, the clergymen said they would press on with calls fortougher economic sanctions against South Africa unless de Klerkcomplied with their demands.   De Klerk, who became president in August, said the clergymenwere reluctant to trust his pledges to negotiate a new, justpolitical system.   ``We are really no longer arguing about the fact that all SouthAfricans must have a vote, that all South Africans must becomeinvolved in all decisions affecting their life,'' he said. ``Whatwe must now start talking about is how do we structure that.''   De Klerk opposes a one-man, one-vote system and black majorityrule. He has not specified what role he envisions for blacks in thenational government.   The president said his government planned to consult with a widerange of South African leaders as part of a step-by-step process tonegotiate a new constitution.   He declined to say when the eight prisoners would be released,but other government officials said it could be within days.   De Klerk said Mandela's status was not discussed at Wednesday'smeeting, but the 71-year-old leader is widely expected to bereleased within the next few months.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the U.S.government hoped the planned prisoner releases ``are merely thefirst steps in a process which will see the release of allpolitical prisoners, including Nelson Mandela, and the return ofpolitical exiles, lifting of the state of emergency and associatedrestrictions on political activity, and negotiations on a peacefultransition to a nonracial and democratic South Africa.''   Walter Sisulu, the most prominent of the eight prisoners, is aclose friend of Mandela and was a major African National Congressleader before the organization was banned in 1960.   Oscar Mpetha, who at 80 is the oldest political prisoner in thecountry, is also among the eight. He was seen Wednesday at GrooteSchuur Hospital in Cape Town, where he has spent most of hisfive-year prison term.   Police used tear gas and batons to stop black youths fromentering a sports stadium in the mixed-race township of Athlone,near Cape Town, where about 3,000 had gathered to celebrateMpetha's expected release. Police blocked the crowd from marchingout of the stadium, and the youths sang freedom songs beforedispersing quietly when they were told Mpetha had not yet beenfreed.   The Prisons Service declined to give details about where, whenand how each prisoner would be released.   In addition to Sisulu, those to be released include four othermen sentenced to life in prison with Mandela in 1964 in connectionwith a guerrilla sabotage campaign to overthrow the whitegovernment.   They are Ahmed Kathrada, 60; Andrew Mlangeni, 63; EliasMotsoaledi, 65; and Raymond Mhlaba, 69, all identified at theirtrial as members of the high command of the African NationalCongress military wing, Spear of the Nation.   Others to be freed are Mpetha; Wilton Mkwayi, 66, who brieflytook command of the military wing after the arrest of Mandela'scolleagues; and Jafta Masemula, a member of the outlawed PanAfricanist Congress guerrilla organization who was sentenced tolife in 1963 for sabotage.</TEXT></DOC>
