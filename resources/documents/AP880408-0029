That's how much it cost to provide the three candidates withSecret Service protection, according to administration officialsand government documents.   At one point in the 1988 presidential campaign, five candidateswere under Secret Service protection, not counting Vice PresidentGeorge Bush who gets it anyway by virtue of his office. The cost:$15,000 a day, $105,000 a week for each candidate; $75,000 a day,$525,000 a week for all five.   Now there are only two _ Democrats Jesse Jackson and Albert GoreJr. Michael Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, passed upSecret Service protection because, according to his wife Kitty,``it would be just one additional layer from the people.''   However, as expensive as $75,000 a day might sound, it palesagainst the $4.9 million it cost to guard Pope John Paul II duringhis 11-day visit to the United States last year.   Secret Service Director John R. Simpson and Francis A. Keating,assistant Treasury secretary for enforcement, told Congressrecently that the pope's visit to the United States was ``thesingle most dal 1989.   Candidate protection is determined by a five-member panelconsisting of a Supreme Court justice, the Senate majority andminority leaders and the House speaker and minority leader, whomeet and make recommendations to the Treasury secretary. Among thethings taken into consideration: the number of delegates acandidate receives and whether any death threats have been madeagainst the candidate.   If the secretary accepts the panel's recommendations, thecandidate is notified. To decline protection, a candidate mustinform the secretary in writing.   Simon gave up his Secret Service protection Wednesday, the daybefore he announced he was suspending all campaign activities.Gephardt quit the race March 28, surrendering his protection a dayearlier.   Robertson's protection ended Wednesday. He has all but abandonedcampaign activity.   Keating said the advisory panel did not recommend protection forerstwhile candidates Bruce Babbitt, Alexander M. Haig Jr. or formerGov. Pete DuPont of Delaware.   Along with Dukakis, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas also declinedprotection during his unsuccessful run for the presidency.   Walt Riker, Dole's press secretary, said Dole believes thatSecret Service protection is too expensive and ``limits where youcan go and what you can do. He likes to go out, meet the people andshake their hands.''   The converse applies, too.   On his first day without Secret Service agents nearby, Simon wasquick to exercise his new freedom.   He jumped into his Chevy Caprice, drove to a mall and bought twonew sport shirts for a week-long family vacation in Puerto Rico.</TEXT></DOC>
