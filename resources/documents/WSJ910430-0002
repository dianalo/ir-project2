The plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Cincinnatiwith Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr., aims to resolve $8.2 billionin creditor claims as of Jan. 15, 1990. Much of the debtresulted from the acquisition of the chains by Canadiandeveloper Robert Campeau in the late 1980s.</LP><TEXT>   Most creditors will receive cash, notes or equity inFederated Department Stores Inc., a reorganized companymerging Allied and Federated's nine department store chains.The stores include Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh and Burdines.When the plan is implemented, Federated will have no ties toToronto-based Campeau Corp. The plan calls for cash payoutstotaling about $850 million as of next Feb. 3, presuming theplan wins court approval.   According to the filing, Federated will emerge fromChapter 11 early next year. The stock then will be owned byabout 25,000 creditors, and any trading would be initiated bythose creditors. The stock is expected to be listed on theNew York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq before next Feb. 3. Theplan won't take effect until creditors vote on it and thecourt approves it.   &quot;It's a realistic plan, and early next year I expect thecompany to go public again,&quot; said Walter Loeb, a retailconsultant. &quot;They've centralized the buying operation whileeliminating many of their unprofitable stores.&quot;   The plan calls for Federated to issue 49 million shares ofClass A restricted common to Federated pre-merger bondholdersand the 92-member bank syndicate headed by Citicorp'sCitibank unit, which is owed $1.5 billion in principal. Anadditional 42.2 million shares of unrestricted stock will beissued to other creditors. The restricted shares can betraded only among institutions for two years; then theyconvert to regular common.   The success of the plan is linked to a separate plan ofreorganization filed on behalf of Federated Stores Inc., theparent holding company of Federated and Allied. Much of theplan concerns the distribution of stock of Ralphs GroceryCo., a successful supermarket chain based in Los Angeles.   Federated said tax claims by the Internal Revenue Serviceare &quot;expected to be resolved&quot; as part of the reorganizationprocess. Last summer, the IRS asked for $585.6 million.   Most trade suppliers to Federated and Allied will be paidin cash and notes in the reorganized company equal to 106.4%of their claims. But suppliers to Abraham andamp; Straus andLazarus will receive only stock equivalent to substantiallyless than 100% of their claims. Both chains are divisions,rather than subsidiaries, of Federated and therefore shareits obligations.   Although some creditor groups appear satisfied with theplan, executives at Federated and Allied have failed toresolve differences with senior secured bank lenders.Federated owes $1.5 billion in principal plus interest to a92-bank syndicate led by Citibank; Allied owes $350 millionto Citibank, Bank of Montreal and Cie. Financiere deParibas's Banque Paribas unit.   According to an executive with a senior secured creditor,who asked not to be identified, some creditors believeFederated and Allied should sell some department storedivisions, repay the senior secured creditors primarily incash rather than equity and emerge from reorganization as asmaller, more profitable company. This executive alsosuggested some creditors may ask the court for the right tosubmit their own plan of reorganization.   The reorganization plan filed yesterday includes no assetsales except those linked to previously announced storeclosings.   Lawrence Handelsman, an attorney who represents Federatedbondholders, who are owed about $1.2 billion, said heobjected to the filing of the reorganization plan because itdoesn't reflect agreement with the banks or Federated'sbondholders. &quot;One of our frustrations is that we have only asense of the plan, despite a number of discussions with thedebtor,&quot; said Mr. Handelsman, an attorney with Stroock andamp;Stroock andamp; Lavan. &quot;We urged them not to file the plan. This isa debtor's view of the way the world ought to be.&quot; Mr.Handelsman added that the filing could &quot;harden&quot; negotiatingpositions and could have an impact on the value of thecompany's publicly traded securities.   According to David Heiman, a partner with Jones, Day,Reavis andamp; Pogue and lead attorney for Federated and Allied,the Federated bank lenders and the pre-petition Federatedbondholders will be treated on an equal basis. Both willreceive their full claim of principal and post-petitioninterest in a variety of considerations including cash, notesand equity.   The Federated bank lenders will be due $1.96 billionincluding interest accruals through next Feb. 3, minus about$200 million already paid post-petition. The banks also willreceive a secured note of $625 million paying 9.87% overeight years, plus stock or other debt securities to bedetermined.   On the Allied side, Citibank is expected to receive $200million in cash. However, Banque Paribas and Bank ofMontreal, owed about $150 million, will receive stock insteadof cash.   Mr. Heiman emphasized that the $25-a-share value assignedto the reorganized Federated stock &quot;is in no way an attemptto strike a guess as to what the market price of that stockwill be a year from today.&quot; He said the $25 is based on thenumber of issued shares divided into the $2.3 billion equityportion of the reorganized value of the company.   Some involved with the reorganization discussions saidthey were pleased with the results. &quot;The plan allowsFederated and Allied to survive as vibrant retail companies,&quot;said Peter Solomon, chairman of Peter J. Solomon Co.,investment bankers based in New York and a principal adviserto Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., Youngstown, Ohio. &quot;It will alsoeliminate the uncertainty concerning the future of Ralphs, aleading supermarket chain in Southern California.&quot;   Under the plan, DeBartolo will receive 60.3% of RalphsGrocery in exchange for forgiveness of a $480 million claim.In addition, DeBartolo will receive all the common of FSIShopping Centers Corp., which owns half-interests in fiveshopping centers; DeBartolo owns the other half.   Herbert P. Minkel Jr., an attorney representing FirstBoston Corp., which he described as Federated's largestsingle creditor and Allied's second largest single creditor,said it was unusual for a company to file a reorganizationplan without the agreement of the major constituencies.   &quot;This process is sort of like a horse race in that therewill be a finish line, but we still have no idea of where thefinish line is,&quot; said Mr. Minkel, an attorney with FriedFrank Harris Shriver andamp; Jacobson.   A spokesman for Campeau Corp. said the real estate companyhasn't yet reviewed the plan. &quot;We're aware of the key points,but we haven't approved the plans because we haven't seenanything,&quot; he said. &quot;We may accept, or we may want tonegotiate.&quot; Campeau owns 100% of the equity in FSI and AlliedStores Corp. and 92.5% of the equity in Federated. Campeau isalso a creditor of all three units either directly or throughsubsidiaries.   The next step for the plan is a disclosure statement byFederated. That statement, expected to be filed May 31,amounts to a detailed financial prospectus. Allied andFederated filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Jan. 15,1990.</TEXT></DOC>
