On Okinawa, the southern island where 35,000 U.S. troops jostlefor training space with 1.2 million Japanese residents, civilianscomplain that houses were hit by bullets in October and two tear-gascanisters exploded at a nightclub Nov. 19. The canisters sent scoresof people into the street, coughing and choking.   The tear-gas incident, which U.S. Marine Corps authorities saidwas under investigation, came one day after the abrupt transfer of aU.S. Navy skipper. His ship had embarrassed the Navy command byfiring practice shells that hit about 1,000 feet from a Japanesecoast guard vessel.   The Navy immediately expressed regret for the shelling, whichoccurred in Japanese waters near the entrance to Tokyo Bay on Nov.9, but the Japanese government reacted strongly.   Japan's Foreign Ministry lodged a protest with the U.S. Embassy,while several major newspapers published blistering editorials.   The Mainichi Shimbun daily called the shelling ``the result ofthe unbelievably slack discipline and lack of moral concepts of theU.S. forces in Japan.''   Said the Asahi Shimbun: ``It would definitely be risky if thingsof this sort were left as they are. Even a single miscalculationwould endanger human life. Besides, it would gravely affect the tiesof genuine friendship that exist between the United States andJapan.''   About 64,000 U.S. troops are in Japan under a security treatythat obliges the United States to help defend this country, with anadded major role in security for northeast Asia. The treaty alsoobliges Japan to provide the bases and training areas needed by theU.S. forces.   The vast majority of the Japanese support the U.S.-Japan securitytreaty and the country's anti-war constitution, which give theUnited States a prime role in defending Japan.   But this country never was occupied by foreign troops until itsdefeat in World War II, and Japanese are sensitive to the U.S.presence.   Leftists demonstrate against visiting U.S. ships that may becarrying nuclear arms, and the public reacts strongly when adangerous accident involves U.S. forces or when the bases appear tobe encroaching on Japanese life.   The U.S. Navy base at Yokosuka wants to build more than 800apartments but faces resistance from the neighboring town of Zushi,which has repeatedly elected a mayor who opposes taking forest landfor the military housing.   On Okinawa, prefectural Gov. Junji Nishime has blamed a string oftroubles on ``something wanting in the U.S. military's chain ofcommand or a decline of discipline.''   U.S. commanders on the southern island are reportedly reviewingsafety measures following a forest fire that occurred in a trainingarea in October and the discovery about the same time that aresidential area near a Marine Corps firing range had been hit bybullets even though firing on the range is supposed to be in theopposite direction.   Two Foreign Ministry officials went to Okinawa on Thursday tomeet with U.S. generals, inspect the firing ranges and talk to localofficials.   Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda said the local people'sattitude was a ``crucial element in the presence of the bases'' andwas important to the wider issue of U.S.-Japan security relations.   Okinawans also have asked that some land now in U.S. bases bereturned to civilian use for the growth of the island's touristindustry. About 20 percent of the island's 300,350 acres iscontrolled by U.S. forces.   An Okinawa official who requested anonymity said there werenumerous small annoyances like parachutists landing by accident insomeone's backyard or losing equipment that plummets to the ground.   ``Things may not be completely improved in a day or two, but weunderstand that the U.S. military is at least trying,'' the officialsaid in a telephone interview.   The Foreign Ministry commended the Navy for relieving Cmdr.Frederick H. Michaelis Jr. as captain of the guided missiledestroyer USS Towers, which fired practice shells in Japanesewaters. But the ministry spokesman said Japan was still awaiting afull report from the U.S. government.   The U.S. command said it was reviewing its investigation of theTowers incident and would not comment until the review was finished.Pending the review, Michaelis was reassigned to shore duty at theYokosuka base.</TEXT></DOC>
