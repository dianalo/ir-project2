This action is in accordance with afinding of foreign availability under section 5(f) of the Export AdministrationAct of 1979, as amended. As a result of this finding, a validated licenseis not needed for export to Country Groups T and V (except the People'sRepublic of China and Afghanistan) of microprocessor-based personal computersshipped as complete systems with all of the following characteristics:(1) A ``total processing data rate'' not exceeding 68 million bits persecond;(2) A ``total internal storage available to the user'' not exceeding 39million bits;(3) A word length of not more than 16 bits (systems with 16-bit externalword length and not more than a 32-bit internal architecture are regardedas 16-bit systems for purposes of this restriction);(4) A maximum CPU to memory bandwidth of less than 160 Mbits/s;(5) A CPU bus architecture that does not support multiple bus masters;and(6) The systems do not include controlled ``related equipment'' other thaninput/output control unit/disk drive combinations having all of the followingcharacteristics_(a) A ``total transfer rate'' not exceeding 10.3 Mbit/s;(b) A total connected ``net capacity'' not exceeding 140 MByte; and(c) A ``total access rate'' not exceeding 80 accesses per second with amaximum ``access rate'' of 40 accesses per second per drive.This decontrol does not affect microprocessor based personal computersthat are:1. Ruggedized above a commercial/office environment;2. Highly portable computers (those that can be battery powered or otherself-contained form of power); or3. Stand-alone graphics workstations with characteristics equalling orexceeding the parameters in ECCN 1565A Advisory Note 9(a)(7)(i) and (iv).For the purposes of this decontrol, personal computers are defined as microprocessorbased computers that are:1. Designed and advertised by the manufacturer for personal, home or businessuse; and2. Are normally sold through retail establishments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. This rule is consistent with Executive Orders 12291 and 12661.2. This rule involves a collection of information subject to the requirementsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This collection has been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under control number 0694-0005. As a result of this rule, areduction of paperwork burden on the public is anticipated. Affected OMBcontrolled collection actions include 0694-000, 0694-007, and 0694-0010.3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis hasto be or will be prepared. 5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. Section 13(b) of theEAA does not require that this rule be published in proposed form becausethis rule does not impose a new control. Further, no other law requiresthat a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public commentbe given for this rule. However, because of the importance of the issuesraised by these regulations, this rule is issued in interim form and commentswill be considered in the development of final regulations. The period for submission of comments will close August 17, 1989. The Departmentwill consider all comments received before the close of the comment periodin developing final regulations. Comments received after the end of thecomment period will be considered if possible, but their considerationcannot be assured. Accordingly, the Department encourages interested personswho wish to comment to do so at the earliest possible time to permit thefullest consideration of their views. The Department is particularly interestedin receiving comments on the removal of export controls in accordance withsection 5(f)(8) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, ``Removalof Controls on Less Sophisticated Goods or Technology.'' All non-confidential public comments on these regulations will be a matterof public record and will be available for public inspection and copying.In the interest of accuracy and completeness, the Department requires commentsin written form. Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, whichwill also be a matter of public record and will be available for publicreview and copying. Communications from agencies of the United States Governmentor foreign governments will not be made available for public inspection.The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained in theBureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Records InspectionFacility, Room 4886, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and PennsylvaniaAvenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. Records in this facility, includingwritten public comments and memoranda summarizing the substance of oralcommunications, may be inspected and copied in accordance with regulationspublished in Part 4 of Title 15 of the <T3>Code of Federal Regulations. </T3>Information about the inspectionand copying of records may be obtained from Margaret Cornejo, Bureau ofExport Administration Freedom of Information Officer, at the above addressor by calling (202) 377-2593. The Department will accept public comments accompanied by a request thatpart or all of the material be treated confidentially because of its businessproprietary nature or for any other reason. The information for which confidentialtreatment is requested should be submitted on sheets of paper separatefrom any non-confidential information submitted. The top of each page shouldbe marked with the term ``CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION.'' The Bureauof Export Administration will either accept the submission in confidenceor, if the submission fails to meet the standards for confidential treatment,will return it. A non-confidential summary must accompany each submissionof confidential information. The summary will be made available for publicinspection. Information accepted by the Bureau of Export Administration as privilegedunder subsections (b) (3) or (4) of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C.,Section 552(b) (3) and (4)) will be kept confidential and will not be availablefor public inspection, except according to law. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 799 </ITAG>Exports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
