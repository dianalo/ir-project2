The new &quot;lockout/tagout&quot; standard was significantly stronger than a proposal made in May 1988 by the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA indicated.    The standard will generally require that employers install locks to ensure that machines being serviced cannot be turned on inadvertently, OSHA said. Warning tags will be permitted when machines cannot be locked, or when an employer can show that tags will give equivalent protection. OSHA also said that each repair or maintenance worker must lock or tag a machine to ensure his or her own protection.    About 90% of existing electrical equipment and two-thirds of energy-control valves can accept a lock, OSHA said. After the standard takes effect Oct. 31, any new or overhauled equipment must accommodate a lockout device.    Last year's proposal would have given employers the option of locking or tagging, and would have allowed someone else, such as a foreman, to cinch the lock or tag the equipment for repair workers.    Some union officials questioned how firmly the final rules require locking and individual locking or tagging.    The United Auto Workers, which has pushed for 10 years for OSHA to require locking of the hazardous equipment, said the new rules seem to &quot;fall short of the protection American workers need.&quot; UAW President Owen Bieber said the rules appear to have &quot;loopholes which permit employers to escape the basic principle of 'one worker, one lock, one key.&quot;'    But the standard was hailed by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), the chairman of the Senate labor subcommittee who has accused OSHA of 10 years of &quot;shameful foot-dragging.&quot; He called it &quot;a big improvement over OSHA's initial proposal, which would not have saved lives,&quot; and said the rules will require safety locks &quot;in the vast majority of cases.&quot;    The new standard can eliminate nearly 6% of all workplace deaths in places affected by the rule, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said. OSHA estimated that compliance with the rule will prevent about 120 deaths, and 28,000 serious and 32,000 minor injuries a year.    OSHA estimated the standard will cost the 631,000 affected workplaces, mostly in manufacturing and service industries, $214 million the first year and $135 million annually in later years.    It said the regulations will cover 39 million workers who could be exposed to hazards from unsecured equipment, with the greatest risk to three million people who actually service the equipment. Packaging and wrapping equipment, printing presses and conveyors account for a high proportion of accidents caused by failure to lock or tag the equipment, OSHA said.    Under the standard, employers must use additional means to ensure safety when tags are used, the agency said. Specific written instructions must usually be given for shutting down and isolating the equipment and for the locking or tagging; workers must be trained to follow those procedures; and annual inspections of energy-control procedures are required. </TEXT></DOC>
