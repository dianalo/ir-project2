(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state trooper serving an arrestwarrant for an unpaid traffic ticket was shot dead Saturday by theviolator, who was then killed by police.   The gunman, Ercil Layton, 62, fired at Trooper J.T. Brammer andhis partner after they entered his house around noon to serve thewarrant for three missed appearances in traffic court, police said.   Brammer, 42, was killed and his partner, R.J. Hicks, 35, waswounded in the upper arm, officials said. It was not immediatelyclear whether the troopers returned the fire or whether Layton shothimself.   ``A damned traffic ticket,'' state police Lt. Perry Fergusonsaid. ``It's a hell of a price to pay.''   Hicks was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the upperarm at Ruby Memorial Hospital in nearby Morgantown, a hospitalsupervisor said.   ``It's my understanding that (Layton's) wife came to the doorand let the officers in,'' state police Lt. Col. G.R. Young said ata news conference. ``They went into the house and from then on,things got bad.''   Brammer was found dead in a bedroom to the right of a hallwaythat leads from the front door of the house. Layton was found aliveon the floor of a utility room at the end of the hallway. He diedon the way to the hospital, Ferguson said.   Officers found a 30.06 high-powered rifle and a 32-caliberhandgun in the Layton home. Young said he did not know if theweapons were used in the shootings.   Police said the traffic ticket was related to an April 1988incident in which Layton allegedly struck an unattended vehicle andleft the scene. According to the warrant, Layton missed courthearings in January, February and earlier this month.   The two troopers were going to take Layton to the Preston CountyCourthouse to pay the fines, Young said.
