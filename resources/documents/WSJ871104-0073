Separately, a federal grand jury in San Francisco indicted four individuals, including a long-wanted suspect now in Canadian custody, for attempting illegally to divert designs for a U.S.-made supercomputer to the Soviet Union.    Paul Freedenberg, acting under secretary of commerce for export administration, said both cases involve attempts by suspected Eastern bloc agents to steal technology vital to the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as Star Wars. &quot;We're a decade ahead of the Eastern bloc in this Star Wars technology,&quot; he said. &quot;We're determined to keep that lead.&quot;    The Commerce Department identified the four individuals indicted in North Carolina as Yoshio Fujinuma and Keisuke Katsuta, both of Tokyo-based Kurimoto Trading Co.; and Istvan Rona and Clara Uitz, both Hungarian nationals. None of the four is believed currently to be in the U.S.    The indictment alleges that the two Hungarians, who were members of the Hungarian embassy staff in Tokyo, arranged in 1982 and 1983 for the Japanese traders to acquire the device, a laser trimmer, and ship it to Tokyo under falsified documents. The Japanese allegedly used an American intermediary, identified in the indictment as Charles Moyer, to purchase the trimmer from a U.S. manufacturer. The Commerce Department said Mr. Moyer pleaded guilty to charges of involvement in this scheme after he was arrested by the department's agents in Charlotte, N.C. on Sept. 24.    The California indictment named the suspects as Charles McVey, a one-time fugitive who was recently arrested and detained by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; Kevin Anderson, a Fremont, Calif., software designer, Ivan-Pierre Batinic, an engineer from the same California city, and Stevan Batinic, his brother, of Mountain View, Calif.    The document alleges that Mr. Anderson and the two Batinic brothers stole plans for a highly advanced supercomputer from a Silicon Valley firm and conspired with Mr. McVey to ship the data to the Soviet Union. The Commerce Department called the technology &quot;one of the most sought-after by the Soviet bloc.&quot;    The California plot was apparently foiled, but the Japanese-Hungarian group succeeded in shipping the laser trimmer to Japan in the guise of an ordinary &quot;electronic carpet trimmer&quot; and then smuggling the device to Budapest as part of diplomatically protected cargo, according to the Commerce Department.    The department said the U.S. hasn't decided whether to lodge a formal protest with the Hungarian government.    The laser-trimmer can manufacture high-speed semiconductors that can be used in a variety of advanced civilian and military computers, including ones that could be part of future anti-missile defense systems.    Mr. Freedenberg said the indictment of the two Japanese businessmen had no relation to current U.S. efforts to persuade Japan to strengthen its export-control policies.    None of the individuals named in yesterday's indictments could be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
