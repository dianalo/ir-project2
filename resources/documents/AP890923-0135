(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials declared a forest disaster inSouth Carolina on Saturday after Hurricane Hugo left half thestate's 43 counties with extensive or moderate timber damage.   ``It certainly is one of the worst forest disasters that SouthCarolina has seen in many, many years,'' said Steve Scott, aforester with the state Forestry Commission.   The storm, which came ashore near Charleston packing sustainedwinds of 135 mph, tore a path across South Carolina's coast earlyFriday. Although its strength was dissipated once it hit land, Hugouprooted trees and broke limbs as it quickly moved north into NorthCarolina.   Extensive timber damage, defined as an area that will require agreat deal of salvage, occurred in nine counties on or near thecoast. Moderate timber damage _ requiring some salvage _ occurredin 12 counties, and all the rest of the state's counties sufferedlight timber damage, Scott said.   Forestry is the third-largest manufacturing industry in SouthCarolina, generating $4.3 billion annually and employing more than30,000.   Seventy-five state personnel were surveying damage in thehardest-hit areas Saturday, and 35 tractors were brought in to helpsalvage efforts, he said.   Scott said he could not yet estimate the cost of the damage, andit was still too early to develop a replanting plan or ask forrelief aid, he said.   ``We will be working with all the private landowners in tryingto salvage the material,'' he added. ``It's going to be a big job.''</TEXT></DOC>
