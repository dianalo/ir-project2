Officials at Archer Daniels Midland Co., based in Decatur, firstapproached prosecutors under U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas about twoyears ago, the Chicago Tribune reported, quoting sources who werenot named.   A security guard answering the telephone at ADM's headquarters onSaturday said a company spokesman would not be available untilMonday.   The ADM complaint came at a time when federal prosecutors in NewYork were cracking down on insider trading on Wall Street.   The seriousness of the allegations of fraud at the Chicago Boardof Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange prompted Valukas to goafter similar corruption in his region, the newspaper said.   The investigation centers on allegations that as many as 100traders at the two exchanges systematically cheated customers out ofmillions of dollars in executing trades.   On Friday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Gillogly would neitherconfirm nor deny the investigation, but the Chicago Sun-Timesreported he and Assistant U.S. Attorney Ira Raphaelson were the leadprosecutors on the case.   FBI agents Richard Carlson and Michael McLoughlin began workingas trainees at ADM Investors Inc., the farm giant's commoditiestrading arm, in December 1986, and then acquired seats on theChicago Board of Trade, the newspaper said.   Richard Burket, an ADM vice president, told the newspaper the twowere employed by the firm, but he would not comment further.   In addition to the undercover agents, the FBI used six traderswho were angry about alleged corruption to inform on theircolleagues at the two exchanges, the Sun-Times reported, also citingsources it did not name.   About a year after the investigation began, the six were wired torecord conversations on the frenzied trading floors and duringsocial gatherings after work, the newspaper said.   The two exchanges were served with subpoenas Thursday demandingrecords of trades.   FBI spokeswoman Jane Koshutko would neither confirm nor deny theinvestigation Friday, but two law enforcement officials inWashington, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed itThursday.   The complaint by ADM indicates that some traders who deal in tensof millions in futures contracts a year were victims of allegedfraud at the exchanges.   While Carlson and McLoughlin were trading in the Treasury bondand soybean pits at the Board of Trade, two other FBI agents weretrading currency at the Merc, The Tribune said.   ``Everybody is obviously concerned about what this means,'' Boardof Trade spokesman Raymond Carmichael said Friday.   Commodities exchanges are hotbeds of capitalism in whichspeculators essentially bet millions of dollars on the future pricesof goods ranging from gold to Treasury bills to frozen orange juice.   FBI agents-turned-traders recorded conversations that suggestsome trades were rigged to prevent customers from gettingfair-market prices, and that some brokers sent false reports tocustomers to hide the skimming of profits of overcharges oncommissions, the Chicago Tribune has reported.   Fourteen seats were sold at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange andthe Chicago Board of Trade from Thursday, when the investigation wasfirst reported, through the end of business Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
