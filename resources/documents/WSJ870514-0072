Industry analysts and officials said that Boeing's willingness to provide seller-financing is directly related to price-cutting by Airbus Industrie, the aircraft consortium subsidized by European governments.    &quot;Airbus will make life unbearable, and there's nothing Boeing or (McDonnell Douglas Corp.) can do about it,&quot; said Alan Benasuli, aerospace industry analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    A spokesman for Airbus wouldn't comment on the consortium's intentions regarding seller-financing. &quot;Every deal is different,&quot; he said. Airbus, based in Toulouse, France, is financed principally by the governments of France, West Germany, Britain and Spain. Representatives of several major airlines didn't return telephone calls seeking comment on the Boeing-United financing.    Few industry observers expect aircraft makers to take positions similar to Boeing's convertible-note holding in Allegis Corp., United's parent; the notes are convertible into a 16% stake in Allegis. Aircraft makers &quot;cannot afford to take a controlling position in an airline and then try to sell airplanes to its competitors,&quot; said Steven Udvar-Hazy, president of Beverly Hills, Calif.-based International Lease Finance Corp. But, he said, the Boeing-United pact sets a new industry standard for manufacturer participation in airlines' finances. &quot;The unfortunate trend is if you do it for one, everybody wants it.&quot;    Industry sources expect much of the pressure to be on McDonnell Douglas, which is cash-poor and has rising debt, compared with Boeing's approximately $4 billion reserves of cash and marketable securities. McDonnell Douglas's new MD-11 is considered the logical choice for long-distance, wide-body aircraft that United plans to purchase for international routes that don't require the capacity of a Boeing 747.    But sources close to McDonnell Douglas said the aircraft maker can't afford to finance the purchase itself, and would instead have to rely on third-party leasing if it hopes to win the order over its Airbus competitor, the A-340. &quot;There's no way McDonnell Douglas can do what Boeing did. They're up to their eyeballs in debt,&quot; said David Smith, an aerospace analyst with Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc. in Baltimore. In St. Louis, McDonnell Douglas officials declined to comment.    Boeing, too, could eventually see its cash whittled away while it tries to preserve its 55% market share through seller-financing, analysts said. Mr. Benasuli said Seattle-based Boeing can't afford to tie up half its cash reserves this way while it faces the need to build inventories to meet production demands and to develop its planned 7J7 advanced-technology aircraft. &quot;Boeing dominates the market, but is not in the driver's seat anymore. Airbus is in the driver's seat,&quot; he said.    But some dispute the notion that seller-financing will be used extensively beyond special circumstances, such as when an airline is in serious financial straits or when two manufacturers' planes are nearly identical in size and performance. Although &quot;U.S. makers are trying to cling to their customers,&quot; they will continue to reserve financing for &quot;very specific, rare purposes,&quot; said one source.    The Boeing-United agreement is the most direct form of a seller-financing trend that began in 1982. That's when American Airlines obtained 20 DC-9s from McDonnell Douglas through short-term operating leases that required the aircraft maker to retain financial risk for the aircraft and gave it a potential share in the sales of the aircraft, if they were profitable. The pact was subsequently restructured, although neither party would disclose how.    More recently, Airbus has aggressively entered into financing pacts with Eastern, Continental and Northwest Airlines. In the most telling recent example of the state of today's aircraft marketplace, American in March convinced both Boeing and Airbus to agree to &quot;rent-a-plane&quot; arrangements that allow the airline, a unit of AMR Corp., to walk away from leases on 15 and 25 aircraft, respectively, with as little as 30 days' notice.    One industry source said that United approached Boeing several months ago to demand a similar leasing arrangement, but that the tenor of the talks changed to a request for convertible debt after United's parent received an offer to buy the airline unit from the Air Line Pilots Association. Boeing declined to comment on that report, and United couldn't be reached. </TEXT></DOC>
