Garcia</HL><DD> 01/30/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Most stock prices eased in active trading yesterday, as highflying airline and technology issues plunged.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 3.38 at 2160.01, marking just the third losing session in the new year.    The broader market indexes declined more steeply than the blue-chip average. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.16 to 274.24 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 0.53 to 156.19.    The Dow Jones Transportation Average tumbled 15.99 to 877.54. Airline issues were the big losers as some investors worried about an outbreak of fare wars among U.S. carriers, following news that Texas Air's Eastern and Continental units introduced fares that undercut industry supersaver fares as much as 40% and some regular coach fares as much as 80%.    Smaller-capitalization stocks were mixed, with the American Stock Exchange's Market Value index closing up 0.31 at a record 299.80. In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite fell 1.06 to 390.98.    At trading's start, the industrials rose briskly on foreign demand and buy programs tied to stock-index futures and options, traders said. But mid-afternoon, with the average fading, several sell programs quickly drove it down nearly 20 points.    Institutional investors weren't aggressive buyers and were careful to stay out of the program sellers' way, said Peter Furniss, vice president in the equity trading department at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. He said when the Sandamp;P 500-index futures began to trade at a discount from the actual index and it was profitable to buy the futures and sell the underlying stocks, many investors simply canceled their bids.    The industrials' loss of nearly 19 points at 3:30 p.m. EST was pared by closing, probably because of short covering by Wall Street traders, said Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers. He said traders, who had borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back at a lower price, probably did so when prices dipped in the afternoon.    Also, stock-index options and futures prices rose to fat premiums above the underlying index during the last half hour, triggering renewed selling of futures and options and stock-buy programs, Chicago traders said. But they said the late program buying wasn't as extensive as the early buying.    Airline stocks, pounded through most of the session, didn't benefit much from the late buying. UAL fell 1 7/8 to 53 3/8; Delta Air Lines, 2 1/8 to 56 5/8; AMR, 1 1/2 to 58; USAir, 1 1/2 to 40 1/4; and NWA, 3 7/8 to 63 3/4. Texas Air, which announced the lower fares, eased 1 1/8 to 44 3/4.    Many investors probably used the Texas Air announcement &quot;as an excuse to take some profits,&quot; said Michael Derchin, who follows the airline industry at First Boston Corp. These stocks were among the best performers of the new year rally and some money managers saw their expectations for stock-price performance fulfilled in just a few weeks, he said.    Despite the discounts announcement, Mr. Derchin said he hasn't changed any of his earnings estimates for the airline companies he follows. He still expects the industry to have a record year, both in operating revenue and in net income.    Profit-takers zeroed in on many technology stocks, traders said. International Business Machines fell 1 3/8 to 128 5/8; Digi tal Equipment dropped 1 7/8 to 144 1/2; Cray Research tumbled 4 3/4 to 109 1/2; NCR slid 1 1/2 to 56 1/8, and Unisys fell 1 to 96.    In the OTC market, Tandem Computers fell 2 3/4 to 52 3/4; Lotus Development slid 3 to 62 1/2; Microsoft tumbled 3 to 68 3/4; Seagate Technology dropped 1 to 26 3/4, and Ashton-Tate slipped 1 1/2 to 24 1/4.    Apple Computer closed down 1 1/4 at 54 1/8 after trading as high as 57 1/4 in the OTC market. Apple unveiled new communications products for its MacIntosh personal computer. There had been some expectations that the company might announce a stock buyback instead, traders said.    Raychem, a thinly traded and volatile chemical stock, dived 6 1/8 to 97 in heavy trading. The company said earnings for the second quarter ended Dec. 31 fell to $1.46 a share from $1.60 a year earlier.    American Telegraph andamp; Telephone dropped 1/2 to 25 3/4 on more than 3.4 million shares. The telecommunications giant reported 1986 earnings of five cents a share, after a charge of $3.2 billion, compared with $1.37 a year ago.    Marsh andamp; McLennan fell 4 1/2 to 67. The insurance broker said fourth-quarter net totaled 67 cents a share, compared with 50 cents a year earlier. Some analysts were looking for higher earnings, traders said.    Several stocks posted big gains on earnings news. Xerox rose 1 to 68 3/8; Chesapeake moved up 2 5/8 to 45 5/8; and Puerto Rican Cement gained 3 1/8 to 25. Xerox and Puerto Rican Cement announced strong quarterly earnings yesterday. Chesapeake announced higher earnings Wednesday.    Consolidated Edison fell 3 1/4 to 48 3/4 in active trading. Late Wednesday, New York state regulators ordered the utility to roll back electric rates 3.3% to reflect a lower federal tax rate and to set a lower return on equity. The cutback amounts to a $165 million annual reduction.    The news depressed many other utility stocks as the Dow Jones Utilities Average fell 2.47 to 224.61.    GenCorp slid 5 1/8 to 71 5/8. Westinghouse Electric plans to end its agreement to buy GenCorp's television station, KHJ-TV in Los Angeles. The agreement allowed for termination if the purchase wasn't approved by the Federal Communications Commission by tomorrow. Westinghouse eased 3/4 to 63.    General Motors rose 3 1/4 to 75 1/4 in active trading. GM Chairman Roger B. Smith got conditional support from some pension fund managers, but they told him that GM must improve profit, productivity and market share throughout 1987 to keep their backing.    General Cinema rose 2 3/4 to 51 1/2. The company announced Monday it acquired an 8.3% stake in Cadbury Schweppes, the British soft drink and chocolate company. Yesterday, Cadbury said any increase in General Cinema's position wouldn't be welcomed. Cadbury eased 5/8 to 34 3/8 in over-the-counter trading.    James River rose 1 1/4 to 40. Morgan Stanley reportedly said that the stock has lagged the rally in paper stocks and that the company expects to report earnings for its third quarter of 50 cents a share, nearly double 29 cents a year earlier.    Other paper and forest products issues were strong. Kimberly-Clark, which rose 9 1/2 points Wednesday after reporting higher quarterly earnings, fell back 2 to 106 1/2 on profit-taking. </TEXT></DOC>
