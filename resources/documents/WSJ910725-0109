Exxon, the nation's largest oil company, said earningsrose 2.3% to $1.13 billion, or 90 cents a share, from $1.1billion, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenueincreased 4.5% to $27.27 billion from $26.09 billion.</LP><TEXT>   Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., said net fell 24% to$269 million, or 94 cents a share, from $353 million, or$1.26 a share. Revenue rose 3.6% to $9.03 billion from $8.72billion.   Sun, based in Radnor, Pa., said earnings fell 63% to $43million, or 40 cents a share, from $115 million, or $1.07 ashare. Revenue rose 6.9% to $3.09 billion from $2.89 billion.Sun said it was studying a company consolidation that couldhave a &quot;negative impact&quot; on second-half results but didn'telaborate.   Gasoline refining and marketing margins in the U.S. wereweak because of the recession, oversupply in some parts ofthe country and higher prices for crude oil, the feedstockfor gasoline. The recession also reduced petrochemicalprofits. Depressed U.S. natural gas prices hurt thecompanies' profitability. Higher crude oil prices weren'tenough to offset these other factors.   Already this week Mobil Corp., Amoco Corp., AtlanticRichfield Co. and Phillips Petroleum Co. all reporteddeclines in second-quarter profits for similar reasons asTexaco and Sun.   The trend has overlapped into the current quarter, saidJames W. Kinnear, Texaco's chief executive officer. &quot;Productmargins, as well as natural gas prices, continue to be underpressure in the U.S.,&quot; he said. He added that Texaco isincreasing its emphasis on controlling costs and expensesbecause of the market conditions.   Exxon, however, is &quot;bucking the trend,&quot; said WilliamRandol, an oil analyst at First Boston Corp. in New York.&quot;Exxon is so big and diverse that no one thing can hurt themthat much,&quot; he said. In particular, Exxon has less exposurethan Texaco, Arco and some other companies to West Coastrefining and marketing, Mr. Randol said. Profits in thatregion have been especially slim this year.   Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, said earnings rose becauseof increased crude oil prices, higher natural gas sales inEurope, increased refinery output and 4% higher sales ofpetroleum products, mostly in the U.S.   The company said it spent just under $2 billion forcapital and exploration expenses in the quarter, up from $1.9billion last year. Exxon said that for the year it expects tospend more than $9 billion, not counting acquisitions.   In the quarter, Exxon said, it bought back about 4.1million shares at a cost of $228 million, for an averageprice of around $56 each. In composite trading yesterday onthe New York Stock Exchange, Exxon rose 50 cents to close at$59. Texaco fell 50 cents to $63.75; and Sun fell 87.5 centsto $29.   Texaco said it made $831 million of capital andexploration spending last quarter, up from $654 million lastyear. The company said much of the increase went toexploration activity in the British sector of the North Seaand the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
