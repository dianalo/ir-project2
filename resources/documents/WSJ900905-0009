The French decision, involving a multibillion-franc orderfor Mirage fighter jets, has until now been kept secret. TheBritish decision, focusing initially on a smaller delivery ofartillery shells, had been made public but waslittle-noticed.</LP><TEXT>   French officials declined to say whether they hadcoordinated their decision with allies. But one French sourcecalled France's military embargo a &quot;protective measure,&quot;aimed at ensuring that none of the equipment is passed toIraq, which has been receiving supplies overland from Jordan.   The French sources said only Iraq and Jordan are currentlysubject to France's military embargo, as the French considerJordan their only current military client likely to passequipment on to Iraq. The Jordanian embargo affects onlymilitary goods, unlike that of Iraq, which involves alltrade.   &quot;Either you are serious about this crisis or you aren't&quot;said one French official privately, explaining the embargo onJordan and the tough approach to Iraq. He also said Frenchtroops would be prepared to fight alongside the U.S. in theevent of a Middle East war.   U.S. officials said the U.S. hasn't embargoed armsshipments to Jordan, essentially because it has almost nooffensive military shipments planned. The U.S. currently isshipping just spare parts and minor items such as jeeps, anddidn't see the value of an embargo, these officials said. TheU.S. has supplied little military aid to Jordan in recentyears because of congressional cutbacks, and without aidthere are few U.S. arms sales to Jordan.   Indeed, both the Europeans and the Americans appear to beusing a carrot-and-stick approach with Jordan's King Hussein.King Hussein, long a U.S. ally, is caught between thatcommitment and the pro-Iraqi sentiment of many Jordanians andPalestinians living in Jordan.   The U.S. has gone out of its way in public to call Jordana friend. Asked yesterday whether he thought Jordan wasbreaking United Nations sanctions against Iraq, PresidentialPress Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said King Hussein pledgedduring a meeting with President Bush last month to abide bythe sanctions. &quot;Overall we think they are working fine,&quot; Mr.Fitzwater said.   The French are following the same policy. After a meetingMonday between King Hussein and French President FrancoisMitterrand, France pledged $750,000 in emergency aid to helpJordan deal with a flood of refugees from Kuwait. Butsecretly, France had made it clear to the king before hearrived that he wouldn't get any weapons until he moved intothe anti-Iraq camp.   Official sources here say the king avoided raising themilitary deliveries issue with Mr. Mitterrand, apparentlybecause he knew it was pointless. In his talks with Frenchofficials, he focused on the broad question of how to end thecrisis.   The main French contract affected is a sale of Mirage 2000jets by Dassault Aviation S.A., whose business in both Iraqand Jordan stands to suffer from France's Mideast policy.   The sale to Jordan was agreed to in April 1988 andinvolves a large number of jet fighters. Dassault and thegovernment refuse to say how many. One source said more thana dozen airplanes are on order and few if any have beendelivered. Dassault also had been hoping for a big Miragesale to Iraq, which now seems impossible.   Official sources said other French military sales toJordan also are embargoed, but wouldn't say what kind ofequipment is involved.   In Britain, a spokesman for the Department of Trade andIndustry said the British government last week revoked alllicenses for exports of military equipment to Jordan. He saidBritain's decision isn't &quot;ironclad,&quot; and it may authorizesome arms sales to Jordan in the future. So far it hasn'tchosen to do so.   The British decision was provoked when customs authoritiesnoted that a merchant ship, the MV Tara, was preparing tosail from Hull with a cargo of British-made artillery shellsordered by Jordan. The export license was revoked, theweapons were unloaded and the ship left without them.   British authorities wouldn't put a value on the militaryexports that are suspended, but said the amount is small.British exports to Jordan, both military and civilian,totaled #111 million ($210 million) in 1988.   France's stiff opposition to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait hassurprised some diplomats, because France has for years triedto build links to Iraq. Along with the Soviet Union, it hasbeen Iraq's main military supplier. Moscow has also cut offarms shipments to Baghdad.   French officials say the government for years has in factbeen split into a pro-Iraq camp and a camp seeking betterrelations with Iran. After the invasion, pro-Iraqi officialssuch as Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement have had totoe the official anti-Iraq line, much as they privatelydislike it. The group favoring closer ties to Iran, led byForeign Minister Roland Dumas, has gained favor, officialshere say.   One French official said France now favors a totalblockade of Iraq, including air and land shipments.Currently, though all shipments to Iraq except emergencysupplies are embargoed, the military blockade focuses onships. The Western powers aren't trying to stop air trafficinto Iraq.   This official said France even would be prepared to useits aircraft to prevent air shipments into Iraq, because itbelieves the current embargo isn't effective enough.   ---   Richard L.
