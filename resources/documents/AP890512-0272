Ron Utt did and what he found is not at all what he was supposedto find, and because of that a currently popular political view haslost some of its credibility.   That political view, often garnished with emotion, is that a cutin the capital gains tax, as proposed by President Bush, wouldenrich the rich at the expense of the poor.   The reasoning involved is that only those with big incomes arelikely to have capital gains, such as from stocks or real estate,because those on limited incomes cannot afford such capitalisticluxuries.   Isn't that what the earnings statistics show?   No, says Utt, former deputy director of the Office of Managementand Budget and now a fellow at the conservative HeritageFoundation. That might be what the statistics seem to show, butonly because of rather odd methodology, he says.   What makes it appear that only the rich have capital gains _ andtherefore can be the only beneficiaries of cuts in the capitalgains tax _ is that every so often those on limited incomes aretreated as if they were rich.   For many individuals, even those on incomes of less than$10,000, capital gains realizations are infrequent occurrences andreflect a unique, one-time event that pushes the taxpayer intohigher brackets _ for one year.   In the next year, the poor taxpayer might revert to the usualunder-$10,000 income, but only after he or she has left an imprinton the previous year's statistics, and thereby helped ``prove'' anersatz point.   Utt explains: Realized capital gains tend often to be suchnon-recurring events as the sale of a small business on retirement,an elderly widow selling her home, the sale of stock to pay for achild's education, the sale of a small portfolio that might haverepresented the meager savings of a lifetime.   Among these one-time capital gainers are spouses of brokenmarriages, who might have put all their money into a home, afterwhich real estate values soared. Now they are selling and dividingthe assets. Are they rich?   Prominent among those who might have capital gains are theelderly, who often sell their houses and move into smallerquarters. In general, they seek to live off their nest egg. Arethey rich, or only taxed as if they were?   In a Heritage Foundation paper supporting a cut in capital gainstaxes, and in an interview, Utt cited 1985 Internal Revenue Servicefigures to show that those on small incomes pay a huge amount incapital gains taxes.   The chart shows those people with annual income of less than$10,000, other than from capital gains, paid $35.3 billion incapital gains taxes, or 20.79 percent of all capital gains taxespaid in that year.   That amount was the largest for any income category other thanfor the unlimited ``over $200,000'' group. Even those withnon-capital gains income of $150,000 to $200,000 paid only $8.7billion, or 5.12 percent of the total.   It is extremely important, says Utt, to measure ``recurring''income, or the income a taxpayer can expect year to year.   When the distinction between recurring income and nest eggincome is made, he says, ``it can be seen that realized capitalgains actually are distributed rather evenly throughout the incomedistribution.''   But if you include those who are ``rich'' for just one year,then of course the statistics will tend to show that only those whoare fairly well off pay capital gains taxes.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv AMs Saturday, May 13</NOTE></DOC>
