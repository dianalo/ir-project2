Only 5 of the extant sites support populations of any significantsize (50+ individuals). Many of these populations are declining and arethreatened by the adverse modification or loss of habitat through cattlegrazing/trampling, clear-cutting and succession.

Leavesare alternate, pinnately compound with typically five to seven leafletswhich are ovate lanceolate to broadly ovate in shape. The inflorescenceis borne in the leaf axils and consists of racemes or compact panicles,5-15 centimeters (cm) (1.97-5.91 inches) long. Individual flowers are about2 cm (0.78 inches) in length and greenish-white tinged with purplish-pinkin color. The fruit is a cylindrical legume 13-20 cm (5.12-7.87 inches)in length. Flowering occurs from mid-June through August, with fruits presentfrom late August through September (Kral 1983, Medley 1980, Woods 1988).This species can be distinguished from <T3>Apios americana</T3>, the only other North American species of <T3>Apios</T3>, on several taxonomic characters. Most notable is the singlelarge tuber of <T3>Apios priceana</T3>, as compared to the multiple small tubers in <T3>Apios americana</T3> (ground-nut). <T3>Apios priceana</T3> typically has larger leaves, more leaflets, andlonger fruits. The standard petal (uppermost petal) is more yellow-greenthan purplish-maroon (as in <T3>Apios americana</T3>), and has a fleshy mucro-like appendage at itstip (Kral 1983, Medley 1980, Woods 1988).<T3>Apios priceana</T3> is of potential economic importance as a food crop.Its large single tuber is edible (National Academy of Sciences 1979, Walter<T3>et al</T3>. 1986) and it may have been a food source for Indians andpioneers (Medley 1980), as was the more common <T3>Apios americana</T3> (Yanovsky 1936, National Academy of Sciences 1979,Seabrook and Dionne 1976). Walter (<T3>et al</T3>. 1986) suggests that <T3>Apios priceana</T3> is perhaps most valuable as a source of germ plasmfor breeding with other <T3>Apios</T3> species. Such hybridization would increase tuber size andexpand land occupied, since <T3>Apios priceana</T3> can grow in highly alkaline, wooded habitats (Walter<T3>et al</T3>. 1986).This species was first collected by Sadie Price near Bowling Green in WarrenCounty, Kentucky in 1896 and later described by Robinson (1898). <T3>Apios priceana</T3> was transferred to <T3>Glycine priceana</T3> by Britton and Brown in 1913, a transfer whichwas invalid since <T3>Apios</T3> had already been conserved over <T3>Glycine</T3> (Woods 1988).<T3>Apios priceana</T3> is thought to be a native of forest openings (Medley1980). Populations occur in open woods and along wood edges in limestoneareas, often where bluffs grade into creek or river bottoms (Kral 1983,Medley 1980). Several populations reportedly extend onto roadside or powerlinerights-of-way. The soils are described as well drained loams on old alluviumor over limestone (Kral 1983). Habitat is described as mixed hardwoodswith such common associates as <T3>Quercus muhlenbergii, Lindera benzoin, Campanula americana, Arundinariagigantea, Tilia americana, Fraxinus americana, Acer saccharum, Ulmus rubra,Cercis canadensis</T3>, and <T3>Parthenocissus quinquefolius</T3> (Medley 1980).<T3>Apios priceana</T3> has been reported from 21 sites in 5 states; however,approximately 40 percent of these are apparently no longer thought extant.Currently, this species is known to exist at only 13 sites with populationsin Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennsessee. A summary of the informationcurrently available on the status of <T3>Apios priceana</T3> throughout its range is given below.<T3>Alabama: </T3>There are three populations of <T3>Apios priceana</T3> in Alabama. Modest populations (15-30 individuals)occur in Madison County and in Autauga County. The third site, locatedin Marshall County, supports a poor population (less than five individuals)which was reportedly etiolated due to excessive shading (Medley 1980).<T3>Illinois: Apios priceana </T3>was discovered in Union County, Illinois,in 1941 (Kurz and Bowles 1981). This population has not been relocatedsince the 1970s despite extensive searches by many individuals (Kurz andBowles 1981, Woods 1988). It is possible that this particular populationwas destroyed by flooding from a beaver dam; however, suitable habitatstill exists in the area, so <T3>Apios priceana</T3> could be rediscovered there in the future (J. Schwegmann,Illinois Natural Heritage Inventory, personal communication).<T3>Kentucky: </T3>Eight records of <T3>Apios priceana</T3> are reported for Kentucky (Medley 1980); however,only three of these are thought extant today and all of these are declining(R. Athey, botanist, personal communication; Woods 1988). The LivingstonCounty population, which was estimated as having 50-65 plants in 1984,has been severely degraded since cattle were introduced into the area in1986 (Woods 1988). At the Trigg County and Lyon County sites, plants extendonto a roadside or powerline right-of-way. The number of plants at theLyon County site is estimated at 25-30 individuals and only a few plantsare reported for the Trigg County population (Woods 1988).<T3>Mississippi: </T3>This State supports the largest number of populations,with four sites in three counties (Oktibbeha, Clay, Lee). Two moderate-sizedpopulations (50-80 individuals) are known to occur in Oktibbeha County(W. Morris, Mississippi State University, personal communication; K. Gordon,Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, personal communication). The ClayCounty site contains a declining population of 15-20 individuals. The largestpopulation in the State is in Lee County, where several hundred plantsare estimated to occur over an acre of area.<T3>Tennessee: </T3><T3>Apios priceana</T3> has been reported from five sites in Tennessee(Medley 1980, Woods 1988) but only three of these have been verified asextant in recent years (Woods 1988; P. Somers, Tennessee Ecological ServicesDivision, personal communication). A large, vigorous population of <T3>Apios priceana</T3> occurs in Marion County where hundreds of plantsare reportedly scattered on a bluff near a roadside (Woods 1988). A smallbut vigorous population (20-30 individuals), is located along a creek inMontgomery County (W. Chester, Austin Peay State University, personal communication).The Williamson County population, located near a roadside right-of-way,consists of only two plants (Woods 1988).In summary, of the 13 known extant sites, only 5 support populations ofany significant size (50+ individuals). Three of the sites have only 5or fewer individuals and the remaining 5 populations have no more than30 plants. Most populations occur on privately owned land, including onesite owned by The Nature Conservancy (Montgomery County, Tennessee). Severalpopulations extend onto State maintained roadside or powerline rights-of-way.Two extant sites occur on lands under Federal jurisdiction, including theTrigg County, Kentucky, site, which is on Tennessee Valley Authority land,and the Autauga County, Alabama, site, which is on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers'land. The historical Illinois site is located on U.S. Forest Service land.<T3>Apios priceana</T3> is currently or potentially jeopardized by a multitudeof threats including cattle grazing/trampling, clearcutting, excessiveshading/weedy competition due to succession, and adverse right-of-way maintenancepractices (herbicide application).Federal actions involving <T3>Apios priceana</T3> began with Section 12 of the Endangered SpeciesAct of 1973, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institutionto prepare a report on those plants considered to be endangered, threatened,or extinct. This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was presentedto Congress on January 9, 1975. On July 1, 1975, the Service publisheda notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the reportof the Smithsonian Institution as a petition within the context of Section4(c)(2), now Section 4(b)(3)(a), of the Act, and of its intention therebyto review the status of those plants. On June 16, 1976, the Service publisheda proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (41 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700vascular plant species to be endangered species pursuant to Section 4 ofthe Act. <T3>Apios priceana</T3> was included in the Smithsonian petition and the1976 proposal. General comments received in relation to the 1976 proposalwere summarized in an April 26, 1978, <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication (43 FR 17909).The Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1978 required that all proposalsover 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period was given to proposalsalready over 2 years old. In the December 10, 1979, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (44 FR 70796), the Service published a noticeof withdrawal of the June 16, 1976, proposal, along with four other proposalsthat had expired. <T3>Apios priceana</T3> was included as a category 1 species in a revisedlist of plants under review for threatened or endangered classificationpublished in the December 15, 1980, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (45 FR 82480). <T3>Apios priceana</T3> was maintained in category 1 in the Service's updatedplant notice of September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526). Category 1 comprisestaxa for which the Service presently has sufficient biological informationto support their being proposed to be listed as endangered or threatenedspecies.Section 4(b)(3) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended in 1982, requiresthe Secretary to make certain findings on pending petitions within 12 monthsof their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 Amendments further requiresthat all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having beennewly submitted on that date. This was the case for <T3>Apios priceana</T3> because of the acceptance of the 1975 Smithsonianreport as a petition. In October of 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987, theService found that the petitioned listing of <T3>Apios priceana</T3> was warranted, but that listing of this specieswas precluded due to other higher priority listing actions, and that additionaldata on vulnerability and threats were still being gathered. Publicationof the present proposal constitutes the final 1-year finding that is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be endangered or threateneddue to one or more of the five factors described in Section 4(a)(1). Thesefactors and their application to <T3>Apios priceana</T3> Robins (Price's potato-bean) are as follows:A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range<T3>Apios priceana</T3> occurs as small disjunct populations throughoutits range. As stated in the ``Background'' section, only 13 of the 21 reportedpopulations are believed extant today. Several populations are threatenedby the potential destruction or adverse modification of their habitat.At five sites, plants extend onto or near roadside or powerline rights-of-wayand are vulnerable to accidental disturbances. Any future road improvements(expansion) or right-of-way maintenance activities (herbicide treatment)at these sites could adversely impact or destroy populations if properplanning does not occur. One population, located near a roadside in TriggCounty, Kentucky, has not been seen since the 1960s (Woods 1988) and mayhave been destroyed by such activities. The Service will work with thoseagencies responsible for maintaining these rights-of-way in order to providethese sites with protection. The Madison County, Alabama, site is threateneddue to its close proximity to a suburban area (Kral, personal communication).The type locality (Warren County, Kentucky) was also located near a rapidlydeveloping area and may have been destroyed by development (Woods 1988).Two populations, which are enclosed in pastureland, have been adverselyimpacted due to soil compaction and trampling by cattle. At the LivingstonCounty, Kentucky, site, 50-60 plants were reported in 1984; however, mostof these have been destroyed by cattle which were introduced into the areain 1986 (Woods 1988). The Clay County, Mississippi, population has beensimilarly impacted.<T3>Apios priceana</T3> is so rare that little is known about its responseto disturbance (Kral 1983). Apparently, this species can withstand somelogging in its habitat, as it has been collected in second growth hardwoodforest (Kral 1983). Being a native of forest openings, it is thought thatselective logging would probably enhance this species; however, heavy loggingor clearcutting would destroy it (Medley 1980, Kral 1983). R. Athey (personalcommunication) has observed the reappearance of plants in a site when thecanopy was opened by light logging. A historical population from CallawayCounty, Kentucky (Medley 1980), could not be relocated in an area whichhad been heavily timbered (Woods 1988). Many of the remaining populationsoccur in hardwood forests which have a potential of being logged in thenear future (Medley 1980). Biologically this species may require specificseral stages or seasonal perturbation (Kentucky Nature Preserves Commission1982). Further investigation into this aspect of the species' biology isneeded in order to perpetuate appropriate habitat conditions.B. Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposesAs discussed under ``Background'', <T3>Apios priceana</T3> produces a large edible tuber which may have beena food source for Indians and pioneers. It has been suggested that suchutilization in the past could have contributed to its decline and presentday rarity (Medley, personal communication; Somers, personal communication).<T3>Apios priceana</T3> is currently not a component of the commercialtrade in native plants; however, publicity from its listing could generatea demand.C. Disease and predationCattle grazing appears to pose a threat to this species in those areasenclosed in pastureland (Woods, personal communication). However, thisis probably secondary to the damage they receive from cattle trampling(see ``Factor A'' above). <T3>Apios priceana</T3> is not known to be threatened by disease.D. The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms<T3>Apios priceana</T3> is officially listed as endangered in Illinoisand Tennessee. Illinois law protects listed species on State property;prohibits the sale of State endangered plants; and prohibits taking withoutthe written permission of the landowner. However, <T3>Apios priceana</T3> is not currently known to exist in this State.Under Tennessee legislation, taking is prohibited without the permissionof the landowner. This State legislation does not provide protection againsthabitat destruction and has been inadequate in preventing the decline ofthis species at several sites. The remaining States in this species' rangehave no official protective legislation (Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky).The Nature Conservancy owns and provides protection to the Montgomery County,Tennessee, population (Barnett Woods Natural Area). A second population(Trigg County, Kentucky) on Tennessee Valley Authority land is affordedsome protection since it occurs within an area designated as a ConservationEducation Center (W. Chester, Austin Peay State University, personal communication).However, no protection is given to those plants at this site which extendonto the roadside right-of-way. Habitat which once supported a populationof <T3>Apios priceana</T3> in Illinois is within an area designated as an``Ecological Area'' by the U.S. Forest Service and would therefore be protectedin the event the species is rediscovered in the area.The Act would enhance the existing protection, provide Federal protection(see ``Available Conservation Measures'' below), provide an avenue of protectionfor plants on private land through voluntary Conservation Agreements, andencourage active management for this species.E. Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence<T3>Apios priceana</T3> is vulnerable due to its limited distribution andlow numbers at many sites. Three populations contain no more than fiveindividuals. The extreme rarity of this plant indicates a narrow ecologicalamplitude (Kral 1983). As discussed in the ``Background'' section, <T3>Apios priceana</T3> is believed to be a native of forest openings (Medley1980). Plants under a completely closed canopy do not appear as vigorous,as they are stunted and mostly vegetative (Medley 1980; Athey, personalcommunication; Woods 1988). Four populations are believed declining dueto a heavy canopy closure and weedy competition associated with naturalsuccession. The loss of many of the historical populations is perhaps attributableto this factor. This species appears to need some sort of disturbance toarrest succession.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining this rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferredaction is to list <T3>Apios priceana</T3> as a threatened species. This species is not inimminent danger of extinction. It has a wide geographic range and two populationsare in designated preserves. However, a downward trend is clearly indicatedfor this species (approximately 40 percent of populations not relocated),and it could become endangered in the foreseeable future if protectivemeasures are not taken. Critical habitat is not being designated for reasonsdiscussed in the following section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extendprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a specieswhich is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for this species at this time. Publication of criticalhabitat descriptions and maps would increase public interest and possiblylead to additional threats for this species from collecting and vandalism,activities difficult to enforce against (see threats factor ``B'' above).No benefit can be identified through critical habitat designation thatwould outweight these potential threats. All involved agencies and privatelandowners will be informed of the locations and importance of protectingthis species' habitat. Protection of this species' habitat will be addressedthrough the recovery process and through the section 7 jeopardy standard.Therefore, it would not be prudent to determine critical habitat for thisspecies at this time.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions by carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingare discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may adverselyaffect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.One extant population occurs on land under jurisdiction of the TennesseeValley Authority. This site is within an area designated for ecologicalstudy and is protected. A second site is on U.S. Army Corps of Engineersland. A historical population from Illinois occurred on U.S. Forest Serviceland. Suitable habitat still exists in this area so there is possibilythat a population could be rediscovered here in the future. However, thisarea is designated as an ecological preserve (LaRue Hills Ecological Area)and protected accordingly. Currently, no activities to be authorized, funded,or carried out by Federal agencies are known to exist that would affect<T3>Apios priceana</T3>.The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.71 and 17.72set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptions that applyto all threatened plants. All trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) ofthe Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.71, would apply. These prohibitions,in part, would make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdictionof the United States to import or export <T3>Apois priceana</T3>, transport it in interstate or foreign commercein the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer it for sale in interstateor foreign commerce, or to remove it and reduce it to possession from areasunder Federal jurisdiction. Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatenedplant species are exempt from these prohibitions provided that a statementof ``cultivated origin'' appears on their containers. In addition, forlisted plants the 1988 Amendments (Pub. L. 100-478) to the Act prohibittheir malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands, and their removal,cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying in knowing violation ofany State law or regulation, including State criminal treaspass law. Certainexceptions can apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.The Act and 50 CFR 17.72 also provide for the issuance of permits to carryout otherwise prohibited activities involving threatened species undercertain circumstances. It is anticipated that few trade permits would everbe sought or issued since the species is not common in cultivation or inthe wild. Request for copies of the regulations on plants and inquiresregarding them may be addressed to the Office of Management Authority,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 27329, Central Station, Washington,DC 20038-7329 (202/343-4955).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited</ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposal are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning:(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to this species;(2) The location of any additional populations of this species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by section 4 of the Act;(3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thisspecies; and(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts of this species.Final promulgation of the regulation on this species will take into considerationthe comments and any additional information received by the Service, andsuch communications may lead to adoption of a final regulation that differsfrom this proposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of theproposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to FieldSupervisor (see ``<T2>ADDRESSES</T2>'' section).<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="74">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Kentucky Nature Preserves Commission. 1982.
