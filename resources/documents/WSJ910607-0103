TheMembers are now busily making the same mistakes as they tearthe heart out of banking &quot;reform.&quot;   Though the Bush administration's reform bill passed aBanking subcommittee 36-0 last month, the Members strippedout its most important provision: limits on depositinsurance. Even the Brady Treasury's modest curtailment ofthe deposit subsidy lost on an 18-17 vote. This can only beunderstood as a decision that deposit insurance is acongressional favor to be handed out to financialinstitutions to attract cheap deposits -- which is the samelogic that got us into the Sandamp;L mess.</LP><TEXT>   Chairman Henry Gonzalez and his committee are taking usback to 1980, when former Chairman Fernand St Germain boosteddeposit insurance to $100,000 an account (from $40,000) inthe dead of night. To prevent another Sandamp;L disaster, we needto limit the deposit-insurance subsidy. A banking &quot;reform&quot;without such limits is just another Nightmare on PennsylvaniaAvenue.   We know the public-interest rationale for depositinsurance is to avoid bank runs. But even granting thatpoint, we ought to seek the minimum amount of insurance thatwould serve this purpose. Mr. St Germain's $100,000 wasmerely a nice round number, the arbitrary choice of bankinglobbyists. Even most liberals now understand that for mostAmericans $40,000 is more than enough to safeguard theirsavings. The rest is just a subsidy to the wealthy, andespecially to bankers who can gamble with loans knowing theyhave a taxpayer IOU.   How or how much to limit deposit insurance obviouslydepends in part on what is politically possible. TheTreasury's plan was too modest for our liking, but its defeatis a chance to put other ideas on the table. Lowell Bryan,McKinsey's banking expert, recently suggested on this pagethat banks accepting insured deposits be subject to someinterest-rate regulation. Put it this way: People, includingbankers, who want federal subsidies and safety nets aren't inmuch of a position to whine if their Faustian bargainincludes constraints on their profit-making potential.   In the Senate, Illinois Democrat Alan Dixon has anappealing idea to insure deposits based more on a bank'sactual risk of failure. The FDIC would introduce a smallelement of private insurance as a way to let the marketplacedetermine relative levels of bank risk. Depositors wouldstill be protected up to $100,000, but they'd know whichbanks are more likely to fail because they're making riskierloans. Bankers flying high on the deposit subsidy would haveto pay more in insurance premiums for any imprudentrisk-taking.   Both of these ideas (and there are others) are superior tothe Freddy's nightmare that Congress now wants to relive. TheHouse Banking Committee wants to keep the insurance buttighten government &quot;supervision,&quot; as if the government cansomehow ensure that every loan made by every banker is OK.Just think about this for a second to see how silly it is: Ifbankers themselves can't always judge loan risk correctly,how can a few distant examiners?   The Comptroller of the Currency's office has 2,376examiners to regulate 3,950 banks; that's less than one abank. The average examiner is 35 years old, with eight years'experience, and makes $47,500 a year. By what fantastic logicdo regulation's most ardent proponents conclude that thisaverage examiner can be an economically efficient co-managerof a Citicorp? Congress could always hire 100,000 examinersand pay them $250,000 a year, but by then we'd havepoliticized credit allocation.   Which may be what the St Germain sequel is really allabout. The House Banking plan maximizes the power ofCongress. The Members can take credit for providing theinsurance subsidy to bankers, then claim credit for hiringexaminers to &quot;protect the taxpayers&quot; from the bankers, andfinally, take credit for demanding that examiners go easieron the bankers. We have no doubt that after Sandamp;L memoriesfade, the Members will be back hounding examiners on behalfof favored constituents, especially those like CharlesKeating and Don Dixon, who are generous with campaigncontributions.   Paying $300 billion to learn this lesson is bad enough,but watching Congress do the whole thing over again is toomuch. Bankers aren't about to object to a subsidy, but theTreasury has a duty to protect the taxpayer. It can start bycalling a &quot;reform&quot; bill without limits on deposit-insuranceanother horror show.</TEXT></DOC>
