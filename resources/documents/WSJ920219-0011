The IBM vice president, Joseph Guglielmi, has a checkeredtrack record in the personal-computer industry largelybecause he was one of the main people associated with IBM'sOfficeVision project. The huge software project, designed toautomate all the routine tasks in offices, was announcedalmost four years ago but quickly bogged down. It was cut wayback a year ago after IBM had invested several hundredmillion dollars in it.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Guglielmi's reputation also suffers because he is oneof the main IBM executives responsible for OS/2, apersonal-computer operating system. OS/2's technology isgood, software developers said, and IBM has been pushing ithard, but it has languished for so long that it is givenlittle chance of overcoming the huge lead that belongs toMicrosoft Corp.'s Windows product.   In the joint venture, Mr. Guglielmi will run Taligent,whose mission is to produce a next-generationpersonal-computer operating system. His appointment isexpected to be announced as early as next week, the industryexecutives said.   The worry in the PC industry is that IBM will turn itsjoint venture with Apple into a typical IBM marketing effortand that bureaucracy could slow the pace of innovation, saidEsther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, an industry newsletter.The appointment of Mr. Guglielmi, a traditional IBM marketingtype, &quot;would certainly confirm everyone's worst suspicions,&quot;she said.   Ms. Dyson said she thinks Mr. Guglielmi got a bum rap onboth OfficeVision and OS/2; she blames the IBM bureaucracyfor smothering both projects. Mr. Guglielmi is known insideIBM as a personal favorite of Chairman John F. Akers. Aspokesman for IBM, Armonk, N.Y., added that, before gettinginvolved in personal-computer software, Mr. Guglielmi hadbeen involved with a string of successes, including theextremely profitable 4300 line of minicomputers. Thespokesman declined to comment beyond that. A spokeswoman forApple, Cupertino, Calif., didn't return a call seekingcomment.   The appointment of Mr. Guglielmi appears partly intendedto balance the appointment of an Apple executive, Ed Birss,as Taligent's chief operating officer. It also appearsdesigned to provide a balance of talents at the top, with Mr.Guglielmi providing the marketing background while Mr. Birssprovides the technical expertise.   Coming 4 1/2 months after Taligent was announced, though,the appointment will still leave the impression that IBM andApple continue to joust over details. The companies have yetto announce a head for their other major software venture,Kaleida. In addition, Mr. Guglielmi's appointment comes onlyafter another candidate was widely considered to have thejob, before being undercut by Apple engineers.   David Liddle, the well-regarded founder of MetaphorComputer Systems Inc., a medium-sized software companyacquired by IBM, had appeared for several weeks to be thefront-runner. He lost out apparently because he was both amember of the IBM camp and a strong technical person. TheApple engineers, who have already done the core of the workthat will become the joint venture's operating system,worried about letting someone from IBM have so much influenceover the writing of the actual code, industry executives havesaid. Mr. Guglielmi is more likely to delegate such matters.</TEXT></DOC>
