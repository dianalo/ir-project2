Things began to heat up late last year, with the turnout of more than 30,000 people at a demonstration in Turin opposing the current level of confiscatory taxation. Writing about that seminal event in the Journal, I concluded: &quot;There are signs that the political world will advise tax protesters to 'eat cake.'&quot; Unfortunately, that prediction was soon confirmed by the proposed revision of the income-tax structure, approved by the Italian government on Jan. 21.    The new system is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, but the change is trivial. Income-tax brackets are reduced to eight from nine; rates that used to range from 12% to 62% should, according to the new scheme, range from 11% to 56%. Those who were hoping for a radical revision of the old structure have every reason to be disappointed. This will have important effects in the coming months and years, on both the economic and political levels. The tax issue is finally coming into focus in this country, and the real question is not whether but when it will overwhelm the current crop of politicians.    On a practical level, the new plan has several flaws. It does not eliminate bracket creep (or &quot;fiscal drag,&quot; as it is called here) through the indexation of income-tax brackets and deductions, as was advocated by economists of different schools. The paradox is that bracket creep violates the Italian Constitution, which states: &quot;No personal or patrimonial obligation may be imposed except on the basis of law.&quot; The increased tax burden resulting from inflation and steeply graduated tax rates is not legislated by anybody. It is, therefore, a &quot;patrimonial obligation&quot; that no law has authorized. And it is not a minor &quot;patrimonial obligation.&quot; According to one estimate, bracket creep accumulated since 1976 yielded 24,300 billion lire in 1984, or 45% of total income-tax revenue that year. (At its current rate, $1 is equal to 1,282 lire.)    Tax rates that were introduced for the rich now fall, thanks to the combined effort of inflation and rate progression, on middle and low incomes. Taxpayers are starting to recognize that they are being exploited by a system that violates the constitution, and taxpayers are unlikely to be fooled, as often happened in the past, by small &quot;reductions.&quot; They are well aware that this kind of window dressing not only fails to reduce their taxes but that the minor reductions don't even prevent the tax burden from rising.    Take, for example, a net taxable income of 30 million lire for 1980, or $35,000 at the then-prevailing exchange rate. According to the tax structure of the time, such an income would have been subject to an income tax of 7,590,000 lire, or 25.3%, and it would have faced a marginal tax rate -- i.e., the rate on the next lira earned -- of 35%. Under the proposed reform, the same real net taxable income in 1987 (64 million lire, considering inflation) will have to pay more than 18 million lire in income tax, or 28.3%, and will face a marginal tax rate of 40%. Thus, despite two &quot;reductions&quot; in income-tax rates, both the total tax burden and the marginal tax rate facing the same real income will have gone up. If the government's proposal is approved, real after-tax income would be lower in 1987 than in 1980. So it is hard to understand what the minister of finance, Bruno Visentini, had in mind when he claimed that his plan would result in a &quot;tax reduction in real terms.&quot;    Mr. Visentini's plan does not even consider some small, but important changes that have been advocated. For example, if a taxpayer ends up paying more than he should, according to Italian legislation, he must wait for many years until the government reimburses him. In the meantime, he must pay his taxes and cannot deduct his credit. This system is not only unfair to the taxpayer but it is also a bureaucratic burden and possibly a net cost for the government, because of bureaucratic costs and interest payments. But Mr. Visentini does not seem interested in allowing Italian taxpayers to &quot;compensate&quot; tax credits and tax liabilities. In short, considering the quality of the proposed &quot;reform,&quot; it does not seem likely that taxpayers will be satisfied.    New initiatives are being taken. For example, another demonstration is going to be held on March 22, this time in Genoa. According to some newspapers, it seems that the Genoa march will have a new feature. Marchers will gather, at the end of the speeches, in a large square, where there will be several trucks of the association of blood donors, and the marchers will donate their blood. The proposed slogan is &quot;Better donate your blood than let the government suck it!&quot;    Such grotesque elements in the revolt of Italy's taxpayers should not mislead the government. The tax revolt is a serious movement, and the government would be foolish to ignore it. The political world has so far reacted in a mixed way. This is in some ways understandable. On the one hand, many politicians see the anti-tax movement as a threat to the existing political apparatus, because the movement has no affiliation with any existing parties. On the other hand, a political party that could convince tax protesters of its being seriously favorable to radical reform would reap substantial electoral benefits.    Politicians are further vexed by the fact that admitting that taxation is excessive would mean acknowledging that government spending has grown beyond an acceptable level. This is difficult for politicians under whom total government spending grew to 62.1% of gross domestic product in 1985 from 48.8% in 1980. Among various parties, the Christian Democrats seem willing to appease taxpayers; they feel, rightly, that the middle class has been badly hurt by bracket creep, and they'd like to do something about it. However, they are constrained both by the attitude of their partners in the coalition and by the fact that they've approved all the major spending decisions. The other coalition parties are divided. The Liberals openly support tax reform and promise to do something about it. Republicans and Socialists either deny that there is a tax problem or prefer to ignore the tax protests altogether.    It's almost as difficult for the opposition, both because the Communist Party has always voted for more public spending and because the Communists are reluctant to concede the failure of the welfare state. The Communists' latest strategy seems to call for some reforms in the right direction -- the largest communist union, the Italian General Confederation of Labor, for example, supports indexation of income-tax brackets together with the introduction of new taxes on capital gains and a &quot;wealth tax.&quot; The ultimate goal would be to appease taxpayers without any reduction in either the absolute level of government spending or of explicit taxation.    At this point, Italian politicians would be well advised to ponder Edmund Burke's well-known remark: &quot;To tax and to please, no more than to love and to be wise, is not given to men.&quot; And it's becoming ever more clear that if a political party really intends to increase its electoral support today, it must show its opposition to the present unacceptable level of taxation.    ---   Mr. Martino is professor of monetary history and policy at the University of Rome. </TEXT></DOC>
