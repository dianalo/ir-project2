But doubts about America are not confined toforeigners. Not too long ago, some American leaders warnedthat the country is at risk of a future of flippinghamburgers and sweeping up around Japanese computers.   Fortunately, the evidence is strong that those who arebearish about America's future are wrong about both the pastand the future. But the pessimism about America is sowidespread that talk of protectionism and a retreat fromactive involvement in international economic and politicalaffairs is again fashionable. The facts suggest that thoseseeking a truly effective industrial policy should actuallyfavor active American promotion of rapid world-wide economicgrowth in the context of free trade.</LP><TEXT>   Research by Andrew Warner of Harvard University and theFederal Reserve shows that, contrary to popular belief,America's advantage is in the production of high-technologycapital goods, and that this advantage has been growing. Akey reason for the recent boom in exports has been the rapidrise of world-wide spending on capital goods.   Back in the late 1960s, when by all accounts the U.S. wasthe world's industrial giant, manufacturing amounted to about22% of real gross domestic product. Much of thismanufacturing went into defense and the production ofconsumer goods from shirts to automobiles. Only 28% of themanufacturing base was devoted to capital goods such ascomputers, aircraft and industrial machinery, and only 20% ofAmerican capital-goods were exported. The total value of U.S.capital goods exports was just 1.4% of GDP.   Today, when some assert that the U.S. has lost itsmanufacturing base, manufacturing output has risen to 23% ofreal GDP. The share of the manufacturing base devoted tocapital goods has risen to 38%. This capital-goods boom hasbeen made possible by exports: About 45% of capital goodsoutput is now sold abroad, more than double the proportion ofthe late 1960s. Capital-goods exports now amount to 4% ofGDP.   Contrary to the pessimists' view, a major part of thisimprovement occurred during the 1980s, and particularly thelate 1980s. During the 1980s, the growth in real exportsamounted to one-fifth of the real growth of the economy.Inflation-adjusted growth in exports of capital goodsoutpaced overall growth by better than two to one. Since1986, the story is even more striking. Nearly half ofAmerica's real economic growth over the past five years hasbeen in exports.   Also contrary to the pessimists' claims, U.S. exports havebecome less based on farm and other primary goods and morefocused on high technology. Capital equipment has risen to41% of U.S. exports from 30% in the late 1960s, largely as aresult of the world-wide investment boom: As other countriesdevelop their economies, they purchase increasing amounts ofAmericanmade machines, computers and airplanes.   During the past two decades, the investment share of worldproduct has risen to 26% from 22%. In dollar terms, grossworld investment outside the U.S. in 1992 will be roughly $5trillion.   We should hope that this process continues, not only forhumanitarian reasons, but also to benefit the Americaneconomy. Each 1% in world investment spending produces a 1.5%increase in exports of capital goods, and almost a full pointincrease in total merchandise exports. Strikingly, not onlydoes the relationship between world-wide investment and U.S.exports pass traditional statistical tests easily, therelationship stands up to a wide variety of mathematical andstatistical specifications. In fact, the link between U.S.exports and world-wide investment shows some signs of havingstrengthened in recent years.   It is interesting to contrast the U.S. performance withthat of Japan. There is no evidence of a statisticalrelationship between Japanese exports and world investmentspending over the past quarter century. There does appear tobe some improvement over time for Japan, although thisimproving trend does not pass statistical muster. Further,even at its highest, the sensitivity of Japanese exports toworld-wide investment spending remained below America's.   One reason for the popularity of the pessimists' view isthat America's strengths are not apparent in goods thatconsumers normally buy. To see them, one has to visitfactories, construction sites and airport hangars -- not yourusual tourist stops.   The regional composition of investment also appears to beshifting in America's favor. Latin America as a whole andMexico in particular are increasing their pace of investment.During 1989, the U.S. exported twice as many capital goods toLatin America as did Japan. The other area of potentialinvestment in the years ahead is the former communist bloc,which could become a staggering source of future growth ofU.S. capital goods exports.   The most urgent message of this analysis is thatencouraging faster worldwide economic development might bethe single most effective policy for promoting the growth ofexports. The export-promotion policy that many suggest as analternative to freer trade is a reduction in the exchangevalue of the dollar. This has three potential drawbacks.First, it's not clear that a country's monetary authoritiescan control the value of their currency. Second, ifforeign-exchange markets perceive that devaluation is anintended policy of the U.S. government, interest rates inassets denominated in dollars might rise to offset theexchange-rate loss. Third, devaluation would reduceAmericans' purchasing power and standard of living.   Recent history provides a good test of the relativeefficacy of world-wide investment and exchange-ratedepreciation. The late 1980s were a period not only ofrapidly growing world-wide investment spending, but also ofreal dollar depreciation. During the five years following thePlaza Accord of 1985, the dollar fell 38% on a tradeweightedbasis. World-wide investment spending rose 38% over the sameperiod.   Over those five years, total U.S. merchandise exports rose$192 billion in inflation-adjusted terms. $106 billion of theadditional merchandise exports, or 55%, was statisticallyassociated with the rise of global investment.   Let there be no mistake: Neither America nor any othercountry can expect to enjoy an economic free ride. Americansshould continue their efforts to reform the nation's schools,increase the investment rate, encourage the naturalentrepeneurship of the population and subject governmentspending and regulation to rigorous cost-benefit tests. Butthese are commonsense ideas that we would be well advised toundertake regardless of the international trading situation.   There may be some advantage in having Mr. Miyazawa and hiscountrymen think that America is in decline. It probably paysto be underestimated. But we would be foolish tounderestimate ourselves. World economic trends are moving ourway and we do not need to be protected from them. Ifanything, we need to reinforce them and to increase ourexposure to them. The best industrial policy for America topursue is active involvement in the world's affairs topromote global economic development and free trade.   ---   Mr. Lindsey is a governor of the Federal Reserve, inWashington, D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
