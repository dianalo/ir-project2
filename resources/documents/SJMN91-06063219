And yourbudget. But when we asked Kim Guthrie, manager of The Limited at Valley Fair,to put together a fashionable spring outfit for $100 she didn't hesitate.;   The store is one of the leaders in knocking off young, designer styles intoaffordable clothing. Most items are well under $50. Guthrie's choices reflectall that, and spring style, too: purple stirrup leggings, a bold print top,wide headband and dangling bead earrings. The total? A cool $99.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  West  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  $100YOU'RE THE TOPS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See also related article on page 12 of this section.  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;It was the most colorful thing I could find,&quot; she says of this outfit.&quot;The leggings are a big part of the look for spring and they can be pairedwith other things that wouldn't look so '60s, too.&quot;;    Besides bright color,she was looking for a bold print, accessories that would get that '60s feelingand comfort. Those who think spandex is dangerous to children and other livingthings should think again.;    &quot;The big-over-slim proportion is flattering tomost,&quot; Guthrie says. &quot;The biggest part of most women is their middle and hip.The top is worn over and out, and it camouflages problem areas.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Michalene Busico  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910303  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  14  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  254  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday March 3, 199100063219,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
