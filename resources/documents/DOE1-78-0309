We implement infrared regularization by consideringthe model on a spatial circle S/sup 1/. Quantum effects modify the gaugeconstraints through the appearance of Schwinger terms in the gauge algebra.We perform a careful analysis of the resulting second class gauge constraintsby implementing Dirac's method at the quantum level and obtain the spectrumof the theory. We get a consistent unitary Lorentz invariant theory forparticular values of the counter-terms. We find that when we regulatethe fermionic sector of the model without reference to the gauge fieldsLorentz invariance requires that we add both Lorentz variant and gaugevariant counterterms.</TEXT></DOC>
