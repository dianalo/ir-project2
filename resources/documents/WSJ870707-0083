It's ludicrous.&quot;    Mr. Lytton's anger reflects a mounting outcry over the inclusion of the fragile Florida Keys in the Interior Department's five-year oil-exploration plans. Besides a big swath of the Pacific coast and Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the Interior Department tentatively included three major areas in Florida: off the state's Atlantic coast, off its west coast in the Gulf of Mexico, and along the 113-mile string of little islands forming the Keys. Interior Secretary Donald Hodel approved the final plan last week.    To some seasoned hands of environmental battles, inclusion of the Keys was a colossal misjudgment. &quot;Interior shot itself in the foot,&quot; contends Lisa Speer, a senior project scientist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. &quot;The Keys are what Florida is all about -- tourism and fishing and water-related recreation.&quot; Indeed, the Keys, with a population of 72,000, get about 2.5 million tourists a year.    The special favor with which Floridians regard the Keys unified the people as nothing else could have, Ms. Speer contends. In an almost unprecedented display, Florida's entire political contingent from governor to congressmen to senators has lined up against the federal plan to explore for oil off Florida.    Nowhere is the anti-exploration sentiment more evident than at the end of the chain in Key West, itself an oddity in these unusual tropical isles. A settlement of about 28,000 presided over by a mayor named Tom Sawyer, it's a meld of grizzled fishermen and gay restaurateurs, of renowned novelists and suspected drug smugglers, and of old weathered wood buildings, mangrove swamps, lizards and, always nearby, water.    But for all their diversity, the locals acted as one in taking Big Oil seriously. When a public hearing was scheduled on the oil issue, the original meeting had to be canceled and moved to a larger building. An estimated 400 to 600 people turned out for a fiery session that ran five hours. It ended only because the building closed.    Greenpeace, a radical environmentalist group active in the Florida leasing dispute, initially asked for a hefty buffer zone of 30 to 50 miles around Florida. &quot;Once we got here and started talking to the people, we revised our position and now object to exploration anywhere around Florida,&quot; says Lynn Davidson, Greenpeace's marine-habitat policy coordinator.    Keys residents contend their environment comprises their total stake and that it's more vulnerable than most. &quot;We have the only living coral reef (in the U.S.) just eight miles offshore,&quot; says Mayor Sawyer. &quot;Our economy is based solely on tourism and fishing, and both could be destroyed by an oil spill.&quot; Adds Robert Perry, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce: &quot;You can clean up a California beach, but you can't clean up a Florida mangrove swamp. If you destroy this environment, you can close down the Keys.&quot;    Down along the town fishing docks, where men are accustomed to making money from the water, exploration is regarded as a powerful dilemma. Peter Bacle, a partner in the Stock Island Lobster Co., a wholesaler that buys from fishermen, says, &quot;Like everyone else, I don't want to see a large oil spill pollute the area.&quot; But, he adds, &quot;If there's a large reserve, it would be insane to leave it.&quot; In any case, he thinks exploration should be pushed farther offshore.    The sizable gay community here also came out strongly against leasing. James Webster, spokesman for the gay-oriented Key West Business Guild, says his group is campaigning aggressively against it.    The Interior Department shows no signs of backing off. Many of the waters around the Keys are in or near &quot;areas of major interest&quot; for oil exploration, says department spokeswoman Janice Mosher. And both the department and the Florida Petroleum Council, an industry group, contend that the extensive environmental studies the government plans before exploration in themselves would be beneficial to the Keys and their protection. </TEXT></DOC>
