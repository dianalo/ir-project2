Ayer Dies</HEAD><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sir Alfred J. Ayer, the British philosopher whohelped popularize the notion that all philosophy can be reduced tolinguistic analysis, died Tuesday night. He was 78.   Ayer died after a lengthy respiratory illness in UniversityCollege Hospital, said journalist Nigella Lawson, whose late mother,Vanessa, was Ayer's third wife.   Ayer was known to generations as A. J. Ayer and to friends as``Freddie.''   His first book, ``Language, Truth and Logic,'' in 1936 was thefirst exposition of logical positivism in the English language.   The movement, which Ayer helped to develop in Britain, expoundsthe view that philosophical problems of the past can be reduced tolinguistic analysis, and that any idea that cannot in principle beverified by sensory observation is nonsensical.   Ranging widely between the ideas of linguistic philosophersBertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, it accepts that languagemust be strictly analyzed and redefined if there is any possibilityof using it as an intelligible means of logical argument.   The philosophical school of linguistic analysts now dominatesmany British and American universities.   ``Language, Truth and Logic,'' which jolted the metaphysicians byits assault on ``much of what has passed for philosophy,'' owed adebt to empiricists such as Russell and Rudolph Carnap. It broughtthe term ``logical positivist'' to the attention of Britishacademics.   ``I maintain that there is nothing in the nature of philosophy towarrant the existence of conflicting philosophical `schools,''' hewrote. ``And I attempt to substantiate this by providing adefinitive solution of the problems which have been the chiefsources of controversy between philosophers in the past.''   ``The principles of logic and metaphysics are true simply becausewe never allow them to be anything else,'' he added.   Ayer wrote ``The Foundations of Empirical Knowledge'' in 1940 and``The Problem of Knowledge'' in 1956, as well as volumes ofphilosophical essays and histories of modern philosophy in which heextended the traditions of British empiricism.   Born Oct. 29, 1910, Ayer was the only child of a French-Swissfather and a Dutch-Jewish mother. His father, Jules, a timbermerchant, became a naturalized British subject before the birth ofhis son.   Educated at Eton and at Oxford University, he was a philosophylecturer and research student at Christ Church, Oxford, from 1932 to1944, and dean of Wadham College, Oxford in 1945-1946. He served asan intelligence officer in France during World War II.   Ayer was professor of mind and logic at University College Londonfrom 1946 to 1959, then professor of logic at the University ofOxford and fellow of New College, Oxford, until 1978.   He was a visiting professor at New York University in 1948-1949,at City College, New York, in 1961-1962, and at Bard College in NewYork State, from 1987.   Ayer earned a first-class literary humanities degree at OxfordUniversity in 1932, then spent several months in Vienna where hecame under the lasting influence of the Werner Kreis, a school ofAustrian philosophers dominated by Wittgenstein and Carnap.   In the 1930s, he introduced and popularized at Oxford Universitysevere Viennese philosophical attitudes when Oxford philosophy wasconsidered vague and explanatory rather than opinionated.   Ayer married Grace Lees in 1932, and they had two children. Hissecond marriage, to American journalist Dee Wells, ended in divorce23 years later in 1983. He then married Vanessa Lawson, former wifeof Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson. She died twoyears later.</TEXT></DOC>
