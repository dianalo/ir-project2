Ty, 21, whointerrupted a conversation on a dingy corner in the Roxburyneighborhood to say he sells crack.   ``Drugs is very heavy down here. And you know why? McDonald'sdoesn't pay anything. Cocaine is here to stay. It's not goinganywhere.''   While he spoke, Ty, who wore heavy gold jewelry around his neck,reached under his sweatshirt to flash a chrome-plated revolver stuckin his waistband.   ``It's bull,'' added 29-year-old Ronald Gardner, who said he usesand sells drugs. ``They're not going to get rid of it. No way.''   Farther up the avenue of dirty vacant lots and boarded upstorefronts, two members of the Humboldt Raiders gang, which policesaid is known for drug dealing, declared Bush's anti-drug planpointless. The two wore fancy sweatsuits and heavy gold medallions.   ``I think it's crazy,'' said Huckleberry Ross, 18. ``They oughtto go right to Colombia and do something. It won't do any good toget rid of it here. You won't keep the gangs from selling it.''   Ross' friend and fellow gang member, 19-year-old Tyrone Stevens,said the White House should focus on providing more educationalopportunities for blacks to help keep them away from drugs.   ``They say they're going to spend money to fight drugs but at thesame time they're taking money out of our public schools,'' saidStevens, referring to the recent closure of several Boston publicschools. ``We can't get no education so we all do what we know best_ try and make money off drugs.''   Three young boys walking down Blue Hill Avenue who said they rundrugs for dealers were as pessimistic as the others.   ``The gangsters all want to make money, it's bad,'' said JerryTyler, 14. ``The only way they (the Bush administration) will do anygood is to pay them off with more money.''   About a mile down the street, 37-year-old Billy Bush sat among agroup of men outside a convenience store and questioned thepresident's plan.   ``There ain't nothing he can do about the ghetto,'' said theoccasional sandblaster who acknowledged being a cocaine and heroinuser. ``He can't win. There's 10 times more crack down here thanheroin. They stopped heroin a little bit but they'll never stopcrack.''   As he spoke, he gestured to a young woman standing on a nearbycorner waving at cars.   ``See, women in the ghetto are selling themselves for base,'' hesaid. ``Blacks are suffering because they're strung out on base.There ain't nothing these guys can do. They can't infiltrate theghetto.''   The conversation ended abruptly when an incoherent friend of hisapproached and tussled with an AP photographer, tearing her strobelight from her grasp and running away.</TEXT></DOC>
