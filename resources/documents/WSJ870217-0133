Nor does the hint of advanced medical technology provide an excuse, moral or economic, for government intervention.    Individuals using their voluntary economic and social institutions, rather than legislators, have the knowledge and motivation to best cope with complex social issues. The strength of this country is not the expansive use of politics, but rather the evolving free market, not only of goods and services but also of ideas, which The Wall Street Journal chronicles and, usually, defends.
