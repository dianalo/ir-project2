The directors also authorized spending as much as $50 million to buy back the company's common stock, an authorization extending through May 31, 1988. The board will consider additional purchases at that time, the company said.    Leon Hess, chairman of the oil company, had told the annual meeting in May that he would recommend declaration of the 15-cent dividend and a stock buyback program of unspecified size.    Hess omitted its dividend in March 1986, reflecting the impact of falling oil prices.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Hess shares closed at $37.125 a share, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
