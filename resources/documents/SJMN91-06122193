The 31-year-old trainer has brought a colt called Green Alligatorto the Kentucky Derby.;    At one time, Green Alligator was the only horseleft in Johnson's barn. Now, one year after Florida-bred Unbridled won theDerby, he's the only colt bred in the Sunshine State expected to start inSaturday's race.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DERBY PROVIDES A FRESH START FOR GREEN ALLIGATOR'STRAINER  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Kentucky Derby Notebook  </MEMO><TEXT>     He will be a long shot, likely going off at double-digit odds.;    &quot;We'remore reluctant to be here than wanting to be here, really,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;Buthe deserves a shot at it.&quot;;    Green Alligator has won only two of sevenstarts, including the California Derby at Golden Gate Fields.;    But he alsohas a Dosage Index rating of 1.35, the lowest of any of the Derby contenders.The Dosage Index is a figure derived through a complicated formula using ahorse's pedigree to determine if it can win at the Derby's 1 1/4-miledistance. Like a baseball pitcher's earned-run average, the lower the figurethe better. Since 1929, no horse with a dosage figure higher than 4.00 has wonthe Derby. This year, Strike the Gold, Wilder Than Ever, Lost Mountain andAlydavid have ratings above the statistical threshold.;    But dosage hadnothing to do with Johnson's decision to bring Green Alligator to Kentucky.Destiny had a lot to do with it.;    Last year, Johnson had four horses in hisCalifornia stable.;    &quot;One of them broke an ankle during a morning workoutand we had to put him down,&quot; he said. &quot;Another ran second in an allowance and,about a furlong after the race, he snapped his leg off. We had to put himdown, too. The third one was claimed off us. We got down to one horse lastwinter and that was Green Alligator.&quot;;    The one whose name was taken fromthe Irish Rovers' song. The horse had become Johnson's last hope.;    With hisfortunes spiraling downward, Johnson and his wife got fed up with theCalifornia lifestyle and the state's racing program.;    &quot;I'm not a speedtrainer and if you're going to go with your percentages, you've got to go withyour speed in California,&quot; he said. &quot;But the horses don't last long that wayand if you're small like us, you've got to make them last.&quot;;    So his familyhas moved to Kentucky with Green Alligator. The horse arrived in his stall atChurchill Downs late last week. Their belongings got to their new homeMonday.;    &quot;It's been a pretty hectic week, moving and all,&quot; Johnson said.&quot;This is my first Derby and we've got an unseasoned young horse with a lot ofability.&quot;;    Outside his barn Tuesday morning, Green Alligator nibbled ongrass and clover. A few admirers stood for a few moments and watched. Then,turning to leave, one said to Johnson, &quot;See you later alligator.&quot;;    Johnsongrinned. &quot;We hear that all the time, now.&quot;;  ETC.: For only the third time,the winners of the Northern California championship races for 3-year-olds willmeet in the Derby. Green Alligator will be joined by Sea Cadet, winner of theEl Camino Real Derby at Bay Meadows. . . . It looks as though a field of 16 islikely, with another one possible if Ron McAnally hops off the fence anddecides to enter Olympio. McAnally already has Sea Cadet, and almost everyother trainer in the race expects him to set the early speed. If McAnallyenters Olympio, who won the Arkansas Derby on April 20, he would have aformidable entry of California stars. The Arkansas Derby was only two weeksago, and McAnally says he doesn't want to run Olympio on such short rest.&quot;It's tempting, but you've got to do what's best for the horse,&quot; McAnally said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Louisville, Ky.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910501  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  669  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 1, 199100122193,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
