Thefactors involved in accomplishing technology transfer will be examinedbased on the 25 years of Westinghouse experience in establishing successfulnuclear technology relationships with over 20 different associates world-wide.This will include information pertaining to organization, training, consultation,technical information transmission, and other important aspects of technologytransfer. Additionally, the methodology of enhancing and increasing thebenefits of technology transfer through cooperative development programsas produced and promoted by Weatinghouse with its associates will beexamined. This will include reviews of several significant copperativeprograms, such as the programs for the Advanced Pressurized Water Reactorand the Integrated Protection and Control Systems for future plants.</TEXT></DOC>
