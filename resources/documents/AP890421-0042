PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Minnesota House tried an interestingangle when a debate over changing the date of the walleye fishingopener hit a snag over a conflict with Mother's Day observances.   Opponents said the change would mean the opener _ a cherishedrite of spring in the state _ would fall on Mother's Day weekend 18times in the next 22 years, compared with only nine times undercurrent law.   The law currently has the walleye, sauger, northern pike andbass season openers beginning on the Saturday closest to May 15.   A compromise amendment reached Thursday says mothers can fishfor free on the opening weekend of the season.   Rep. Dee Long asked how conservation officers would be able totell whether a woman is a mother and thus entitled to fish withouta license.   The author of the Mother's Day compromise amendment, Rep. DaveGruenes, retorted, ``I think what you do is ask; moms don't lie.''</TEXT><DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Florida Supreme Court has made itlegal. Legal documents can't be put on legal-sized sheets of paperanymore.   The high court, in an order issued Thursday, said filings ofpleadings, motions and other documents in all state courtsbeginning Jan. 1 must be on 8{-by-11-inch paper.   Chief Justice Raymond Ehrlich, who issued the ruling onlegal-size paper, said federal appellate courts require theletter-size paper. There is no rule now specifying the size ofpaper to be used in Florida courts, but legal-sized sheets _ 8{ by14 inches _ are common.   Clerks at the Palm Beach County Courthouse were bewildered bythe Supreme Court's interest in paper size. Most shook their heads,raised their eyebrows and wondered if the high court didn't haveenough work to do.   ``It will probably save a few trees,'' admitted Mary AnnSusdorf, supervisor of the felony division. ``Isn't that the wholeidea?''</TEXT></DOC>
