As approved by IMF executive directors, the new Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility would allow such middle-income debtor nations as Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, as well as the poorest Third World debtor nations in Africa and Asia to seek the new type of IMF loans.    IMF officials said they couldn't predict how soon they might be approving the new type of credits, to be provided from the 151-nation agency's ordinary financial resources at 5.5% annual interest. The applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis, with the amount of each credit to be determined by a formula keyed to the size of a borrowing country's regular IMF quota or subscription.    The basic outline of the new lending program was approved by finance ministers and central bankers of the IMF's member nations last April when the IMF's policy-making interim committee met in Washington. At that time, IMF executive directors were instructed to work out the technical arrangements, which have now been completed. </TEXT></DOC>
