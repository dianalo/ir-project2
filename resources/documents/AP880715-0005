Raising their fists and chanting ``let our people go,'' thedemonstrators lifted the grey casket before the embassy entrance,as NAACP executive director Benjamin L. Hooks led the crowdThursday in a series of prayers that ``hearts might be changed.''   Hooks prayed that ``those white folk in South Africa, that callthemselves Christians, may start acting like Christians andrecognize that they are their brother's keeper ... that we are allone blood.''   ``We come here today in the spirit of Walter White, Roy Wilkins,Martin Luther King ... to say that we won't be satisfied until thewalls of segregation, apartheid and oppression are brought low inSouth Africa,'' said the Rev. Jerry Guess, NAACP communicationsdirector.   ``We come today praying that our own pharaoh, who sits at 1600Pennsylvania Avenue, will hear these voices (and realize that) wecannot exist in this world, half slave and half free,'' Guessprayed, referring to the White House address.   Hooks then pointed to the casket and pronounced sentence on thepolicies of apartheid, segregation, hatred, racial discrmination,unjust treatment and inequality.   He led the crowd in the closing words over the coffin, saying,``dust to dust, ashes to ashes _ apartheid you'll never riseagain!'' The coffin was placed in a white hearse as thedemonstrators sang ``Oh, Freedom,'' a song from the civil rightsmovement.   The half-hour march was the culmination of South Africa Day atthe 79th annual convention of the National Association for theAdvancement of Colored People. There were no arrests.   In the morning sessions, Sen.
