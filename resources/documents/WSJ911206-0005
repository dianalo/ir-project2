And ithas big problems.   Leaders of the 12 European Community nations will assemblehere this weekend for a meeting Monday and Tuesday that,according to the pre-summit publicity, will transform theContinent. On the agenda is nothing less than the creation ofa United States of Europe, with treaties binding EC states togreater cooperation in finance and defense, economics andforeign policy.</LP><TEXT>   The summit also will afford the final opportunity to pushfor completion of the 1992 single-market program -- themost-potent symbol of Europe's new dynamism -- which is dueby the end of next year. But already, amid glaringly unevenprogress on unity and a sputtering economy that makes furthergains trickier, the 1992 program is being overshadowed by thedebate over the future of Europe.   Here at Maastricht, EC leaders will be asked to throw awaytheir 12 national currencies and agree to a singleEurocurrency issued by a European central bank. They will beasked to submit to the collective will on foreign affairs.They will be asked to sign away their sovereign powers oversuch areas as immigration, the environment and labor andindustrial policy. And they will be asked to give theEuropean Parliament powers now held by national legislatures;these measures are needed to secure approval for theMaastricht treaties from the Europarliament itself.   Whatever the outcome, and it is in some doubt, thereverberations from Maastricht will be felt far beyondEurope. Supporters say the moves will make the EC as powerfulan international player as the U.S. Skeptics, citing Europe'suncoordinated economies and the EC's helplessness in endingthe civil war in Yugoslavia, say the moves go too far and aredoomed to fail.   &quot;One way or another, Maastricht is the start of a newera,&quot; says Stanley Crossick, a veteran analyst of EC affairswho heads a consulting firm in Brussels. &quot;We are trying toproject 100 years of American history into just a few years.&quot;   For the U.S. and Japan, the major question is whetherMaastricht will mark a great leap backward, toward a FortressEurope. Though America and Japan have lobbied strongly, andmostly successfully, to forestall new barriers againstoutsiders, Maastricht revives just that specter.   Of particular concern are measures that would give theBrussels-based EC greater power in social and industrialpolicy. These measures could clear the way for the EC topromote subsidies and create global champions in everythingfrom aviation to heavy industry to high-definitiontelevision. Indeed, Maastricht will be a failure, Dutch PrimeMinister Ruud Lubbers said this week, if it doesn't ensurethat &quot;Europe is more than just a market by extending the ECinto such areas as industrial and social policy.&quot;   Despite EC officials' assurances of their commitment tofree trade, such talk worries some people. &quot;I'm largelyindifferent to whether Europe has a single currency or not.We could manage our business either way,&quot; says MichelDavid-Weill, head of the Lazard Freres banking group, whichhas world-wide interests. &quot;But I am not indifferent to a freeand open market. That's what we must maintain.&quot;   With such fundamental issues at stake, Europe'spoliticians have been jockeying for position in a mannerunusual even for pre-summit negotiating. But the scramble hasbrought out more differences than common positions among the12 EC members. In the run-up to the summit, Europe has moreclosely resembled a chorus of harpies than a club of oldfriends.   Britain, as usual, is resisting most vocally. It won'tjoin a single Eurocurrency now, the first step on the&quot;conveyor belt to federalism,&quot; as former Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher put it. It will veto any treaty mentioningthe word &quot;federal,&quot; as the draft treaty on political uniondoes. And it opposes most aspects of social and industrialpolicy, which one British official says smacks of thesocialist &quot;nanny&quot; state the Conservative government has spenta decade trying to unravel at home.   But the Germans and Italians say they will veto any treatythat doesn't mention federation, and they think industrialpolicy isn't such a bad idea. Says a senior German ECofficial: &quot;To us, federalism means `States' Rights.' But aBriton associates it with central control. When you can't getbeyond such simple concepts, you really have problems.&quot;   So, as Europe heads to Maastricht, it seems less anunstoppable juggernaut than a Chinese fire drill, lessproductive than frantic. In scenes repeated across the EC,the British were lobbying for their position in Germany andthe Netherlands last week, and this week Prime Minister JohnMajor conferred with French President Francois Mitterrand andvisited Ireland.   Everyone is grinding his own particular axe. The Spanishthreaten a veto if the poorer southern countries don't getmore subsidies. The Italians, unable to cut their budgetdeficit, would agree to monetary union in the hope thatBrussels somehow could do the job. The Danes aren't happyabout anything -- a recent poll showed most of them oppose asingle currency and foreign policy -- but they feel that theyhaven't much choice. Amid such basic divisions, Maastrichtcould produce, EC Commission President Jacques Delors saidrecently, &quot;institutional schizophrenia.&quot;   What makes Maastricht more than just another forgettablemeeting in the endless European summiteering, however, areevents largely outside the 12 member states. The breakdown ofcommunism on the EC's eastern borders and the end of the coldwar have created both opportunities and dangers.   Advocates of faster EC integration -- led by the French --want to bind Europe closer together to ensure it won't blowapart into another world war. They are most worried about anindependent, unified Germany -- now Europe's only realsuperpower -- turning into a loose cannon.   To such advocates of a &quot;deeper&quot; EC, a federal Europe wouldtie down the loose cannons and would be a stronger magnet inthe world arena, eventually attracting the seven members ofthe European Free Trade Association and perhaps ultimatelythe former East Bloc as full-fledged partners. Meanwhile,though, greater cooperation is needed -- for instance, totoughen EC immigration rules to control the potentialmillions of outsiders, including East Bloc refugees, who wantin. And the EC government must have stronger powers both tofoster tougher industrial competitors to the U.S. and Japanand to try to cut the EC's stubbornly high unemployment.   But others, such as the British and the Danes, view theinitiative to &quot;deepen&quot; the EC as mistimed at best andmistaken at worst. They believe in markets, not governments,and want faster progress to a &quot;wider&quot; EC, one that would morequickly include as many as 30 countries ranging from Swedento Romania.   The &quot;wideners&quot; care less whether Europe has a singlecurrency than whether it has a genuine single market in goodsand services. They especially want greater access for theformer Communist countries to pull themselves up to FirstWorld standards. Besides the practical difficulties ofbinding together economies with inflation rates ranging frommore than 18% in Greece to 2% in Denmark, the &quot;wideners&quot; saythe debate over Europe's future is getting ahead of itself.   With Maastricht looming as a showdown, many people expectEurope's leaders to draw back and agree to watered-downversions of the draft treaties. Britain believes that it maysucceed in replacing treaty language about federalism with aclause about &quot;an ever-closer&quot; union, though at the cost ofmaking concessions elsewhere. The upshot is likely to be lessthan the &quot;deepeners&quot; want but more than the &quot;wideners&quot; wereprepared to accept.   &quot;Maastricht will be a fudge. You won't get genuine victorsand vanquished,&quot; Mr. Crossick says.   If the EC follows its previous pattern of compromise, thenations at Maastricht will agree to continue the battleelsewhere. Any treaty will probably allow the British to &quot;optout&quot; of monetary union and give other states similar latitudein other sensitive areas. Most of the ground will be ceded bythe federalists to ensure support from the member states. Assuch, Maastricht's lasting consequence may be to more clearlydraw the battle lines between the &quot;wideners&quot; and the&quot;deepeners.&quot;   But for people doing business in a unified Europe, such anoutcome isn't what's needed. Many of them are worried becauseonly 15% of the 282 single-market laws required for the 1992program have been implemented by all 12 EC members. Onlytwo-thirds have been implemented by any one member, and&quot;there's no way&quot; the whole program will be in effect by theEC's deadline, an American lobbyist in Brussels says.   So, the unity Europe supposedly has already achieved isbeing questioned. While politicians talk about a singlecurrency and unified army, such major issues as sales taxes,product standards and free movement of some goods andservices are unaddressed or unresolved only a year before thedeadline for the single market. And when member states doenact 1992 legislation, it is often &quot;180 degrees opposed&quot; tothe spirit of the single-market program, one U.S. executivesays.   &quot;The debate over monetary and political union is way aheadof time,&quot; says Christen Sorensen, former member of Denmark'sCouncil of Economic Advisers. &quot;Before embarking on such aneffort, we ought to make better progress on what's alreadyagreed and ask whether the European population really wantsmore.&quot;   Even after 1992, Europe will remain a maze of entrenchednational interests and hardly a seamless market. Auto makerswill still need to make several engines to satisfy nationalrules and markets. You still won't be able to buy anappliance in Spain with a plug to fit British sockets.   For Anton van der Lande, Brussels-based director of publicaffairs at United Parcel Service, the basic problem in the1992 program is simply getting from A to B. Though the singlemarket is aimed at knocking down national barriers, Francerecently imposed new taxes on any parcel sent to a domesticdestination. Any parcel from abroad is taxed twice -- atorigin and again in France. &quot;This raises questions aboutwhether the actual spirit of 1992 really exists,&quot; Mr. van derLande says. &quot;It also illustrates all the problems we wouldhave with political union. Basically, people don't agree onwhat it means.&quot;   And France isn't alone in taking such actions. Although asecurities firm should be able, after 1992, to sell anywherein the EC, Italy recently required that an Italian subsidiarybe established to do such business there. &quot;That's as far fromthe spirit of 1992 as the French attempt to block Britishcars exported from the U.K. with Japanese names,&quot; says JohnRedwood, a British trade and industry official.   Meantime, even the normally pro-free-trade Britishrecently lobbied hard for a long delay in genuine free tradein liquor. London secured an extension to heavy nationaltaxes to protect both the Scottish whisky industry and theduty-free shops at British airports. &quot;The history of Europeancooperation is such compromise,&quot; an EC Commission officialsays.   In recent years, such consultants as Price Waterhouse andAndersen Consulting expanded rapidly amid the overinflatedexpectations of a boom in 1992-related business; now, theyhave scaled back their Brussels-based 1992 operations. Morethan a dozen U.S. law firms opened up; now, several arelaying people off or moving them elsewhere. OneBrussels-based American lawyer spends four days out of fivein Poland, advising on privatization.   At the Filigranes bookstore a few blocks from the EC,there isn't a single book on 1992. &quot;I could order a hundred{different} books, but I don't stock any,&quot; Marc Filipson, themanager, says. &quot;No one is buying them anymore. Everyone knowsit isn't going to happen next year -- if ever.&quot;   In a sense, the European leaders at Maastricht will facethe same issues -- of state sovereignty and of the power totax and print money -- that the framers of U.S. Constitutionfaced two centuries ago. But many people worry about suchdecisions being imposed from the top. Though supporting moreEC integration, Mr. Crossick says what Europe needs mostright now are &quot;European Federalist Papers&quot; to outline thecase for change. &quot;If people feel that {change} is happening-- which it isn't -- by imposition of a faceless bureaucracyfrom above, there will be problems and resistance later on,&quot;he says.   So far, there has been little broad debate among the EC's320 million people, few polls and no referendums. Most peoplebelieve that the durability of European unity depends onincreasing the role of an elected European government so thatdecisions aren't made by unelected bureaucrats in Brusselsand are made in a public and credible matter. And so far, theEC seems to be falling short.   &quot;Most people in the community are largely unaware of whatis going on,&quot; said Clifford Chance, a London law firm, in arecent report. Most of the negotiations have been in secret;few details of the 200 or so draft papers have emerged.   &quot;If the U.S. Constitution were to undergo such drasticrevisions,&quot; the law firm's report said, &quot;it would be almostimpossible to open any law journal without reading pages ofargument.&quot; But &quot;unlike the open, democratic style one findsin the U.S.,&quot; the EC tends to function in secret. So, &quot;verymuch fewer than 1% {of Europeans} will have any real idea ofthe substance of the negotiations.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
