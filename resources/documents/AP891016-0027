The hero's welcome given to the political prisoners _ six jailedfor at least 25 years _ reflects the depth of support for the ANCdespite government repression throughout the movement's 77-year-oldhistory.   The government outlawed the ANC in 1960, and President F.W. deKlerk remains adamant that the organization must renounce violencebefore it may participate in negotiations on a new constitution.   However, the release of ANC leaders and de Klerk's recentdecision to allow peaceful mass protests, ``virtually amounts to defacto validation of the banned ANC,'' said The Sunday Times, thecountry's largest-circulation newspaper.   ``At the very least, the de-demonization of the ANC has began,''the newspaper said in an editorial.   After their release, the seven spoke to hundreds of supportersand journalists at a news conference. It was the first time rankingANC leaders were permitted to engage in political activity in SouthAfrica since the organization was banned.   Government officials have conferred with the ANC's mostprominent jailed leader, Nelson Mandela, whose release is widelyexpected in coming months. There is speculation Mandela wants theANC legalized as a political force before he leaves prison.   ANC supporters, long denied the chance to express theirpolitical sympathies, now wave the green, gold and black ANC flagat marches _ an action that previously brought swift police action.   At a rally in Durban last month, the ANC banner was raised atcity hall and police allowed it to remain on the flagpole until thedemonstration ended.   Black-oriented newspapers now print articles favorable to theANC and run pictures of its imprisoned and exiled leaders _ inoutright defiance of government censorship laws.   New Nation, one of the country's most militant oppositionnewspapers, on Friday printed its entire front page in green, goldand black and ran pictures of the seven former prisoners under theheadline, ``ANC Lives.''   Such developments seemed unthinkable as recently as a year ago.   De Klerk's predecessor as president, P.W. Botha, and hissecurity officials denounced the ANC as a communist-led terroristgroup. Botha said the guerrilla movement would be barred from anynegotiations on apartheid.   In recent months, the ANC appeared to be regrouping, if notretreating.   ANC President Oliver Tambo, 71, suffered a stroke in August andremains hospitalized in London. He has no clear successor, andthere has been speculation of a rift between ANC hardliners, whowant more military action, and political leaders who believenegotiations are on the horizon.   While the ANC publicly calls for an escalation of its armedstruggle, there have been fewer attacks this year than any timesince nationwide black unrest broke out in 1984.   Since a state-of-emergency was declared in June 1986 more than210 bombings have killed 37 people, but this year about 40 havekilled three.   This year, the ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, had to close itsmilitary bases in Angola under a regional peace treaty signed bySouth Africa, Angola and Cuba.   The organization won't say where its thousands of guerrillaswere sent. Reportedly, the fighters were moved to Uganda andTanzania, two countries with little day-to-day contact withsouthern Africa.   The South African government also has successfully eased itsdiplomatic isolation on the continent. Botha and de Klerk metseveral black African leaders in the past year.   The ANC's bid to increase economic sanctions on South Africa haswaned, and few new punitive measures were imposed in the past twoyears.   The government can claim small victories, but the ANC's support,particularly among the young, is stronger than ever.   Thousands of black youths fled South Africa in 1976 amidnationwide black violence to join the ANC and the organization saysthat since 1984 it has received about 100 new recruits monthly.   The organization has an estimated 15,000 members in exile, andmillions of supporters inside South Africa, where blacks comprise28 million of the 37 million population.   Most political analysts believe the ANC would receive the mostvotes if free elections were held.   Even relatively conservative black leaders say the ANC must belegalized before serious negotiations on political change can takeplace.</TEXT></DOC>
