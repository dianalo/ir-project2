The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday ended anembargo ordered Oct. 4 by a federal judge in San Francisco. Thethree-judge panel gave no reason for its action but scheduled oralarguments in the case for next February.   Imposed under a U.S. dolphin-protection law, the embargo hasstirred some anti-U.S. feeling in Mexico and has affected thedebate over establishment of a joint free-trade zone for the twocountries.   A lawyer for environmental groups that fought for the ban saidthe government submitted declarations to the court fromadministration officials saying the embargo was disruptingrelations with Mexico on issues that included anti-drug efforts ndpetroleum sales.   The officials included Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher andJohn Negroponte, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, said Joshua Floum,lawyer for the Earth Island Institute and the Marine Mammal Fund.   ``Congress knew if an embargo was imposed, Mexico wouldn't likeit. We're surprised that agents of the U.S. government are sohostile to the law. (The court's action) will allow the continuedslaughter of dolphins by Mexico without the consequencescontemplated by Congress,'' Floum said.   Floum said he would seek reconsideration of the ruling, signedby Judges Thomas Tang, Jerome Farris and Alex Kozinski.   Martin Hochman, regional counsel for the Commerce Department'sNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said thegovernment hopes to gain foreign cooperation in reducing dolphinkills in meetings over the next several months.   ``One reason for the kind of reaction we've gotten from foreignnations is that it is unilateral action by the United States,''Hochman said. ``The hope is, something can be achieved that will dowhat the U.S. domestic legislation is aiming at but in acooperative way with the foreign countries.''   He said a U.S. delegation, including environmental and tunaindustry representatives, has been meeting with eastern Pacifictuna fishing nations to discuss a possible internationalorganization or agreement on the issue.   Hochman said Mexico has the largest foreign tuna fleet but sellsmost of its tuna to Europe.   The suit was filed under a law aimed at reducing the killing ofdolphins that swim above yellowfin tuna in the eastern Pacific.Some commercial tuna fleets deliberately drop their nets ondolphins.   The law requires the U.S. government to embargo tuna fromnations that fail to reduce their dolphin-killing below certainlevels: for 1989, twice the kill rate of the U.S. tuna fleet, andfor any year, a total kill that includes no more than 15 percenteastern spinner dolphins, a protected subspecies.   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson ordered a ban Aug. 28 onimports of tuna from Mexico, Panama, Ecuador, Venezuela and thePacific island nation of Vanuatu, saying the Commerce Departmenthad failed to show that their 1989 dolphin kill rates were lessthan twice the rate of the U.S. fleet.   The Commerce Department never imposed the embargo on Ecuador,Venezuela or Vanuatu, saying new figures from the first eightmonths of 1990 showed that they were in compliance. Panama did notmeet the limit and is being embargoed.   The department also said Mexico would not be embargoed becauseit was below the limit for the first eight months of 1990. ButHenderson ordered an embargo on Mexican tuna Oct. 4 and extended itOct. 19, citing Mexico's excessive kills of eastern spinnerdolphins in 1989.   Though Commerce Department figures showed Mexico below the 15percent limit for eastern spinners in the first eight months of1990, Henderson said the law protecting eastern spinners requiredcompliance for an entire year before an embargo could be lifted.   Government lawyers argued that Henderson should have deferred tothe department's interpretation of the law.</TEXT></DOC>
