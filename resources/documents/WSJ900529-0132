Media outlets for the current California campaign includeonly newspapers, television, radio and billboards. But, asyou state, &quot;since 60% of tobacco users start smoking beforethey reach high school,&quot; why not reach these &quot;users,&quot;specifically impressionable young women, via women'smagazines? Unfortunately, this is the very place young womenare most likely to be influenced by smoking ads.</LP><TEXT>   The unwillingness of most women's magazines to omitcigarette ads is purely financial -- they depend on thesupport of the tobacco companies to stay afloat. But it isironic that, in doing so, these magazines are killing offtheir own readership.   Naomi M. Stearns   Director of Social Work   Dana-Farber Cancer Institute   Boston   ---   Your article reports a welcome development to the extentthat many First Amendment experts have stressed that thecorrect response to the objectionable &quot;commercial speech&quot; ismore speech -- not advertising bans.   However, the financing of such counteradvertising byhigher taxes on cigarettes may be constitutionallyquestionable because it amounts to forcing companies to payfor the speech of their opponents.   Besides, such social-issue advertising suffers from a lackof clear-cut goals, apart from expressing opposition to aparticular behavior. Will it reduce smoking by 10%, or 5%, or1%? Without specific bench marks, California officials andanti-smoking groups will keep asking for more money, whichmay be wasted, considering all we know about similarcampaigns against drugs or for belt-buckling.
