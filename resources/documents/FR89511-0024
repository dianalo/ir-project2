Appraisals are performed by independent appraisers who are designatedby each VA Regional Office as ``fee appraisers''. The appraisal is thansubmitted to the appropriate regional office for a determination of reasonablevalue and issuance of a Certificate of Reasonable Value. The reasonablevalue of a property must be determined in order to comply with 38 U.S.C.1810(B)(5) which states that a VA guaranteed loan cannot exceed the reasonablevalue of the property securing the loan as determined by the VA. PublicLaw 100-198, the Veterans Home Loan Program Improvements and Property RehabilitationAct of 1987, added a subsection (f) to 38 U.S.C. 1831 which allows lendersto determine a property's reasonable value on behalf of the VA. The lawrequires that lenders granted this authority must be those that alreadyhave authority to process VA loans on the ``automatic'' basis under section1802(d) of 38 U.S.C. The law also requires that the procedures and standardsfor the Secretary to authorize lender determinations of reasonable valueshall be set forth in regulations. The law further mandates that, in exercisingthis authority, the VA must assign a sufficient number of personnel tocarry out an appraisal review system to monitor the making of appraisalsby appraisers, and the effectiveness and efficiency of the determinationsof value by lenders. Automatic processing of VA guaranteed loans means that lenders originate,underwrite and close loans without the VA's prior-approval. The loan isnot submitted to VA until closed and the evidence of guaranty is requested.Section 1802(d) of Title 38 identifies two categories of lenders that mayprocess loans automatically. They are (1) entities such as banks, savingsand loans, and mortgage and loan companies that are subject to examinationby an agency of the United States or of any State and (2) lenders approvedby the VA pursuant to standards established by the VA. Lenders that arein either of the two categories will now be eligible to request authorityto review appraisals and determine the reasonable value of properties tobe purchased with VA guaranteed loans. Appraisals will still be performedby VA designated fee-appraisers who will continue to be assigned on a rotationbasis to each case by VA. These proposed regulations set forth the criteriafor designation as a Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) lender.The lender's authority to process cases under LAPP is delegated at thediscretion of the VA and the recipient of such authority has special responsibilitieswhich include, but are not restricted to: ensuring that staff review appraisersreview appraisal reports utilizing recognized appraisal techniques; makingprudent and sound determinations of reasonable value; and ensuring thatthe property condition meets VA minimum property requirements and is otherwiseacceptable security for a VA guaranteed loan. In closing the loan on theautomatic basis, after determining the reasonable value and property-relatedconditions, lenders must know what is and what is not an eligible loan;i.e., one meeting established underwriting standards, eligibility, andentitlement requirements.Lenders seeking designation as a LAPP leader will be required to have onstaff a review appraiser who may also be an underwriter. This individualwill be a full-time member of the lender's permanent staff and may notbe employed by, or perform services for, any other mortgage. The staffreview appraiser must be able to demonstrate a knowledge of, and the abilityto apply, the industry accepted principles, methods, practices and techniquesof appraising real property. Experience demonstrating knowledge of generalrealty practice and principles as they relate to real property valuation,skill in collecting and assembling data and the ability to prepare clearand concise reports are all required. Also required will be the abilityto review the work of others and to recognize deviations from acceptedappraisal principles and practices, errors in computations and unjustifiableand unsupportable conclusions. Experience under the Department of Housingand Urban Development's direct endorsement program is helpful, since theVA program will be similar, but is not automatically qualifying. The lender'sstaff reviewer may be located in a branch office except that when the VAapproved automatic underwriter is also the VA approved review appraiser,that individual must be located at the home office or an approved regionaloffice of the lender. A certification will be required either on the UniformResidential Appraisal Report (URAR) or attached to it as to the staff reviewappraiser's personal review of the appraisal report and his/her findings.Exact language for the certification is contained in the proposed regulations.Lenders meeting the requirements of the proposed regulations will be approvedto make reasonable value determinations for a one-year probationary period.It is proposed that during the probationary period the first 15 cases processedunder LAPP be submitted to VA when processed to the point where the lenderstaff reviewer has made reasonable value recommendations. VA personnelwill then make a complete review of those cases and, if the lender's review,reasonable value recommendation, and determination of other conditionsspecific to the case (i.e., repair requirements) are acceptable, a Certificateof Reasonable Value will be issued. The loan may then be closed on theautomatic basis provided it meets all other VA requirements. After submissionof the first 15 cases, if acceptable performance has been demonstrated,lenders will be able to make the reasonable value determinations and closeloans automatically without issuance by VA of a Certificate of ReasonableValue. For the remainder of the probationary period detailed reviews willbe performed by VA staff to determine the adequacy, appropriateness andoverall quality of the lender's determinations. Under the new program,lenders will be responsible for notifying both the veteran-borrower andVA of the reasonable value determination and for providing each with acopy of the appraisal report. The original of the appraisal report andall related documentation will be included in the request for loan guaranty.Lender's staff review appraisers will not have the authority to adjustthe fee appraisers' value recommendations upward or to remove or adjustrepair recommendations costing more than a dollar amount of percentagespecified by the local VA office of jurisdiction.Appeals of fee appraisers' value recommendations or lenders' reasonablevalue determinations will be processed by the VA. The procedures for submittingappeals will be the same as for cases in which a Certificate of ReasonableValue has been issued by VA.These proposed regulations also include the criteria for withdrawal ofa lender's authority to review appraisals and determine reasonable value.The criteria include withdrawal of authority: when the basic eligibilityrequirements are no longer met; when it is shown that the lender's determinationsare not made in accordance with requirements and procedures contained inVA regulations, guidelines or in applicable laws; or when there is sufficientinformation of adequate evidence to support reasonable belief that a particularunacceptable act, practice or performance has occurred. Such acts, practicesor performance include, but are not restricted to: demonstrated technicalincompetence (i.e., conduct demonstrating insufficient knowledge of industryaccepted appraisal principles, techniques and practices or the lack oftechnical competence to review appraisal reports and make value determinationsin accordance with those requirements) or substantive or repetitive errors(i.e., any error(s) of a nature that would materially or significantlyaffect the determination of reasonable value or a number of series of errorsthat, considered individually, may not significantly impact the determinationof reasonable value, but which when considered in the aggregate would establishthat appraisal reviews or LAPP case processing are being performed in acareless or negligent manner). Withdrawal of the authority to determinerasonable value will be made upon proper notice and provision of the rightto appeal the decision of the VA.Fraudulent or criminal conduct under the Lender Appraisal Processing Programwill be subject to Government nonprocurement suspension and debarment actionsthat are contained in 38 CFR Part 44.Upon publication of final regulations the VA will also publish separatelythe detailed procedures for lenders submitting loans under the new program.It is contemplated that in the beginning of the program, lenders' authoritywill be limited to the determination of reasonable value on propertiesthat qualify as existing construction. Existing construction cases aredefined by the VA as: (1) Previously owner occupied, regardless of theage or date construction was completed, provided the property meets theVA Minimum Property Requirements (MPRs) for existing construction, (2)not previously occupied, provided construction was completed in all respectsone (1) year or more prior to the date of the appraisal request and meetsVA MPR for existing construction; (3) not previously occupied, constructionis less than one (1) year old and is fully complete except for customerpreference items (e.g., interior finishes, appliances, equipment) and thoseexterior improvements for which the VA office allows onsite escrows <T3>and </T3>the property is enrolled in a ten-year insurance-backed warrantyplan that has been accepted by the VA. Manufactured (mobile), and multi-family(two or more units) homes will be excluded. A test program in selectedareas, for proposed construction cases is under active consideration. Specificcomments are invited as to implementation of such a test. Proposed constructioncases may be included at a future date after the test results have beenanalyzed. The Secretary hereby certifies that these proposed regulations, if promulgated,will not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.601 through 612. Pub. L. 100-198 requirs that the standards and proceduresfor the VA program of lender determinations of reasonable value be establishedin the appropriate regulations. This program will not cause lenders tosignificantly change their practices since such review of appraisals isnow accomplished for conventional loans and most Federal Housing Administration(FHA) insured loans. Lenders that make VA guaranteed loans also make conventionaland FHA insured loans. The main impact will be on the time involved inprocessing a VA guaranteed loan. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these proposedregulations are exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibilityanalysis requirements of andSection;andSection; 603 and 604. The proposed regulations have been reviewed under Executive Order 12291,entitled Federal Regulations, and are not considered major regulation changesas defined in the Executive Order. These regulations will not impact onthe public or private sectors as major rules. They will not have an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more and will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, governmentagencies, or geograhic regions; nor will they have other significant adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>Section 36.4344 of this regulation contains an information collection requirement.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 30 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

Five years of experience demonstratinga knowledge of, and the ability to apply, industry-accepted principles,methods, practices and techniques of appraising, and the ability to competentlydetermine the value of property within a prescribed area is necessary toqualify as a staff review appraiser. The individual must demonstrate theability to review the work of others and to recognize deviations from acceptedappraisal principles, practices, and techniques, errors in computations,and unjustifiable and unsupportable conclusions.(3) Lenders that meet the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 1802(d) and have aVA-approved staff review appraiser will be authorized to review appraisalsand make reasonable value determinations on properties that will be thesecurity for VA guaranteed loans. The lender's authorization will be subjectto a one-year probationary period. During the probation period the first15 reasonable value determinations made by the staff reveiw appraiser willbe submitted to VA along with the lender's staff review appraiser's reasonablevalue recommendation, prior to loan closing. The reasonable value recommendationwill be reviewed by the appropriate field facility personnel, and if thelender's processing is determined acceptable, a Certificate of ReasonableValue will be issued by VA. Such a loan may than be closed automaticallyif it meets all other requirements of the VA. If a lender's first 15 casesprocessed under this authority are found to be acceptable by VA the lenderwill be allowed to process subsequent loans without prior submission toVA and without the issuance of a Certificate of Reasonable Value. The 15case review requirement may be expanded by a regional office, if acceptableperformance has not been demonstrated. Thereafter, routine review willbe made by VA staff, based upon quality control procedures prescribed bythe Chief Benefits Director, of cases closed where the lender has madethe determination of reasonable value. Such reviews will be made on a randomsampling or performance related basis.(4) The following certifications are required to be either placed on, orattached to, each Uniform Residential Appraisal Report (URAR), FreddieMac Form 70/Fannie Mae Form 1004 reviewed by the staff appraiser.

VAoffices will issue local instructions regarding the lender's ability toadjust, remove, or alter the fee appraiser's or fee compliance inspector'srecommendations for VA minimum property requirements. Condominiums, planned-unitdevelopments and leasehold estates must have been determined acceptableby the VA, or in the cases of condominiums or planned-unit developmentsby the Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Department ofAgriculture under the VA's reciprocal agreement with those agencies, beforethe lender can process a case under this authority.(c) <T3>Adjustment of reasonable value determination. </T3>Lenders do not haveauthority to increase the fee appraiser's estimated market value indicatedin the Reconciliation Section of the appraisal report. Lenders may decreasethe estimated market value if such adjustment is warranted and supported,and the staff review appraiser clearly justifies such adjustment in writingon the appraisal report form. Such comments, adjustments, corrections,etc., must be made in a contrasting color and be clearly legible and initialedand dated by the staff review appraiser.(d) <T3>Notification. </T3>It will be the responsibility of the lender to notifythe veteran borrower in writing of the determination of reasonable valueand related conditions specific to the property at the time the determinationis made. Any delay must be documented. Any delay beyond two (2) workingdays without reasonable extenuating circumstances will not be acceptable.The original appraisal report, and related appraisal documentation, anda copy of the reasonable value determination notification to the veteranwill be submitted to the VA with the request for loan guaranty.(e) <T3>Appeals. </T3>All appeals of fee appraisers' value recommendationsor lenders' reasonable value determinations, along with the lenders' recommendations,if any, must be submitted to the VA for processing and final decision.(f) <T3>Affiliations. </T3>A lender affiliated with a real estate firm, builder,land developer or escrow agent as a subsidiary, division, or investmentmay not use this authority for any cases involving the affiliate unlessthe lender demonstrates that (1) the lender and its affiliate(s) are essentiallyseparate entities that operate independently of each other, free of allcross-influences; and (2) the lender has developed, will implement, orhas implemented an effective self-policing or quality control system toassure, to the extent possible, that its activities do not deviate formhigh standards of integrity and will be agreeable to furnishing pertinentevidence of independent operation and of such a system to the VA on demand.Under the lender appraisal processing program, the lender's quality controlor self-policing system must specifically contain provisions concerningthe adequacy and quality of real property appraisals. While the lender'squality control personnel need not be appraisers, they should have basicfamiliarity with appraisal theory and techniques so that they can selectappropriate cases for review if discretionary sampling is used, and prescribeappropriate corrective action(s) in the appraisal review process when discrepanciesor problems are identified. Copies of the lender's quality control planor self-policing system evidencing appraisal related matters must be providedto the VA office of jurisdiction. (g) <T3>Withdrawal of lender authority. </T3>The authority for a lender todetermine reasonable value may be withdrawn by the Loan Guaranty Officerwhen proper cause exists. A lender's authority to make reasonable valuedeterminations shall be withdrawn when the lender no longer meets the establishedbasic requirements for granting the authority. Such authority may alsobe withdrawn when it can be shown that the lender's reasonable value determinationshave not been made in accordance with VA regulations, requirements, guidelines,instructions or applicable laws, or when there is sufficient informationor adequate evidence or support reasonable VA belief that a particularunacceptable act, practice, or performance by the lender or the lender'sstaff has occurred. Such acts, practices or performance include, but arenot restricted to: demonstrated technical incompetence (i.e., conduct demonstratinginsufficient knowledge of industry accepted appraisal principles, techniquesand practices or the lack of technical competence to review appraisal reportsand make value determinations in accordance with those requirements); and/orsubstantive or repetitive errors (i.e., any error(s) of a nature that wouldmaterially or significantly affect the determination of reasonable valueor a number or series of errors that, considered individually, may notsignificantly impact the determination of reasonable value, but which whenconsidered in the aggregate would establish that appraisal reviews or LAPPcase processing are being performed in a careless or negligent manner).(1) Withdrawal of authority by the Loan Guaranty Officer may be eitherfor an indefinite or a specified period of time. For any withdrawal longerthan 90 days a reapplication for lender authority to process appraisalsunder these regulations will be required. Written notice will be providedat least 30 days in advance of withdrawal unless the Government's interestsare exposed to immediate risk from the lender's activities in which casethe withdrawal will be effected immediately. The notice will clearly andspecifically set forth the basis and grounds for the action. The lenderwill be provided an opportunity for a hearing before the Loan GuarantyOfficer in order to present evidence that the action is not warranted.In the event of an immediate withdrawal the lender will be afforded a hearingwithin three (3) business days of a request for such a hearing. The LoanGuaranty Officer will make a recommendation to the Facility Director whoshall make the determination as to the action to be taken. The lender willbe informed in writing of the decision. (2) If the withdrawal takes place, the lender has the right to appeal thedecision to the Chief Benefits Director. In the event of an appeal theChief Benefits Director will review all relevant material concerning thematter and make a determination that shall constitute final agency action.(3) Withdrawal of authority will require the lender to request a determinationof reasonable value by the VA. This will require a VA staff review of theappraisal report and subsequent issuance of a Certificate of ReasonableValue which will then be used by the lender to close loans on either theprior VA approval or automatic basis.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1831) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-11248 Filed 5-10-89; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 8320-01-M   </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
