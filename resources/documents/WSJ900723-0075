A lot of people might think so when they see news footageof riot police in combat gear battling strikers. Or whenKorean government economists and business associationspronounce the country in a crisis. Newsweek says, &quot;SouthKorea's Economic Miracle Has Lost Its Glow,&quot; and the New YorkTimes echoes, &quot;The South Korean `economic miracle' looksincreasingly fragile now.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Don't bet on it. It is becoming increasingly clear thatKorea's economy has turned around and, while not quite readyto roar, will be purring contentedly.   For all their recent talk of a crisis, economists nowagree Korea's gross national product will probably grow 9%this year -- one of the biggest increases in the fast-growingAsian region. Domestic demand is strong. Exports will beexpanding by an annual rate of more than 10% by the end ofthe year, averaging more than 5% growth for all of 1990.   With machinery backlogs up 50% over last year andshipbuilding orders up 50% -- enough to keep Korea'sshipyards busy for three years even if they get no new orders-- a continuation of double-digit export growth into nextyear looks like a sure thing. &quot;Growth was somewhat morerobust than expected,&quot; says Koo Boo Young, a presidentialeconomic adviser.   There are of course some potential trouble spots.Inflation, clipping along at an annual rate of about 12%, isone of them. And Korea's merchandise trade balance may goslightly into the red for the first time since 1985, althoughthat isn't as bad as it seems: Imports grew quickly becauseKorean companies were buying 40% more U.S.- and Japanese-mademachinery than they did in 1988 to automate factories and cutproduction costs.   All in all, optimism is breaking through the clouds.&quot;Policy makers are gradually getting more optimistic --although some uncertainties linger over the optimisticopinion,&quot; says Chang Seung Woo, a top official of thegovernment's Economic Planning Board.   In fact, the biggest worry these days among thetechnocrats who engineered Korea's economic &quot;miracle&quot; isn'tthe health of the economy. They worry that the factors thatwill keep Korea's economic machine whirring are no longerones controlled by their macroeconomic tinkering. Korea'seconomy now is so complex and intertwined with world marketsthat developments in Tokyo, New York or Frankfurt -- aninterest rate change or a product innovation -- can have moreimpact than government decisions. &quot;In the past the outsideworld did not interfere as they do now,&quot; says Lee Hahn Koo,president of Daewoo Research Institute.   Korea's recovery was spurred by an abrupt end to laborunion unrest and a favorable turn in the value of Korea'scurrency, the won.   The Labor Ministry says that through the first week ofJuly when the strike season usually finishes, the countrysuffered only 255 strikes, compared with 1,127 last year.Moreover, the average length of the strikes declined to about12.4 days from 19.2 last year. Pay increases averaged onlyabout 7% this year, compared with 17.8% last year.   The labor peace shows up on the bottom line. In the firstquarter last year, companies claimed they lost $643 millionin exports due to labor disputes. This year the loss claimedis only $20 million. Wages are rising, but they no longer areoutstripping productivity gains. &quot;This year things are goingvery smoothly,&quot; says Park Sung Kyou, president of DaewooTelecom Co. &quot;Businessmen have got their confidence back,their ego back, and they are starting to invest and startingto export.&quot;   While many Korean businessmen had blamed higher wages forKorea's loss of overseas competitiveness, the real culpritseems to have been the change in the currency rates.   In 1986, when the Japanese yen began rising sharplyagainst the dollar, Japan's products became more expensiveoverseas. Korea, which linked its currency to the dollar,thus gained an advantage in the U.S. market. But it quicklylost this advantage when the won started rising against thedollar. Things got even worse when the yen started to fallagainst the dollar and the won fell more slowly. That meantthat the price difference between Japanese and Koreanproducts narrowed. In some product areas, Korean productsbecame more expensive than their Japanese rivals, withdisastrous consequences for Korean exports.   SKC Ltd., a Korean video and audio tape maker, evendiscovered that tapes imported into Korea grabbed 15% of thelocal market because the prices were almost the same, eventhough imported tapes were hit with a 13% duty. &quot;We are notvery competitive,&quot; says Park Jang Suk, manager of thegovernment's planning department.   There was little the economic planners could do. The KoreaInstitute of Economics and Technology, a government-supportedthink tank, estimated that when the won-yen rate is at about435 won to 100 yen, Korea loses about $3.4 billion inexports.   Recently the won fell to around 484 to 100 yen, exportssurged, and the economy began its recovery.</TEXT></DOC>
