The Dallas electronics and defense concern said that itand Southern California Edison plan to begin developing amanufacturing process for their photovoltaic cell over thenext few months and hope to have solar modules on rooftopsfor testing by year end.</LP><TEXT>   James Skelly, Texas Instruments' solar program manager,wouldn't disclose how much the two companies are spending todevelop the technology. But he said Texas Instruments andSouthern California Edison, a unit of SCEcorp of Rosemead,Calif., have spent $10 million over six years on the projectand still are spending less than $10 million a year.   The new solar cell, which is composed of 17,000 tiny solarspheres on a thin aluminum foil, uses low-purity silicon toconvert sunlight to electricity. Because they plan to uselow-cost materials and low-cost manfacturing processes, thecompanies said the technology could cut by more than half thecurrent cost of using solar energy.</TEXT></DOC>
