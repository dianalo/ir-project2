The oil and natural gas partnership managed by T. BoonePickens Jr. has been trying to restructure about $916 millionin bank debt for about a year to avoid potential liquidityproblems. Mesa said that the private placement and the saleof about 17% of its reserves for $440 million earlier thisyear has allowed it to pay off its bank lenders, led by WellsFargo and Texas Commerce Bank, Houston.</LP><TEXT>   Under the private placement, Hugoton Capital L.P., made upof the company's prized Hugoton Field natural gas reserves,sold secured notes that mature over the next 15 years,although they could be paid off sooner or the maturity couldbe stretched up to 21 years, depending on natural gas prices.Interest rates on the notes range from 7.5% to 11.3%.   Although investment bankers often sell securities backedby assets like credit-card receivables, the offering isbelieved to be the first time a producing oil and gas fieldhas been &quot;securitized,&quot; said Michael McMahon, the SalomonBrothers Inc. managing director who helped put the offeringtogether.   Mesa said that about 30 institutions and affiliatespurchased the notes, led by Cigna Corp. affiliates, whichbought 24% of the issue. The Hugoton Field properties, whichback the notes, represent about 57% of Mesa's reserve base.   As part of the debt restructuring, Mesa said it arranged anew $150 million bank line led by Societe Generale, althoughMr. Pickens said the company doesn't have a current need forthe credit.   The transactions have left Mesa with about $350 million incash and interest and debt payments that match the company'sreserve base. &quot;We're truly back in business,&quot; Mr. Pickenssaid. The restructuring effort, he said, &quot;has ossified all ofus for more than a year.&quot;   Mr. Pickens said Mesa plans to pursue opportunities incompressed natural gas and is beginning work on a new gasprocessing plant in Satanta, Kan., scheduled to open in early1993. The plant, which will cost $50 million to $60 millionto build, will increase Mesa's gas processing capacity byabout 50%, allow it to double its natural gas liquidsproduction and begin helium production.   Mr. Pickens said the company will consider using some ofthe cash to buy back some of its $600 million in public debt,but he said the possibility isn't as enticing as it once was.The bonds traded as low as 65 cents to 70 cents on the dollarearlier this year. But yesterday, Mesa's 12% subordinateddebentures, maturing in 1996, added 1 point to end at 92; thecompany's 13.5% subordinated debentures, due in 1999, gained1 3/4 points to finish at 97.
