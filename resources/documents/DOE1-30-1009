The results obtainedfor natural gas coming from Northern Germany or for imported naturalgas are well consistent with actual measuring results. The model cantherefore be applied as a rule for computing in a new technical recommendationand determine real gas factors whenever they are relevant to trading.The respective calculations must be preceded by a complete analysis characterizingthe quality of gases. However, the new method allows for the alternativecalculation of real gas factors on the basis of a small number of easilymeasurable factors (for example H/sub 0/, d, CO/sub 2/). This qualityseams to be all the more attractive as it allows for an automatic translationof parametric sets at changing gas qualities which for the first timecan manage without an expensive online gas chromatography or densitytranslators, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
