The body of a man found burned to death Thursday near the cityof Gifhorn, about 25 miles east of Hanover, has been identified asthat of Karl Koch, police said. Koch, 24, was under investigationfor his part in a computer scandal that resulted in internationalheadlines in March.   Wolfsburg police said in a statement that Koch apparently dousedhimself with gasoline and set himself on fire.   A melted plastic gasoline canister was found near the body,``and there were no signs of foul play from an outside source,''the statement said.   Koch was one of eight West German computer hackers underinvestigation for allegedly supplying Soviet agents with code wordsto gain access to Western computers. Those computers included theU.S. Defense Department's general databank, known as Optimus, and aNASA ``Star Wars'' research computer.   Authorities said at the time that the hackers were believed tohave been recruited by the KGB, the Soviet intelligence agency, in1985 and ``were paid in cash and drugs'' to provide the code words.   Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the federal prosecutor'soffice in Karlsruhe, confirmed today that Koch was one of thehackers under investigation.   ``We are still investigating the others and expect to filecharges when the probe is completed,'' Foerster said.   Officials have said that while the code words allegedly providedby the hackers gave the Soviets access to various computernetworks, they were not sufficient to gain access to classifiedinformation.</TEXT></DOC>
