One of the banks, Peoples State Bank, Turkey, Texas, is to reopen today as a branch of Memphis State Bank, Memphis, Texas. Peoples had assets of $6 million and held deposits of $5.9 million in 1,050 accounts.    Last night, the FDIC was trying to arrange the transfer of the insured deposits held by UnitedBank, Houston, because the agency received no bids for its purchase. If a transfer can't be arranged, the FDIC will pay off the deposits that are below the federal insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor.    The FDIC said it had no other details about UnitedBank.    So far this year, 23 banks have failed in Texas. </TEXT></DOC>
