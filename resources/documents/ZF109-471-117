Weizenbaum's ELIZA.andP;  Even today, implementationfrequently takes the form of a dialogue with the program asking significantquestions and making appropriate responses.andP;  The writer then uses therecorded information as the raw material for the paper.andM;Current systems have two drawbacks.andP;  First, many strategies used byprofessional writers are comparable to a rule of thumb; thus, theeffectiveness and appropriateness of a heuristic varies with the task.andP;  Theylose most of their spontaneity and flexibility when automated.andP;  Second, thedialogue metaphor, which attributes a personality to the computer, is anembarrassing affectation in most programs.andM;Outliners.andP;  This category has generated more commercial interest than theothers.andP;  Although frequently called &quot;idea processors,&quot; the label seems morehonorific than earned.andP;  Most use a top-down (general-to-specific) knowledgerepresentation as their bases.andP;  In other words, writers are encouraged tofind hierarchical relationships in their raw material by filling in anopen-ended tree structure.andP;  On some systems, levels can be hidden, thusfocusing attention and reducing the cognitive load inherent in the writingprocess.andP;  Writing environments.andP;  The more interesting of these programs arestill in their infancy and can be represented by Writing Environment,developed at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and CICILE,developed at the Center for Applied Cognitive Science in Toronto, Ont.,andO;Canada.andP;  Some commercial packages offer the user a collection of tools (asthe analysis routines in the Writer's Workbench); however, these tools areseparate entities and the writer is free to pick and choose among them.andM;On the other hand, a writing environment's suite of tools is integrated intoa rigorously structured cognitive model of writing.andP;  Essentially, awell-designed writing environment orchestrates the writing process byemulating stages of thinking.andP;  Few, if any, writing environments includeconventional Al applications (expert systems).andP;  Nevertheless, because thewhole system supports and guides the activities of thinking, theseknowledge-making habitats should be characterized as &quot;intelligent.&quot;andM;I like the concept, but I'm uneasy with the implementation.andP;  First, all theexamples are theory-laden and exit as heavily funded projects at largeresearch universities or government laboratories.andP;  These systems seem to betestbeds for high-powered research on the writing process more than practicaltools for professionals.andP;  Second, because of the amount of &quot;scaffolding&quot; eachsystem provides for writers, they seem more appropriate as learningenvironments.andP;  In short, writing environments are more tutors than tools.andO;Third, their heavy commitment to a definitive cognitive model of writingseems to ignore what technology historians have taught us: new tools engendernew habits of mind, and the tool can change the nature of the task over time.andO;In summary, word processing precipitated interest in CAW.andP;  Once text could berepresented as bits and bytes, computational software for analyzing prosepatterns became feasible.andP;  But the patterns used are too fine-grained and theevaluation too rigorous to qualify as a comfortable cognitive tool.andP;  I'venever used a CAW product that didn't constrain my writing by beingdistractingly intrusive, nitpickingly atomistic, or downright tedious in itssophomoric advice.andP;  Writing is a manifestation of the controlled creativitywe call design.andP;  The cognitive activities of design take place cyclicallyrather than linearly.andP;  First, we decompose or partition the task into itscomponents to get an idea of what we want to do.andP;  Then, we work on the piecesfor a while, compare interim results with higher-level goals, consolidategains, jettison unrealistic expectations or excessive constraints, reorderplans, and go back to working on the pieces.andP;  The cycle repeats during thewriting session.andM;Good writers excel where poor writers fail because they can move smoothlybetween top-down and bottom-up strategies.andP;  A good cognitive tool forcomposing has two functions: to serve as a peripheral brain that helps withthe cognitive overload inherent in a complex task and to act as an expertassociate that advises in the iterative &quot;prototype and feedback&quot; process ofdesign.andM;COGNITIVE TOOLSandM;Two prototype cognitive tools that I've developed use neural networks to&quot;assess&quot; prose during the iterative process of composing.andP;  These tools, whichdiffer from what is available, work at a higher level of abstraction.andP;  Thefirst uses the cumulative effect of 16 stylistic features to assess the voiceor tone of a prose passage; the second helps to transform the knowledgerepresentation from an associational net to a hierarchical frame.andM;Though neural networks are part of Al, they're very different from the Alformalisms to which we're accustomed.andP;  Expert systems use if-then rules toarrive at an answer.andP;  These rules are formulated by a knowledge engineer whoworks closely with a content expert to derive a model of the problem space.andO;Neural networks, however, are fed sample cases (called &quot;training sets&quot;) andlearn how to recognize patterns in new cases not included in the samples.andO;Because neural nets are trained rather than programmed, the onlyoverhead-other than the initial design-is in collecting and formatting thedata sets.andM;Expert systems work well in procedural domains where rules can be given tocharacterize the problem solver's behavior.andP;  Neural nets are useful innonprocedural domains -tasks involving fuzzy logic, indeterminate rules, andincomplete or error-ridden data.andM;Each writing tool has three components: a word-processing package thatprovides the amenities: editing, formatting, and so on; a &quot;data collector&quot;(in the form of a parser or pseudoparser) whose output becomes the input forthe neural net; and a neural network trained by a backpropagationsupervised-learning algorithm.andP;  The second prototype has the middle element(the data collector) completely automated.andP;  In this case, data collected by ahypertext shell is passed to the neural net.andP;  In the other prototype, thedata was hand-processed both for the training set and test cases.andM;The hardware platform is a 386/25 machine running DOS.andP;  Eventually, all thepieces will be united in a development environment such as Windows v. 3.0,but for now the interface is not seamless.andP;  All three software packages Iused (word processor, hypertext shell, and neural-net developer) arecommercially available and cost about $500 each.andM;Hearing voices: an automated style machine.andP;  What is style and how much doesit enter into our assessment of writing? Anyone who has slogged through anopaque memo won't need an answer to the last part of the question.andP;  The firstpart is a bit more difficult to answer because style has two dimensions:readability and persona.andP;  The first, readability, probably needs littleexplanation.andP;  From grammar school on, we've been admonished to be clear,concise, and correct in our writing.andM;Persona, or voice, is a more subtle, psychosocial dimension of style.andO;Writing projects a personality whether we intend to or not.andP;  This persona mayhave nothing to do with our true selves and it may differ from writing taskto writing task.andP;  Because this dimension of writing seems subjective, theimpact of voice on the effectiveness and acceptance of prose is not alwaysacknowledged.andP;  For example, consider these two samples:andM;We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shallfight on theseas and oceans ...andP;  we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, weshallfight on the beaches, we shallfight on the landing grounds, we shallfight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not fora moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated andstarving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the BritishFleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World,with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation ofthe old.andM;Your hands can be one of the most beautiful things about you.andP;  Make them&quot;happy&quot; by giving them the extra-special care they deserve.andP;  To eliminatenail problems, carefully massage cream (special nail cream is best) into yourcuticles every day and get into the habit of pushing cuticles back gentlywith a towel whenever your hands are damp .... Religiously set aside sometime for a once-a-week manicure.andP;  There's nothing like soft, feminine handswith beautifully cared for nails to set male hearts aflutter.andM;Take a minute to characterize the tone of each passage.andP;  Although you mightstruggle a bit for descriptive words, you should have an overall impressionof each voice.andP;  But how do you know? What features influenced your decision?andO;Could you write a set of expert system rules to duplicate your decision?andM;In his book Tough, Sweet, and Stuffy: An Essay on Modern American Prose Style(Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 1966), Walker Gibson examinesthe phenomenon of style as it relates to voice.andP;  His point is to reduce aslippery concept to a small set of variables.andP;  Voice can be described asintimidating or tough, solicitous or sweet, and pompous or stuffy.andP;  Althoughthese terms have negative connotations, one style overwhelms the otherdimensions only when that prose becomes noticeably dysfunctional.andP;  In a mixedstyle (Gibson's term), a reasonable presence of all three voices tends to actas a balance.andM;Gibson identifies 16 factors of discourse and sets up a rating scale toprofile a passage of prose.andP;  Applying the &quot;machine&quot; by hand islabor-intensive.andP;  The prose sample must be assessed for each of the 16factors and one point awarded for each threshold met.andP;  For example, the firstsample (by Winston Churchill) has a profile of tough(10)/ sweet(4)/stuffy(5)and the second sample (from an article in a popular magazine) measures in attough(7)/sweet(14)/stuffy(0).andP;  Passages may score higher than 16 pointsbecause some of the thresholds overlap.andM;My first prototype automates the style machine described by Gibson.andP;  Itrained a neural network to take the 16 features of writing and, based onthese observations, rate the style of the prose on three different dimensions(tough, sweet, or stuffy).andM;In Gibson's numeric notation, exceeded thresholds are awarded a single point.andO;However, the neural net I designed could work with the raw data for eachdiscourse feature only if each entry was normalized as a decimal percentage.andO;Using this data format, both input and output are presented as two banks ofdata-driven &quot;thermometers&quot;-one showing the percentage profile for the threestyle dimensions and the other showing the relative weights given to eachfactor involved in the analysis.andM;The network is fast and efficient, can be fine-tuned or retrained ifnecessary, and works with incomplete or fuzzy data sets.andP;  An added benefit isthe ability to &quot;back-chain&quot;; that is, given the three dimensions of the endprofile, the writer can backtrack and find out which elements were moreheavily weighted in determining the stylistic evaluation.andP;  Thus, a writerunsatisfied with the result would know what textual features to work on toproduce a more agreeable final analysis.andM;Copyediting is not the only thing that can be expected from an evaluator;such atomistic, fragmented assessment does little to improve the deepstructure of prose.andP;  To be effective, commentary on writing, whether fromcolleague or computer, should start with a holistic appraisal followed by anindication of what features influenced the assessment and advice on how theresults could be changed.andM;Mapping knowledge structures.andP;  Hyper-text has been variously characterized asnonlinear prose, interactive print, or dynamic text.andP;  The basic elements arenodes (chunks of text or graphics) and links (connections indicating arelationship).andP;  Both contribute to hypertext's ability to fashion knowledgefrom information.andP;  Nodes deconstruct the linear sequence of printedmaterials, making possible dynamic recombinations.andP;  Links indicate therelationship among nodes (through types and attributes), creating aconceptual graph, similar to a semantic network.andM;Although hypertext is a hot topic today, the power of conceptual graphs tocapture complex data at a high level of abstraction has long been recognized.andO;In the early 1970s Horst Rittel posited the Issues-Based Information System(IBIS) to facilitate complex decision making.andP;  Essentially, Rittel saw thedesign process as a dialogue (even though only one person might be involved)in which possibilities (or issues) are set forth, expanded, challenged, andsupported.andP;  Rittel's idea was to control the flow of the creative process byestablishing an exchange protocol and capturing the essence of thedeliberations in a graph, similar to a conceptual map.andM;Though Rittel developed the method for paper and pencil, IBIS's mostimpressive uses are in computer implementations.andP;  This potential to manageknowledge through linking is exploited in the graphical Issue BasedInformation System (gIBIS), a hyper-text system developed by Microelectronicsand Computer Technology Corp. (Austin, Texas) to support collaborative designwork.andP;  The basic premise of gIBIS is that of an electronic conference, whoseparticipants can enter three different text node types: &quot;Issue&quot; (a startingplace), &quot;position&quot; (elaborations of issues), and &quot;argument&quot; (extensions topositions).andM;A conferee begins by posting a central issue, and other participants respondwith positions (a statement or assertion addressing the issue).andP;  Argumentspertain to a position.andP;  The nodes are linked by using one of nine relationalconnections (responds-to, questions, supports, objects-to, specializes,generalizes, replaces, refers-to).andM;The user interface is a graphical display of nodes and links, reminiscent ofstory-boarding techniques used for information development.andP;  Color coding thelines (link relations) and the rectangles (node content) provides a synopticoverview of the flow of the dialogue.andP;  Each node can be opened to revealanother network of nodes (this second level of relationships appears if theinterchange has been particularly rich) or a text expansion of thehigher-level keyword or concept.andP;  Though gIBIS sets up a protocol for postingnodes and weaving the associational network, the process is flexible enoughto be free-flowing and to evoke thought.andP;  In fact, the tool may be a littletoo free-wheeling: after some time working at the board, the associationalnetwork becomes difficult to decipher.andM;gIBIS exploits the theory that human memory is a semantic network and duringthe formulative stages of creative activity (as with writing) much of what isproduced is a collection of associations.andP;  The variety of doodles, sketchyoutlines, and disconnected notes produced in the early stages of writingbears the theory out.andM;But something of a disconnect occurs between the knowledge structures we'recomfortable with in this prewriting phase and the structures acceptable asconnected discourse.andP;  Cultural conventions prevent us from thinking of aconceptual graph as a sharable, informationally acceptable, formal artifact.andO;We must rework the connections into rhetorically meaningful patterns (such aslogical paragraphs with syntactically correct sentences) that can be ingestedlinearly, which usually means translating the conceptual graph into ahierarchical pattern.andM;Using a hypertext shell, I first created an automated storyboard, duplicatingthe features of Rittel's IBIS model.andP;  Clicking on a node opens a window andthe author can enter blocks of text (words, sentences, paragraphs, pages).andO;As the writer makes nodes and links at the drawing board, a listing of&quot;transactions&quot; is recorded in a separate file.andP;  This file becomes data for aneural net, whose output is a two-dimensional matrix, with the nodeindicators running across both the top and side of the array.andP;  The ninepotential relationships are posted in the appropriate cells and eachrepresented by a different symbol.andP;  Relationships are always expressedbottom-up (from argument to position to issue) and are not interpreted asbidirectional.andM;Consider a sample case, simplified by using only the supports and refutesrelationships.andP;  Figures 3, 4, and 5 show the three data representations.andP;  Thewriter learns to read the interrelationships expressed in the neural-netoutput matrix as a hierarchy.andP;  Additionally, after some practice ininterpreting the matrix patterns, the writer becomes skilled at manipulatinginformation to fit the aim of the text being created.andM;The matrix representation shows that Position 1 seems to be invalidated(because unsupported) when compared with Position 2.andP;  If the author feelsthat both sides of the issue have merit and wishes to present a balancedcase, formulating a paragraph or a paper around this structure would becounterproductive.andP;  A closer look at the matrix suggests a remedy.andP;  ArgumentA1, since it refutes Position 1, may by its converse support Position 2.andO;Similarly, Arguments A4, A5, and A6 may support Position 1.andP;  By flip-floppingthe arguments, a structure more congruent with the author's intent emerges.andM;Often the process behind the product in writing is abstract, leading to asense of helplessness that keeps many from formulating the strategiesnecessary for expert behavior.andP;  What we need are cognitive tools that helpvisualize a complex problem space.andP;  Transforming the unobservable intoobjects that can be examined and inspected provides a mental model whereideas can be represented and related in different configurations and levelsof specificity.andM;As future enhancements to the tool, output of the prototype's neural netcould be incorporated into more sophisticated mechanisms for feedback.andP;  Thesemantically meaningful webs could be passed through filters to display therelationships in a number of different representations.andP;  State-transitiondiagrams, flow charts, or other quasi-formalisms could be used to bringintellectual control over the body of information.andM;KNOWLEDGE WORKER'S TOOLKITandM;The information explosion has forced knowledge workers to develop morepowerful, more efficient, and faster habits of processing data.andP;  One suchheuristic, awareness of hierarchical structuring coupled with top-downproblem solving, has become a powerful strategy and greatly improvedperformance in some domains.andP;  For example, CASE tools implement thisheuristic by employing layering and abstraction to handle the complex processof designing large computer systems.andP;  Rhetoricians would do well to takeheed.andP;  Just as computers have transcended their role as mechanical numbercrunchers to enhance conceptualization and creativity in science, neural-netapplications may provide a similar collaborative function for computers inthe realm of words.andM;Douglas Englebart, a pioneer of hypertext, advocates finding a better fitbetween the human intellect and text technology.andP;  In &quot;A Conceptual Frameworkfor the Augmentation of Man's Intellect&quot; (Vistas in Information Handling,Vol.andP;  1, London, U.K.: Spartan Books, 1963), he describes a symbioticrelationship between human and computer in which &quot;the symbols with which thehuman represents the concepts he is manipulating can be arranged before hiseyes, moved, stored, recalled, operated upon according to extremely complexrules-all in very rapid response to a minimum amount of information suppliedby the human, by means of special cooperative technological devices.&quot; Thissynergy among machine, mental structures, and symbolic manipulation is theessence of cognitive tools and should serve as a model for future generationsof CAW tools.andM;This paper was written during the author's tenure as a National ResearchCouncil senior associate at the Human Resources Laboratory, IntelligentSystems Branch, Brooks Air Force Base, Texas.andP;  Findings and opinions are theauthor's, not official Air Force position or policy.andM;Patricia A.
