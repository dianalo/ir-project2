We have found that photonswith low energies and at forward angles do not constitute an appreciablebackground to the bremsstrahlung photons due to the deacceleration ofthe nuclei. The bremsstrahlung photon can therefore serve as a probeof the nuclear stopping power in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.</TEXT></DOC>
