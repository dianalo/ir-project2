WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The foreign minister will visit Irannext week and has offered to act as an intermediary in gaining therelease of foreign hostages held by Islamic radicals, diplomaticsources said today.   Iranian media also reported that Hans-Dietrich Genscher may tryto negotiate the release of foreign hostages, and that a specialeffort may be made in the case of kidnapped Anglican Church envoyTerry Waite.   The Foreign Ministry said Genscher will leave Sunday for two daysof meetings with Iranian government and industry leaders, but itdisclosed no details of the visit, which is expected to focus on theIran-Iraq war and means of improving trade ties between Bonn andTehran.   Diplomatic sources said Genscher has offered to talk with Iranianofficials or groups in an effort to gain freedom for the hostages,including nine Americans, held by pro-Iranian Islamic radicals inBeirut.   ``The minister has offered his services to secure the release ofall hostages,'' one official source told reporters. ``And theIranian government has assured us that this corresponds with theiraims.''   The sources all spoke on condition of anonymity.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored inNicosia, Cyprus, carried a report from the English-language dailyTehran Times speculating that Genscher's trip is intended asmediation in the hostage situation.   ``Everything points to this being the case, and this accords withrecent moves to have Terry Waite, the Archbishop of Canterbury'srepresentative taken hostage in Lebanon, released,'' the TehranTimes was quoted as saying.   Asked whether Genscher expected a breakthrough in Waite's case,one source said the case would be raised with Iranian officials, butthat he could not elaborate. Iranian government officials have inthe past contended they have no influence over the Beirut Shiitegroups, but the source said enlistment of the Tehran leadership ingaining the hostages' release would be pursued.   Waite and 13 other foreign hostages are held by Lebanese Shiitegroups considered loyal to Iran. There are no Germans known to beheld in Beirut.   West German officials, including Genscher, have denied mediaallegations that they paid for the release of former German hostagesAlfred Schmidt and Rudolf Cordes. The Hamburg-based Bild newspapersaid in September that as much as $22.2 million was paid for Cordes'freedom.   Cordes and Schmidt were kidnapped in Beirut in January 1987.Schmidt was released Sept. 7 of that year and Cordes was freed twomonths ago after 20 months in captivity.   Waite disappeared in January 1987 after leaving his West Beiruthotel room to negotiate the release of other hostages.   The longest held hostage is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March16, 1985.   Genscher will be accompanied by about 30 influential Germanbusinessmen who expect to meet with senior officials of the Iranianeconomics and finance ministries as well as industry representatives.   He will meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati andother senior government officials, but is not expected to seeAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the sources said.</TEXT></DOC>
