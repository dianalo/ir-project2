Law-abiding passengers deposit their $1 brass tokens into aturnstile slot. The tokens drop into a canvas bag, which thieveshave discovered is increasingly easy to reach on antiquatedturnstiles.   TA officials say the Metropolitan Transportation Authority isexpected to approve $300,000 Friday for the emergency purchase of500 new quarter-inch steel vaults to be installed into turnstilesat the worst-hit stations.   The vaults, which will replace the canvas bags, will havetamper-resistent screws, and token clerks will open them with ahigher security key than the ones now used. If the vaults areeffective, they'll be installed systemwide, Broshous said.   People can regularly be seen hawking tokens at busy subway stopsto people who don't want to wait in line at the booths whereemployees sell tokens.   ``People should realize when they buy those tokens that they aresupporting someone who is preying on the system,'' said Al O'Leary,spokesman for the transit police. ``It's drug abusers. It's thehomeless. It's people who see an easy opportunity. Because that'swhat it is.''   Some stations are robbed over and over again.   A group of people will enter a station and look for police.Lookouts are posted near entrances. Another accomplice willdistract the token clerk or block his view. Then a technician doesthe actual break in, at the rate of about 10 to 15 seconds perturnstile. Then the whole group goes to another station.   ``It's almost as if there's a predetermined plan as to how tocarry it off,'' Broshous said.   There are 13 types of turnstiles in use in the subway system's463 stations. The oldest date to the late 1920s, are wooden andwere designed to accept nickels.   ``In an era when people left their front doors open, it was asecure turnstile. By today's crack-ridden standards, it's not,''O'Leary said. </TEXT></DOC>
