Nicolae Andruta Ceausescu, 66, a former deputy interior ministerand police general, is charged with ``aggravated murder,''instigation to commit genocide, and attempted murder, for his partin efforts to suppress the popular revolt that ended his brother's24-year hold on power.   Under Romanian law ``aggravated murder'' is the slaying of morethan one person.   According to the indictment, the defendant ordered some 1,000police cadets under his command to fire on thousands ofdemonstrators in the streets of Bucharest on Dec. 21-22. When theyrefused, he allegedly shot seven protesters.   Ceausescu has denied the accusations but has admitted the lessercharge of illegal possession of firearms, the indictment said.   The trial, which was expected to last through the week, tookplace in a converted theater hall ringed with policemen andsoldiers in full combat gear. Two armored personnel carriersblocked the entrance.   The defendant sat flanked by two helmeted policemen and gazedimpassively at a three-man panel of military judges headed by Col.Igon Dima. Ceausescu bears an eerie physical resemblance to hislate brother.   He occasionally turned to glance at the courtroom, where accesswas restricted to journalists and members of the victims' families.   The 15-page indictment accused Ceausescu of ``issuing orders tohis men to open fire on demonstrators.'' It said he personally``distributed ammunition to the cadets.''   The document quoted witnesses among the security forces whotestified that ``he was shouting like a beast and shot his gun'' atthe crowds.   ``He acted to suppress the revolution and fired his gun, killingseven persons,'' the indictment said.   At one point during the trial, the parents of one of the allegedvictims, tears streaming from their eyes, accused defense attorneyVasile Soroceanu of ``protecting this hyena.''   But Ceausescu told the court he did nt initiate orders to fireon the deomnstrators. ``I did not give any orders on my owninitiative to repress the demonstrators, but I passed on through myaides the orders I received from the minister of interior.''   Soroceanu told the court the prosecution ``arbitrarily choseseven victims from the hundreds who died without any proof that(Andruta) Ceausescu had killed them.''   Hundreds of people were killed in the popular uprising thatstarted in mid-December.   Nicolae Ceausescu was toppled Dec. 22 and executed three dayslater with his wife, Elena, after a summary trial before a militarytribunal.   Following their execution, the death sentence was abolished bythe provisional leadership that took power in the chaos of therevolution.   If found guilty, the maximum penalty Ceausescu can face is lifeimprisonment.   Four of the former president's closest aides were sentenced tolife imprisonment by a military tribunal last month. His two sonsand daughter are also in custody awaiting trial, likely to open inlate April or early May, Romanian reporters said.</TEXT></DOC>
