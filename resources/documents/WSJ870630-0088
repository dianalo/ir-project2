SchmittStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/30/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> DIGTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   A group led by New York money manager Mario Gabelli said it offered to acquire Di Giorgio Corp. in a leveraged buyout that the group valued at $28 a share, or a total $238 million.    San Francisco-based Di Giorgio, a food distributor with interests in building materials and real estate development, said it was studying the &quot;unsolicited&quot; proposal and declined further comment.    The bid was made through two partnerships related to Gabelli Group Inc., which disclosed a 4.4% stake in Di Giorgio's common shares in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The filing also disclosed that a Gabelli unit manages customer accounts holding additional Di Giorgio shares, which boosts the total stake to 28.6%.    Gabelli said the $28-a-share bid includes $20 in cash and $8 in securities and calls for existing shareholders to retain a one-third stake after the buyout. A spokesman for Gabelli, a New York investment firm, said &quot;our intent is to remain friendly,&quot; but he didn't rule out a hostile bid.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Di Giorgio's stock jumped $3 to close yesterday at $30 a share, indicating that investors may be expecting a higher bid.    Di Giorgio, which has about 8.5 million shares outstanding, has been considered a takeover candidate amid the wave of food industry mergers in recent years. Last year, Kane-Miller Corp., a Tarrytown, N.Y., food processor, acquired a 9.4% stake in the company, but later reduced it after being rebuffed in an effort to gain board representation.    Mr. Gabelli himself has previously touted the stock as a takeover candidate, but now seems to be taking matters into his own hands.    In 1986, Di Giorgio profit rose 29% to $14.3 million, or $1.85 a share, from $11.2 million, or $1.72 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 17% to $1.1 billion from $936.2 million. Its food operations acccounted for about 80% of 1986 sales. </TEXT></DOC>
