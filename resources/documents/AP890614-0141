The Democrats then chose Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., to bemajority whip, making him the No. 3 Democrat in the House, behindSpeaker Thomas S. Foley and Gephardt, and the highest-ranking blackin Congress.   Gephardt defeated Georgia conservative Ed Jenkins, 181-76, andGray won with 134 votes to 97 votes for David Bonior of Michigan and30 for Beryl Anthony of Arkansas.   The two victors, both considered liberals, fill out the newleadership team Democrats have had to install in midterm because ofthe resignations of Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, and Whip TonyCoelho of California, both following ethics allegations. Foley, ofWashington, was elected speaker last week.   Shortly after their selection, Gephardt and Gray jopined othercongressional leaders for a White House meeting with President Bushon the savings and loan bailout bill.   Bush began the session by congratulating both men, saying ``Ilook forward to working with you, arguing with you, working with you_ and I do mean that.''   Gephardt accepted the No. 2 post with a call to Democrats to pushaside what he said were Republican attempts to slander the party. Atop GOP official was forced to resign last week after sending out astatement comparing Foley's voting record to that of a homosexualcongressman _ an episode Democrats contend was an example of typicalRepublican tactics.   ``Some on the other side are committed to the dark side ofpolitics, smear, innuendo, rumors, cynical media management, thepolitics of character assassination,'' Gephardt said. ``But let ussay... that we will win at the ballot box not by the force of ourslurs but the force of our ideas.''   In the secret ballot, Gray won the whip's post over two rivalsdespite news reports that personnel practices in his office wereunder investigation by the Justice Department.   After Wednesday's vote, Gray said he was helped by a statementfrom the department that he was not the subject of the federalprobe, and he was grateful for the vote of confidence from hiscolleagues.   Bonior will continue in his role as chief deputy whip and Anthonyas chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.   Jenkins said in his campaign it was time for the Democraticleadership to include a representative of the more conservative wingof the party, and although he didn't win there were assurances thata Southerner would be installed in an appointed leadership post.   ``The party has to do more... to expand to include the one-thirdof its party that is in the more conservative ranks,'' especially ifit expects to win the White House, he said.   Gephardt's experience as a presidential candidate will help theparty in the House and nationally, said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.,an ally.   ``He is more on the cutting edge of issues than we've had forsome time,'' Glickman said. And the fact that he survived the 1988presidential campaign without a hint of dirt in his background gave``in a sense a kind of a relief that people know he's got noproblems.''   In a nominating speech for Gephardt, Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.,alluded to ethics attacks on Democrats by Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.``In this era of Newtspeak, we need to confront crass with class,''Obey said, according to one staff member present.   Afterward, Gephardt echoed Foley's statement last week thatethics and campaign reform legislation is a top priority this year.But he emphasized the theme of economic nationalism that was thehallmark of his unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination lastyear.   ``In my humble opinion, America is beginning to be in a state ofdecline,'' Gephardt told reporters. ``And we as Democrats have tolead, even though it's not a crisis. Even though the presidency isheld by a different party. And even though getting our consensustogether on the Democratic side is always difficult to do.''   Wednesday's election left a vacancy in Gray's former position aschairman of the House Democratic Caucus, the No. 4 position. TheDemocrats will meet later to fill that post which is being contestedby two candidates, Reps. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and Barbara Kennelly,D-Conn.</TEXT></DOC>
