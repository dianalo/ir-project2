(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Anti-nuclear activists who haltedthe firing of a Trident 2 missile from a submarine said they won'tblock the rescheduled launch, but will continue their politicalbattle against the weapon.   Four Greenpeace U.S.A. vessels forced postponement of the launchFriday when they sailed into an off-limits danger area in theAtlantic 50 miles off Cape Canaveral and ignored repeated warningsto leave.   It was the first time in the 38-year history of Cape Canaveralthat such a protest had stopped a launching.   Steve Shellhorn, commander of one of the Greenpeace ships, saidthe activists would not be back at sea when the launch isrescheduled.   ``We think we made our point, and we've been quite successful infocusing attention on America's most expensive missile system andin delaying its operational date,'' Shellhorn said Friday.   ``We don't think we can match the Navy test for test, so we willconcentrate on eliminating the Trident 2 through the politicalprocess,'' he said. ``But we won't rule out returning to the rangeeventually.''   The Navy called off the Trident 2 test several hours after theGreenpeace vessels penetrated the safety zone.   A statement said the launch was postponed ``because ofintentional interference from foreign flag ships in a designatedhazardous operational area ... Concern for safety of theinterfering ships precluded the launch of the test missile.''   ``We're happy about it, of course,'' Greenpeace spokeswomanShannon Fagan said. ``But we would be happier if the Navy cancelledthe Trident 2 missile altogether.''   Fagan said two large Greenpeace ships and two motorized raftsshadowed the submarine for hours, exercising their right to operatein international waters. Safety regulations require that acountdown be stopped if non-essential boats approach within aboutthree miles of the submarine.   One of the motorized rafts slipped up to the submerged Tennesseeand the three-man crew attached three ``nuclear free seas'' bannersto the submarine, two to the radio mast and one on the side, Fagansaid.   She said a Navy whale boat dispatched from a cruiser twicerammed one of the Greenpeace boats, the 60-foot ketchMonticivitano, after warning it and the other intruding vesselsthat they were in danger because a missile launch was imminent. Thedamage was minor, she said.   The M.V. Greenpeace, a 190-foot vessel, flew the Dutch flag. TheMonticivitano sails under Swedish registry.   The Navy had no comment on the Greenpeace reports.   It was to have been the second underwater test firing of theTrident 2, the Navy's newest, most powerful weapon. The first test,on March 21, ended in an explosion when the $23.7 million missilepinwheeled out of control four seconds after it was launched fromthe Tennessee. Nineteen land launch pad tests, 15 of themsuccessful, preceded the sea trials.   The Navy has said it plans to have the Trident 2 operational andon station next March. The weapon has a range of 4,600 miles andcan carry up to 10 nuclear warheads. Twenty-four missiles arecarried on each sub.</TEXT></DOC>
