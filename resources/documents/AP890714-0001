(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   United Mine Workers President RichardTrumka on Friday issued a plea to striking miners to end theirunauthorized walkouts and workers in at least three states plannedto return to the coal mines.   Trumka also declared an end to the union's weeklong authorizedwork stoppage that idled 60,000 union miners east of the MississippiRiver.   ``I am personally asking our members to suspend their protestactions,'' Trumka said in a news release.   At least 37,000 miners in eight states in Appalachia and theMidwest were on unauthorized wildcat strikes before this week. Thewildcat walkouts began June 12 in support of 1,900 union members onstrike against the Pittston Coal Group Inc. in a contract dispute.   In southern Indiana, a wildcat strike by 1,750 UMW members wassuspended Friday. Alabama's 5,000 union miners also would return towork Sunday night, said a union official there. And Illinois unionrepresentatives said striking miners were planning to return to work.   But in western Kentucky, more than 1,000 wildcat strikers inUnion County said they would not return to work.   ``We told our people to go back to work, but they told us `No,''' Donald Watson, vice president of UMW Local 1071, said late Friday.   In the past, the UMW has maintained it has not asked the workersto stay away from the coal mines; and many UMW rank-and-file haveignored back-to-work orders from judges.   Trumka asked the wildcat strikers to return to work until July26, when the union's international executive board meets.   ``As the regular work schedule resumes on Monday and our membersreturn to work, we assume that the industry will cooperate with ourefforts to help restore stability in the coal fields,'' Trumka said.   ``I think by and large things should go back to normalcy onMonday,'' union spokesman Joe Corcoran said.   Trumka said miners would continue the ``memorial'' or cooling offperiods in UMW District 31 in north central West Virginia from nextMonday through Thursday and in UMW District 6 in Ohio and WestVirginia's Northern Panhandle from next Wednesday through Friday.   The announcement came during another day of unrest in the coalfields. Two mine employees were wounded by gunfire in Mingo County,and a car bomb exploded at Pittston Coal Group Inc.'s headquartersin Lebanon, Va.   A federal judge Friday also called on the UMW and The PittstonCo., parent of Pittston Coal, to meet with him to find out what hasstalled contract negotiations between the two sides.   Pittston workers in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky went onstrike April 5 after working 18 months without a contract.   The UMW on Monday began a three-day cooling-off period, which wasextended Wednesday. The days off without pay _ 10 of which areallowed the the UMW's contract with the Bituminous Coal OperatorsAssociation _ were aimed at easing coal field tensions, but unrestand violence has continued.   A bomb went off in a car parked at Pittston Coal Group'sheadquarters, said Virginia Police Sgt. Mike Frank. There were noinjuries, and no arrests were made, Frank said.   The bomb destroyed a vehicle that Pittston said was owned by areplacement worker hired during the strike against the company.   ``We're very concerned about incidents such as this,'' Pittstonspokeswoman Susan Copeland said. She said security would beincreased at the headquarters.   Corcoran said he and other union officials were unaware of theexplosion. He said it would be wrong to blame the union when noarrest has been made.   At least one other car bombing and two failed attempts at carbombings have been reported by police during the strikes in Virginia.   Two employees of non-union Hampden Coal Co. in Gilbert were hitby buck shot Friday morning as they were replacing paint-splatteredwindows that had protected a camera surveillance system, saidcompany President Sid Young III.   No arrests were made, officials said.   In Indiana, the wildcat strike was scheduled to be suspended atmidnight Friday, a union official said.   ``Members will be returning to work,'' said Roger Myers,international executive board member for the UMW's District 11.   ``We have suspended the protest for right now,'' Myers said in atelephone interview from Oakland City.   Myers added that the order to ask Indiana workers to return cameat the same time Trumka made his plea.   ``They're going back because I asked them to,'' Myers said. ``Ifelt there were some positive things happening down in Virginia andrecommended we go back to work. ''   Jerry Jones, president of UMW District 12 in Illinois, said 8,500striking Illinois miners would be returning to work in shiftsthroughout the weekend.   In Alabama, the miners would be notified Saturday to ``return towork at the next available shift,'' said Earl Brown,secretary-treasurer for UMW District 20.</TEXT></DOC>
