The failed coup shattered oil-rich Venezuela's image asone of the region's most entrenched democracies, leadinganalysts to wonder if Mr. Perez can carry out the toughpolicies that have caused unrest at home but led many abroadto extol the country as a model of reform. And some bankersfret that the international investment community's optimismover the &quot;rebirth&quot; of South American markets could be setback, at least temporarily.</LP><TEXT>   In a move that stunned Venezuelans, rebels from an eliteparatroop regiment attacked Mr. Perez's residence and thepresidential palace just after midnight Monday. They wererepelled by loyalist troops after an intense gun battle. Mr.Perez proclaimed on television that the coup failed, butwitnesses reported occasional gunfire in central Caracas andpockets of resistance outside the capital until midafternoon.At least 42 civilians and 14 soldiers were killed. More than1,000 rebels were arrested. A host of constitutional rightswere suspended for at least 10 days.   The identity of the coup leaders and their precise motivesremain hazy, but analysts say they apparently hoped tocapitalize on discontent sweeping the country to push theirown grievances, which reportedly include declining wages, afeeling that corruption is getting out of hand and anger overwhat's perceived as softness by the government in recentborder disputes with Brazil and Colombia.   The coup attempt shows that even the region's most stabledemocracies are imperiled by the tough economic adjustmentsbeing made as South America tries to incorporate itself intothe global economy. Throughout the region, these reforms areshowing results in terms of economic indicators, but at thecost of belt-tightening by the broad majority, including thearmed forces, that is fueling social tensions.   Venezuela, which has had an uninterrupted string ofdemocratically elected governments since 1958, is arguablythe most extreme example of this paradox. With the largestoil reserves in the Western Hemisphere, Venezuela isexperiencing a spectacular revival. Its economy grew 9.2%last year, the highest rate in the Americas, and thoughdeclining oil prices will slow growth this year, the economystill is expected to expand by 5%. Inflation, which peaked at89% three years ago, is now running at 30% annually.Foreign-exchange reserves top $14 billion.   But to many Venezuelans, these seeming victories, achievedthrough privatization of some state companies, slashingimport duties and subsidies and deregulating industry, havetranslated into high unemployment, declining living standardsand depreciation of the currency.   A recent poll showed that 81% of Venezuelans had little orno confidence in Mr. Perez, who in his first term in office,from 1974 to 1979, did the opposite of what he's doing today.During the past few weeks, students took to the streets toprotest a rise in bus fares and teachers went on strike overlow pay. Though far from the violence of 1989, whendemonstrations against Mr. Perez's policies left 300 peopledead, five students and two police officers have died in thelatest disturbances.   Still, Venezuelans and U.S. officials were startled by thecoup. &quot;Had you asked me what the odds were for a coup d'etatin this country, I would have said they're 100-to-1,&quot; says aCaracas banker. He says he can't understand what the rebelshad hoped to achieve.   &quot;The examples of Haiti and the ex-Soviet Union should havebeen compelling enough,&quot; the banker says. &quot;Bush would slap anembargo in one second and no one would buy a barrel of oilfrom us.&quot; But one U.S. expert notes that the vast amount oftrade between the U.S. and Venezuela would have made it hardfor Washington to impose an embargo.   Analysts are divided over the effect the coup attempt willhave on economic reforms. Political parties, including thatof Mr. Perez, are going to demand concessions that willaggravate inflation and the deficit, says the banker, whoasked not to be named.   But others expect Mr. Perez, strengthened by the coup'squick defeat, to continue with the reforms, if only becausethe hardest part has been done and Venezuela has noalternative. &quot;This could have some effects on growth thisyear and there will probably be postponements in foreigninvestment decisions, but the chances of the (economic)program continuing are very high,&quot; says Pedro Palma, apartner in the Caracas office of consultants Booz, Allen andamp;Hamilton.   &quot;There was no popular support for the coup,&quot; he adds.&quot;It's so out of fashion in Latin America.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
