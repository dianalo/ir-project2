Similar action has been taken in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungaryand East Germany as part of the wave of political upheaval andreform that is diminishing the role of the Communist Part in thosenations.   Lithuania's parliament defied Moscow with a resounding 243-1vote to end the party's total dominance of all political and socialorganizations within the Baltic republic. Another 98 deputiesabstained or stayed away from the session.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has resolutely opposed amultiparty system for the Soviet Union. The challenge to theCommunist power structure comes at a time when he faces a crippledeconomy, growing nationalism and demands from conservativecommunists for more order.   The move in Lithuania, one of 15 Soviet republics, thrilledother Soviet activists who are organizing a two-hour general strikeMonday to call for similar action by the national parliament.   ``Wonderfully done!'' said activist Yelena Bonner on hearing ofthe Lithuanian action. ``You cannot restrain the movement today.This is a good example for the other republics,'' said Bonner, wifeof Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov, one of a group ofnational parliamentarians calling for the general strike.   Estonia's parliament voted Wednesday to delay voting on asimilar switch to a multiparty system until next week, to allowtime for public discussion. Armenia's parliament was forced into apostponement Wednesday for lack of a quorum.   The Lithuanian action rescinds Article 6 of the republic'sconstitution, which says the Communist Party of the Soviet Union isthe ``leading and guiding force of Soviet society, the nucleus ofits political system, government and social organizations,''according to Tass.   In practice, it meant that Communists dominated every sphere oflife and every organization in the country. Until Gorbachev'sreforms began to loosen the iron custom, ambitious Soviets wereforced to join the party and follow its orders to rise in anyprofession.   Similar articles are found in the national constitution of theSoviet Union and those of the other 14 republics.   Word of the call for a general strike to demand a parliamentaryvote on the national version of Article 6 began to percolatethrough Soviet society Thursday, after it was reported by Westernradio stations.   On Thursday, the newspaper Izvestia published the first mentionof the strike call in a generally circulated Soviet publication.The article was highly critical of the strike call but neverthelessspread the word to the newspaper's 9.5 million readers nationwide.   It accompanied a letter from parliamentarian Yuri Chernichenkosaying he supported the call for a vote on the Communist Party'ssupremacy, but not the plan for a strike. Chernichenko's name wasamong the supporters listed on announcements of the strike.   Sakharov and his fellow deputies called the strike to pressurethe national Congress of People's Deputies into voting to rescindArticle 6 and on draft laws on land, property and businessenterprises. The Congress starts its second semi-annual sessionTuesday.   In Latvia, the People's Front is scheduled to meet with factoryand labor leaders to respond to the call for a general strike.Janis Krumins, deputy editor of the Latvian People's Frontnewspaper Atmoda, said the Latvians are likely to strongly supportthe strike, but for just 15 minutes, not two hours.   Eduardas Potashinskas, an activist who watched a live TV feed ofthe parliamentary session in the capital of Vilnius, said theSupreme Soviet directed that a new law governing the actions ofpolitical parties in the republic be prepared in the next 45 days.   Potashinkas said Lithuanian Party First Secretary AlgirdasBrazauskas and other party leaders voted for the change. He saidthat in debate Tuesday, Brazauskas had termed the decision``difficult, but correct.''   A first try Tuesday fell nine votes short of the two-thirdsmajority of 228 necessary for approval of a constitutionalamendment because so many members were absent or abstaining.   The Lithuanian Communist Party is due for a showdown with theKremlin on Dec. 19, when its party congress is to vote on a plan toseparate from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and on aprogram that includes support for Lithuanian independence.Gorbachev has spoken out sharply against both moves, but LithuanianCommunist leaders say they must change or face certain defeat inupcoming elections.</TEXT></DOC>
