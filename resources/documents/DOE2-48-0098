The application of fiber ceramics to the trap is made possibleby the development of a new processing technique of forming, corrugating,and sintering a raw-ceramic sheet obtained from ceramic fiber and cray.The trap has characteristics of not only low-back-pressure but also afilter efficiency of more than 80% thanks to the high porosity and two-dimensionalmesh structure of the fiber ceramics. Also, the trap has passed the durabilitytest of repeated regeneration by the incineration of the particulates.The test resulted in no damage, such as cracks, though a high temperatureof over 800{sup 0}C and a local thermal gradient of 20{sup 0}C/mm wereobserved. The trap is further undergoing various tests for practicaluse.</TEXT></DOC>
