Because this is no longer the case, new financing approachesare being explored. Owners had earned part of their payback by depricatingplant investments over five years and taking the 10% investment tax credit(ITC). By adding in project cash flow, private parties were able to offersponsoring municipalities deals with lower tipping fees than the cityor county would have netted had it owned the plant itself. Facilitiesunder development before the act became law were &quot;grandfathered&quot;. Butnew plants now being developed, observers say, most likely will be ownedby municipalities - because the loss of tax benefits means those whocould make an equity contribution no longer will be able to offer thoselower disposal costs. If private plant ownership is to survive as anoption for municipalities, this new financial environment demands a creativeresponse. Such a response is proposed here. This paper takes a brieflook at what the act has described.</TEXT></DOC>
