Responding to the prosecution's call for a prison term for North,defense lawyers said in court papers Monday that ``a sentence ofimprisonment would be cruel and unjust.''   ``Such a sentence would be deeply and fundamentally unfair,'' thedefense said in the pre-sentence memo filed in U.S. District Court.   The 45-year-old former National Security Council aide isscheduled to be sentenced Wednesday for three felony convictionsarising from his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.   He faces up to 10 years in prison and $750,000 in fines foraiding and abetting the obstruction of a congressional inquiry intothe affair, destroying or altering government documents andillegally accepting the installation of a security fence outside hishome by arms dealer Richard Secord.   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has asked U.S. DistrictJudge Gerhard Gesell to send the retired Marine lieutenant colonelto prison, arguing that North defied Congress and lied at his trialto win acquittal of other charges.   But defense lawyers led by Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. said theprosecution's request ``demonstrates that it will stop at nothing inits effort to crush Oliver North.''   The prosecution ``does not offer evidence to support thesecharges; it plainly assumes that if it throws enough mud, some willstick,'' the defense said. Repeating an argument made during theeight-week trial, North's lawyers said he was mostly charged withactivities that were ``authorized by his superiors.''   ``A prison sentence for Lt. Col. North would not deter highgovernment officials from using their subordinates to carry outactions that are legally or politically risky,'' the defense briefsaid.   ``It would not escape notice of such officials if Oliver Northwere to go to prison while others remain in government in positionsof power or return to private-sector sinecures,'' the defense said.   ```Those who created this situation have walked away from it,'''the defense said, quoting from a letter to the court by Noel Koch, aformer deputy assistant secretary of defense.   Imprisoning North, Koch wrote, ``will only reassure those who useyoung men like him that they can do it with impunity.''   North has suffered enough punishment with his dismissal from theWhite House staff and the threat of the loss of his Marine Corpspension as well as ``unrelenting and often hostile press scrutiny''for 2{ years, the defense said.   If the court feels that further punishment is warranted, thedefense said, it ``should take the form of probation conditioned oncommunity service.''   In a related action, Iran-Contra prosecutors opposed a request byJoseph Fernandez to subpoena former President Reagan to testify atFernandez's trial on charges of lying about his role in helping armthe Nicaraguan Contra rebels.   Walsh's office said testimony by Reagan about his support for theContras was irrelevant to charges that Fernandez lied whenquestioned by a presidential commission and his CIA superiors abouthis efforts to set up an airstrip in Costa Rica for the Contraresupply network.   Fernandez, former CIA station chief in Costa Rica, is scheduledto stand trial July 24 in federal court in Alexandria, Va.</TEXT></DOC>
