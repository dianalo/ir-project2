The bad news comes from budget-cutters who are slashing 10percent of the corporation's staff, closing television stations andreducing services.   Their goal is to make up a projected shortfall of $91 million innext year's $935 million budget.   Declining advertising revenues, reduced government funding andrising TV production costs have hurt the network deeply. About 75percent of production costs comes from the government.   Angry public protests have occurred from Newfoundland to Ontarioto the Gaspe Peninsula of Quebec over what many feel are cuts inone of the few things that make Canadians really different fromAmericans.   The CBC will cut 1,100 of its nearly 11,000 permanent positions,effective April 5.   The CBC is known internationally for highly rated dramas. Fully82 percent of its television prime time is Canadian in content,this year featuring such drama series as ``Road to Avonlea,'' ``DeGrassi High,'' and ``Street Legal.''   Previous budget cuts have slowed efforts to make CBC prime time95 percent Canadian. The latest round of layoffs are aimed mainlyat local stations, but are also expected to have some impact at thenational level.   In announcing the cutbacks and closures Dec. 5, CBC PresidentGerard Veilleux said they were permanent and would not be reversedeven if there is a turn in the 54-year-old corporation's economicfortunes.   A major element in the cost-saving program was closure of threetelevision stations entirely and reducing eight others to smallnews reporting bureaus feeding their reports into regional andnational centers.   Windsor, a city of 200,000 inhabitants just across the DetroitRiver from a megalopolis of 4{ million, was particularly hard-hitbecause cancellation of the CBC's local programming there left itonly with news canned in Toronto.   ``This is Windsor, and we're sick of getting shoved around,''Mayor John Millson told the 5,000 people who took to the streets onSunday.   Most major Canadian cities have competing private radio andtelevision stations, some providing popular local newscasts.   But the loss of a strong CBC presence in Windsor means it iseven more difficult to maintain a separate identity from Detroit,which has more than 60 television and radio stations beaming intoCanada.   Getting local news is very important to Windsor residents,particularly on weekends when there is no Sunday paper.   Employees in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan have received a provincialgrant to study the feasibility of buying the local CBC station,reduced to a reporting bureau for the regional center in Regina.   The corporation says there have been a number of queries topurchase stations, which will be considered.   The CBC says that henceforth it will be not have more than oneEnglish-language station and one French-language station perprovince.   That means for example that Calgary, Alberta, no longer has itsown local CBC newscasts but instead must transmit versions itreceives from rival Edmonton.   Closure of Goose Bay, which served 35 small communities, meansnews for Labrador will be produced in St. John's, 450 miles away.The same is true for Saskatoon and Regina.   The CBC also announced it no longer will operate theparliamentary channel, which broadcasts debate in the House ofCommons, or Radio Canada International, the shortwave service thatbroadcasts in 14 languages abroad.   Iqbal Rahemtulla, a spokesman for the corporation, said theHouse of Commons may take over the funding of the parliamentarybroadcast and the Ministry of External Affairs, because ofinternational ramifications, is considering ways to maintain RadioCanada International's services.   If all that wasn't bad enough, the CBC's projections show thatthere will be another shortfall of about $42 million in the 1992-93budget.   Emerging relatively unscathed, except for a 1 percent budgetreduction, is CBC Radio, broadcasting in both French and English toevery Canadian in this gigantic country.   The radio, which carries no advertising, features news, currentevents, talk shows and music to a wide range of audiences on bothAM and FM.   Its Northern Service also broadcasts in English, French andeight native languages and dialects.   Also continuing are the network's well-regarded nationaltelevison news programs ``The Journal'' and ``The National,'' aswell as its 24-hour all-news channel, ``Newsworld.''   ``It is certainly sad,'' said Rahemtulla. ``The CBC has been cutto the bone now.''</TEXT></DOC>
