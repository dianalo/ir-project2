 These switches are fully ISDN-compatible, andtheir open architectural framework accommodates equipment from multiplevendors.andM;Universal port architecture accounts for the Definity's small footprint andseamless growth potential.andP;  One circuit pack gives you eight digital portsand eight or 16 analog ports.andP;  You can start up a Definity Generic 1 with aslittle as 40 lines, and work all the way up to a gargantuan 30,000 lineGeneric 2.andM;Looking for a top-of-the-line proprietary instrument for use with theDefinity?andP;  Lucky you.andP;  You've just happened to brush by the ATandamp;T 7507 ISDNterminal.andP;  This fine specimen of digital desktop-ware gives you integratedvoice/data, 31 call appearances, a two-line by 40 character display and ahigh-resolution speakerphone.andM;ATandamp;T has developed an ACD package of unparalleled capability and power foruse with their Definity switches.andP;  This ACD harbors an exclusive Look-AheadInterflow feature, allowing an ACD call to be redirected to the vector ofanother switch within a private ISDN PRI network.andM;The Definity's ISDN prowess is also evinced by the Service Node Controller,or SNC.andP;  SNC is an ISDN Central Office switching application which bringsPrimary Rate Interface into the Electronic Tandem Network environment -- yetanother prime example of ATandamp;T's ironclad commitment to network/CPEintegration.andM;ATandamp;T System 25andM;Min/Max Stations: 20; 200 Min/Max Trunks: 8; 104 Technology: Digital, TDM,PCM Direct T-1 Interface?: NoandM;The ATandamp;T System 25 is a digital switch with impressive voice/datacapabilities.andP;  It is non-blocking at up to 230 ports, and can accommodate astunning 2,500 busy hour calls.andP;  That's a lot to ask from a system with a200-line ceiling, but then again ATandamp;T always answers your telecom needs witha resounding yes.andM;The central processor for this system is the Motorola 68010, operating atspeeds of 16 bit, 8 MHz.andP;  The switch has 192 RAM and 1 Meg ROM of memory.andP;  Toprotect valuable programming information, the System 25 can reload from aninternal floppy disk, from an external data recorder and from an internalhard disk.andM;The System 25 supports the StarLAN network, allowing networked PCs toexchange information with local and remote computers without the burdens ofindividual data connections and modems.andP;  Plug-in components allow you to growfrom a couple of PCs to up to 100 terminals, printers and desktop computers.andM;Advanced Administration Software allows you to manage your system on your ownpremises.andP;

384/1,200 Min Trunks: 2 Technology: Digital, PCM, TDMDirect T-1 Interface?: YesandM;Mr.andP;  Klaus Gueldenpfennig, president of Redcom, is perhaps the most effectiveadvocate for the SBX imaginable.andP;  We asked him to give us three good reasonswhy we should choose this switch over the formidable competition.andP;  Hisanswers did not disappoint.andM;First off, Mr. Gueldenpfennig likes to highlight the SBX's uniquearchitecture: &quot;The truly distributed architecture enables the SBX to beserviced with ease as well as providing cost-effective expansion.&quot;andM;True.andP;  The switch harbors only a small number of different printed wiringboard types, using a maximum level of integrated circuitry.andP;  This makes theunit especially easy to service.andP;  And the SBX's use of 48-port MSU buildingblocks allows you to expand your system in increments which closely parallelyour growing needs.andM;Second on Mr. Gueldenpfenning's list of talking points is the SBX's extensiveinventory of features.andP;  &quot;Even in the low-port sizes,&quot; he asserts, &quot;the SBXgives you such standards as call forwarding, call waiting, last numberredial, hold, speed dial, auto and auto call back.andM;The last thing Mr. Gueldenpfennig will point out is the robust set of optionsyou can choose for the SBX.andP;  Large system perks such as an attendant console,integrated voice/data, recorded announcement capabilities, 16-partyconferencing and network capability can all be harnessed for immediatetelecom action.andM;Also not to be sneezed at is Redcom's VODAS-K -- a flagship voice over datakey phone.andP;  It can manage simultaneous voice and data through your existingwiring.andP;  It gives you a combination of programmable keys and mode selectionto let you customize to your heart's content.andP;  And it provides intra-networkcall status information via a full display.andM;For 1989, the SBX has acquired R2 compelled signalling in a dialing format,integrated auto-attendant/ACD, user-programmable call progress signals andnetworking with multi-node operation, making a good thing even better.andM;SiemensandM;Saturn IandM;Min/Max stations: 24;
