Bush made the comments when asked if he was willing to considerrelaxing the longstanding trade restraints in light of the recentdemocratic movements sweeping Eastern Europe.   Senior administration officials, speaking on the condition ofanonymity, said that the United States is willing to give a fullre-evaluation to East-West trade curbs that have multiplied overthe past 40 years.   The re-evaluation mentioned by Bush would seek to separate itemsthat had real potential military applications from commercial itemsthat provide little realistic national security threat, theofficials said.   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has been in the forefront ofthe move to relax the trade restraints.   Although these restrictions were designed to keep materials thatcould have military application from finding their way to Sovietbloc nations, critics contend they also impede shipment of hundredsof consumer products _ ranging from home computers to even somekitchen appliances _ that contain sophisticated electroniccomponents.   European allies, including France, have been urging a relaxationin these restrictions for some time _ in part because East blocnations have been able to freely buy the same goods from othernations, particularly from Asian competitors.   But the United States in the past has resisted any majorrevamping of the system.   And, even Saturday, Bush told reporters, ``There are stilllegitimate national security interests that must be preserved and Idon't think we have one iota of difference with France on that.''   The set of trade rules of what can be imported into Warsaw Pactnations from the West is regulated by the Paris-based CoordinatingCommittee for Multilateral Export Controls, or COCOM for short.   This committee is made up of the United States, its NATO alliesand Japan.   Bush's comments Saturday were the first public sign that theUnited States is now willing to consider a major relaxation of thetrade restrictions.   It previously granted most-favored nation status to Hungary,supported a variety of economic incentives for Poland and agreed tosupport the Soviet Union's longstanding application to participateas an observer in an international trade forum, the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade.</TEXT></DOC>
