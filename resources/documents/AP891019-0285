BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   AMR Corp. has broken its silence imposed sinceDonald Trump made his since-aborted $7.5 billion takeover offer,calling the bid for the parent of American Airlines``ill-considered and reckless.''   The New York billionaire retorted Wednesday that the board'sstatement was ``strident and pompously self-serving'' and accusingAMR management of ``smugness'' in it attitude toward stockholders.   After a meeting Wednesday, the AMR board issued a statementsaying, ``We are pleased that Mr. Donald Trump has withdrawn hisuninvited proposal to negotiate a cash merger agreement with AMR.... AMR has not been, and is not, for sale.''   The statement was the first of substance from the FortWorth-based company since it received Trump's offer Oct. 4.   ``AMR has been operating pursuant to a highly successfullong-term plan designed to create growth and value,'' the statementsaid. ``We see absolutely no basis for departing from that strategyand believe that the imposition of a highly leveraged capitalstructure would have very unfavorable effects.''   The board took no other action stemming from Trump's offer, saidspokesman John Hotard.   Some industry analysts had speculated the board might erectstronger takeover defenses, such as taking advantage of lower stockprices to create an employee stock ownership plan that would placea big block of shares in presumably friendly hands, making ahostile takeover nearly impossible.   ``AMR's reference to its successful long-term plan ... isparticularly ironic on a day that AMR reported a significantdecline in net income ... and has warned its shareholders of adisappointing fourth quarter to come,'' Trump said in New York.   ``AMR's smugness about its marketplace perception ought perhapsto give way to a concern for its shareholders,'' he said. ``Todate, AMR has yet to pay any dividend.''   AMR stock rose 75 cents to close at $74 a share Wednesday inheavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.   Trump withdrew his bid Monday because of the tumble in AMR'sstock price during and after the market's Friday the 13th selloff.   The selloff was sparked by troubles in financing a $6.75 billionmanagement-employee buyout of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines.AMR stock had hit $107 immediately after Trump's offer, but fell tothe mid-$70s in the market plunge.   Trump said he would consider other options, including sellinghis AMR shares or making a lower offer. However, analysts doubt hecan return with a bid below the $120 a share he already offered.   Financing questions dogged Trump's proposal and analystsquestioned how he would raise enough money in the unsettled creditmarkets beyond the $1 billion in equity he promised to put uphimself.   AMR had focused on the debt in its initial, vague response tothe flashy tycoon's proposal for the nation's largest airline andChairman Robert L. Crandall repeated that concern Wednesday.   ``Imposing extraordinary levels of debt on an airline,particularly without the active cooperation of both management andemployees, will not serve the long-term interests of anyone,''Crandall said.   ``The public will be disadvantaged if excessive financingreduces an airline's ability to seize new opportunities, topromptly replace old airplanes, to be responsive to environmentaldesires for quieter airplanes, to produce adequate passenger andfreight facilities, to finance state-of-the-art maintenance andpilot training facilities ...,'' Crandall said.   AMR said its profit in the three months ended Sept. 30 fell to$137 million, or $2.16 per share, from $150.3 million, or $2.50 ashare, in the same period last year. Revenue rose to $2.73 billionfrom $2.33 billion last year.   Crandall blamed the results on a slight decrease in yield and amore than 11 percent increase in fuel prices from a year earlier,and said AMR expected those trends to continue in the fourthquarter.   ``This unhappy outlook ... underscores the continuing volatilityof airline earnings and the importance of an adequate capitalbase,'' he said.   Crandall told analysts last month that profits through next yearwould be squeezed by the gradual recovery of Eastern Airlines froma crippling strike, higher labor costs, expansion of service andpurchase of new aircraft.   Crandall said the airline had 21.6 percent of the domesticmarket during the quarter.   For the first nine months, AMR's earnings rose 15.5 percent to$415.9 million, or $6.59 per share, from $360.1 million, or $5.99per share, a year earlier. Revenue in the nine-month period rose to$7.89 billion from $6.46 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
