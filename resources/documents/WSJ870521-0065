Clayton andamp; Dubilier, a New York-based investment firm, said a fund it manages now owns 70% of Borg-Warner Industrial Products Inc., with most of the remaining equity owned by management. Clayton andamp; Dubilier said Citibank provided a $160 million line of credit to finance the transaction.    The industrial-products group, which has annual sales of $300 million, develops and makes fluid-transfer and control equipment. Borg-Warner's other interests include chemicals, automotive parts and protective services.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
