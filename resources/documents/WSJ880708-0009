Insiders said the chairman would put the draft before his committee for a vote next week only if it attracts broad backing. But senior Republicans on the panel declined to back the draft, and Rep. St Germain was still trying to round up support late yesterday.    If his committee fails to act next week, that will dim considerably the prospects for final congressional action this year on a major banking bill.    As expected, Mr. St Germain's bill would give bank affiliates broad new securities-underwriting powers. But it would bar federal regulators from expanding banks' authority to engage in real estate brokerage or development. It includes insurance restrictions onerous to some banks. And its consumer-service requirements, while toned down from an earlier draft, continue to spark strong resistance from bankers.    Charles Pistor, president of the American Bankers Association, called the bill &quot;anti-consumer and anti-competition.&quot; He charged that the bill's &quot;new restraints, costly new regulatory burdens and encroachments on states' rights would reduce the ability of banks to compete.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
