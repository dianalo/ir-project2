The settlement reached with the Commodity Futures TradingCommission concludes a 13-count administrative complaintfiled by the agency in January 1987.</LP><TEXT>   The penalty comes at a time when the agency would benefitfrom appearing to be a strong regulator. The Bushadministration is proposing to wrest oversight of stock-indexfutures away from the CFTC and grant the power to theSecurities and Exchange Commission. That shift is vehementlyopposed by the commodity regulator, which is backed in thefight by the commodity exchanges.   The CFTC said the Merc violated rules requiring exchangesto tell the agency if a member firm fails to provideCFTC-required reports. When the four firms didn't comply, theMerc didn't disclose that, the agency said.   A spokesman for the exchange said the complaint resultedfrom a disagreement over interpretation of CFTC regulations.   &quot;I think there was honest disagreement over what should orshouldn't have been reported,&quot; Merc spokesman Andrew Yemmasaid. &quot;You can't always know exactly what somebody wants, andour interpretation of what to provide was different thantheirs.&quot;   &quot;The whole purpose of the case,&quot; said CFTC enforcementdirector Dennis Klejna, &quot;is to drive home the point that theexchanges have an obligation to inform the commission whenthey learn of the inadequacies and we haven't been informed.&quot;   It isn't unusual for the agency to charge exchanges withfailing to follow their own rules, as in this case, he said.But, &quot;This is the first time we've brought an action againstan exchange for failing to provide notice to the commission&quot;of firms' deficiencies, Mr. Klejna said.   The four firms -- CRT Services Inc., Chicago Grain andamp;Financial Futures Co., Rouse Woodstock Inc. andContiCommodity Services Inc. -- failed to make reportsrelating to early warning net capital levels, which tell theagency that the firm might be headed for trouble; majorinadequacies in internal controls; and non-current books andrecords, the CFTC said. Financial audits of the firms fromSeptember 1982 to March 1984 showed the problems, the agencysaid.   A CRT Services official said the problem resulted from anerror in a computer program used by the firm that wasimmediately corrected. The three other firms have gone out ofbusiness or have been acquired by other commodity-tradingfirms since the alleged violations occurred.   Although no charges have been filed against the firms forsimilar reporting violations, both Rouse and ContiCommodityin recent years have settled CFTC charges of fraud and otherviolations, the agency said.   The Merc, which settled the complaint without admitting ordenying guilt, also agreed to let the CFTC more closelymonitor the exchange's enforcement of its financialcompliance program for two years.   The Merc's agreement was second in size to the $200,000settlement by the New York Mercantile Exchange in the early1980s for problems stemming from the 400-ounce gold contract.The case resulted in the delisting of the contract.</TEXT></DOC>
