Preliminary information indicatedthat the concentration of carbon dioxide in the incoming air will needto be reduced to 5--100 ppM. A detailed calculation was performed topredict the performance of a full-size-vehicle system with 6-m{sup 2}air-cathode surface area; results showed that previous estimates of systemperformance are reasonable and consistent with currently available components.39 refs., 46 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
