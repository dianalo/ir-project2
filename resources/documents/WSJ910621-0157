The huge listincludes everything from automobiles to feminine hygieneproducts. &quot;How can you possibly be hopeful about a countrythat continues to attempt to fight inflation with pricecontrols?&quot; asks Mr. Campos. &quot;This must be the mosteconomically retarded country in the world.&quot;   Many Latin American nations are now taking serious stepsto liberalize their economies. Brazil, however, is not one ofthem. President Collor de Mello visited the U.S. this week todiscuss a hemispheric free trade zone, but interventionistpolicies continue to stifle his country.</LP><TEXT>   At least the &quot;Zelia Nightmare&quot; is over. Although Mr.Collor campaigned for the presidency last year on a promiseto bring Brazil into the global economy, the thrust of hisfirst economics minister, Zelia Cardoso de Mello, was inprecisely the opposite direction. In one year, Ms. Cardosasubjected the country to two major economic plans based oncommand and control models. In March 1990, she froze allfinancial accounts of more than $1,000. This, along with atightening of price controls, pushed the nation's $340billion economy into a severe contraction, even as inflationreached 1,200%. The second plan, initiated in January 1991,included a new round of price freezes and led to furthereconomic contraction (GNP has fallen by at least 6% in thefirst four months of this year). After the failure of thesecond economic program Ms. Cardoso was forced to resign.   &quot;The worst thing about the economy under Zelia was theatmosphere of antagonism that existed between the governmentand the private sector,&quot; says Miguel Jorge, vice president ofcorporate affairs at Auto Latina. He had to travel almostweekly from Sao Paulo to the capital of Brasilia forbargaining sessions on price controls. &quot;At one meeting,&quot; hesays, &quot;about 20 of the top industrialists in Brazil wereassembled to discuss proposed price rules. Zelia'srepresentative kept us waiting for almost two hours, and thenimmediately started in by lecturing to us about how our pricerequests were out of line. This was quite typical.&quot;   Perhaps the best thing about the Zelia Nightmare was thatthe command model was conspicuously discredited after havingbeen given every chance to succeed. Ms. Cardoso'sreplacement, former Ambassador to the U.S. Marcilio MarquesMoreira, is viewed as much less interventionist and hasstated clearly that &quot;there will be no more economic `plans.'&quot;This has produced a sigh of relief in the business community.The new economic team has already proved much more flexiblethan the outgoing team, which resigned en masse with Ms.Cardoso last month. Nevertheless, price controls, tariffs,outright prohibition of imports (like the infamous lawprohibiting imports of many software programs and personalcomputers), subsidization of more than 200 state-ownedindustries, and dozens of confiscatory taxes continue toprevent this market of 150 million consumers from growing.   Of course, the impact of these policies on Brazil'sindustrialists is far less critical than it is on theworking-class poor. Lincoln Ferreira is the owner of aconvenience store in a favela (or slum) called Sao Bernardoon the outskirts of Sao Paulo. His major concern right now isthat his inventory isn't moving; the purchasing power of hiscustomers has declined 40% in the past six months. Like mostof the workers in this favela, Mr. Ferreira migrated to thecity from the impoverished northeast of Brazil. But he'sthinking about moving back. &quot;At least there we could growfood for ourselves.&quot;   A neighbor, Jose Franco, works at a nearby car plant. Hepulls out his last pay stub and shakes his head at all thedeductions for taxes. &quot;If it weren't for these taxes, I couldbuy winter clothes for my children.&quot; Mr. Franco says he praysto God that his children will at least get an education thatwill get them out of the favela. But this is unlikely; theschools are now so poorly staffed that classes are held onlyfrom 11:30 until 2 p.m.   One reason for the dramatic decline in public services isthat public funds continue to be funneled to the manyinefficient state enterprises that were supposed to have beenprivatized. The privatization plans never took off. &quot;WhenCollor came into office, he thought he could do it alone,without becoming affiliated with a major political party,&quot;says Sao Paulo stock analyst Steven Popovics. &quot;But then herealized he had to make deals.&quot; Mr. Popovics cites a deal Mr.Collor made with former president Jose Sarney, now a senatorfrom the northern state of Amapa. In exchange for his supporton other matters in Congress, Mr. Collor has agreed tocontinue with a construction project that became a politicalembarrassment when Mr. Sarney was president: a billion dollarnorth-south railway line that, like many federal constructionprojects, was found to have gross irregularities in thebidding process.   &quot;Well, the shortest distance between two points inpolitics is never a straight line,&quot; sighs Ozires Silva, whoin March resigned in frustration as the economics minister incharge of privatizations. &quot;Yes, the president was forced tomake too many deals, and as a result, action onprivatizations has been severely hampered. But he has alsobeen hemmed in by our ridiculous constitution.&quot; Brazil iscurrently saddled with a constitution that became a politicalpork barrel when it was re-written three years ago. Mr. Silvacounts more than 70 amendments concerning consumer rightsfrom the book length constitution. Says Mr. Silva: &quot;The newlegal structure of the country has made it very difficult toreform the economy.&quot;   Actually, the judiciary is being used to fight economiccontrols. Tens of thousands of legal claims are being made byindividuals and companies attempting to have their frozenassets returned. And the complainants are winning. The courtshave shown an unforeseen independence from the executivebranch, going so far as to issue a warrant for the arrest offormer Central Bank president Ibrahim Eris when he refused toobey a court order to release the assets of a stock company.(Mr. Eris, was forced to hide out in his office for fivehours as federal agents searched for him.) So successful havethese individual suits been that lawyers are offering todefend these cases with no money up front, in return for 10%of the proceeds once the assets are returned. This isparticularly impressive because losers of civil claims mustpay the winners' attorneys' fees.   In fairness to Mr. Collor, there have been some notablegains -- the removal of more than a thousand items from thelist of formerly banned imports and the lowering of sometariffs. But the special interests that benefit fromprotection and subsidies have yet to be taken on. Thesevested interests are the same groups that oppose competitiveopenings around the worldthe contractors who pay offpoliticians, the unions that threaten strikes, theintellectual &quot;statesmen&quot; who claim to be more concerned withnational sovereignty than with their government perks.   They were all well represented at a conference last weekin Rio, co-sponsored by the Manhattan Institute and theGetulio Vargas Institute, the former a free market think tankin New York, and the latter a Brazilian think tank with aclear preference for the status quo. So discouraged was oneU.S. participant with a Brazilian intellectual's rejection ofeconomic opening that he abruptly left the conference,saying: &quot;I'm going home to read Marx; I prefer to get myMarxism undiluted.&quot;   However, what the participants at the conference did notsee was the growing frustration of a new generation ofentrepreneurs in Brazil. These young businessmen long to seeBrazil become an active member of the global economy. A newSao Paulo group called the National Base of ThinkingBusinesspeople (Pensamento Nacional das Bases Empresarais)has begun to coordinate lobbying activity. &quot;In Brazil, 50% ofthe industry is controlled by 2% of the industrialists,&quot; saysPNBE co-founder Emerson Kapaz, a 36-year-old owner of a toymanufacturing company. &quot;Most of this 2% survive on governmentcontracts and by keeping this country closed to competition-- external or internal. That's why they don't want to openup.&quot;   But Mr. Kapaz is hopeful that Brazil's established elitewill see the necessity of change. &quot;Brazil is like a hugeocean liner that has been slowly sinking,&quot; says Mr. Kapaz.&quot;The elite are in the top cabins, so they haven't beennoticing as the rest of us have been going under water. Butnow the water is beginning to tickle their feet and they seethat the they're on the same sinking ship. I believe thateven the protected groups now see that we can no longer goagainst the tide of history.&quot;   It is to be hoped that President Collor was encouragedduring his visit to the U.S. to begin free trade talks. Buthe should also realize how important it is to get his ownhouse in order. Mexico began down the road leading to itsfree trade agreement in 1986 when it joined the GATT andbegan to open its economy. Only then was it possible to enterinto serious discussion about a free trade agreement. Bythose standards, Brazil has a long way to go.   ---   Mr. Asman is the editor of the Journal's Americas column.</TEXT></DOC>
