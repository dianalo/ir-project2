(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A pair of IBM employees who thought theyhad pulled off an undetectable theft were arrested in a parking lottrying to peddle discount computer parts to undercover officers.   Jay Robert Wetterer, 36, and Steven Mark Shoeppe, 34, both ofBoca Raton, were held Thursday at the Manatee County Jail on $10million bail each.   Circuit Judge George Brown said the high bond was justified bythe value of the stolen goods and the suspects' extensiveout-of-state contacts.   The theft of $1.8 million in computer chips and other parts _one of the biggest ever at International Business Machines Corp. _began when Wetterer and Shoeppe tried to take advantage of a glitchin inventory records, said Sam Jones, spokesman for the Tampa Bayregion of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.   Wetterer, a senior buyer who worked for IBM for eight years, andShoeppe, a cost engineer for 10 years, allegedly took the chips andtried to sell them at a reduced price, Jones said.   After lengthy negotiations, state undercover agents arranged tobuy 910 parts from Wetterer and Shoeppe for $300,000 in theSarasota parking lot, authorities said.   Each faces two counts each of dealing in stolen property, grandlarceny, grand theft and crimes against computers.   In June 1988, IBM officials announced they were moving thecompany's personal computer manufacturing plant from Boca Raton toRaleigh, N.C.   During the relocation, about 1,300 memory-boosting computerparts were incorrectly labeled and sent to a repackaging plant inWest Palm Beach.   ``So the officials from the West Palm Beach office said, `Get ahold of our man Wetterer and let him straighten it out,''' Jonessaid.   ``Apparently (Wetterer) felt everything was so busy, that no onewould notice them missing,'' Jones said. ``Not only would thecompany not know they were missing, they would not be able to tracethem.''</TEXT></DOC>
