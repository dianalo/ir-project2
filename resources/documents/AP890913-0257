The virus cripples personal computers' hard disks, where programsand data are stored, by wiping out the directory sections known asthe partition table and file allocation table.   ``It's like taking away the index from the library,'' said JohnMcAfee, chairman of the Computer Virus Industry Association in SantaClara, Calif.   The industry association says it has created a program that willdetect the virus and another one that will eradicate it. Both areavailable free from computer bulletin boards or from the associationitself.   But McAfee said Tuesday that the virus, while unusually harmful,is so rare that most PC owners do not need to be overly concerned.   ``It's a low-probability, high-consequence risk,'' said Harold J.Highland, editor of Computers andamp; Security in Elmont, N.Y.   The virus was named the Datacrime virus by its unknown creatorbut goes by several other names, including the Columbus Day virus,the Icelandic virus and the Friday the 13th virus, since Friday,Oct. 13, is the first day it could strike.   The virus is spread by contaminated floppy disks or over phonelines and lurks inside contaminated programs until after Oct. 12,when it will be activated by the computer's internal clock. Onlycomputers that use Microsoft Corp.'s MS-DOS operating system can beinfected.</TEXT></DOC>
