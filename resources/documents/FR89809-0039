In accordance with NAECA,the Department has reviewed amendments to the prescribed standards. Asa result of its review, DOE proposes that revised standards for dishwashers,clothes washers and clothes dryers would result in a significant conservationof energy and would be economically justified. For clothes washers, the Department is not proposing a specific level withinthe range considered; rather, DOE is soliciting comments and informationfrom the public to be considered in promulgating the final rule, whichwill specify a specific level for clothes washers; the level selected couldinclude no change to the standard level prescribed by NAECA. For dishwashers, the Department is proposing a minimum energy efficiencystandard. For clothes dryers, the Department is proposing a prescriptive standardthat would require clothes dryers to be equipped with an automatic terminationdevice, either a moisture termination or temperature termination device.The purpose of this notice of proposed rulemaking is to provide interestedpersons an opportunity to comment on the proposed rule, and to invite interestedpersons to participate in the appliance energy conservation standards rulemakingprocess.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> Written comments on the proposed rule must be receivedby the Department by October 10, 1989.

Authority Part B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Pub.L. 94-163, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA),Pub. L. 95-619, by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA),Pub. L. 100-12, and by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendmentsof 1988 (NAECA 1988), Pub. L. 100-357,\1\<NOTE/> created the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Productsother than Automobiles. The consumer products subject to this program (oftenreferred to hereafter as ``covered products'') are: refrigerators, refrigerator-freezersand freezers; dishwashers; clothes dryers; water heaters; central air conditionersand central air conditioning heat pumps; furnaces; direct heating equipment;television sets; kitchen ranges and ovens; clothes washers; room air conditioners;fluorescent lamp ballasts; and pool heaters; as well as any other consumerproduct classified by the Secretary of Energy. Section 322. To date, theSecretary has not so classified any additional products.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Part B of Title III of EPCA, as amended by NECPA, NAECA,and NAECA 1988, is referred to in this notice as the ``Act.'' Part B ofTitle III is codified at 42 U.S.C. 6291 et seq. Part B of Title III ofEPCA, as amended by NECPA only, is referred to in this notice as NECPA.Under the Act, the program consists essentially of three parts: testing,labeling, and mandatory energy conservation standards. The Department ofEnergy (DOE or Department), in consultation with the   National Instituteof Standards and Technology (NIST), is required to amend or establish newtest procedures as appropriate for each of the covered products. Section323. The purpose of the test procedures is to provide for test resultsthat reflect the energy efficiency, energy use, or estimated annual operatingcosts of each of the covered products. Section 323(b)(3). A test procedureis not required if DOE determines by rule that one cannot be developed.Section 323(d)(1). One hundred and eighty days after a test procedure fora product is adopted, no manufacturer may represent the energy consumptionof, or the cost of energy consumed by the product except as reflected ina test conducted according to the DOE test procedure. Section 323(c)(2).The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is required by the Act to prescriberules governing the labeling of covered products for which test procedureshave been prescribed by DOE. Section 324(a). These rules are to requirethat each particular model of a covered product bear a label that indicatesits annual operating cost and the range of estimated annual operating costsfor other models of that product. Section 324(c)(1). Disclosure of estimatedoperating cost is not required under section 324 if the FTC determinesthat such disclosure is not likely to assist consumers in making purchasingdecisions or is not economically feasible. In such a case, FTC must requirea different useful measure of energy consumption. Section 324(c). At thepresent time there are FTC rules requiring labels for the following products:room air conditioners, furnaces, clothes washers, dishwashers, water heaters,freezers, refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers, and central air conditioners.44 FR 66475, November 19, 1979, and 52 FR 46888, December 10, 1987. For each of 12 of the covered products, the Act prescribes an initial Federalenergy conservation standard. Section 325 (b)-(h). The Act establisheseffective dates for the standards in 1988, 1990, 1992 or 1993, dependingon the product, and specifies that the standards are to be reviewed bythe Department within three to ten years, also depending on the product.Section 325 (b)-(h). After the specified three- to ten-year period, DOEmay promulgate new standards for each product; however, the Secretary maynot prescribe any amended standard which increases the maximum allowableenergy use, or decreases the minimum required energy efficiency, of a coveredproduct. Section 325(1)(1). The Department's current review of standardsis for dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers. Any new or amended standard is required to be designed so as to achievethe maximum improvement in energy efficiency that is technologically feasibleand economically justified. Section 325(1)(2)(A). Section 325(1)(2)(B)(i) provides that before DOE determines whether a standardis economically justified, it must first solicit comments on a proposedstandard. After reviewing comments on the proposal, DOE must then determinethat the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens, based, to the greatestextent practicable, on a weighing of the following seven factors: (1) The economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on theconsumers of the products subject to such standard; (2) The savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average lifeof the covered product in the type (or class) compared to any increasein the price of, or in the initial charges for, or maintenance expensesof the covered products which are likely to result directly from the impositionof the standard; (3) The total projected amount of energy savings likely to result directlyfrom the imposition of the standard; (4) Any lessening of the utility or the performance of the covered productslikely to result from the imposition of the standard; (5) The impact of any lessening of competition, determined in writing bythe Attorney General, that is likely to result from the imposition of thestandard; (6) The need for national energy conservation; and (7) Other factors the Secretary considers relevant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In addition, the Act specifies criteria for petitions to DOE in regardto amendments to standards. Section 325(k). Under the Act, any person maypetition the Department to conduct a rulemaking to amend a Federal energyconservation standard for any covered product. Section 325(k)(1). The Departmentmust grant such a petition if it determines that an amended standard willresult in significant conservation of energy, is technologically feasibleand is cost-effective. Section 325(k)(2). Sections 325(k)(3) (A) and (B) stipulate that in no case may an amendedstandard apply to products manufactured within three years or five years,depending on the product, after publication of the final rule establishinga standard. Prior to proposing a new or amended standard, DOE is required to publishan advance notice of proposed rulemaking which specifies the type (or class)of covered product to which the rule may apply and which provides a 60-dayperiod during which interested persons may submit written comments. Section325(m)(1) (A) and (B). Section 326 of the Act authorizes the Secretary to require manufacturersto submit information or reports to assure that each covered product towhich a standard applies meets the required energy efficiency level. TheAct also specifies that in determining information requirements, DOE considerexisting sources of information, including nationally recognized tradeassociation certification programs. Section 326(d). Enforcement-related provisions of the Act provide for: (1) DOE to prescriberules requiring manufacturers to allow the Department to observe testingand inspect results of testing conducted by the manufacturer (section 326(b)(5));(2) manufacturers to supply to DOE a reasonable number of products fortesting purposes (section 326(b)(3)); (3) manufacturers to submit informationor reports necessary to ensure compliance (section 326(d)); and (4) injunctiverelief against any prohibited act, including distribution of noncomplyingproducts (section 334). b. Background NECPA required DOE to establish mandatory energy efficiency standards foreach of 13 covered products.\2\<NOTE/> These standards were to be designed to achieve the maximumimprovement in energy efficiency that was technologically feasible andeconomically justified.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The consumer products covered by NECPA include: refrigeratorsand refrigerator-freezers; freezers; dishwashers; clothes dryers; waterheaters; room air conditioners; home heating equipment not including furnaces;television sets; kitchen ranges and ovens; clothes washers; humidifiersand dehumidifiers; central air conditioners; and furnaces.  NECPA provided, however, that no standard for a product be establishedif there were no test procedure for the product, or if DOE determined byrule either that a standard would not result in significant conservationof energy, or that a standard was not technologically feasible or economicallyjustified. In determining whether a standard was economically justified,the Department was directed to determine whether the benefits of the standardexceeded its burdens by weighing the seven factors discussed above. NECPA specified the priorities and procedures to be followed in adoptingefficiency standards. Nine of the 13 covered products were given priority.These nine products were: refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers; freezers;clothes dryers; water heaters; room air conditioners; home heating equipmentnot including furnaces; kitchen ranges and ovens; central air conditioners;and furnaces. The Department published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking for thenine priority products on January 2, 1979. 44 FR 20. On December 13, 1979,DOE published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking for dishwashers;television sets; clothes washers; and humidifiers and dehumidifiers. 44FR 72276. An advance notice for central air conditioners (heat pumps) waspublished on January 23, 1980. 45 FR 5602. After receiving comments on the January 2, 1979, advance notice, DOE published,on June 30, 1980, its first proposed rulemaking for the nine products.45 FR 43976. (Hereafter referred to as the June 1980 proposal.) This NOPRset forth DOE's proposal concerning energy efficiency standards for thecovered products. It also proposed comprehensive requirements for certificationand enforcement of the standards, procedures for processing petitions byStates that sought exemption for regulations subject to the general preemptionrequirements of NECPA, and small business exemptions. On April 2, 1982, DOE issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking withrespect to the nine priority products. 47 FR 14424. (Hereafter referredto as the April 1982 proposal). With respect to eight of the products,DOE proposed to make a determination that a standard would not result insignificant conservation of energy and would not be economically justified.\3\<NOTE/> The April 1982 proposal also proposed rules governing petitionsto DOE both by States to obtain exemption from preemption of State or localenergy efficiency standards, as well as by manufacturers to obtain preemptionof State or local standards.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The April 1982 proposal did not propose any rule withrespect to the product type ``home heating equipment, not including furnaces,''or with respect to that class of the product water heaters made up of heatpump water heaters, or with respect to those classes of the product centralair conditioners that are heat pumps. On December 22, 1982, DOE published a final rule in which the Departmentdetermined that efficiency standards were not warranted for clothes dryersand kitchen ranges and ovens. 47 FR 57198. (Hereafter referred to as theDecember 1982 final rule.) At that time, DOE also adopted final proceduresby which States might obtain exemption for State or local efficiency standardsfrom Federal preemption, and by which manufacturers might obtain preemptionof a State or local standard not otherwise preempted. On August 30, 1983, DOE published a final rule with respect to the remainingsix covered products: refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers, freezers,water heaters, furnaces, room air conditioners and central air conditioners.48 FR 39376. (Hereafter referred to as the August 1983 final rule.) Foreach of the six products covered by the August 1983 final rule, exceptcentral air conditioners, DOE determined that an energy efficiency standardwould not result in significant conservation of energy and would not beeconomically justified. With respect to central air conditioners, DOE foundthat an energy efficiency standard would result in significant conservationof energy, but would not be economically justified. On April 1, 1985, DOE published a proposed rule with respect to four coveredproducts: dishwashers, television sets, clothes washers and humidifiersand dehumidifiers. 50 FR 12966. (Hereafter referred to as the April 1985proposal). For each of the four products covered by the April 1985 proposal,DOE proposed that an energy efficiency standard would not be economicallyjustified and would not result in a significant conservation of energy.During 1983, DOE's December 1982 and August 1983 final rules were challengedin a lawsuit brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) andothers against the Department. On July 16, 1985, the U.S. Court of Appealsset aside DOE's December 1982 and August 1983 final rules. <T3>NRDC </T3>v. <T3>Herrington, </T3>768 F.2d 1355 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Consequently, on March 5, 1986, DOE published notices in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> removing the December 1982 and August 1983 finalrules and withdrawing the April 1985 proposal. 51 FR 7549 and 51 FR 7582.The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, which became law on March17, 1987, amended EPCA in part by: redefining ``covered products'' (specifically,refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers were combined into oneproduct type from two; humidifiers and dehumidifiers were deleted; andpool heaters were added); establishing Federal energy conservation standardsfor 11 of the 12 covered products; and creating a schedule, according towhich each standard is to be reviewed to determine if an amended standardis required. The National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988, which becamelaw on June 28, 1988, established Federal energy conservation standardsfor fluorescent lamp ballasts. These amendments also created a review schedulefor DOE to determine if an amended standard for fluorescent lamp ballastsis required. As directed by the Act, DOE published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking,with a 60-day comment period that ended July 18, 1988. 53 FR 17712, May18, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the advance notice). The advance noticepresented the product classes that DOE planned to analyze, and provideda detailed discussion of the analytical methodology and analytical modelsthat the Department expected to use in performing the analysis to supportthis rulemaking. The Department invited comments and data on the accuracyand feasibility of the planned methodology and encouraged interested personsto recommend improvements or alternatives to DOE's approach. The commentsin response to the advance notice are addressed in sections II and IIIof this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. General Discussion</ITAG>As stated above, NAECA requires DOE to determine if the legislated standardsfor dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers should be amended.The Act prohibits DOE from promulgating a standard for a product if: (1)There is no test procedure for the product (except in the case of clotheswashers, clothes dryers, dishwashers, and kitchen ranges and ovens), (2)a standard is not technologically feasible, (3) DOE determines that a standardwould not be economically justified, (4) if a standard would not resultin a significant conservation of energy or (5) if the Secretary has madea finding that such a standard will likely result in the unavailabilityof currently available performance characteristics. To measure possibleenergy savings and economic justification, DOE analyzed several possiblestandard levels for each product type. Furthermore, the Act stipulatesthat any adjustment of a standard may only be toward more stringent levels.With respect to each appliance, DOE analyzed various specific design options,including prototypes. A prototype can be either an individual component,e.g., an improved food filter, or a complete assembly with the design optioninstalled, e.g., heat pump clothes dryers. While a prototype design maybe technologically feasible as an individual component or as part of abread-board \4\<NOTE/> assembly, it does not necessarily follow that techniqueshave been developed for mass production of the prototype design.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ A bread-board unit is an experimental arrangement of thedesign made to test its feasibility.a. Test ProceduresFor each product discussed in today's proposed rulemaking there is an applicableDOE test procedure to evaluate its energy efficiency.b. Technological Feasibility1. <T3>General. </T3>For those products and classes of products discussedin today's notice, DOE believes that the efficiency levels analyzed, whilenot necessarily in production, are technologically possible. The technologicalfeasibility of the design options is addressed in the product specificdiscussion. DOE's criteria for evaluating design options for technologicalfeasibility are that the design options are already in use by the respectiveindustry or that research has progressed to the likely development of aprototype.One comment on the advance notice addressed the subject of technologicalfeasibility. Whirlpool Corporation (Whirlpool) contended that a designoption is not technologically feasible unless it is acceptable to the consumerand commercially workable. (Whirlpool, No. 1, at 17).\5\<NOTE/> DOE considers a design option to be technologically feasible,if, based on the Department's analysis, DOE believes it is capable of beingcarried out.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Comments on the advance notice have been assigned docketnumbers and have been numbered consecutively.2. <T3>Maximum Technologically Feasible Levels. </T3>The Act requires thatin considering any new or amended standards, the Department must considerthose that ``shall be designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energyefficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible andeconomically justified.'' (Section 325 (1)(2)(A)). Accordingly, for eachclass of product under consideration in this rulemaking, a maximum technologicallyfeasible design option was identified. This is the most efficient modelof a class for which at least a prototype exists. In comments on the advancenotice, Whirlpool and the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM)stated that any determination of maximum technological feasibility includeonly those options that are ``commercially workable.'' (AHAM, No. 5 at7; Whirlpool, No. 1, at 17). While the Department will consider the commercialworkability ``of a maximum technologically feasible'' design in the economicjustification analysis, such a consideration is not relevant in determiningthe maximum technologically feasible design, which is largely an engineeringdetermination. DOE considers a design option to be technologically feasible,if, based on the Department's analysis, DOE believes it is capable of beingcarried out.A complete discussion of each maximum technologically feasible level, andthe design options included in each, is found in the Engineering Analysis.<T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Chapter 3, specifically sections3.2.5, 3.3.5, and 3.4.5. These are presented in Table 2-1, below.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>2-1_<T4>Maximum Technologically Feasible Levels  </T4><H1>Products and product classes </H1><H1>Unit energy consumption</H1> Dishwashers: <ITAG tagnum="2">Compact, 115V <D>525 kWh/yr. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Standard, 115V <D>742 kWh/yr. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Standard water heating, 115V <D>704.5 kWh/yr. </D></ITAG>Clothes washers: <ITAG tagnum="2">Top loading, compact \1\ <D>576 kWh/yr. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Top loading, standard capacity \2\ <D>743 kWh/yr. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Top loading, large capacity \3\ <D>1,010 kWh/yr. </D></ITAG>Clothes dryers: <ITAG tagnum="2">Compact, electric, 110V \4\ <D>347 kWh/yr. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Compact, electric, 240V \4\ <D>384 kWh/yr. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Standard electric \5\ <D>859 kWh/yr. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Electric heat pump \5\ <D>336 kWh/yr.

DOE believes that there are no products available with the sameutility and capacity that are more efficient than the maximum technologicallevel. Each maximum technologically feasible level was evaluated to determineif it would be economically justified at the time of the effective dateof the standard. Standards that have unacceptable impacts on consumersor manufacturers or result in the changing of the utility of the productwere rejected. DOE provided lists of design options for the engineering analysis in theadvance notice. The comments on these design options resulted in more detaileddesign options for DOE review. DOE has considered these suggestions andhas addressed them in the product specific discussions in this notice.The analysis process is described fully in the Technical Support Document.Computer models and manufacturers' data were used to predict improvementsin product efficiencies and the costs associated with these improvements.The Engineering Analysis addresses two statutory requirements. The firstrequirement is the Department's evaluation of the maximum improvementsin energy efficiency that are technologically feasible. The second requirementrelates to the lessening of utility to the consumer of any of the coveredproducts due to the imposition of standards. The Engineering Analysis alsoprovides information on efficiencies and manufacturing costs to other sectionsof the overall analysis. The product specific sections of this notice includethe method of analysis for each product. c. Energy Savings1. <T3>Determination of Savings. </T3>The Department forecasts energy consumptionthrough the use of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential EnergyModel (LBL-REM). The LBL-REM forecasts energy consumption over the periodof analysis for candidate standards and the base case.\6\<NOTE/> The Department quantified the energy savings that would beattributable to a standard as the difference in energy consumption betweenthe candidate standard's case and the base case. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The base case for these three products represents NAECA's1988 standards, which are design standards only. The LBL-REM is an improvement of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ResidentialEnergy End Use Model (ORNL Model), which was used by DOE in previous standardsrulemakings. The LBL-REM is fully explained in the Technical Support Document.Appendix B to that document addresses the LBL-REM in detail. The LBL-REMcontains algorithms to project average efficiencies, usage behavior, andmarket shares for each product. The market share calculations contains the following steps: potential purchasersmay purchase any competing technology within an end-use, or none. For clotheswashers and dishwashers, the decision to purchase or not is modeled, andthe fraction of the total that chooses each class, e.g., standard 115V,standard water heating 115V, etc., is specified exogenously. For clothesdryers, the decision to purchase or not and the choice of fuel is modeled,and the fraction of the total that chooses each class is specified exogenously.Long-term market share elasticities have been assumed with respect to equipmentprice, operating expense, and income. The effects of standards are expectedto be lower operating expense and higher equipment price. The percentagechanges in these quantities are used, together with the elasticities, todetermine changes in market share resulting from standards. Higher equipmentprices will decrease market shares, while lower operating expenses willincrease market shares. The net result depends on the standard level selected,and associated equipment prices and operating expenses. The LBL-REM is used to project residential energy use over the relevanttime periods for these three products with and without amended standards.By comparing the energy consumption projection at alternative standardlevels, or NAECA's 1988 standards, the Department estimated the amountof energy projected to be saved during the period 1993-2015.\7\<NOTE/> The energy saved is expressed in Quads, i.e., quadrillionBtu's. With respect to electricity, the savings are quads of source orprimary energy, which is the energy necessary to generate and transmitelectricity. The Act defines ``energy use'' as the quantity of energy directlyconsumed by a consumer product at point of use. This is generally called``site'' energy, as opposed to ``source'' energy. There are major differencesbetween these types of energy. In 1987, the amount of electrical energyconsumed at the site was less than one-third of the amount of source energythat was required to generate and transmit the site electrical energy.\8\<NOTE/> Therefore, it is important to identify whether the electricityinvolved is site or source energy.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ LBL-REM was programmed to analyze a single standard levelor alternative levels, over the entire period. That is, the fact that astandard might be revised during subsequent rulemakings was not consideredby the model. The Department believes that it is not possible to predictwhat result such reviews may have, and therefore it would be speculativeto model any particular result. Therefore, for purposes of this rulemaking,each standard level that was analyzed was projected to have been in placefrom the time of implementation to the year 2015. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Energy Information Administration, <T3>Electric Power Annual 1987, </T3>Tables 25 and 82, DOE/EIA-0348(87),1987.   The LBL-REM projections are dependent on many assumptions. Among the mostimportant are responsiveness of household appliance purchases to changesin energy prices and consumer income, future energy prices, future levelsof housing construction, and options that exist for improving the energyefficiency of appliances. As is the case with any complicated computermodel simulation, the validity of the outputs is critically dependent onthe inputs. Comments that DOE received questioned several of the assumptions that weredescribed in the advance notice. These included the following: <ITAG tagnum="81">Rebound Effect </ITAG>In the analysis, the Department assumed that greater efficiency in thesethree product types would not cause them to be used more intensively becauseof the efficiency improvements. Therefore, in estimating energy savingsfrom different standard levels for dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothesdryers, the Department did not use a rebound effect. The Department hasno data indicating that changes in either energy prices or efficiency willcause consumers to use these products any differently. <ITAG tagnum="81">Discount Rate </ITAG>The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) questioned the Department'suse of consumer discount rates for calculating the cost of conserved energyand suggested, instead, that DOE use a discount rate that is based on ``realfinancial markets.'' (NRDC, No. 3, at 9). The Department agrees, and notesthat the discount rate that was used in this and earlier rulemakings (sevenpercent) is based on ``real financial markets.'' \9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ DOE in the calculation of life-cycle cost and net presentvalue, discounted the value of energy; the Department did not discountother measures, e.g., energy and emissions.  Since a dollar in the future is worth less than a dollar today, that futuredollar must be discounted to determine its value today. If the discountrate chosen is too high, the present value of future dollars will be understated.Thus, higher discount rates tend to preclude more capital-intensive candidatestandard levels. Nevertheless, the Department does not believe that theseven percent rate that was used in the analysis is artificially high.From the business perspective, a reasonable discount rate would be onethat represented the private opportunity cost of capital used to meet anyappliance conservation standard. A gauge of the private opportunity costof capital is the most profitable alternative use of that capital. Onemeasure of that cost could be the prime rate, that is, the interest ratethat is offered by lending institutions to their most credit-worthy customers.In early March 1989, the prime rate was 11.5 percent. If such a businesssecured a loan at one of those rates of interest, and repaid it in the1990-1995 time period, the real rate of interest would be 6.5 percent.This results because the expected annual rate of price increases in thattime period is approximately five percent. Most businesses, however, arenot eligible for loans at the prime rate of interest, so the estimatedreal rate of interest for these firms would probably be slightly higher.Similarly, from the consumer perspective, one approach to selecting anappropriate discount rate is to look at the interest payable on a consumerloan and depreciate that interest by the inflation rate. If a consumersecures a loan at 12 percent interest, and repays it in the 1990-1995 timeperiod, the real rate of interest will be seven percent. Thus, DOE believesthat from both the business and consumer perspectives, a seven percentdiscount rate is reasonable. On the other hand, it may not be reasonable to require consumers to makean investment where there are inherent risks. For example, if consumersperceive a risk because of the uncertainty of energy prices and reliabilityand longevity of the equipment, they would require a greater return ontheir investment, i.e., a higher discount rate. It has been argued thatthe discount rate should be as high as 15 percent. Dubin and McFadden,``An Econometric Analysis of Residential Electric Appliance Holdings andConsumption,'' <T3>Econometrica </T3>March 1984, pp. 345-361. DOE reuests comments onthe approach taken to select an appropriate discount rate, alternativeapproaches, and the consumer and business risks to be considered. Several of the inputs, e.g., energy and equipment prices, were tested insensitivity analyses to determine the effects of varying certain assumptionson the results of the analysis. By such sensitivity analyses, it is possibleto determine those inputs where changes, including possible errors, aremeaningful to the model's output, and those inputs for which changes arenot meaningful. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, andSection;andSection; 4.3 and 5.4.The savings attributable to the different standard levels are identifiedfor each product in section III of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="81">Modeling </ITAG>Several comments offered suggestions on the LBL-REM modeling efforts. NYSEOcritiqued the use of ``old data'' in LBL-REM in developing the baselineunits for analysis, and contended that use of such old data could underestimatethe impact that increased efficiency standards could have on saving energy.(NYSEO, No. 2 at 3). While historical data were used as a starting point for the analysis ofthese three product types, all of the data bases were updated to reflectcurrent prices and levels of efficiency in the marketplace. These datawere then used to calculate annual energy consumption for the LBL-REM andlife-cycle cost (LCC) analyses. For example, in the LCC analysis, DOE usedboth the cycles of operation and the more recent, 1986, Proctor and Gamble(Part 5) data to calculate the life-cycle cost. This calculation does notaccount for variability in consumer usage patterns, nor does it reflectany changes in typical consumer usage behavior since the test procedureswere developed. While the adoption of out-of-date usage values may affectthe results of the LBL-REM and LCC analysis, DOE is not certain to whatextent the results would be affected since, for example, the energy savingsand net present value calculation of the LBL-REM would use the dated usagevalues in both the base case and standards case. It is important to note out the difference between ``baseline unit'' and``base case.'' In the engineering analysis, the baseline unit for eachproduct class under consideration is identified. These are units that arerepresentative of units that are expected to be offered for sale in thebeginning year of the analysis.\10\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ The baseline units are those with estimated average shipment-weightedenergy factors (SWEF's) in 1987. The baseline clothes dryer efficienciesare estimated from very limited data, while the efficiencies for dishwashersand clothes dryers are estimated from more extensive data which was availablebecause these products are covered by the FTC labeling program.  Baseline refers only to the engineering analysis and is the first pointidentified in each cost-efficiency curve. It is the product to which designoptions are added to create more efficient units. On the other hand, ``basecase'' refers to the economic analysis forecast with only those standardsmandated by the Act. Two comments raised issues about the Department's modeling of utility impacts.First, NYSEO suggested that utility impacts be analyzed for smaller areasin order to capture better the differences among individual power pools.(NYSEO, No. 2, at 9). While the Department agrees with this point in principle,data limitations prevent the implementation of this suggestion. NYSEO also stated that inclusion of all planned generating facilities asavailable capacity is inappropriate. (NYSEO, No. 2, at 9-10). The Departmentnotes that the National Electricity Reliability Council (NERC) forecastassumed that certain power plants, e.g., Shoreham and Seabrook, will operate,even though these plants may be delayed, cancelled, or shut down. The Department'sestimate of capacity benefits is conservative, because cancelling theseplants would increase the reliability benefits of the appliance standards.On another point, NYSEO contended that the Department underestimates reliabilitybenefits when adequate reserve margins have been forecasted. (NYSEO, No.2, at 10). The Department believes that such benefits could be estimatedfor individual utilities, but is unable to do so for larger regions. NSPC also contended that use of a combustion turbine, which is typicallya peak-load generator, in estimating the capacity impact measures of baseloadappliances undervalues the cost of new generating capacity. (NSPC, Id.).While there are several alternative methods for valuing capacity impacts,the Department's utility analysis is one that has been adopted by manyutilities. For more detailed explanations of, and justification for, thevaluation of capacity impacts,<T3> see </T3>Technical Support Document, chapter 8 and Appendix D. 2. <T3>Significance of Savings. </T3>Under section 325(1)(3)(B) of the Act,the Department is prohibited from adopting a standard for a product ifthat standard would not result in significant energy savings. While theterm ``significant'' has never been defined precisely in the Act, the Departmentbelieves that a standard level option need not meet a threshold level ofenergy savings to be considered a significant saver of energy. The U.S.Court of Appeals, <T3>NRDC </T3>v. <T3>Herrington, supra, </T3>concluded that Congressional intent in usingthe word ``significant'' was to mean ``non-trivial.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 30. Thus, DOE believes that each candidate standard consideredresults in significant energy savings. d. Rebuttable Presumption NAECA established new criteria for determining whether a standard levelis economically justified. Section 325(1)(2)(B)(iii) states:<ITAG tagnum="21">If the Secretary finds that the additional cost to the consumer ofpurchasing a product complying with an energy conservation standard levelwill be less than three times the value of the energy savings during thefirst year that the consumer will receive as a result of the standard,as calculated under the applicable test procedure, there shall be a rebuttablepresumption that such standard level is economically justified. A determinationby the Secretary that such criterion is not met shall not be taken intoconsideration in the Secretary's determination of whether a stamdard iseconomically justified.</ITAG>DOE believes this provision means that if the added price of an appliance,caused by a conservation standard, would repay itself to the consumer inenergy savings in less than three years, then it can be presumed that suchstandard is economically justified.\11\<NOTE/> This presumption of economic justification can be rebuttedby the seven factors of economic justification. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ For this calculation, the Department calculated cost-of-operationbased on the DOE test procedures. Therefore, the consumer is assumed tobe an ``average'' consumer as defined by the DOE test procedures. Consumersthat use the products less than the test procedure assumes will experiencea longer payback while those that use them more than the test procedureassumes will have a shorter payback.  e. Economic Justification As noted earlier, section 325(1)(2)(B)(i) of the Act provides seven factorsto be evaluated in determining whether a conservation standard is economicallyjustified. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) proposed a methodologythat the Department could use in evaluating candidate standard amendments.(AHAM, No. 5, at 11-12). Except for its proposal that the maximum technologicallyfeasible design options be chosen only from those that are ``commerciallyworkable,'' the Department's planned methodology is consistent with theAHAM's proposal.NRDC suggested that the Department rank design options in ascending orderof cost of conserved energy. (NRDC, No. 3, at 9). The Department, withone exception, clothes dry automatic termination, has ranked the designoptions in ascending order of incremental payback period; this is equivalentto NRDC's suggestion.NRDC also suggested that any water savings that could result from amendedstandards be included in the cost-effectiveness, environmental, and economicimpact analyses. (NRDC, No. 3, at 8). The Department has included estimatesnot only of the potential water savings for amended standards, but alsoof the foregone water disposal expenses that such water savings would cause.1. <T3>Economic Impact on Manufacturers and Consumers. </T3>The engineeringanalysis identified improvements in efficiency along with the associatedcosts to manufacturers for each class of product. For each design option,these costs constitute the increased per unit cost to manufacturers toachieve the indicated energy efficiency levels. Manufacturer, wholesaler,and retailer markups will result in a consumer purchase price higher thanthe manufacturer cost.To assess the likely impacts of standards on manufacturers, the Departmentused a computer model that simulated hypothetical firms in the three industriesunder consideration. This model, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory ManufacturerImpact Model (LBL-MIM), is explained fully in the Technical Support Document.LBL-MIM provides a broad array of outputs, including shipments, price,revenue, net income, and return-on-equity (ROE). An ``Output Table'' listsvalues for all these outputs in the base case and in each of the standardscases under consideration. It also gives a range for each of these estimates.A ``Sensitivity Chart'' shows how ROE would be affected by a change inany one of the model's nine control variables.For consumers, a measure of economic impact is the life-cycle cost of aproduct, because it accounts for the increased first price, any increasedmaintenance expenses, and the reduced fuel expenses resulting from theproduct's greater efficiency. Under section 325 of the Act, life-cyclecost analysis is a separate factor to be considered in determining economicjustification.2. <T3>Life-Cycle Costs (LCC). </T3>One measure of the effect of proposedstandards on consumers is the change in operating expense as compared tothe change in purchase price, both resulting from standards. This is quantifiedby the difference in life-cycle cost (LCC) between the base and standardscase for the appliance classes analyzed. The LCC is the sum of the purchaseprice and the operating expense, including maintenance expenditures, discountedover the lifetime of the appliance.The LCC is calculated at the estimated average efficiency for each classin the year standards are imposed using consumer discount rates of five,seven, and 10 percent. The purchase price is based on the factory costsin the Engineering Analysis and includes a factory markup plus a distributorand retailer markup. Energy price forecasts are inputs that are taken fromthe 1987 Annual Energy Outlook of the Energy Information Administration.Appliance usage inputs are taken from the relevant test procedures andrecent P and G data. The Department seeks comments on the input to theLCC analysis, including the discount rate and energy price forecasts.The differences in life-cycle costs between the base case and various levelsof standards for dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers are presentedin Tables 6.1-6.3 of the Technical Support Document. These LCC's are calculatedat a seven percent discount rate; a higher rate, e.g., 10 percent, givesa smaller difference, while a lower rate, e.g., five percent, producesa greater difference. As discussed above, it has been argued that discountrates as high as 15 percent should be used. The Department did not use15 percent in the LCC analysis; however, as can be seen in the variousLCC curves, the use of a higher discount rate would result in a flattercurve with the minimum life-cycle cost dropping, i.e., approaching thebaseline unit. If a higher discount rate were used, e.g., 15 percent, andenergy prices were lower than average, the minimum life-cycle cost pointcould be less efficient than the baseline units.When the LCC numbers are plotted graphically (on the Y axis) against unitenergy consumption (on the X axis), the data generally produce a curvethat is concave from above in shape. This means that at first the LCC curvewill decline as efficiency improvements are made, will reach a minimum(which may or may not be discrete), and then rise. This indicates thatthe first efficiency improvements will produce energy savings, the valueof which will more than pay for the design change. As efficiency improvementsare made, it becomes increasingly costly to save more energy, and, eventually,the value of the energy savings will not cover the expenditures for thedesign improvements. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, section 3.5.The minimum of the LCC curve was of particular interest in the analysis.The minimum of the curve represents that level of efficiency improvementsthat maximizes the difference between the value of energy saved and theadditional consumer expenditures for the relevant efficiency improvements.Therefore, design options that corresponded to the minimum point were ofspecial consideration in establishing standard levels. Efficiency levelsexceeding the LCC minima were generally rejected as standards as not beingeconomically justified. At efficiency levels beyond the LCC minima, theincremental first cost of the product exceeds the value of the energy savingssuch that the average consumer does not realize an incremental benefitfrom the investment beyond the LCC minimum. The Department conducted a net present value (NPV) analysis to assess thedifferential economic impacts on consumers that would occur from the adoptionof amended standards for these three products compared to a base case withno change in the NAECA-imposed 1988 standards. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Chapter 5. The LBL-REM calculatesthe total expenditure for each product (discounted total value of energyconsumption from 1993 through the last year of use for those products purchasedthrough the year 2015), plus the total discounted expenses for equipmentpurchased from 1993 through 2015, with more stringent standards and withNAECA 1988 standards. The NPV analysis is similar to the LCC analysis,in that the greatest NPV should occur at the standard level that correspondsto the LCC minimum for the product.\12\<NOTE/> The NPV for each product at the different standard levelsis identified in section III of this notice. The NPV calculation, is basedon average efficiency from P and G and usage values.\13\<NOTE/> This analysis does not take into account variations in applianceusage rates, local energy prices and consumer energy efficiency choices.Instead, the model assumes that nationwide average appliance usage rates,energy prices and efficiency apply to all consumers in all areas of thenation. In other words, it assumes that consumers who face high energyprices or expect to make extensive use of their appliances, will, on average,purchase the same distribution of appliance efficiencies as consumers facinglow energy prices or low appliance usage rates. To the extent that individualconsumer decisions are influenced by local (rather than national average)energy prices or by their individual (rather than national average) usagerates, the model could yield inaccurate results.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ The net present value (NPV) of a standard, per appliance,is calculated for all affected appliances that are purchased in the projectionperiod, while the life-cycle cost (LCC) is calculated only for the lifetimeof an appliance that is purchased in the first year of the relevant standard.Therefore, NPV and LCC estimates, per appliance, may not correlate exactly.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ The NPV usage values are taken from recent Proctor andGamble data, while the LCC usage values were taken from both the DOE testprocedures and the Proctor and Gamble data. If, as DOE believes, consumers who face below-average energy prices aremore likely to purchase less-efficient appliances, then the analysis islikely to understate the energy savings resulting from standards for theseconsumers. Likewise, for those consumers who would purchase more-efficientappliances, the analysis would overstate the energy savings resulting fromstandards. If the consumers who live in low- and high-energy cost areaswould purchase less-efficient and more-efficient appliances, respectively,then valuing all energy savings at the national average energy price couldoverstate the value of energy savings to the former by more than it understatesthe value of energy savings to the latter. Thus, under these circumstances,the net effect of assuming a national average energy price would be tooverestimate the total value of energy saved. Similarly, if consumers who live in low- and high-energy usage areas wouldpurchase less-efficient and more-efficient appliances, respectively, thenusing the national average energy usage rate could overstate the energysavings to the former by more than it understates the energy savings tothe latter. Thus, under these circumstances, the net effect of assuminga national average energy usage rates could be to overestimate the totalamount of energy saved. In either case, to the extent that the model inaccurately predicts thevalue and/or quantity of energy savings, then it could lead to an inaccurateestimate of life-cycle cost savings and a standard that is different fromthe optimal standards. DOE does not have the data to determine if, or towhat extent, the NPV calculations are affected by using average energyprices, usage rates and efficiency. DOE requests comments on this issue.Specifically, DOE requests data on the effects of energy prices and usagerates on consumer energy efficiency choice. Such data could include manufacturerwarranty and/or registration data that includes appliance efficiency andpurchase location. Similarly, DOE also requests data on the effect of energyefficiency on usage rates. DOE also solicits comments on the likely improvementsto the analysis that would result from the incorporation of such data and,in the absence of relevant data, alternative analytic approaches to capturethe effect of these variations. 3. <T3>Energy Savings. </T3>While the significant conservation of energy isa separate statutory requirement for imposing an energy conservation standard,the Act requires DOE, in determining the economic justification of a standard,to consider the total projected savings that are expected to result directlyfrom revised standards. DOE used the LBL-REM results, discussed earlier,in its consideration of total projected savings. The savings for the threeproducts are provided in section III of this notice.4. <T3>Lessening of Utility or Performance of Products. </T3>This factor cannnotbe quantified. Whirlpool and AHAM both urged that the Department not establishany amended standards that could lessen the utility of the affected productto the consumer. (Whirlpool, No. 1, at 16; AHAM, No. 5, at 8). The Departmentbelieves that it has met this concern by a careful selection of productclasses, as discussed below. In establishing classes of products and design options, the Departmenttried to eliminate any degradation of utility or performance in the threeproducts under consideration in this rulemaking. That is, to the extentthat comments or DOE's own research indicated that a product included autility or performance-related feature that affected energy efficiency,a separate class with a different efficiency standard was created for thatproduct. In this way the Department attempted to minimize the impact ofthis factor as a result of the standards that were analyzed. 5. <T3>Impact of Lessening of Competition. </T3>It is important to note thatthis factor has two parts; on the one hand, it assumes that there couldbe some lessening of competition as a result of standards; and, on theother hand, it directs the Attorney General to gauge the impact, if any,of that effect. In order to assist the Attorney General in making such a determination,the Department studied the affected appliance industries to determine theirexisting concentrations, levels of competitiveness, and financial performances.This information will be sent to the Attorney General. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Chapter 7. The Department hasalso provided the Attorney General with copies of this notice and the TechnicalSupport Document for his review. 6. <T3>Need of the Nation to Conserve Energy. </T3>One measure of the needof the Nation to conserve energy is the country's reliance on energy inthe form of oil, especially imported oil. This was documented in 1987 ina DOE report (<T3>Energy Security: A Report to The President of The United States, </T3>Washington,D.C.: U.S. Department of Energy, March 1987). In that report, U.S. energysecurity essentially was considered to be a function of free oil markets.The three products being considered in this rulemaking (dishwashers, clotheswashers, and clothes dryers) are all fueled by energy forms other thanoil, specifically electricity for all three and natural gas for some clothesdryers. While some oil is used to generate the electricity on which theseproducts operate, that is a very small part of our national energy picture.Specifically, only 4.6 percent of net electricity was generated by petroleumin 1987. DOE requests comments on this issue. 7. <T3>Other Factors. </T3>This provision allows the Secretary of Energy,in determining whether a standard is economically justified, to considerany other factors that he deems to be relevant. To date, the Departmenthas not identified any such factors with regard to these three products.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Product-Specific Discussion </ITAG>a. Dishwashers <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Classes </ITAG>In the advance notice, the Department discussed its methodology for reviewingthe energy conservation standards for dishwashers that were establishedby the Act, to determine if the standards should be amended. NAECA currentlyprescribes a design standard for dishwashers; units manufactured afterJanuary 1, 1988, are required to have an option to dry without heat. The following are the classes of dishwashers that have been identified:(A) Compact Dishwasher (115V) (B) Standard Dishwasher (115V) (C) Water Heating Dishwasher, Compact (115V) (D) Water Heating Dishwasher, Standard (115V) (E) Water Heating Dishwasher, Compact (230V) (F) Water Heating Dishwasher, Standard (230V) <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Design Options </ITAG>The following is a list of design options that were examined: (A) Improved Food Filters (B) Improved Fill Control (C) Improved Motor Efficiency <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Comments on the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking </ITAG>Whirlpool commented that after reviewing all of the design options fordishwashers included in the advance notice, it found that not one couldbe utilized to improve the energy efficiency of those machines. Whirlpoolclaimed that many of the possible configurations of design options identifiedby DOE have already been developed and have achieved the maximum energyefficiency possible; in other cases, the design improvements are so costlythat the extra expense would outweigh any conservation benefits. (Whirlpool,No. 1, at 3-7). After reviewing the potential energy conservation improvements of the designoptions for dishwashers, the Department has found that several, i.e., improvedfood filters, motors, and water fill controls, do exhibit the potentialto save energy above what Whirlpool claims is possible. NRDC stated that DOE should consider the ``broadest possible range of measures.''For dishwashers, NRDC suggested the Ecotech I prototype; heat pumps forwater heating dishwashers; and the range of designs currently available.(NRDC, No. 3, at 4-6). The Department analyzed the Ecotech I, and performedliterature reviews on new designs. In addition, data were sought from manufacturerson current and proposed designs. Heat pump dishwashers have not been analyzedbecause the Department could not determine if design is technologicallyfeasible since no data have been presented and no prototypes exist. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Efficiency Levels Analyzed</ITAG>DOE examined a range of standard levels, including the 1988 NAECA standard.As discussed above, the impacts of any revised standards were comparedto the 1988 NAECA standard; therefore, the impacts of the base case aregenerally not presented because they are calculated to be zero. Table 3-1 presents the efficiency levels, other than the base case, selectedfor analysis for 1993. Alternate levels were selected to generate a rangeof impacts for analysis. Initially, the levels were selected for the classof standard dishwasher (115 volt). Level 3 corresponds to the highest efficiencylevel identified in the engineering analysis. Levels 2 and 1 correspondto lower efficiencies than that of level 3. Each level was analyzed discretelyin the engineering analysis. Standard levels for the other class of dishwasherswere based on the combination of design options for the standard dishwasher(115 volt). The Department did not analyze compact and standard-sized water heatingdishwashers (115 volt) separately. Nevertheless, the impacts for thoseclasses are expected to be similar since the design options that wouldbe adopted would be the same. Because of the small amount of empirical data on compact water-heatingdishwashers (115V and 230V) and on standard water-heating dishwashers (230V),the Department was unable to analyze these classes. As a result, the Departmentis not proposing any amended standard for them. Nevertheless, the standardsthat require dishwashers of all classes to have an option today withoutheat will remain in effect for these three classes. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,b2,i1,s10,4,4,4 </C><T4>Table </T4> 3-1_<T4>Alternative Efficiency Levels for </T4>1993 <T4>for Dishwashers</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Energy Factor=Loads/kWh/Yr.] </ITAG><H1>Product class </H1><H1>Level analyzed</H1><H2>1 </H2><H2>2 </H2><H2>3</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Compact dishwashers (115V) <D>0.58 </D><D>0.60 </D><D>0.61 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Standard dishwasher (115V) <D>.41 </D><D>.42 </D><D>.43 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Standard water heating dishwasher (115V) <D>.44 </D><D>.45 </D><D>.46</D></ITAG></ITAG>  <T3>Payback Period </T3>Table 3-2 presents the payback period for the efficiencylevels analyzed for the most prevalent class of product (standard waterheating dishwasher (115 volt)).

All three standard levels meet the rebuttable presumption testin that the payback is less than three years. Standard level 3 is alsothe maximum technologically feasible design option identified in the analysis.<T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 6.6.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp9,p7,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s20,8</C><T4>Table </T4>3-2_<T4>Payback Periods (years) Standard Water Heating Dishwasher (115 volts)</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Payback period</H1>Standard level: <ITAG tagnum="3">1 </ITAG><D>0.9 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">2 </ITAG><D>1.3 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">3 </ITAG><D>2.1</D></ITAG><T3>Significance of Energy Savings. </T3>By the year 2000, the weightedaverage energy consumption of new dishwashers sold in the absence of revisedstandards is not projected to change compared to the year 1993. The weightedaverage energy consumption is projected to decline between the year 2000and 2015. Overall, the average energy consumption is projected to decreaseslightly from 1993 to 2015. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 5.2. This is because residentialelectricity rates are projected to decline from 1984 to 1995, then increase,reaching 1985 levels by 2015 (in real terms). <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 4.5 and DOE/EIA-0383(87)Annual Energy Outlook 1987, Table A.3. Without upward pressure on operatingexpenses, the LBL-REM projects that there will be no major energy consumptionimprovements. The LBL-REM projects, for the period 1993-2015, the followingenergy savings would result from the increased standards:<ITAG tagnum="15">Level 1_0.39 Quads</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Level 2_0.52 Quads</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Level 3_0.65 Quads</ITAG><T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 5.3On the basis of the above, DOE believes that the increased standard levelsconsidered for dishwashers would result in a significant conservation ofenergy. However, DOE believes that the LBL-REM base case projections ofno improvement in the efficiency of dishwashers compared to the year 2000is unlikely. Between 1972 and 1983, the average efficiency of dishwashersincreased nearly 55 percent. During this time, the nation experienced bothdeclining and increasing real energy prices. DOE believes there is no reasonto conclude that the average efficiency of dishwashers will not increase.Changes in shipment weighted energy factor (SWEF) can be brought aboutby a number of factors including heightened consumer awareness. DOE requestscomments on this issue particularly the LBL-REM's forecast of dishwasherefficiency.<T3>Economic Justification</T3>_ A. <T3>Economic Impact on Manufacturers and Consumers. </T3>The per unit increasedcost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency (improved food filter)is $7.50, while the addition of improved motor efficiency in standard level2 costs an additional $4.00. Standard level 3 provides efficiencies obtainedwith an improved fill control, which adds another $8.00. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Tables 3.3 and 3.4.For consumers, standard level 1 would cause a price increase of $10.75for a standard dishwasher; standard level 2 would add an additional $6.21,while level 3 would be $12.57 more. The price increases caused by standardlevels for water-heating dishwashers are the same. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Tables 3.18 and 3.19.The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Manufacturers Impact Model (LBL-MIM),in the base case, projects manufacturers' long-run return-on-equity (ROE)to be 6.80 percent for dishwashers. At level l, the LBL-MIM predicts thata prototypical dishwasher manufacturer would have an ROE of 6.64 percent,a loss of 2.4 percent. At level 2, the manufacturer's ROE is expected tobe 6.72 percent, a 1.2 percent decline. At level 3, however, the LBL-MIMprojects that the prototypical dishwasher mamufacturer's ROE would be 6.97percent, an increase of 2.5 percent over the base case. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 7.9.This industry has displayed continuing consolidation for several decades,especially during periods of low earnings. By increasing profitability,as DOE projects at standard level 3, standards could lead to a reductionin the rate of such consolidations, thereby possibly contributing to morerobust competitiveness than is likely in the base case.The Department's characterization of the prototypical manufacturer in thebase case assumes that manufacturers' typical dishwasher designs are basedon the combination of options presented in the Engineering Analysis forthe baseline unit. If manufacturers use a different combination of designoptions to produce dishwashers that minimally comply with the 1993 standard,the Department may have inappropriately characterized the financial positionof the prototypical manufacturer in the LBL-MIM. Furthermore, since financialdata of the type needed to characterize the prototypical manufacturer aregenerally not available, DOE had to make a number of assumptions basedon the limited data publicly available, e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission10K reports and company annual reports. Because of the significant impactthat these assumptions could have on the results of the analysis, DOE requestscomments on these issues, particularly from small manufacturers. The sensitivity analysis, however, indicates that the dishwasher industryis sensitive to price and operating expense elasticities. For example,the high price and low operating cost scenario indicates that the effectsof standards would be to decrease return-on-equity for dishwasher manufacturersby 2.5 percent. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 7.13. While these scenariosare theoretically possible, the Department expects that the original analysiswill be the likely outcome.B. <T3>Life Cycle Cost and Net Present Value. </T3>The LCC analysis indicatesthat for each possible standard level the increase in purchase price wouldbe offset by savings in operating expenses. Standard level 3 correspondsto the minima of the life-cycle cost curves. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Figures 3.17 and 3.18. This indicatesthat the standard level would not cause any economic burden on the averageconsumer. For consumers, standard level 1 would cause a reduction in life-cyclecost of $98.56 for a standard dishwasher; standard level 2 would reducelife-cycle cost an additional $5.45, while level 3 would result in a furtherdecrease of $.96 compared to level 2. For standard water heating dishwashersstandard level 1 would cause a reduction in life-cycle cost of $92.09;standard level 2 would reduce life-cycle cost an additional $5.45, whilelevel 3 would result in an increase of $.02 compared to level 2. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 6.3.While DOE examined the effect of different discount rates, five, seven,and 10 percent, on the LCC curves and generally found little impact, theDepartment did not consider higher discount rates. Similarly, DOE did notconsider differemt energy prices, including regional prices, in the LCCanalysis. However, DOE did examine the effect of a usage rate that wasdifferent from the 322 cycles per year set by the DOE test procedure. RecentProcter and Gamble data appear to indicate that national average dishwasherannual usage rate is 260 cycles per year, nearly 20 percent less than thetest procedure representative average use cycle. The lower usage numberstend to result in lower life-cycle cost estimates, with the purchase pricecarrying greater weight in the calculations. For standard dishwashers,at the lower usage rate, standard level 2 becomes the minimum life-cyclecost point. Standard level 1 would cause a reduction of $89.23 for a standarddishwasher; standard level 2 would reduce life-cycle cost an additional$3.21, while level 3 would result in an increase of $1.42 compared to level2. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 6.3. As can be seen, notonly does the minimum life-cycle cost point change but the overall reductionin life-cycle costs would be reduced by approximately 10 percent. The Departmentrequests comments on the effects of usage rates.Another way to compare the costs and benefits that would be associatedwith any standard level is to estimate the net impact on life-cycle cost.Such a comparison for each standard level is shown below. The incrementalconsumer price for each standard level for all equipment purchased in thefirst year after the standard goes into effect; the total operating expensesavings calculated at a 5, 7 and 10 percent discount rates; and the netdifference in discounted savings and incremental prices paid are presented.The results show that, for each standard level, there is a positive netreduction in life-cycle cost; which indicates that, using national averagevalues, the benefits of each candidate standard level exceed the increasein price paid for the appliance by the affected consumers. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,b2,tp8,p6,6/7,i1,s10,6,6,6,6,6</C><T4>Dishwasher Net Present Values</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[In millions of dollars, 1987] </ITAG><H1>Standard level </H1><H1>Price increase </H1><H1>Operating expense savings </H1><H2>5% </H2><H2>7% </H2><H2>10% </H2><H1>LCC differences</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1 <D>29.78 </D><D>268.61 </D><D>240.42 </D><D>205.90 </D><D>210.64</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2 <D>51.05 </D><D>304.65 </D><D>272.67 </D><D>233.51 </D><D>221.62</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3 <D>95.27 </D><D>346.47 </D><D>310.13 </D><D>265.57 </D><D>214.86</D></ITAG></ITAG>The LBL-REM employs national average energy prices and usage rates. Theappropriateness of this approach depends on the relationship between energyprices and consumer choice of efficiency levels and the relationship betweenconsumers' expected usage and choice of energy efficiency level. If thoseconsumers who face higher energy prices and/or expect to use their dishwashersmore intensively, are on average, more likely to buy higher efficiencydishwashers, then a modeling approach that assumes that national averageenergy prices and usage rates apply to all consumers will yield resultsthat overstate the net benefits that could be expected. As discussed above,recent Procter and Gamble data have shown declines in usage rates for dishwashers.The Department requests comments and data on the effects of energy pricesand expected usage rates on the consumer's choice of efficiency level.The NPV analysis indicates that if a standard were adopted at level 1,there would be a net present value of $710 million from energy savingsover the period 1993-2015. At levels 2 and 3, the corresponding NPV's wouldbe $811 million and $609 million, respectively. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 5.6.C.<T3> Energy Savings. </T3>As discussed above, DOE proposes that standards,at each candidate standard level, would result in a significant savingof energy. The Department conducted several sensitivity cases, one of whichwas to assume that after 1993, the market would produce dishwashers ofan efficiency that increases more than the standards would otherwise require.The base case projects that there will be only slight increases in theSWEF of dishwashers after 1993, i.e., that the private sector will notcontinue to improve the efficiency of those appliances much beyond themandated levels. The sensitivity case assumes that after the 1993 standardsare in place, the base case efficiency growth will increase from 0.5 percentannually to 2.0 percent. The Department believes that the maximum improvementin market-induced dishwasher energy efficiency after 1993 would be thehistorical improvement rate, 3.1 percent annually. The Department doesnot have any reason to assume that energy efficiency would improve at agreater than historical rate.The Department believes that the range of market-induced efficiencies thatwould occur after 1993 in the absence of additional Federal standards wouldbe from a low of no improvement to a high of an historical average growthrate. If SWEF increases, the energy savings due to standards would be lessthan calculated.D. <T3>Lessening of Utility or Performance of Products.</T3> As indicatedabove, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that thestandards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performanceof dishwashers. However, there is no assurance that future utility or performanceof dishwashers would not be lessened as a result of standards-induced disincentivesto investments in energy-using new features.In addition, the Department believes adoption of any of the design optionsconsidered will not affect utility or performance.E. <T3>Impact of Lessening Competition. </T3>The determination of this factormust be made by the Attorney General.<T3>F. Need to Save Energy. </T3>Dishwashers use electricity as a primaryenergy source, both for operation of the motors and for the electric coilsthat are used in the drying cycle. In addition, that portion of water heaterelectricity consumption that provides hot water to the dishwasher is consideredto be indirect dishwasher electricity consumption. Similarly, since someof the hot water that is supplied to dishwashers comes from gas water heaters,dishwashers are responsible for indirect gas consumption, too.In 1987, source electricity generation in the United States totaled 27.6quadrillion Btu's, and gas consumption totaled 17.18 quadrillion Btu's.Dishwashers accounted for .8 percent (or .22 Quads) of the electricitygeneration and .4 percent (or .069 Quads) of the gas consumption: oversix percent of that dishwasher energy consumption would be saved by standardlevel 1, and over eight percent of that consumption would be saved at level2. Furthermore, standard level 3 would save over 10 percent of the 1987dishwasher energy consumption. The sensitivity analysis on the LBL-REMindicates that if market improvements and consumer awareness of applianceefficiencies continue at their historical rates, then the projected savingsat level 3 would be .17 Quads as compared to .65 Quads. <T3>Conclusion.</T3> After careful consideration of the analysis, the Departmentis proposing a revision of the dishwasher standard to standard level 1.The Department proposes that standard level 1 for dishwashers saves a significantamount of energy, and is economically justified. As discussed above, DOE's analysis indicates that there would be a significantenergy savings at each candidate standard level. For standard level 1,during the period 1993-2015, this savings would be .39 Quad of primaryelectricity compared to the base case. This represents five percent ofthe expected dishwasher energy consumption over that period. Although standard level 1 would cause an increase in the initial priceto the consumer of $10.75, the standard is estimated to reduce the typicalconsumer's life-cycle cost by $99. In addition, with a payback of 0.9 years,the candidate standard level satisfies the rebuttable presumption test,i.e., it has a value of energy savings that repaid the initial purchaseprice increase to the average consumer in less than three years. The technologies that may be necessary to meet the standard are availablenow in the form of improved food filters used by some manufacturers. Formanufacturers, the standard is expected to result in long-run returns onequity of 6.64 percent. The results of the analysis discussed above, could change if a differentdiscount rate were used, energy prices drop, or if the uses of nationalaverage energy prices and national appliance usage rates have introducedan uncertainty into the analysis. Standard levels 2 and 3 were both found to save a significant amount ofenergy but the Department proposes that neither is economically justified.Standard levels 2 and 3 result in marginal benefits compared to standardlevel 1. The life-cycle cost savings compared to standard level 1 are calculatedto be $5.45 and $6.41 respectively. While the energy savings are projectedto be 0.52 and 0.65 Quads. The payback period for standard levels 2 and3 are less than 3 years; however, the bulk of the consumer benefits aredue to standard level 1 benefits. Furthermore, if energy prices were todrop from the projected or usage rates were lower than assumed, standardlevel 1 could become the minimum life-cycle cost point. If this were tooccur, DOE is concerned that consumers would be precluded from purchasingthe most cost-effective unit. Level 3 standards, the maximum technologically feasible level, involvestechnologies that the Department believes are generally available, i.e.,improved food filter, improved motor and improved fill control. However,the Department finds that the price of the improved fill control, $12.57,results in a $13.53 reduction in lifetime operating cost which yields thelife-cycle operating cost savings of $.96, or less than $.10 per year overthe average dishwasher lifetime. While the benefits of standards, on alife-cycle cost basis, are calculated to exceed the cost to consumers,the Department believes the risks of standards at this level exceed thepossible benefits. As can be seen in Figure 3.15 of the Technical SupportDocument, the life-cycle cost curve for standard dishwashers is relativelyflat between standard levels 1 and 3; DOE believes that the differencesin the life-cycle costs between points 1, 2, and 3 are probably less significantthan the possible inaccuracy of the analysis. For example, if usage islower than that assumed, or if energy prices are lower than those usedin the analysis, incremental increases in price to meet standard level3, as compared to standard level 2, would likely not be met by the valueof the energy saved. Furthermore, the analysis predicts energy savingsof .65 Quads, or .13 Quads over standard level 2. The Department believesthat the marginal energy saving benefits of level 3, as compared to theuncertain nature of the analysis as discussed, particularly with respectto the LBL-REM's forecast of relatively small improvements in SWEF overthe period of analysis and the questions surrounding dishwasher usage andappropriate discount rates do not justify standards at this level. Therefore,the Department concludes for the reasons discussed above, that reviseddishwasher standards at standard level 3 are not economically justified.Level 2 standards involve technologies that the Department believes arewidely available, i.e., improved food filter and improved motor. However,the Department finds that the price of the improved motor, $6.21, resultsin a $11.66 reduction in lifetime operating cost or a life-cycle cost savingsof $5.45; approximately $.50 per year over the average dishwasher lifetime.As discussed above, the Department does not believe that these marginalsavings justify standards at this level, because of the associated risksat this level. Therefore, the Department concludes that revised dishwasherstandards at standard level 2 are not economically justified. In weighing the costs and benefits of standards, the Department gave considerableweight to the impacts on consumers as measured in the life-cycle cost analysis.The major impact of standards on life-cycle cost occurs at standard level1. Because of the uncertainty of the analysis, i.e., energy price forecastsand usage rates, consumers may not receive the marginal benefits in life-cyclecosts projected at levels 2 and 3. Furthermore, DOE believes that standardlevels 2 and 3 could be beyond the minimum life-cycle cost point, precludingconsumers from purchasing the most cost-effective unit. Therefore, DOEis proposing standard level 1. The Department request comments on the above,including DOE's weighing of the factors. b. Clothes Washers <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Classes </ITAG>In the advance notice, the Department discussed its methodology for reviewingthe energy conservation standards for clothes washers that were establishedby the Act, to determine if the standards should be amended. NAECA prescribeda design standard for clothes washers; units manufactured after Januaryl, 1988, are required to have an option for a cold water rinse. The following are the classes of clothes washers that have been identified:<ITAG tagnum="15">Top Loading, Compact (1.6 ft.\3\ capacity or less) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Top Loading, Standard (1.61 to 2.74 ft.\3\ capacity) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Top Loading, Large (2.75 ft.\3\ capacity or greater) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Top Loading, Semi-Automatic </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Front Loading </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Suds Savers</ITAG>A review of the characteristics and data regarding fully automatic toploading washers indicates that class distinction by capacity may be appropriate.Compact washers offer the utility of small cabinet size allowing them tobe placed in size-restricted spaces. Larger washers offer the utility oftime savings for users that have large laundry loads. However, the energyuse characteristics of existing machines indicates that energy use is nota linear function of capacity as might be expected. This seems to precludehaving one standard for all capacities. From the data collected to date,the Department is unable to discern exactly why energy usage varies disproportionatelywith capacity, but suspects that different mixes of temperature controlfunctions may play a major role. If this is the case, temperature controlfunction may be a better criteria than capacity by which to distinguishclasses. The Department seeks comments on this subject. Furthermore, since the last three of these classes collectively representless than 5 percent of total industry shipments, the Department did notanalyze them and is therefore not proposing amended standards for theseclasses; however, the existing standard requiring a cold water rinse optionis proposed to remain in effect. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Design Options </ITAG>The following is a list of design options that were examined:<ITAG tagnum="25">Warm Rinse Elimination </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Improved Fill Control </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Reduced Thermal Mass </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Increased Motor Efficiency </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Thermostatically Controlled Mixing Valves Employed </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">3. Comments on the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking </ITAG>For clothes washers, NRDC suggested that the Department consider: (a) Reducedwash cycle temperatures; (b) insulation of the drum, (c) a combinationof (a) and (b); and (d) the wide range of currently available designs forenergy efficiency in clothes washers. (NRDC, No. 3, at 6). In its analysis,the Department did consider each of these energy conserving options. Reducedwash cycle temperatures were dismissed since studies have shown that suchlowered water temperatures affect performance. Otherwise the Departmentdid examine all energy-concerning designs in clothes washers that couldbe found through literature searches, discussions with industry personneland researchers, both domestically and abroad. NRDC suggested that the ``suds savings'' feature of certain clothes washersbe considered a conservation measure, rather than a separate class. (NRDC,No. 3, at 3). The Department believes that ``suds savings'' provides a unique utilityto the consumer, both as a feature in itself, and as a water and detergentsaver. Furthermore, because of the fact that ``suds savings'' requiresa nearby sink or other storage device, its applicability as a conservationmeasure could not be universally employed. Therefore, the Department hasconcluded that ``suds savings'' clothes washers should be a separate class.The Speed Queen Company (Speed Queen) suggested that the large capacityclothes washer not be considered as a separate class, but rather it shouldremain in the class as standard machines so as to reflect their higheractual energy usage. (Speed Queen, No. 4, at 1-2). The Department agreeswith Speed Queen that large capacity washers use more energy. The Department,however, is proposing to retain large capacity washers as a separate classbecause of their utility as discussed above. If large washers were to begrouped together with standard size washers and required to meet a singlestandard, the large washers would likely have more difficulty in meetingthat standard because energy use is a function of volume. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Efficiency Levels Analyzed </ITAG>Table 3-3 presents the efficiency levels that have been selected for analysisfor 1993. These efficiency estimates are for a standard capacity, top-loadingclothes washer. Alternate levels were selected to generate a range of impactsfor analysis. As noted earlier, standard level 1 corresponds to efficienciesachieved by elimination of a warm water rinse; level 2 corresponds to efficienciesachieved by thermostatic mixing valves; level 3 adds a more efficient motor;and, level 4 substitutes a plastic tub. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,b2,i1,s10,6,4,4,4,4</C><T4>Table </T4>3-3._<T4>Standard Levels Analyzed for Top-Loading Clothes Washers  </T4><H1>Size</H1><H1>Baseline</H1><H1>Energy Factor (cu. ft./kWh)</H1><H2>1</H2><H2>2 </H2><H2>3 </H2><H2>4</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Compact \1\ <D>0.76 </D><D>0.96 </D><D>1.02 </D><D>1.04 </D><D>1.05 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Standard \2\ <D>.98 </D><D>1.23 </D><D>1.32 </D><D>1.34 </D><D>1.35 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Large \3\ <D>.90 </D><D>1.13 </D><D>1.21 </D><D>1.23 </D><D>1.24 </D><F>\1\ Capacity less than 1.6 ft.\3\ </F><F>\2\ Capacity 1.6 ft.\3\ to 2.75 ft.\3\ </F><F>\3\ Capacity greater than 2.75 ft.\3\</F></ITAG></ITAG>  <T3>Payback Period. </T3>Table 3-4 presents the payback period for theefficiency levels analyzed. Standard level 1 involves efficiencies achievablewith eliminating warm water rinse altogether, level 2 involves additionalefficiencies achievable with thermostatic mixing values, level 3 adds animproved motor, and level 4 replaces the metal tub with a plastic one.For standard capacity, top-loading clothes washers, each standard levelsatisfies the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the additional cost ofpurchasing a product at each efficiency level will be less than three timesthe value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive during thefirst year. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document Table 6.5. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp9,p7,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s20,7.1</C><T3>Table </T3>3-4._<T4>Payback Periods of Design Options (Years) for Standard Size, Top-LoadingClothes Washers </T4><H1> </H1><H1/><T3>Payback Period</T3>Standard Level: <ITAG tagnum="3">1 </ITAG><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">2 </ITAG><D>0.9</D><ITAG tagnum="3">3 </ITAG><D>1.2</D><ITAG tagnum="3">4 </ITAG><D>1.6</D></ITAG><T3>Significance of Energy Savings. </T3>By the year 2015, the weightedaverage energy consumption of new clothes washers sold in the absence ofamended standards is projected to be 923 kilowatt hours per year (kWh/yr)a decline from 1152 kWh/yr in 1987. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 5.9. At standard levels1 through 4, the average consumption is expected to be 895, 867, 860, and858 kWh/yr, respectively. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 5.10. The LBL-REM projects,for the period 1993-2015, the following energy savings would result fromthe increased standards:<ITAG tagnum="15">Level 1_0.70 Quad </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Level 2_1.21 Quads </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Level 3_1.38 Quads </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Level 4_1.50 Quads</ITAG><T3>Economic Justification._</T3>A. <T3>Economic Impact on Manufacturers and Consumers. </T3>The per unit increasedcost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency is $0; to meet levels2-4, the manufacturers' cost increases, as compared to the base case, are$13, $17, and $23, respectively, for a standard, top-loading clothes washer.<T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 3.8.At those levels of efficiency, the incremental consumer price increasesare $0, $19, $25.30, and $33.80 for standard levels 1-4, respectively.<T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 3.16. The LBL-MIM results for clothes washers show that standard level 1 wouldcause manufacturers to have a decline in ROE from 6.64 percent in the basecase to 6.45 percent (a decline of 2.9 percent). Standard levels 2-4, however,are projected to improve manufacturers' ROE's by 3.5 percent, 6.3 percent,and 8.4 percent, respectively. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 7.17. This industry hasdisplayed continuing consolidation for several decades, especially duringperiods of low earnings. By increasing profitability, as DOE projects atstandards levels 2, 3, and 4, standards could lead to a reduction in therate of such consolidations, thereby possibly contributing to more robustcompetitiveness than is likely in the base case. The Department's characterization of the prototypical manufacturer in thebase case assumes that manufacturers' typical clothes washer designs arebased on the combination of options presented in the Engineering Analysisfor the baseline unit. If manufacturers use a different combination ofdesign options to produce clothes washers that minimally comply with the1993 standard, the Department may have inappropriately characterized thefinancial position of the prototypical manufacturer in the LBL-MIM. Furthermore,since financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypicalmanufacturer are generally not available, DOE had to make a number of assumptionsbased on the limited data publicly  available, e.g., Securities and ExchangeCommission 1OK reports and company annual reports. Because of the significantimpact that these assumptions could have on the results of the analysis,DOE requests comments on these issues, particularly from small manufacturers.B. <T3>Life Cycle Cost and Net Present Value. </T3>The LCC analysis indicatesthat at each possible standard level the increase in purchase price wouldbe offset by savings in operating expenses. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Tables 3.16 and 3.17. Also, ofthe four candidate standard levels, level 3 had the lowest consumer life-cyclecost. This indicates that the standard level would not cause any economicburden on the average consumer because of the decreasing life-cycle costs.Standard level 1 would cause a reduction in life-cycle cost of $147 fora top loading standard-sized clothes washer; standard level 2 would reducelife-cycle cost an additional $19, standard level 3, the minimum life-cyclecost point, an additional $4, while standard level 4 would result in anincrease of $7 compared to standard level 3. While DOE examined the effectof different discount rates, 5, 7, and 10 percent, on the LCC curves andgenerally found little impact, the Department did not consider higher discountrates. Similarly, DOE did not consider different energy prices, includingregional prices, in the LCC analysis. However, DOE did examine the effectof a usage rate different from the 416 cycles per year set by the DOE testprocedure. Recent Procter and Gamble data appear to indicate that the nationalaverage clothes washer annual usage rate is 406 cycles per year, approximately3 percent less than the test procedure representative average use cycle.The slightly lower usage numbers tend to result in lower life-cycle costestimates, with the initial purchase price increase carrying greater weightin the calculations. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Tables 3.16 and 3.17. Another way to compare the costs and benefits that would be associatedwith any standard level is to estimate the net impact on life-cycle cost.Such a comparison for each standard level is shown below. The incrementalconsumer price for each standard level for all equipment purchased in thefirst year after the standard goes into effect; the total operating expensesavings calculated at a 5, 7 and 10 percent discount rates; and the netdifference in discounted savings and incremental prices paid are presented.The results show that, for each standard level, there is a positive netreduction in life-cycle cost; which indicates that, using national averagevalues, the benefits of each candidate standard level exceed the increasein price paid for the appliance by the affected consumers.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,b2,tp8,p6,6/7,i1,s10,6,6,6,6,6</C><T4> </T4><T4>Clothes Washer Net Present Values </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[In millions of dollars, 1987]  </ITAG><H1>Standard level</H1><H1>Price increase</H1><H1>Operating expense savings </H1><H2>5 percent</H2><H2>7 percent</H2><H2>10 percent</H2><H1>LCC differences</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">1 <D>29.27 </D><D>461.70 </D><D>407.12 </D><D>342.03 </D><D>377.85 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2 <D>64.39 </D><D>726.58 </D><D>640.75 </D><D>538.09 </D><D>576.36 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3 <D>99.11 </D><D>783.79 </D><D>691.19 </D><D>580.67 </D><D>592.08 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4 <D>153.77 </D><D>803.95 </D><D>709.01 </D><D>595.63 </D><D>555.23</D></ITAG></ITAG> The LBL-REM employs national average energy prices and usage rates. Theappropriateness of this approach depends on the relationship between energyprices and consumer choice of efficiency levels and the relationship betweenconsumers' expected usage and choice of energy efficiency level. If thoseconsumers who face higher energy prices and/or expect to use their dishwashersmore intensively, are, on average, more likely to buy higher efficiencydishwashers, then a modeling approach that assumes that national averageenergy prices and usage rates apply to all consumers will yield resultsthat may overstate the net benefits that could be expected. As discussedabove, recent Procter and Gamble data have shown declines in usage ratesfor clothes washers. The Department requests comments and data on the effectsof energy prices and expected usage rates on consumer's choice of efficiencylevel. The NPV analysis indicates that standard level 1 would produce a net presentvalue of $1.45 billion to consumers. The corresponding NPV numbers forlevels 2-4 are $2.47 billion, $2.62 billion, and $2.47 billion, respectively.<T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 5.14. C. <T3>Energy Savings. </T3>As indicated above, standards will result in savingsof electricity consumption for clothes washers. If, however, the marketplacecontinues to demand changes in efficiency at the same rate as historically,the LBL-REM projects that energy savings from standards over the 1993-2015period will be reduced by .43 Quads. D. <T3>Lessening of Performance of Products. </T3>As indicated above, DOEestablished classes of products in order to assure that the standards analyzedwould not lessen the existing utility or performance of clothes washers.Standard level 1 involves an efficiency level that was attained by eliminatingthe warm water rinse option. It could be argued that if manufacturers choseto achieve the standard's efficiency levels by eliminating that option,the utility of the clothes washer could be lessened. DOE appreciates thatconcern, but considers the utility of a clothes washer is its ability toclean clothes. The Department welcomes comments about the utility of awarm water rinse option in a clothes washer.E. <T3>Impact of Lessening Competition. </T3>The determination of this factormust be made by the Attorney General. F. <T3>Need to Save Energy. </T3>Like dishwashers, clothes washers use electricitydirectly, and are responsible for the water heater energy consumption thatis necessary to supply the heated water to the clothes washer. That waterheater energy consumption is primarily either electricity or natural gas,depending upon how the water heater is fueled. Consequently, clothes washersare responsible for both gas and electricity consumption. In 1987, 1.6percent of source electricity (or, .442 Quads) and 1.4 percent of naturalgas consumption (or, .241 Quads) were consumed by clothes washers. Standardlevel 1 would save nearly five percent of the .683 Quads that clothes washersconsumed in 1987. Standard levels 2 through 4 would save 8.1 percent, 9.2percent, and 10.0 percent, respectively. The sensitivity analysis on theLBL-REM indicates, however, that if consumer awareness of, and concernwith, appliance efficiencies were to continue at their historic averages,the projected savings from standard level 3 would be 1.07 Quads over the1993-2015 period. <T3>Conclusion. </T3>After careful consideration of the analysis, the Departmentis proposing a revision of the clothes washer standard to include a rangeof standards that includes continuing the 1988 NAECA standards to standardlevel 2. The Department proposes that each candidate standard level forclothes washers saves a significant amount of energy and that standardlevels 1 and 2 are economically justified. However, because of the analyticalissues discussed above, the Department is not proposing specific standardlevels within the above range. Rather, DOE is presenting the results ofthe analysis and is soliciting additional comment and information to beconsidered in promulgating the final rule. The final rule will specifya specific level for clothes washers; the level selected could includeno change to the 1988 NAECA standards. As discussed above, DOE's analysis indicates that there would be a significantenergy savings at each candidate standard level of efficiency. During theperiod 1993-2015, the cumulative energy savings would be .7 Quads of primaryelectricity for level 1, and 1.2 Quads for level 2. For standard level 1 these estimated savings can be achieved by eliminatingwarm water rinse options; if so, the standard would cause no extra coststo manufacturers and zero consumer financial expenditure. In fact, if thesavings are attained by this change in feature, the standard is estimatedto reduce the typical consumer's life-cycle costs by $144, from $3,870to $3,726, with a zero payback period (since there are no additional expensesthat are possible to pay back). For standard level 2 these savings wouldbe achieved by adding thermostatic mixing values resulting in an increasein consumer expenditure of $19 with a corresponding reduction in life-cyclecosts of $19. Although these standards were assumed to eliminate warm water rinse, someconsumers may continue to want clothes washers with a warm water rinse.If some manufacturers responded to these consumer demands by continuingto provide that feature, then those producers would have to meet the energyconservation standard by some other efficiency improvement. In doing that,there would be some additional manufacturing costs and higher consumerprices, the amounts of which would depend on the energy conservation improvementmade. In addition, while the same amount of energy would conceivably besaved, there would be some positive payback period for the consumer, thelength of which would also depend on the extra expense of the other efficiencyimprovement. DOE believes the technologies that may be necessary to meet each standardlevel will be commercially available by 1993. The technologies to meetstandard levels 1-3 are considered to be presently widely available orcapable of being carried out. For manufacturers, level 1 standards areexpected to produce increases in their return-on-equity of 6.45 percent,a decline of nearly 3 percent from the baseline. Standard level 2 willresult in a return-on-equity of 6.87 percent. DOE considers the declinein ROE for level 1 to be an anomaly of the LBL-MIM which is caused by theno additional manufacturer cost of the eliminate warm rinse design option.In the base case (1988 NAECA standards), DOE believes the analysis maynot accurately estimate the impacts of amended standards. As discussedabove, the Department believes that the LBL-REM overestimates energy consumptionin the base case by forecasting moderate increases in clothes washer efficiency.Furthermore, characterization of the prototypical firm in the LBL-MIM doesnot account for manufacturers electing to continue to provide a warm waterrinse option, and adding other, presumably more costly design options.For standard level 1, the Department proposes that there would be a significantconservation of energy and that the standards are projected to have littleeconomic impact on manufacturers. In addition, the standards would likelynot cause an increase in price to consumers. However, standards at thislevel, eliminating warm water rinse, may be viewed as negatively affectingthe utility of the product. Also, the analysis may underestimate the economicimpacts on consumers and manufacturers as discussed above, if manufacturerselect to retain the warm water rinse option and incorporate other designoptions. For standard level 2, the Department proposes that there would be significantconservation of energy and that the standards are projected to have littleeconomic impact on manufacturers. Standards at this level would likelybe met with existing technology and would reduce consumer life-cycle costs.More stringent standard levels were examined and rejected for the followingreasons: First, the level 4 standard, the maximum technologically feasiblelevel, is beyond the minimum life-cycle cost point; this would precludethe average consumer from purchasing the most cost-effective product; i.e.,the minimum life-cycle cost unit. In addition, the results of the analysiscould change if different annual cycles of operation were used, therebyreducing benefits of standards. While standard level 4 would save additionalamounts of energy, 1.5 Quads as compared to 0.7 Quads, level 1, and wouldappear to have positive economic impacts on manufacturers_standards areforecast to cause an increase in manufacturers' return-on-equity_DOE doesnot consider these benefits to outweigh the consumer life-cycle cost impacts.Level 3 standards, the minimum life-cycle cost point, involves technologiesthe Department believes to be widely available, i.e., warm rinse elimination,and use of thermostatic mixing valves and improved motors. However, theDepartment believes that the additional price of the improved motor, $6.30,and the corresponding decrease in life-cycle costs, $4 or approximately$.30 per year over the average clothes washer lifetime, do not justifystandards at this level. DOE believes the risks of standards at this levelexceed the possible benefits. As can be seen in Figure 3.17 of the TechnicalSupport Document, the life-cycle cost curve for top-loading standard sizeclothes washers is relatively flat between standard levels 2 and 4; DOEbelieves that the differences in the life-cycle costs between these levelsare likely less significant than the uncertainty of the analysis. For example,for consumers whose usage is lower than assumed by the test proceduresor whose energy prices are lower than those used in the analysis, the incrementalprice increase to meet standard level 3, compared to standard level 2,would likely not be met by the value of the energy saved. In addition,the analysis predicts energy savings of 1.38 Quads, or .17 Quads over standardlevel 2. Finally, the impact of this standard on manufacturers is likelyto increase manufacturers' return-on-equity. The Department believes thatthe marginal benefits as compared to the uncertainty in the analysis asdiscussed above, do not economically justify standards at this level. Therefore,the Department concludes that revised clothes washer standards at standardlevel 3 are not economically justified. c. Clothes Dryers <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Classes</ITAG>In the advance notice, the Department discussed its methodology for reviewingenergy conservation standards for clothes dryers that were establishedby the Act, to determine if the standards should be amended. NAECA prescribeda design standard for gas clothes dryers; standing pilot lights are prohibitedon units manufactured after January 1, 1988. The following classes of clothesdryers have been identified:<ITAG tagnum="25">Electric, Standard </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Electric, Compact (120V) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Electric, Compact (240V) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Electric Heat Pump </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Gas, Standard </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Gas, Compact</ITAG>Compact gas clothes dryers and heat pump clothes dryers were not analyzedfor this rulemaking. In these instances the product classes represent avery small segment of the market and manufacturer or industry cost andperformance data were not available. Therefore, cost and performance estimateswere not performed. Compact gas clothes dryers will retain the ban on standingpilot lights and heat pump clothes dryers will have no standards imposedin this rulemaking. Both of these classes will be addressed in the nextrulemaking cycle. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Design Options </ITAG>The following is a list of design options that were examined:<ITAG tagnum="25">Automatic Termination by Temperature Sensing </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Automatic Termination by Moisture Sensing </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Added Insulation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Recycle Heat Exchanger Used </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">3. Comments on the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking </ITAG>The Department received one comment concerning clothes dryers. In its comments,NRDC suggested consideration of both condensing and non-condensing heatexchangers, a variety of efficiencies of heat pump and microwave dryers,as well as spin-assisted drying. (NRDC, No. 3, at 7-8). The Department has analyzed both condensing and non-condensing heat exchangers.In addition, DOE identified and analyzed one prototype heat pump dryer,which the Department believes largely captures the likely energy savingspossible. The Department has placed heat pump clothes dryers in a separateclass because such units are likely to be relatively larger than conventionaldryers, relatively slower in drying time, and would probably need a drain(thereby preventing their universal applicability, and, as a consequence,affecting their utility). DOE does not believe that a microwave dryer is technologically feasible.DOE requested data on microwave dryers in the advance notice; no informationhas been submitted. Therefore, this design option has not been evaluated.Standard levels 1 and 2 represent efficiencies achieved by two differentforms of automatic termination, temperature-sensing and moisture-sensing,respectively. The test procedure gives both moisture-sensing and temperature-sensingtermination the same energy savings credit. In the analysis the Departmentgave moisture-sensing approximately 78 percent more credit than temperature-sensingtermination. Nevertheless, in evaluating the results, the Department treatedthem as having the same energy savings impact. The Department requestscomments about the relative energy efficiencies of these two forms of automatictermination in clothes dryers. <ITAG tagnum="81">4.

The majority of the savings due to standards is electricity, since theLBL-REM projects that between 1993 and 1996 gas clothes dryer average energyconsumption, in the base case, will decrease by over 10 percent (the basecase electric clothes dryer energy consumption is not expected to changeuntil after 2005). This is because residential electricity rates are projectedto decline from 1984 to 1995, then increase, reaching 1985 levels by 2015(in real terms). The LBL-REM projects, for the period 1993-2015, the following energy savingwould result from the increased standards:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L0,tp0,p7,7/8,g1,t1,i1,xs46,r10,xs44 </C><H1>  </H1><H1>Electricity </H1><H1>Gas</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Level 1 <D>0.50 Quad </D><D>0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Level 2 <D>0.87 Quad </D><D>0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Level 3 <D>1.06 Quads </D><D>0.02 Quads </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Level 4 <D>1.70 Quads </D><D>0.08 Quads</D></ITAG></ITAG> On the basis of the above, DOE believes that the standard levels consideredfor clothes dryers would result in a significant conservation of energy(total gas and electricity). <T3>Economic Justification_</T3>A. <T3>Economic Impact on Manufacturers and Consumers. </T3>The per unit increasedcost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency is $8 for a standardelectric or gas unit. To meet levels 2-4, the incremental cost increasesare $5, $6.60, and $30, respectively. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Tables 3.12 and 3.13. At those levels of efficiency, the incremental consumer price increasesfor an electric or gas dryer are $11.60, $7.10, $10.00, and $46.90, respectively.<T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, tables 3.14 and 3.15. The LBL-MIM results for clothes dryers estimate that standard level 1 wouldcause manufacturers to have an increase in ROE from 6.6 percent in thebase case to 8.1 percent (a gain of 23 percent). At standard level 2 through4, the percentage changes in ROE (compared to the base case ROE) are 42,14, and minus 145 percent, respectively. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 7.25. The reason for the striking decline in ROE under standard level 4 is thoughtto be the industry's price elasticity of demand: standard level 4 causessuch a large price increase that a significant decline in the quantityof dryers demanded occurs. In LBL-MIM, this fall in unit sales causes agreater reduction in revenue than in variable costs and, as a result, profitand ROE decline. This industry has displayed continuing consolidation for several decades,especially during periods of low earnings. By increasing profitability,as DOE projects at standard levels 1, 2 and 3 standards could lead to areduction in the rate of such consolidations, thereby possibly contributingto more robust competitiveness than is likely in the base case. The Department's characterization of the prototypical manufacturer in thebase case assumes that manufacturers' typical clothes dryer designs arebased on the combination of options presented in the Engineering Analysisfor the baseline unit. If manufacturers use a different combination ofdesign options to produce clothes dryers that minimally comply with the1993 standard, the Department may have inappropriately characterized thefinancial position of the prototypical manufacturer in the LBL-MIM. Furthermore,since financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypicalmanufacturer are generally not available, DOE had to make a number of assumptionsbased on the limited data publicly available, e.g., Securities and ExchangeCommission 10K reports and company annual reports. Because of the significantimpact that these assumptions could have on the results of the analysis,DOE requests comments on these issues, particularly from small manufacturers.B. <T3>Life Cycle Cost and Net Present Value. </T3>For clothes dryers, theLCC analysis indicates that at each possible standard level, except level4 for gas clothes dryers, the increase in purchase price would be offsetby savings in operating expenses. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Tables 3.18 and 3.19. Also, ofthe four candidate standard levels, standard level 3 for electric clothesdryers and standard level 2 for gas clothes dryers had the lowest life-cyclecost. This indicates at these levels the standard would not cause any economicburden on the average consumer because of the decreasing life-cycle costs.Standard level 1 would cause a reduction in life-cycle costs of $45.62for electric standard clothes dryers and $7.68 for gas standard clothesdryers; standard level 2 would reduce life-cycle cost an additional $37.22and $7.88 respectively; standard level 3 would result in a $5.28 reductionand $5.03 increase for standard electric and gas clothes dryers, respectively;standard level 4 would result in an increase of $1.59 and $30.84 respectively.While DOE examined the effect of different discount rates, 5, 7, and 10percent, on the LCC curves and generally found little impact, the Departmentdid not consider higher discount rates. Similarly, DOE did not considerdifferent energy prices, including regional prices, in the LCC analysis.However, DOE did examine the effect of a usage rate different from the416 cycles per year set by the DOE test procedure. Recent Procter and Gambleclothes washer data, when applied to clothes dryers, appear to indicatethat the national average clothes dryer annual usage rate is 406 cyclesper year, approximately 3 percent less than the test procedure representativeaverage use cycle. The slightly lower usage numbers tend to result in lowerlife-cycle cost estimates, with the initial purchase price increase carryingslightly greater weight in the calculations. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Tables 3.18 and 3.19. Another way to compare the costs and benefits that would be associatedwith any standard level is to estimate the net impact on life-cycle cost.Such a comparison for each standard level is shown below. The incrementalconsumer price for each standard level for all equipment purchased in thefirst year after the standard goes into effect; the total operating expensesavings calculated at a 5, 7 and 10 percent discount rates; and the netdifference in discounted savings and incremental prices paid are presented.The results show that, for each standard level, there is a positive netreduction in life-cycle cost; which indicates that, using national averagevalues, the benefits of each candidate standard level exceed the increasein price paid for the appliance by the affected consumers.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,b2,tp8,p6,6/7,i1,s10,6,6,6,6,6</C><T4> Clothes Dryer Net Present Values</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[In millions of 1987 dollars] </ITAG><H1>Standard level</H1><H1>Price increase</H1><H1>Operating expense savings</H1><H2>5 percent </H2><H2>7 percent</H2><H2>10 percent</H2><H1>LCC differences</H1>  <ITAG tagnum="1">1 <D>50.07 </D><D>213.24 </D><D>184.00 </D><D>150.43 </D><D>193.93 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2 <D>80.77 </D><D>378.45 </D><D>326.59 </D><D>266.96 </D><D>245.82 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3 <D>124.17 </D><D>435.39 </D><D>375.71 </D><D>307.11 </D><D>251.54 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4 <D>322.83 </D><D>600.60 </D><D>518.26 </D><D>423.66 </D><D>195.43</D></ITAG></ITAG> The LBL-REM employs national average energy prices and usage rates. Theappropriateness of this approach depends on the relationship between energyprices and consumer choice of efficiency levels and the relationship betweenconsumers' expected usage and choice of energy efficiency level. If thoseconsumers who face higher energy prices and/or expect to use their dishwashersmore intensively, are, on average, more likely to buy higher efficiencydishwashers, then a modeling approach that assumes that national averageenergy prices and usage rates apply to all consumers will yield resultsthat overstate the net benefits that could be expected. As discussed above,recent Procter and Gamble data, when applied to clothes dryers, would appearto show a decline in usage rates for clothes dryers. The Department requestscomments and data on the effects of energy prices and expected usage rateson consumer's choice of efficiency level. The NPV analysis indicates that standard level 1 would produce a net presentvalue of $856 million over the forecast period (all of the $856 millionwould be attributed to the standard on electric dryers). At standard level2, the NPV would be $1,646 million, of which $1,625 would come from thestandard on electric dryers. Standard level 3 would produce an electricdryer NPV of $1,711 million and a gas dryer NPV of minus $21 million, fora total NPV for the standard of $1,690 million. Lastly, standard level4 produces the same $1,711 million NPV for electric dryers, but, underthis standard level, the NPV for gas dryers is a negative $229 million,leaving the standard's NPV at $1,482 million. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 5.21. C. <T3>Energy Savings. </T3>As indicated above, standards will result in savingsof energy consumption by clothes dryers. The cumulative energy savingsover the 1993-2015 period would range from 0.5 Quads at standard level1 to 1.78 Quads at standard level 4. D. <T3>Lessening of Utility or Performance of Products. </T3>As indicatedabove, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that thestandards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performanceof clothes dryers. E. <T3>Impact of Lessening Competition. </T3>The determination of this factormust be made by the Attorney General. F. <T3>Need to Save Energy. </T3>Clothes dryers use electricity and naturalgas as their energy sources. Approximately 1.8 percent of the nation's1987 source electricity generation, and 0.3 percent of that year's naturalgas consumption were used to operate clothes dryers. This represented atotal of .55 Quads of energy, of which standard level 1 would save 4.1percent. Standard levels 2 through 4 would save 7.2 percent, 9.0 percent,and 14.8 percent, respectively. The LBL-REM sensitivity analysis indicates,however, that if consumer awareness of, and concern with, appliance efficiencywere to continue at its historical rate, the projected savings at standardlevel 2 would be .09 Quads over the 1993-2015 period. <T3>Conclusion. </T3>After careful consideration of the analysis, the Departmentis proposing a revision of the clothes dryers standard to require all clothesdryers manufactured after January 1, 1993, to be equipped with an automatictermination device, either a temperature or moisture sensing terminationcontrol. The Department proposes that this prescriptive standard savesa significant amount of energy and is economically justified. As discussed above, DOE's analysis indicates that there would be a significantenergy savings at the candidate standard levels of efficiency. During theperiod 1993-2015, the cumulative energy saving is expected to be between.50 Quads (level 1) and .87 Quads (level 2) of primary electricity. Thisrepresents three to six percent of the expected clothes dryer electricityconsumption over that period. DOE's analysis indicates that there wouldnot be any gas saved due to the imposition of the proposed standard. However,DOE believes this is due to the LBL-REM forecast that between 1993 and1996 the average energy consumption of new gas clothes dryers is to decreasewhich the Department believes is due to the incorporation of automatictermination devices.Therefore, DOE believes that for gas clothes dryers the marketplace forceswill demand automatic termination devices. While the analysis would appearto indicate that level 2, moisture termination, would save more energy,and do so at lower consumer life-cycle costs than level 1, temperaturetermination, the Department's clothes dryer test procedures treats bothas having the same energy conservation potential. DOE's analysis of theavailable data indicates that either the two technologies have the sameenergy conservation potential or that the test procedure gives too muchcredit to temperature termination. There are presently no data availableto DOE to indicate that the test procedure should give moisture terminationa larger energy conservation credit. Finally, as indicated above, the dataare not conclusive that the test procedure should be revised. Therefore,DOE is proposing a prescriptive standard that would allow manufacturersto choose either type of automatic termination device. Although a prescriptive standard for electric clothes dryers would causean increase in the initial price to the consumer of $11.57 and $18.67 fortemperature-termination and moisture-termination, respectively, the standardis calculated to reduce the typical consumer's life-cycle costs of $38.80and $69 for temperature-termination and moisture-termination, respectively.For gas clothes dryers, a prescriptive standard would cause an increasein    the initial purchase price to the consumer by the same amount aselectric clothes dryers and with a corresponding decrease in life-cyclecost of $7.68 and $15.56 for temperature-termination and moisture-termination,respectively. The technologies that may be necessary to meet the standard are availablenow in the form of temperature-sensing and moisture-sensing terminationcontrols that are presently installed in many electric clothes dryers.For manufacturers, the standard is expected to result in an increase inlong-run returns-on-equity from 6.60 percent to between 8.10 percent and9.40 percent. As discussed above, there is uncertainty about the forecasting effort;for example, the results of the analysis could have been different if energyprices changed differently from the energy price forecasts or if use ofnational energy prices and appliance usage rates introduced a bias. The Department examined more stringent standard levels and rejected themfor the following reasons: First the level 4 standard, the maximum technologicallyfeasible level, is beyond the minimum life-cycle cost point for both gasand electric clothes dryers; this would preclude the average consumer frompurchasing the most cost-effective product, i.e., the minimum life-cyclecost unit. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that the standard wouldcause an increase in the initial price to the consumer of nearly $46.00for both electric and gas clothes dryers. This increase in price is expectedto preclude many consumers from purchasing clothes dryers and would alsocause the negative return-on-equity projected by the LBL_MIM. While standardlevel 4 would save additional amounts of energy (1.78 Quads as comparedto 0.5 Quads, level 1); the Department believes standards at this levelwould have negative impacts on manufacturers and consumers as discussedabove. Level 3 standards involve technologies the Department believes to be generallyavailable, i.e., automatic termination devices and 1 inch insulation. However,for gas clothes dryers the standard is beyond the minimum life-cycle costpoint, which would prevent some consumers from being able to purchase thecost-effective units for them. For electric clothes dryers, the Departmentbelieves that the additional price of the insulation, $10.02, and the correspondingminimal decrease in life-cycle costs, $5.03 or less than $.50 per yearover the average clothes dryer lifetime, do not justify standards at thislevel. DOE believes the risks of standards at this level exceed the possiblebenefits. As can be seen in Figure 3.19 of the Technical Support Document,the life-cycle cost curve for standard electric clothes dryers is relativelyflat between standard levels 2 and 3; DOE believes that the differencein the life-cycle costs between these levels are likely less significantthan the accuracy of the analysis. For example, for consumers whose usageis lower than assumed by the test procedures or whose energy prices arelower than used in the analysis, the incremental price increase to meetstandard level 3, as compared to standard level 2, would likely not bemet by the value of the energy saved. In addition, the analysis predictselectricity    savings of 1.06 Quads, or .19 Quads over standard level2. Finally, the impact of the standards on manufacturers is to reduce theirreturn-on-equity from 9.4 percent at level 2 to 7.5 percent. The Departmentbelieves that the marginal benefits as compared to the burdens of the standardsand the questionable nature of the analysis as discussed above do not justifystandards at this level. Therefore, the Department concludes that revisedclothes dryer standards at the standard level 3 are not economically justified.<ITAG tagnum="84"> IV. Environmental, Regulatory Impact, Takings Assessment, Federalismand Regulatory Flexibility Reviews </ITAG>The Department has reviewed today's proposed action in accordance withthe Department's obligations under: andbullet; The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C.4321 et seq.), the Council on Environmental Quality regulations implementingthe procedural provisions of NEPA regulations (40 CFR Part 1500 et seq.),and the Department's own NEPA regulations (10 CFR Part 1021); andbullet; Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193, February 19, 1981) which pertainsto agency review of the impact of Federal regulations; andbullet; Executive Order 12630 (53 FR 8859, March 18, 1988) which pertainsto agency consideration of Federal actions that interfere with constitutionallyprotected property rights; andbullet; Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) which pertainsto agency consideration of federal actions that would have a    substantialdirect effect on States, on the relationship between the National Governmentand the States, and on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government; and andbullet; The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.) which requires,in part, that an agency prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysisfor any proposed rule unless it determines that the rule will not havea ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.''In the event that such an analysis is not required for a particular rule,the agency must publish a certification and explanation of that determinationin the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> a. Environmental Review DOE prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) on the proposed standardspursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended,Pub. L. 91-190, 40 U.S.C. 4221 et seq., and the implementing regulationsof the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1808).The EA addresses the possible incremental environmental effects attributableto the application of the proposed standards to the design of three typesof covered products: dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers.A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is published in today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The FONSI concludes that the proposed standardswould result in no significant environmental impacts and that an environmentalimpact statement is not required.The EA is part of the Technical Support Document and is available at theDOE Freedom of Information Reading Room at the address provided at thebeginning of this notice. b. Regulatory Impact Review Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193, February 19, 1981) directs that, inproposing a major rule,\14\<NOTE/> an agency perform a regulatory analysis. Such an analysispresents major alternatives to the regulation that could substantiallyachieve the same regulatory goal at lower cost, as well as a descriptionof the costs and benefits (including potential net benefits) of the proposedrule.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ ``Major rule'' means any regulation that is likely toresult in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. DOE has determined that this proposed rule is a ``major rule.'' Accordingly,a Draft Regulatory Impact Review has been prepared. The Regulatory Analysis is summarized below. This summary focuses on themajor alternatives considered in arriving at the proposed approach to improvingthe energy efficiency of consumer products. The reader is referred to thecomplete draft ``Regulatory Impact Analysis,'' which is contained in theTechnical Support Document, available as indicated at the beginning ofthis notice. It  consists of: (1) A statement of the problem addressedby this regulation, and the mandate for government action; (2) a descriptionand analysis of the feasible policy alternatives to this regulation; (3)a quantitative comparison of the impacts of the alternatives; and (4) theeconomic impact of the proposed standard. It should be noted at the outset that none of the alternatives that wereexamined for these three products saved as much energy as the proposedrule. Also, most of the alternatives would require that enabling legislationbe enacted, since authority to carry out those alternatives does not presentlyexist. <ITAG tagnum="81">Alternatives for Achieving Consumer Product Energy Conservation </ITAG>Six major alternatives were identified by DOE as representing feasiblepolicy alternatives for achieving consumer product energy efficiency. Thesealternatives include: andbullet; No New Regulatory Action andbullet; Informational Action<ITAG tagnum="15">_Product labeling </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Consumer education</ITAG>andbullet; Prescriptive Standards andbullet; Financial Incentives<ITAG tagnum="15">_Tax credits </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Rebates</ITAG>andbullet; Voluntary Energy Efficiency Targets andbullet; The Proposed Approach (Performance Standards) Each alternative has been evaluated in terms of its ability to achievesignificant energy savings at reasonable costs, and has been compared tothe effectiveness of the proposed regulation. If no new regulatory action were taken, then no new standards would beimplemented for dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers. Thisis essentially the ``base case'' for each appliance. In this case, betweenthe years 1993 and 2015 there would be expected energy use of 40.54 Quadsof primary energy, with no energy savings and a zero net present value.Several alternatives to the base case can be grouped under the headingof informational action. They include consumer product labeling and DOE'spublic education and information program. Both of these alternatives aremandated by the Act. One base case alternative would be to estimate theenergy conservation potential of enhancing these programs. To model thispossibility, the Department assumed that market discount rates would belowered by five percent for purchasers of these three products. This resultedin energy savings equa1 to 2.32 Quads, with expected consumption equalto 38.22 Quads. The net present value is estimated to be $3.05 billion.Another method of setting standards would entail requiring that certaindesign options be used on each product, i.e., prescriptive standards. Forthese three products, this involved assuming level 1 standards, i.e., improvedfood filters for dishwashers, elimination of warm rinse options for clotheswashers, and temperature termination for clothes dryers. This resultedin energy consumption, between 1993 and 2015, of 38.95 Quads, and savingsof 1.59 Quads. The net present value, in 1987 dollars, was $3.02 billion.Various financial incentive alternatives were tested. These included taxcredits and rebates to consumers, as well as tax credits to manufacturers.The tax credits to consumers were assumed to be 15 percent of the increasedcost of higher energy efficiency features of these appliances, while therebates were assumed to be 15 percent of the increase in equipment prices.The tax credits to consumers showed a sizable change from the base case,i.e., this alternative would save 2.30 Quads with a net present value of$3.22 billion. Consumer rebates also showed sizable changes; they wouldsave 2.29 Quads with a net present value of $3.42 billion. Another financial incentive that was considered was tax credits to manufacturersfor the production of energy-efficient dishwashers, clothes washers, andclothes dryers. In this scenario, an investment tax credit (ITC) of 20percent was assumed. The tax credits to manufacturers had almost no effect,since the energy consumption estimates are 39.99 Quads with savings equalto .55 Quad, and a net present value equal to $52 million. The impact of this scenario is so small because the ITC was applicableonly to the tooling and machinery costs of the firms, i.e., the firms'fixed costs, and most of the design improvements that would likely be adoptedto manufacture more efficient versions of these products would involvepurchased parts. Expenses for purchased parts would not be eligible foran ITC. Two scenarios of voluntary energy efficiency targets were examined; inthe first one, the proposed energy conservation standards were assumedto be voluntarily adopted by all the relevant manufacturers in five years,and, in the second scenario, the proposed standards were assumed to beadopted in 10 years. In these scenarios, the five year delay would resultin energy consumption by these appliances of 39.19 Quads, energy savingsof 1.35 Quads, and a net present value of $2.22 billion; the 10 year delaywould result in 40.04 Quads of energy being consumed, .50 Quad being saved,and a net present value of $940 million. These scenarios assume that there would be universal voluntary adoptionof the energy conservation standards by these appliance manufacturers,an assumption for which there is no reasonable assurance. Lastly, all of these alternatives must be gauged against the performancestandards that are being proposed in this notice. Such performance standardswould result in energy consumption of dishwashers, clothes washers, andclothes dryers to total an estimated 38.07 Quads of primary energy overthe 1993-2015 time period. Savings would be 2.47 Quads, and the net presentvalue would be an expected $4.83 billion.As noted at the beginning of this section, none of the alternatives thatwere considered for these products would save as much energy as the proposedrule. c. ``Takings'' Assessment Review Executive Order 12630 (53 FR 8859, March 18, 1988) directs that, in proposinga regulation, an agency conduct a ``takings'' review. Such a review isintended to assist agencies in avoiding unnecessary takings and help suchagencies account for those takings that are necessitated by statutory mandate.<ITAG tagnum="21">For purposes of the Order:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``Policies that have takings implications'' refers to Federal regulations,proposed Federal regulations, proposed Federal legislation, comments onproposed Federal legislation, or other Federal policy statements that,if implemented or enacted, could effect a taking, such as rules and regulationsthat propose or implement licensing, permitting, or other condition requirementsor limitations on private property use, or that require dedications orexactions from owners of private property.</ITAG>It appears that there are three parts of the appliance standards programthat conceivably could be viewed as having ``takings implications.'' Theseare testing and certification requirements, the impacts of standard levels,and possible DOE testing of products for validation. With regard to the first part, namely, testing and certification, the Departmentbelieves that such a requirement, implementing a long-established statutorymandate in a manner calculated to minimize adverse economic impacts, doesnot constitute a ``taking'' of private property. Similarly, the Department's possible validation testing does not constitutea ``taking,'' within the limitations described above. Lastly, the impact of standards could be viewed by some as a ``taking.''Nevertheless, the Department believes that the fact that while an energyconservation standard may limit some manufacturers in the range of applianceefficiencies that they can produce, such narrowing of the energy efficiencyrange does not constitute a ``taking'' in the sense described above. In short, in none of the three parts of the appliance standards programdoes the Department believe that the provisions of E.O. 12630 pertain.d. Federalism Review Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) requires that regulationsor rules be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on therelationship between the National Government and the States, or on thedistribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government.If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then Executive Order12612 requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in alldecisions involved in promulgating and implementing a regulation or a rule.The Department believes that today's regulation, when finalized, wouldnot have a substantial direct effect on State governments. Firstly, Stateregulations that may have existed on these three products were preemptedby the Federal standards established in NAECA; secondly, States could havepetitioned the Department for exemption from such preemption, and nonehas done that; lastly, today's regulation, when finalized, amends (or,in one case reaffirms) the Federal standards from NAECA. e. Regulatory Flexibility Review The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354) requires an assessmentof the impact of proposed regulations on small businesses. Small businessesare defined as those firms within an industry that are privately ownedand less dominant in the market. In this rulemaking, three different products and, hence, industries, arebeing addressed. Regulatory flexibility issues will be discussed for thedishwasher, clothes washer, and clothes dryer industries for which standardsare being proposed. First, the energy conservation standard of an improved food filter on thosedishwasher manufacturers, who could be considered small businesses, willbe discussed. Dishwasher manufacturing firms may be divided into two groups: those thatcompete on large sales-volume products and those that compete in small,specialized markets. Small firms are generally forced to specialize insmall market niches that offer some protection from the cost advantagethat large firms hold when they can produce in volume. This effect caneven be observed among the major producers in the tendency of the smallermajor producers to produce somewhat more specialized products. There are significant differences among the major firms. As learned fromdiscussions with industry consultants, average cost decreases with firmsize. Thus, the industry has economies of scale, and large firms (to theextent that their facilities are up-to-date) have lower average costs thansmall firms. This fact, coupled with increasing competitiveness of thenational and international markets, probably accounts for the continuingconsolidation that has been occurring for several decades. The fact thatthe consolidation has been producing larger firms strongly corroboratesthe finding that large firms have a cost advantage. A principal implication of consolidation is that the smaller of the majorfirms will be, on average, in more danger of failing or being bought outthan will the large firms. Because of the greater precariousness of smallerfirms, any decrease in average profitability is more likely to damage seriouslya smaller firm, and an increase in average profitability is more likelyto mean the difference between success and failure for a smaller firm.From the point of view of competitiveness, a decrease in average profitabilitycould speed up the process of consolidation, producing a less competitiveindustry, while an increase in average profitability could help maintainthe current levels of competition. Either effect might well be temporary,because, in the long-run, the number of firms should be determined by theindustry's cost structure and by the way a single firm's elasticity ofdemand relates to the number of competing firms. Although larger firms have a cost advantage due to economies of scale,the very small firms in the dishwasher manufacturing industry have foundmarket niches in which to survive profitably. The small firms sell dishwashersprimarily to the replacement and kitchen remodel markets, which tend tooffer higher profit margins than does the builder market. As a result,it is possible, according to industry consultants, that small firms wouldhave an easier time passing through increased variable costs that resultfrom the proposed standard, and thus may be affected more positively thanthe large firms. Therefore, the fact that this energy conservation standard on dishwashersis not likely to ``have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities'' suggests that the provisions of section 605.(b)of the Regulatory Flexibility Act pertain. These provisions state thatneither an initial nor a final regulatory flexibility analysis need beperformed for a proposed or final rule ``if the head of the agency certifiesthat the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.''Secondly, the proposed energy conservation standards on clothes washermanufacturers needs to be addressed. The proposed standard is an efficiencylevel that was achieved by the elimination of a warm rinse option. Forthose manufacturers who choose to meet the standard by eliminating thatoption, there will be essentially a zero cost increase resulting from thestandard. Consequently, since this standard may have no effect on any manufacturer,large or small, the Department believes that in this industry, too, theprovisions of section 605.(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act pertain.Lastly, the proposed energy conservation standards on electric clothesdryer manufacturers need to be addressed. It is not at all clear that theprescriptive standard levels being proposed will ``have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The LBL-MIM indicates,through its prediction on an increase in typical ROE, that the proposedstandards are likely to slow down the consolidation process temporarily.This would lead to a temporary slowing down of the continuing decreasein this industry's competitiveness. However, this prediction would be temperedby the observation that if standards were technologically difficult tomeet they could hurt some smaller firms the most, since smaller firms tendto have less sophisticated research and development capabilities. Thisshould not be a serious consideration for regulatory flexibility, sincethe proposed standard levels on clothes dryers will not be technologicallydifficult to meet.Therefore, since the prescriptive standards that are being proposed areexpected to increase the clothes dryer manufacturers' ROE, and slow downthe industry's consolidation, the Department believes that section 605.(b)of the Regulatory Flexibility Act pertains here, also.Thus, for each of these three industries, the Department is concludingthat the proposed standard level will not ``have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and that preparationof neither an initial nor a final regulatory flexibility analysis needbe performed. DOE welcomes comments on this conclusion.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Public Comment Procedures</ITAG>a.
