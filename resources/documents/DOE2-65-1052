The high number of unemployed,which has existed for years, and the resulting social and economicalconsequences. This study presents examples showing how measures for solvingthese two problems can be linked with each other, how steps to counteractunemployment can contribute to the rational and ecological use of energy,and, on the other hand, how measures and investments in the field ofrational and ecological energy use can also create and secure jobs.</TEXT></DOC>
