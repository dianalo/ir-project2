Pablo Benavides, a foreign affairs official of the EuropeanCommunity, traveled to Warsaw to sign a letter on an emergency foodprogram for the financially strapped nation, said a spokesman forthe 12-nation trading bloc.   The spokesman, demanding anonymity, said Benavides' agendacalled for talks with Polish authorities, including IreneuszSekula, deputy prime minister, and Dominik Jastrzebski, minister offoreign economic cooperation, as well as officials of theSolidarity trade union.   Negotiators for the community and Poland reached agreement latelast month on the trade and economic cooperation accord, whichgives a five-year timetable for gradually lifting quotas andtariffs on a range of industrial and farm products.   It also calls for greater cooperation in such fields aspetrochemicals, construction, mining, energy, transportation,tourism and telecommunications.   The trade agreement was the third between the Common Markettrading bloc and an East European country since a thaw in relationsa little more than a year ago. Accords also have been worked outwith Hungary and Czechoslovakia.   The letter sets out some conditions for receipt of $120 millionin free food the community will draw out of its surplus stocks anddeliver soon to Poland, which has been suffering from serious foodshortages.   The community wants to link the food shipments to changes in thestructure of the Polish economy, such as in the inadequate systemfor getting food from farms to consumers' tables.   The idea is to allow the Poles to sell the food to consumers anduse the money for economic improvements. The Poles have acceptedthe plan, and the letter calls for creating a fund that often isused in development programs.   President Bush and other world leaders attending an economicsummit in Paris urged emergency food shipments to Poland. They alsocalled on the European Community to hold a high-level conference tocome up with an economic aid plan for both Poland and Hungary.   Western officials held their first meeting on the aid plan lastweek. Other discussions were expected to be scheduled in the fall.</TEXT></DOC>
