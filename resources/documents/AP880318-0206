The announcement by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board came afterthe company's disclosure, in a report filed with the Securities andExchange Commission, that its thrift unit _ American Savings andamp; LoanAssociation of Stockton, Calif. _ was insolvent under generallyaccepted accounting principles.   The bank board's promise, designed to provide the ailing Sandamp;Lwith stability and stem a drain of deposits, goes beyond its usualmandate of protecting deposit accounts up to $100,000.   In the statement, the bank board also reaffirmed its support forthe management of FCA and American.   FCA, based in Irvine, Calif., said American's net worth _ thedifference between assets and liabilities _ had fallen to negative$106 million at the end of the year, compared with positive $244.4million on Sept. 30.   Under less stringent regulatory accounting guidelines, its networth was plus $69 million at the end of 1987, compared with $357.8million at the end of the third quarter.   FCA had previously revealed that its net worth had fallen intothe red, but this is the first disclosure that net worth atAmerican, FCA's main subsidiary, has fallen below the zero mark.That happened when American concluded that repayment of debts duefrom its parent company was not assured.   FCA's annual report, filed with the SEC, also disclosed thatAmerican had a drain on deposits of $493 million during the firsttwo months of this year. It attributed the drain to publicity aboutthe bank's problems and said the drain eased during the first 10days of March. Deposits had totaled $17.1 billion at the end of theyear.   The drain was milder than the severe run at American in Augustand September of 1984, when the bank _ amid heavy operating losses_ lost about $6.8 billion of its $25 billion in deposits.   The bank board's sister agency for commercial banks, the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp., issued a similar promise on Thursdayprotecting all depositors and general creditors of FirstRepublicBank Corp. of Dallas, a bank holding company of about thesame size as FCA.   However, the FDIC went a step further than the bank board bypumping $1 billion into First RepublicBank.   FCA on Feb. 23 asked the bank board for a $1.5 billion inassistance as soon as possible. Karl Hoyle, a bank board spokesman,said the request is under review.   FCA, with $33.7 billion in assets, ranks second among thriftcompanies only to H.F. Ahmanson andamp; Co., the Los Angeles-based parentof Home Savings of America.   The bank board has tried unsuccessfully for nearly a year tofind another institution willing to take over all or part of FCA onterms that wouldn't be too costly to the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp., the bank board unit that insures deposits.   On-again, off-again talks with the thrift unit of Ford Motor Co.broke down early in January.   Because of its size, FCA is the bank board's largest singleproblem institution, although the problems collectively of TexasSandamp;Ls are more severe.   On Jan. 27, FCA reported a loss of $224.6 million in the lastthree months of last year, bringing its 1987 loss to $468 million.   Two weeks later, the bank board ordered it to sell off $2.5billion in mortgage-backed securities to reduce its vulnerablity tointerest rate fluctuations.   On March 9, the bank board, which regulates about 3,150 Sandamp;Lsnationally, passed a resolution reassuring nervous Wall Streetfirms, which had loaned more than $12 billion to American in theform of reverse repurchase agreements.</TEXT></DOC>
