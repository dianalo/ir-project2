Gold and platinum gave up almost as much as they gained Tuesday, while silver gave up a little more.    December delivery gold declined $2.80 an ounce to $374.70. September silver was off 5.8 cents an ounce at $5.207. October platinum was down $9.60 an ounce at $488.10.    The price movements in platinum, which were the biggest in the precious-metals complex with a rise of more than $10 Tuesday and a drop of almost as much as that yesterday, amount to zero significance, according to Neil Carson, marketing manager for Johnson Matthey Inc., USA.    &quot;The rally and the subsequent decline tended to wash each other out and were mostly attributable to speculative trading, as industrial demand for the metal has been quiet in recent weeks,&quot; Mr. Carson said.    Industrial demand globally for platinum for the year as a whole has been generally strong, but the usual summer shutdowns have limited demand for the metal, he said.    &quot;Investors, on the other hand, probably feel the time now is right to buy bullion because of price declines under $500 an ounce, but they're waiting for prices to show some definite sign of recovery before coming in to buy,&quot; Mr. Carson said.    A new trend may be developing in the U.S. that is favorable for platinum, according to Mr. Carson.    &quot;Platinum jewelry used to be the biggest market for the metal in the U.S. prior to World War II,&quot; he said. During the war, there was such a tightness of platinum supplies that none was used for jewelry, he said. White gold replaced it, and, after the war, platinum wasn't able to recover its market, according to Mr. Carson.    &quot;Now, Italian jewelry manufacturers are making a concentrated effort to sell platinum jewelry in the U.S.,&quot; he said. &quot;They believe that something new and different is needed, and why not go with a product that was once popular?&quot; Italians are among the world's major manufacturers of jewelry and are noted for setting trends, Mr. Carson said. In 1988, Italian businesses exported $958 million of jewelry to the U.S., or 52.7% of the total, he said.    The setback in gold shows that the metal is still in a downward trend, according to Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan Bank, New York.    &quot;Technically, gold hasn't been able to sustain gains at the $370 level,&quot; he said. &quot;That means it could eventually challenge the low $350s.&quot; If the price drops below that level, he said, a significant rally could develop.    &quot;The supply/demand picture has changed,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of the gold that is to be produced from 1990 to 1994 has already been sold into the market and new gold (mining) projects, which take several years to develop, are the lowest in three years. That means any gold price rally won't encounter the aggressive forward selling that has taken place previously, which has stifled advances.&quot;    One analyst observed that open interest figures dropped in all three metals yesterday, which, he said, indicated that the Tuesday rally was largely covering or buying back of contracts by traders who'd previously sold in anticipation that prices would go down. Open interest is the outstanding contracts that must be offset with opposite trades or satisfied by delivery of the commodity.    Another analyst, Peter Cardillo, futures trading adviser for Josephthal andamp; Co., New York, agreed, and added that traders yesterday appeared to be selling contracts in advance of the release of the report on the June U.S. merchandise trade deficit. The report is due to be released today.    &quot;Anticipation is that it will range between $8.5 billion and $9 billion,&quot; he said. &quot;But I think there may be a surprise. If the figure comes in below $8.5 billion, as I think it might, it would be regarded as anti-inflationary and strengthen the dollar. This could cause traders to sell precious metals, and prices could test their lows,&quot; Mr. Cardillo said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Futures closed mixed, with corn rising and soybeans mostly declining. Many traders bought corn futures and sold beans in response to technical factors. &quot;There are also mixed feelings on the weather, and that continues to make the market vacillate,&quot; said Steve Freed, a senior analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. Some brokerage-house meteorologists predicted increased rains over the weekend, which spurred the selling in soybeans. Both the corn and soybean crops, the biggest harvests still developing in the fields, need rain in some regions. &quot;I expect the choppy trade to continue until we see what the weather is going to do,&quot; Mr. Freed said.    COPPER: Futures prices rose slightly on continued concern about production disruptions. The September contract rose 0.35 cent a pound to $1.2185. Analysts noted that the Peruvian national miners' strike, which began Monday, appeared to be losing its effectiveness. On Monday, 35% of the miners were estimated to have walked out, while on Tuesday, the figure dropped to 30%, one analyst said. Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst for PaineWebber, New York, said that the action on the first day appeared to be a symbolic gesture and that more miners may be returning to work. Another analyst observed that if the trend continues, it would be a repetition of previous strike attempts in Peru, most of which dissipated. The second analyst said that two mines of the Southern Peru Copper Corp. appeared to be particularly hard hit by the walkout and that &quot;the next few days are going to be critical.&quot; Peru is the world's sixth-largest copper producer. Workers at the Compania Minera, Mexico's largest producer, are voting on whether to strike later this month. All these production difficulties appear to be giving the market a lift, Mr. Savaiko said. He also noted that the September futures rose into the $1.22-$1.23 range, regarded as a key resistance level, before falling back. Also, he said, the three-cents-a-pound premium of the September contract over December is holding steady, but not widening much, &quot;so I have to question how tight the supply situation really is.&quot;    ENERGY: Petroleum futures rallied on little news except an optimistic report on U.S. oil inventories. The report, released Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute after futures trading had closed, showed drawdowns last week of nearly 2.8 million barrels in U.S. crude oil inventories and 3.5 million barrels in gasoline stocks. Yesterday, as a result, prices of crude oil as well as those of petroleum products were propelled higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange. West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery ended at $18.97 a barrel, up 29 cents. But gasoline was the leader of the rally. The September contract for unleaded gasoline settled at 52.93 cents a gallon, up 0.87 cent. Robert Boslego, a Winchester, Mass., consultant who analyzes oil statistics for clients, said the fact that U.S. crude oil inventories are 14 million barrels less than the year-ago level &quot;is a fundamental that is clearly supporting the market.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
