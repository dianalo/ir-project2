(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Atlantis streaked out oforbit from its secret spy satellite mission Tuesday and glided to anunusual afternoon landing as a small band of spectators cheered thefive astronauts' safe return.   Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson guided the 97-ton shuttle to acenterline touchdown at 3:35 p.m. PST on a hard-packed clay runwayafter a flight of 4 days, 9 hours, 5 minutes.   ``They have been given the welcome back call,'' said BillieDeason at Mission Control in Houston after the spaceship had rolledto a halt on the 7.5-mile-long runway.   Two loud sonic booms crackled overhead as Atlantis descendedthrough partly sunny skies and made its swooping approach to RogersDry Lake in the Mojave Desert.   One tire on the shuttle's left landing gear had a slow leak, butNASA said it was not a concern. It certainly did not seem to affectthe smoothness of the touchdown, which was televised live by thenetworks.   About 55 minutes after landing, the crew emerged from the orbiterand was greeted by NASA adminiistrators, and then inspected theunderside of the craft. ``Dings'' could be seen in the blackprotective tiles,'' Ms. Deason said.   The underside scarring shown by NASA cameras ``appeared to be alot more damaged than usual,'' said NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato.   A white plume was seen coming from the right rear of Atlantisduring landing but Ms. Lovato said it was normal venting of vapor.She did not know whether the vapor was water or chemical.   ``It was a great flight, a super flight,'' NASA AdministratorJames C. Fletcher said in a statement. ``It shows we can serve ourDOD (Department of Defense) customers as we have in the past.''   It was only the seventh afternoon shuttle landing, the timeapparently dictated by the orbit Atlantis had to follow in deployinga radar satellite to spy on the Soviet Union. NASA prefers morninglandings at Edwards because winds tend to gather force later in theday.   Because of the military secrecy, Tuesday's landing was closed topublic viewing from the observation site on this military base 80miles north of Los Angeles. Only a few hundred journalists, NASAemployees and invited guests were witnesses.   Scattered applause echoed across the hardpan in front of NASA'smain hangar as Atlantis rolled across the dry lakebed. The NationalAnthem blared from a loudspeaker.   In contrast, an estimated 425,000 people had watched Discoveryreturn Oct. 3 from the flight that put Americans back in space forthe first time since the Challenger tragedy.   Ms. Deason said all systems performed normally during landing androllout. Tests of the new nose wheel steering system and brakesproved successful, she said. Previous shuttles experienced brakeproblems and before Challenger, shuttles were steered during landingby applying brake pressure on one side of the orbiter or the other.   Although NASA and the Air Force permitted live televisioncoverage of the landing, as they did for Friday's launch from CapeCanaveral, Fla., everything in between was blacked out. Nothing washeard during the flight from commander Gibson or crew members Col.Richard M. Mullane, Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner and Lt. Col. Jerry L.Ross of the Air Force and Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.   NASA said Gibson would probably make brief remarks to the workersat Edwards before the astronauts flew to Houston later in theevening.   Mission Control in Houston lifted its curtain of secrecy on theflight just long enough to report, as it was happening, that Gibsonhad fired braking rockets to slow the spaceship's 17,400-mph speedby 283 mph and drop it out of orbit onto an hourlong fiery descentthrough the atmosphere.   The flight was the 27th shuttle mission and the second since the1986 Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts and haltedlaunchings for 32 months. It was the third flight for Atlantis andthe longest of the three shuttle missions that have been dedicatedentirely to military purposes.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration discovered aslow leak in one of Atlantis' six tires before the spaceship waslaunched. On Monday, the space agency issued a statement saying,``The left inboard main landing gear tire pressure is not a concernfor landing.''   Rear Adm. Richard Truly, a former astronaut in charge of theshuttle program, called the current flight ``one of our mostimportant missions. It's Atlantis' first flight after the standdown,and now you have two vehicles proven in flight. That's extremelyimportant.''   While the mission was shrouded in secrecy, with no briefings byofficials on details of its progress, U.S. and Soviet newsorganization reported the shuttle's classified payload was apowerful spy satellite.   Sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity said Monday thatthe astronauts had successfully deployed the $500 million Lacrossesatellite during the weekend, and that it was operating well in anorbit that allows it to make radar pictures of 80 percent of theSoviet Union.   The satellite is said to be designed to help Americanintelligence agencies monitor Soviet compliance with arms controltreaties, and also to serve as the ``radar eye'' for the new B-2stealth bomber.   The astronauts also were believed to have conducted severalexperiments aimed at defining man's role as an observer in space.   A NASA spokesman, asked the reason for the afternoon landing,said he assumed it was required by the shuttle's orbit. To deploy aspy satellite to fly over much of the Soviet Union would require ahigh-inclination orbit in which Atlantis zig-zagged far north andsouth of the equator as it circled Earth.   After shuttles land at Edwards, they are towed off the lake bedto the 100-foot-tall steel trusswork ``mate-demate device'' forservicing, then several days later mounted on a modified jumbojetliner for a piggyback ride home to the Kennedy Space Center inFlorida.</TEXT></DOC>
