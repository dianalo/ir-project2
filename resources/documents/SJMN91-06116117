Debt retirement cannot be collected from contributors who havealready contributed those amounts. That was the intent of the ordinance, it'sin the language of the ordinance and it's the been the consistentinterpretation of the city attorney's office.&quot;;    'Can't live by intent';  &quot;Idon't agree with her,&quot; said Fiscalini, basing his view on a legal opinion fromattorney Chuck Reed. &quot;We are advised that the intent of the city attorney'soffice was to prohibit this. But we can't live by intent. We have to live bythe letter of the ordinance.&quot;;    Fiscalini said his debt -- down somewhatfrom $110,580 at the end of 1990 -- is owed mostly to consultant Les Francis,advertising executive Peter Carter and himself.;    &quot;The language that we havein this ordinance is not clear,&quot; said Reed, who is considering running forcity council. &quot;Frank is entitled to do what the ordinance allows. If you wantto pass laws to tell people how they have to behave, you have to be specificand clear.&quot;;    The city's ordinance -- originally crafted in response to the1979 bribery indictment of former councilman Al Garza -- was rewritten mostrecently in June 1989 to reflect changes in state law by restricting donationsto a mayoral campaign to $500 per fiscal year.;    Because the primary andgeneral elections fall in different fiscal years, the maximum allowablecontribution to any candidate is really $1,000, if funds are given in twodifferent fiscal years.;    Although the state campaign law was overturnedlast September, in part because the fiscal-year provisions were deemed tofavor incumbents, San Jose's ordinance contains sections that counter thoseadvantages. Contributions must be raised for a specific office and may not beraised before July 1 of the year preceding the election. Also, in the&quot;off-years,&quot; incumbents may raise funds only for non-campaign officeholderexpenses or to retire debt.;    The debt retirement issue;  But a keyprovision of the ordinance -- aimed at preventing limitless solicitations orthe exercise of undue or improper influence over elected officials -- strictlyprohibits any officeholder or former candidate from using campaign debtretirement as a means of dodging the limitations.;    &quot;No debt retirementcontributions may be solicited or accepted from any contributor in excess ofthe amount which could have been collected from that contributor prior to theelection,&quot; states Section 2.21.160.;    In other words, said Gallo, Fiscalini&quot;can collect, as of July, from new donors -- those who didn't give $500 in theprimary or the general election. But once you hit $500 per election, you havegiven the maximum amount you are permitted to give.&quot;;     Reed voicesobjections; That's not what the ordinance says, Reed countered, noting thatthe law specifically uses fiscal years. &quot;I do not believe that this says youare limited to $500 per election.&quot; Even if a contributor gave $500 in theprimary and $500 in the general election, he could again donate $500 in thenew fiscal year, Reed argued.;    For several weeks, according to City Hallsources, rumors have been circulating that Mayor Susan Hammer, who herselffaced a campaign debt of $286,601 at the end of 1990, and other councilmembers were privately preparing to alter the campaign ordinance to permitpost-election contributions to retire debt.;    The effect of such a move,critics say privately, would be to eliminate campaign contribution limitsaltogether. But one Fiscalini supporter suggested that it was in hopes of sucha move by the council that the July dinner was planned.;    Aide scotchesrumors;  &quot;They're betting on it being legal after July 1,&quot; said this Fiscalinisupporter.;    Gary Robinson, the mayor's chief of staff, on Wednesdayscotched the rumors. The idea of changing the law was proposed to Hammer, hesaid, but &quot;there has been no discussion with other council members -- it's notin any shape or form beyond an idea. . . . We have no concrete plans to doanything with this.&quot;;    As for his interpretation of the law, Robinson, whowas Hammer's campaign manager, said, &quot;It's my understanding that there is a$500 limitation per election, per fiscal year.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PHILIP J.
