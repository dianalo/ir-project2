NBC News commentator John Chancellor, who moderated the seminar,said that since presidential candidates are spending public money _about $41 million each in 1988 _ ``we ought to have some say in howthey spend it.''   Jeff Greenfield, political and media adviser for ABC News,defended political advertising as admittedly ``a short and clumsyway to get to know a candidate. Yet even within those limits, youpick up something.''   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert on presidential politics fromthe University of Texas at Austin, suggested a nonpartisan panel beinstituted to review political advertising and rule on its fairnessand accuracy.   And while some may complain that the presidential campaign dragson, ``I don't know what you can do about the process being too longshort of legislating it and that would just drive it undergroundlike booze,'' he said.   Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee,suggested that allowing the political parties a bigger role inselecting candidates might produce more leaders on a par with thegreat presidents of years past.   ``There are people who believe when it comes to selectingcandidates for president, that you use participatory democracy toits fullest extent in a general election, but that there are otherways that parties ought to select candidates,'' Brown said.   ``Certainly no changes are going to be made by 1992, but itcertainly isnce because there are ``too many imponderables'' inmaking a successful campaign.   Brown said that negative campaigning was one of the factors thatturn people off and keep them away from the polls on Election Day.   Greenfield said he believed the role of television was ``vastlyexaggerated.'' Even with the skills of media gurus like Ailes,``you run the 1988 campaign with 10 percent unemployment and youhave a very different result,'' he predicted.   Greenfield, a former speech writer for Sen. Robert Kennedy, alsocriticized the level of public discourse the campaigns have reached.   ``Every time a candidate breaks through the puerility of thedebate,'' he said, ``whether it's Jesse Jackson and his `workingpoor' litany or George Bush's acceptance speech (at the Republicanconvention), you can feel the public almost come alive, say, `More,please give us more.' ''   At a later seminar Wednesday night, pollster Louis Harris saidhe believed that presidents should turn to public opinion pollsafter they confront the issues and make a decision.   But, he pointed out, ``our polling is either victimized or areflection of what is reported. There's no question about it. Andtelevision is the most powerful medium.''   CBS White House correspondent Lesley Stahl said television'scoverage of issues is dependent, like it or not, on the presidentpresenting them in a simplified manner.   ``If they want to communicate what their policies and theirthoughts and their decisions are to the American people overtelevision, they simply must learn how to simplify it,'' she said.   She also noted that Bush has not been getting his message out aswell as President Reagan or even as well as he did during thecampaign.   ``Presidents win support in these times not because the publicagrees with them on their ideology or their policies or onsubstantive issues, but because they come to like them overtelevision,'' she said.   ``Reagan became adored by the public because the White Housemanipulated very brilliantly'' the media with staged events andphoto opportunities, she said. Bush has not done that, she said,adding ``I kind of respect it but it's not doing him any good.''   The seminars at Fordham in Manhattan were part of the city'scommemoration of the bicentennial of George Washington'spresidential inauguration.</TEXT></DOC>
