Mr. Li has been under investigation for several months for suspected breaches of Hong Kong's Prevention of Bribery Ordinance. He was charged Thursday and appeared in court Friday.    The single charge alleges that Mr. Li, &quot;without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, accepted an advantage&quot; last May in the form of 1.1 million Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong) shares, allotted to him at 2.50 Hong Kong dollars (32 cents) each. He allegedly accepted the shares as &quot;an inducement or reward&quot; for facilitating the company's listing on the exchange.    No plea was taken. Another hearing was scheduled for April 14; Mr. Li remains free on bail, set at 10 million dollars ($1.3 million) after Mr. Li's initial arrest Jan. 2.    If convicted, Mr. Li could face maximum penalties of seven years in prison and a 500,000-dollar fine. The anti-bribery ordinance also empowers the courts to require that a convicted offender surrender whatever financial advantage he is deemed to have accepted illegally.    Mr. Li, 58 years old, was stock exchange chairman until his term expired Dec. 16. He didn't comment on the charge. </TEXT></DOC>
