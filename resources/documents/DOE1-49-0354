Gene transfer can be divided into twomain types: transfer of cloned genes and transfer of uncloned genes fromwhole genomic DNA. In this chapter the authors are concerned principallywith the transfer of uncloned DNA's. By uncloned whole genomic DNA meansDNA that is isolated from mammalian cells without being previously identifiedand purified by cloning in a bacterial plasmid or viral vector. Therecan be several goals in transferring uncloned whole genomic DNA. DNA-mediatedgene transfer (DMGT) can be used to gain information similar to thatobtained by the hybridization of somatic cells;that is, to gain informationabout dominance, or to study the genetic complementation of related phenotypes.Because in DMGT the authors are dealing with only one molecule, DNA,purified away from the other molecules and organelles of the cell, thissystem is significantly cleaner than traditional somatic cell hybridization.It adds conclusive proof that a trait is being transmitted through theDNA and not through other cellular molecules. The purpose of this chapteris to introduce the technique of DMGT by acquainting the reader withthe methodologies involved, the biological properties of transformation,the techniques for cloning genes via DMGT, and the future prospects ofDMGT, with special emphasis on the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell.</TEXT></DOC>
