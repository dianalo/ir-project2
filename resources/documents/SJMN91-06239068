THE FASTEST 100LEWIS FLASHES TO 9.86, REGAINS WORLD RECORD  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  World Track and Field Championships  </MEMO><TEXT>     Equally incredibly, two of the six broke the world record of 9.90 secondsset in June by Leroy Burrell.;   On Sunday, Burrell ran a 9.88. But Lewis waseven faster with a 9.86.;   &quot;To be 30 years old and to be able to run thefastest race of my life and put the best race of my career together in theworld championships means everything,&quot; Lewis said.;   Dennis Mitchell made aclean sweep for the United States by finishing third in 9.91 seconds. LinfordChristie of Great Britain ran fourth in 9.92. Frank Fredericks of Namibia wasfifth in 9.95 and Ray Stewart of Jamaica sixth in 9.96.;   As Burrell said,&quot;Who could have imagined anyone running the hundred in 9.96 seconds andfinishing sixth?&quot;;   &quot;I broke the world record and lost it in the same race.How many people can say that?&quot; Burrell asked.;   Lewis appeared to have ahorrible start and was no better than fifth at the midway point in the race.;  &quot;It looked like I had a terrible start, but I had a good start,&quot; Lewis said.&quot;The other guys got out so good (that) it just looked like I had a bad one.&quot;;  Lewis accelerated steadily, however, then maintained his top speed betterthan the others.;   &quot;I felt great at 60 meters, and I was still about fifth,&quot;Lewis said. &quot;At about 60 meters, I said to myself, 'I have a shot.' At 80meters, I thought I had a great shot. At 90 meters, I had cleared everybodybut Leroy, and I thought, 'I can win this.' &quot;;   Lewis caught Burrell at 90meters, seized the lead at 95 meters and won by perhaps a foot.;   Lewisimmediately threw his arms in the air, a picture of thanks or relief paintedon his face. A couple of strides past the finish, he turned back to see the9.86 on the scoreboard clock, leaped into the air and dropped his open palmsupon his head as emotion overcame him.;   He hugged Burrell and Mitchell, whogot a U.S. flag out of the stands and handed it to Lewis for his victory lap.;  Later, still emotional, Lewis told an interviewer, &quot;I want to tell myfather, this one's for him.&quot;;   Lewis' father, William, died of cancer in1987.;   Lewis ran in lane 5, two lanes to the right of Burrell. Burrell islegally blind in his right eye and never really saw Lewis during the race.;  &quot;I thought I had the race in hand toward the finish line,&quot; Burrell said,noting his vision problem. &quot;But once I crossed the finish line, I realizedthat that was not the case.&quot;;   Burrell said, &quot;I could have run a littlefaster if I hadn't tried to lean at the end, but I got a little desperate.&quot;;  From 1983-87, the world record of 9.93 had belonged to American Calvin Smith.Then Canadian Ben Johnson upset Lewis in the final of the 1987 worldchampionships with a world-record 9.83 in Rome. A year later in the Olympicsfinal, Johnson again won in a world-record time of 9.79; Lewis ran second in9.92.;   But when Johnson tested positive for steroids after that race, helost his gold medal, and the International Amateur Athletics Federationrefused to recognize the 9.79 as a record. When Johnson later admitted that hehad been using steroids at the time of the '87 world championships, he alsowas stripped of that record.;   On Sunday, Johnson, struggling to make adrug-free comeback, watched from the stands.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Dallas Morning News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Tokyo  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910826  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  733  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, August 26, 199100239068,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
