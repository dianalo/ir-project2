Abrar, the Farsi-language paper, did not mention a condition setby the English-language Tehran Times on Tuesday: freeing billionsof dollars in Iranian assets the United States froze a decade ago.   President Bush said Tuesday the assets, which include arms andmilitary equipment ordered before the fundamentalist Shiiterevolution, could not be linked to the hostage issue. SixteenWestern captives are held in Lebanon, including eight Americans.   Kayhan, another Iranian daily, said Wednesday that Iran wouldrather ``wash its hands'' of its assets than compromise its``ideological principles,'' the official Islamic Republic NewsAgency reported.   It quoted Abrar as saying: ``Iran has repeatedly announced itsreadiness to exert its influence ... to help solve the hostageissue in response to any sign of goodwill by the West.''   The four Iranians are believed to have been killed when theydisappeared in 1982.   President Hashemi Rafsanjani is seen as a pragmatist who wantsimproved relations with the West as a means of getting help torebuild from the eight-year war with Iraq. He is opposed by theradical faction of Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, to whichcompromise with the West is anathema.   In the past, Rafsanjani has linked hostage releases the threeIranians and a Lebanese driver with an Iranian passport who werekidnapped by Christian militiamen in north Lebanon in July 1982.   All four are believed dead. Iran Iran wants the caseinvestigated and publicized to show it, too, has been a victim ofkidnappers.   Israel kidnapped Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, 33, from his home insouthern Lebanon on July 28. It has offered to trade him and theestimated 300-400 Shiite prisoners it holds for three 3 Israelisoldiers held in Lebanon and the Western hostages.</TEXT></DOC>
