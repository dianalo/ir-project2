A product of the Los Angeles barrio, Sarah Flores went towork as a secretary at age 17. She rose through the ranks tobecome a $63,000-a-year aide to a Los Angeles countysupervisor. Last June, she stood for election to become thefirst Hispanic elected to the Board of Supervisors, whichoversees a $10 billion budget. She placed first in theprimary and was favored to defeat a conservative Anglo judgein the runoff. The day before the primary, a federal judgemade her first-place showing meaningless.</LP><TEXT>   In response to a lawsuit from the local ACLU and a liberalHispanic legal group, Judge David Kenyon declared theexisting districts invalid on the Alice-in-Wonderland groundsthat &quot;an Hispanic is unable to be elected to the board&quot; underthem.   He ordered new district lines be adopted and a newelection held this month. The new lines were drawn by theliberal Hispanic lawyers who had filed the lawsuit. The factthat Mrs. Flores is Hispanic, that the district she had runin was 47% Hispanic and that she had won two-thirds of theHispanic vote was apparently of little interest to JudgeKenyon. The central political fact was this: To liberalcivil-rights groups Mrs. Flores was the wrong kind ofHispanic.   As a Republican, she wasn't &quot;politically correct.&quot; Worse,if Sarah Flores could demonstrate that an Hispanic with herpolitics was electable, she'd become a role model for otherindependent-minded Hispanics who might want to escape theliberal establishment's thought police.   The new district excluded Mrs. Flores's own home andpolitical base. Since the judge had demanded a 71% Hispanicdistrict, its boundaries -- shown nearby -- were morecontorted than those of the old district (see accompanyingillustration -- WSJ Jan. 29, 1991). Many called it the&quot;Poodle District.&quot; More than half of the old district's 1.9million residents weren't in the new district. (They are nowrepresented by a supervisor they never voted for.) Theliberal groups got what they wanteda gerrymandered districtwhere 67% of voters were Democrats, instead of only 50%.   In the event, Mrs. Flores actually won the half of thedistrict that wasn't new to her. But in the other half shesplit the non-liberal vote with a moderate Democratic statesenator, and placed third overall with 20%. Ironically, anabysmally low voter turnout meant that the 79,000 votes castin the new district were barely more than the 74,000 votesSarah Flores had won by herself in the old district. A runoffbetween two longtime Hispanic wheel horses in the DemocraticParty machine will be held next month.   Most media reports on the Flores case intoned that it wasabout &quot;civil rights.&quot; In fact, it reeked of partisanpolitics. The original supervisorial districts had beengerrymandered to protect incumbents of both parties. Thecivil-rights lawsuit to invalidate them on the grounds ofdiscrimination was brought by liberals only in 1988 -- sevenyears after the lines were drawn. By then, logic would havedictated that they wait and draw a new, more Hispanic seatafter the 1990 census or that the Board of Supervisors beexpanded from five to seven members, something the boardwould have agreed to.   But the Voting Rights Act, as currently designed, more orless mandates the creation of minority districts to theexclusion of all other relevant factors. It presumes thatminority voters must be represented by other minorities andthat ethnic considerations should be the most importantelement in politics. Republicans often go along with thisspoils system because by concentrating minority voters itmakes it easier for them to win suburban seats. This kind ofracial gerrymandering serves only to reward politicalmachines and drive people apart.   It is often said that the abuses of either racial orpolitical gerrymandering will never become a hot politicalissue; such abuses are &quot;inside baseball.&quot; But as the nationprepares to redraw hundreds of congressional seats andthousands of seats in state legislatures, it's time voterswoke up. Political machines will stack the electoral deck,and there will be judges willing to legitimize the game. Ifyou don't believe it, ask Sarah Flores and the 74,000 peoplewho wanted her as their supervisor.</TEXT></DOC>
