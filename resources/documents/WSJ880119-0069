The withdrawal is certainly no help to NATO, but it'd be less troubling if it inspired NATO governments to get serious about how they're going to continue to deter an attack. With the Senate about to debate the INF treaty that removes Pershing missiles from Europe's defense, now is the time to get serious.    The loss of the jets from Spain is important both as substance and symbolism. In the event of an attack, the planes would have backed up fighters in Italy and Turkey; now it isn't clear where they'll go. Both Spain and the State Department are stressing that the U.S. will retain access to other installations in Spain, but that can't compensate for the spectacle of a NATO country giving the boot to an ally's best aircraft. The message this sends to the East is that another European government would rather play nationalist politics than maintain an adequate deterrent.    Western strategists are already pressing for new arms talks to reduce the Warsaw Pact's substantial edge in conventional forces -- 2.5 to 1 in tanks, 3 to 1 in artillery and combat helicopters, and even more in troops, but the Soviets aren't likely to give up anything when NATO is content to give up F-16s on its own. Nor can we recall the last time the Soviets removed forces from Europe simply because the Czechs or Poles asked them to.    More than arms control, NATO needs a strategy to modernize and improve its deterrent. One of the better ideas we've seen so far is the NATO Defense Initiative (NDI) being promoted around Washington by Senator Dan Quayle, a Republican member of the Armed Services Committee. Senator Quayle is proposing a 15-year effort, launched by the U.S. but supported in Europe, to upgrade both conventional and nuclear NATO forces. The project wouldn't necessarily require any new spending but over the years it would demand that the services redirect some of what they spend now.    On the conventional side, NDI would stress better air defenses, longer-range artillery, and, above all, cruise missiles (short- and long-range). The idea is to improve NATO's ability to disrupt any breakthrough of its forward defenses -- by striking bridges, rail lines and other choke points -- and to strike deep inside Warsaw Pact defenses and supply lines.    With the Pershings gone, Senator Quayle also proposes to modernize NATO's theater nuclear weapons -- both to deter the Soviets from using them first and to deter advancing forces from massing together. These weapons should be more accurate and have a longer range than NATO's current battlefield nukes, so they could be used in Warsaw Pact, not NATO, territory, and would do less collateral damage.    Importantly, Senator Quayle's NDI seems to fit well into the overall strategy presented to President Reagan last week by his commission on long-term Western defense. That strategy calls for a flexible, mobile force that doesn't have to &quot;go nuclear&quot; as soon as the East's forces advance. The fact that serious people in the U.S. are thinking about such things is encouraging news for NATO. A sustained commitment to developing these new approaches will be necessary to compensate for events such as the F-16s' departure from Spain. </TEXT></DOC>
