And if the trade news is less positive, currency analysts and traders say, the past week's rises in U.S. interest rates will probably limit the currency's fall.    If the June U.S. merchandise trade deficit is substantially narrower than May's seasonally adjusted $10.93 billion, &quot;there's no way they'll be able to hold (the dollar) at 1.90 marks,&quot; says Thomas Benfer, a foreign exchange marketing representative for Bank of Montreal's New York branch.    He says major central banks are apparently comfortable with a dollar range of about 1.80 to 1.90 marks at this time. But he says the U.S. currency could be pushed to 1.95 marks by favorable trade data.    However, many economists and currency traders seem to have doubts that the trade data will be that positive, and West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said Thursday that a dollar higher than 1.90 marks could have a negative impact on the West German economy.    Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report generally believe that the June trade gap held steady at around May's level. Some traders say speculation about a wider trade gap of as much as $13 billion has filtered through the markets.    Because of this sentiment and West German opposition to a higher dollar, sentiment about the currency ahead of the trade report is &quot;mixed to slightly bearish,&quot; according to Jack Adkins, a Refco Group Ltd. currency analyst.    In late New York trading Friday, the dollar stood at 1.8825 marks and 133.28 yen, off from 1.8950 marks and 133.88 yen a week earlier. In trading Monday in Tokyo, the U.S. currency opened at 132.73 yen. It traded as high as 1.9260 marks and 135.20 yen last week after the Federal Reserve raised its discount rate, the rate it charges on loans to financial institutions, to 6 1/2% from 6%.    However, neither that move nor the subsequent half-point rise in U.S. prime lending rates to 10% could counter the currency market's fears that the Group of Seven major industrial nations -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- believe the dollar is becoming too strong.    Still, market participants say the firmer U.S. interest rates will lend support to the dollar if tomorrow's report shows that the trade gap widened in June.    Mr. Adkins says he believes a substantially larger deficit would send the dollar down moderately to 1.84 or 1.85 marks and 129 yen.    In addition to the trade deficit itself, currency analysts say, there will be considerable interest in the figures on U.S. imports for June.    Arthur Greco, managing director of Rinfret Futures in New York, says there are concerns that a strong U.S. economy &quot;will lead to consumption that will cause the trade deficit to go back out again.&quot;    Although there is some concern that the trade gap may already be about as narrow as it's going to get this year, a number of economists see it leveling off and possibly shrinking further in coming months.    Aside from the trade picture, the market will be closely monitoring interest rates abroad this week. West German analysts say the Bundesbank may raise its 3% discount rate and 5% Lombard rate by a half-point as early as Aug. 25, when the central bank's council convenes after a four-week recess.    There also is widespread speculation that the Bank of Japan will raise its 2.5% discount rate, although a move is not generally thought to be imminent.    In Britain, analysts say, interest rates may stay stable for now. But the base lending rate, currently 11%, is still considered more likely to rise than to fall when it moves next.    Although higher rates abroad could slow the dollar, Mr. Greco says the currency is supported by a belief that further U.S. rate increases &quot;will outweigh theirs.&quot;    On the New York Commodity Exchange Friday, gold for current delivery settled at $431.30 an ounce, up $2. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.3 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Monday, gold's price was quoted at $431.70 an ounce.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Friday, Aug. 12, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
