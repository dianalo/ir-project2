Section 1116 of the Social Security Act and 45 CFR Parts 201 and 213 establishDepartment procedures that provide an administrative hearing for reconsiderationof a disapproval of a State plan or plan amendment. HCFA is required topublish is copy of the notice to a State Medicaid Agency that informs theagency of the time and place of the hearing and the issues to be considered.(If we subsequently notify the agency of additional issues which will beconsidered at the hearing, we will also publish that information in a notice.)Any individual or group that wants to participate in the hearing as a partymust petition the Hearing Officer within 15 days after publication of thisnotice, in accordance with the requirements contained in 45 CFR 213.15(b)(2).Any interested person or organization that wants to participate as amicuscuriae must petition the Hearing Officer before the hearing begins in accordancewith the requirements contained in 45 CFR 213.15(c)(1). If the hearing is later rescheduled, the Hearing Officer will notify allparticipants. The issues in this matter are: (1) Whether California's proposed plan amendmentviolates section 1902(a)(17)(B) of the Social Security Act (the Act) becausemaking payment would not take into account all resources available to therecipient; (2) whether California's proposed plan amendment violates Medicaidstatute and regulatory requirements at 42 CFR 433.139 regarding third-partyliability which require cost avoidance rather than expenditure recovery;(3) whether California's proposed plan amendment violates section 1915(g)of the Act by inappropriately including non-case management costs (Departmentof Developmental Services costs) in the rate to be paid for case managementservices; and (4) whether California's proposed plan amendment violatesregulations at 42 CFR 447.325 by making payments in excess of the upperlimits on payment. Califorina submitted State plan amendment 87-15 to provide targeted casemanagement services to the developmentally disabled. The Health Care FinancingAdministration (HCFA) determined that the amendment must be disapprovedbecause it violated statutory and regulatory requirements for the 4 reasonscited above as well as for 2 other reasons: (1) The amendment would makeduplicate payment for case management services provided to residents ofintermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded (ICFs/MR) and (2)the amendment would violate freedom of choice requirements at section 1902(a)(23)of the Act. On the last day of the 90-day statutory review period the Statetelecopied to HCFA a revised amendment. This revised version continuedto be at variance with the statute and regulations and did not alter thedisapproval of the amendment. However, HCFA has determined, based on thatinformation, that the two bases of disapproval related to duplicate paymentsfor case management services provided residents of ICFs/MR and freedomof choice are no longer an issue. The notice to California announcing an administrative hearing to reconsiderthe remaining 4 issues in the disapproval of the plan amendment reads asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="26">Ms. Diane Shell Campbell,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T3>Deputy Director and Chief Counsel,</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T3>Department of Health Services,</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T3>California Health and Welfare Agency,</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T3>714/744 P Street,</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T3>Sacramento, California 95814.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dear Ms. Campbell: I am advising you that your request for reconsiderationof the decision to disapprove California State Plan Amendment 87-15 wasreceived on August 22, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">California State Plan Amendment 87-15 would provide targeted casemanagement services to the developmentally disabled. You have asked fora reconsideration of the 6 bases for disapproval contained in my letterof August 5, 1988. Based on our review of the revised amendment you telecopiedto the Health Care Financing Administration on August 5, we believe ourconcerns related to duplication of payment for case management servicesprovided to residents of intermediate care facilities for the mentallyretarded (ICFs/MR) and freedom of choice have been resolved. The remainingbases for disapproval have not been adequately addressed by the revisedamendment. Accordingly, I am granting your request for a reconsiderationon the 4 remaining issues.
