Pakistani defense officials said the Afghan plane was on abombing raid and that it was the third time Soviet-built aircraftwith Afghan markings have bombed Pakistani territory in the pastweek.   The Kabul government has denied the accusations and accusedPakistan of sending a reconnaissance plane over its territory.   Pakistani officials said today they still did not know the fateor nationality of the pilot who apparently ejected when a PakistanAir Force F-16 shot him down Wednesday near Nawagai, about 12 milesfrom the Afghan border.   The Defense Ministry said four planes, believed to be MiG-23s,were intercepted by a Pakistani air patrol after they had bombedtwo locations across the border, injuring 12 people.   Afghan planes, which in the past have only darted over theborder to bomb Afghan rebel and refugee camps, struck more than 30miles into Pakistani territory on Sept. 1 and 5.   The Foreign Ministry lodged strong protests, telling Kabul``that if such attacks do not cease the entire responsibility forthe serious consequences will rest on the Kabul authorities.''   Afghanistan's Marxist government called the Pakistaniallegations ``lies.''   Kabul's Foreign Ministry countered on Wednesday by claiming thata Pakistani Air Force jet had ``intruded into Afghan airspace andcarried out a reconnaissance flight.''   At least four Afghan or Soviet aircraft have been shot down overPakistani territory since Moslem insurgents began battling thegovernment in 1978.   On Aug. 4, Pakistan shot down an intruding Soviet Su-25fighter-bomber near the border. The Soviet pilot was handed over tohis embassy in Islamabad on Aug. 17.   Defense Minister Mahmood Haroon told the Senate on Wednesdaythat Pakistan still was seeking to acquire a sophisticated airborneearly warning radar system to protect its rugged frontier regionwhere ground-based radar is blinded by high mountain peaks.   Islamabad has approached Washington about two different airplatform systems but has not filed a formal request.   U.S. government officials reportedly have stalled Pakistan forfear the systems might escalate tensions with Afghanistan on thewest and India to the east.   Moscow and Kabul accuse Pakistan of violating the April 14Soviet pullout accord by continuing to supply the rebels withmainly American arms. But under the pact, the superpowers tacitlyagreed to continue aiding their respective sides until one of themstops.   The result has been an escalation of guerrilla attacks as theSoviets turn the war increasingly over to Afghanistan's demoralizedarmy.   September's bold air strikes appear to be testing Islamabad'sresolve following the death last month of the guerrilla's sponsor,President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.   Meanwhile, in Nicosia, Cyprus, the United Nations mediator forAfghanistan reported today that more than half the estimated115,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan have pulled out and thewithdrawal is proceeding ``in a very satisfactory manner.''   The envoy, Diego Cordovez, told reporters during the non-alignedmovement's foreign ministers conference, that about 80 percent ofAfghan territory ``has no foreign troops any more.''   But he added that the Soviet withdrawal has not yet resulted in``any significant return'' of the millions of Afghan refugees whofled to neighboring countries during the nine-year Sovietoccupation.</TEXT></DOC>
