Perry and Ellen Hume (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> NEW ORLEANS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   As the Republicans open their national convention today, one question dominates all the rest: Who is George Bush's running mate?    But only Mr. Bush knows, and he isn't saying, in hopes of keeping some suspense in a convention that is being carefully stage-managed to say a nostalgic goodbye to President Reagan and to introduce to the nation a more forceful George Bush. The Bush managers insist they won't disclose the identity of Mr. Bush's running mate until Thursday morning.    Today is set aside as Mr. Reagan's final moment as the man who has won the hearts of the Grand Old Party in his seven-and-a-half years in the White House. He arrived here last night to prepare for his farewell speech tonight. The sentimental evening will include a tribute from his wife, Nancy, and a film about his years as president.    At a rally following his arrival, Mr. Reagan told a cheering crowd that the Democratic Party still is led by ardent liberals &quot;who think the Sugar Bowl is in Washington -- and known as the U.S. Treasury.&quot;    But even if the election is based on competence, and not ideology, George Bush easily wins the battle of resumes, the president declared. Mr. Bush, he said, &quot;has it all.&quot;    It will be the liberals that the voters &quot;take out behind the barn&quot; in November, the president said. Voters &quot;should say no&quot; to liberal Democrats, Mr. Reagan said, &quot;and say yes to George Bush and a new Congress.&quot; He said he supported Mr. Bush &quot;with every fiber of my being&quot; in a campaign he said was, in fact, &quot;a crusade.&quot;    He said: &quot;America needs the strength, the vision and the true grit of George Bush.&quot;    The Democratic convention in Atlanta, Mr. Reagan said, was a sham -- &quot;one of the most artful dodges in American history. . . .the biggest masquerade since last year's Mardi Gras here in New Orleans.&quot;    He and Mr. Bush will link up at a nearby naval air station tomorrow as Mr. Reagan heads to California for a vacation and Mr. Bush arrives in New Orleans. From that moment on, this will be Mr. Bush's convention, a crucial time for the vice president as he attempts to establish his own identity and move out from under the shadow of Mr. Reagan.    &quot;I know what I am and I want to try to convey that,&quot; Mr. Bush told Dan Rather in a CBS News interview broadcast Saturday night. &quot;And I know what I'm not. I'm not William Jennings Bryan.&quot;    In the same interview, Mr. Bush hinted at the emphasis that will be given all this week on so-called family values. &quot;I think I'm motivated by family values, by faith, and I think it will become clear over this campaign who the real George Bush is,&quot; the vice president said.    Mr. Bush's wife, Barbara, taking part in the same interview, said her husband is &quot;the most decent, honorable, caring, certainly the most beloved human being, I think.&quot;    In another interview, on ABC News with Sander Vanocur yesterday, Mr. Bush discussed economic policy. He said there's some room to maneuver in the federal budget &quot;if the GNP (gross national product) continues to increase at 2.8% and we keep inflation in the 4% range. . . .So there is room for flexibility but there's not room for reckless spending.&quot;    Appearing on NBC's Meet the Press, Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, one of a dozen or more politicians who have been mentioned as possible running mates, said he has asked Mr. Bush not to consider him for the spot. &quot;I've had a very checkered career,&quot; he said.    Mr. Simpson added that the next president &quot;is going to have to do something in that area&quot; -- raising taxes -- &quot;or we'll be off the wall.&quot;    NBC's Tom Brokaw interrupted:&quot;But Vice President Bush says he will not raise taxes.&quot;    &quot;I know,&quot; said Mr. Simpson, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, &quot;but we'll wait for the (National Economic) commission to come in. . . .&quot; with recommendations on how to reduce the federal budget deficit.    With Mr. Simpson declaring himself out of the race, the short list, according to some reports, included: Kansas' Sen. Robert Dole, Senate minority leader; Rep. Jack Kemp of New York; Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana; former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, and Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico.    Sen. Dole and Rep. Kemp, both of whom sought this nomination, are the heavy hitters on the list -- the two best-known figures.    Choosing one or the other is more a political choice than a personal one. Sen. Dole is widely known in the party and is no more an ideologue than Mr. Bush -- but he is testy and has said unkind things about Mr. Bush.    On ABC's &quot;This Week with David Brinkley,&quot; Sen. Dole, 65 years old, sought to make amends by lavishing praise on his former rival: &quot;I've learned about his strengths that I hadn't thought about before.&quot; Sen. Dole would help the ticket, especially in the Midwest. But if the vice president is serious about his desire to pick a running mate who would be loyal and personally compatible, that would certainly work against Sen. Dole.    Conservatives support Mr. Kemp and the lesser-known Sen. Quayle.    Mr. Kemp, one of the founders of President Reagan's brand of supply-side, tax-cutting economics, is an energetic campaigner who looks younger than his 53 years and is a national figure. But he probably couldn't help the ticket sufficiently in his native New York state, and Mr. Bush never has been personally comfortable with politicians such as Rep. Kemp who are so wrapped up in ideas.    Those are the easy choices. The others aren't so well known, and may appear to be riskier.    Sen. Quayle is only 41 years old. In the words of Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire: &quot;He's almost a movement conservative, close enough.&quot; He may be a younger version of Jack Kemp, but he's untested nationally and some GOP strategists wonder if he's up to the task.    Sen. Domenici, 56, is Roman Catholic, Italian-American, with a proven following among Hispanics in his home state of New Mexico. More than most, he has a common touch. For years, he took the subway to work in Washington -- a nice parallel with Democrat Michael Dukakis, a Boston subway rider. But in the past he has advocated tax increases and cuts in Social Security benefits, two positions that Mr. Bush says are unacceptable.    Elizabeth Dole, 52, Sen. Dole's wife, is a first-class campaigner -- but she received poor marks from many for her performance as Secretary of Transportation. A woman on the ticket, some say, would help Mr. Bush, who does poorly among women voters in public-opinion polls, but such a move might backfire and be seen more as an admission of weakness.    Then, finally, there is that category called &quot;somebody else.&quot; Mr. Bush is keeping his ideas to himself, and he's the only one who knows how short or long his list really is. </TEXT></DOC>
