Lotus has sold the product directly only to about 79 largecorporations, for $62,500 for a 200-user license.andM;Despite all the hoopla, Notes has contributed little to Lotus' bottom line.andO;It accounted for only 1 percent of sales in the last fiscal year ended June30, 1990, said Mary McCaffrey, analyst at New York brokerage C.J.andP;  Lawrence,Morgan, Grenfell Inc.andP;  Notes sales will triple this year, said McCaffrey, butwill still only account for about 2.5 percent of Lotus' annual sales.andM;&quot;It's a small amount of revenue, but Lotus is out ahead of the client/servermarket.andP;  They are learning how to sell, service and support a completelydifferent type of software,&quot; she said.andM;Users agree that Notes must have a stronger support system for both end usersand VARs if it is going to be successful.andM;&quot;Lotus has provided a very nice development environment with Notes,&quot; saidDharen Rao, a senior manager at accounting firm Price Waterhouse in SanFrancisco, one of the first companies to use Notes.andP;  &quot;But it is a verycomplex system, so you need significant support.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
