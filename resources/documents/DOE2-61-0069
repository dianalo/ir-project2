Specifically, a microstructural study is being madein an attempt to define extrinsic and intrinsic factors that controlfracture and thus influence properties. One of the more important productsproduced by ACMC from SiCw/Al composites has been the rolled sheet. Theresponse of the material to secondary processing and thermo-mechanicaltreatment is of utmost importance with respect to material quality. Thepresent study emphasizes microstructural-mechanical property characterizationof the rolled material.</TEXT></DOC>
