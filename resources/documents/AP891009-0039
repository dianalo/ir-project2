STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   East German authorities tried and sentenced tojail many of the hundreds of protesters arrested during weekendanti-government demonstrations in a half-dozen cities, West Germantelevision said today.   Meanwhile, East Germany began letting Western tourists back intoEast Berlin after keeping them out since Thursday during ceremoniesmarking the state's 40th anniversary, West Berlin officials said.   On Sunday, riot police used clubs and dogs to attack thousandsof demonstrators rallying for democratic reform outside an EastBerlin church in a second day of protests against their Communistgovernment's intransigence.   The peaceful protesters shouted ``We want freedom'' and ``Noviolence,'' as security forces broke up a sit-in after a vigil atthe Protestant Gethsemane Church, beating demonstrators and chasingthem into side streets.   Police seized between 30 and 100 people, according to HessischeRundfunk radio in Frankfurt. Several people were injured.   The latest arrests came after hundreds were detained in protestsSaturday in East Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden, Jena, Potsdam andPlauen. Some estimates put the number arrested at more than 1,000in East Berlin alone.   ``Many of those arrested have been given summary trials andsentenced to prison terms of up to six months,'' West Germany's ARDtelevision said today. It did not give a more precise estimate.   ARD said demonstrations had also occurred in Karl-Marx Stadt.   East German officials gave no reports of arrests or injuries.   As it marks its 40th anniversary, East Germany is in the throesof the most serious street demonstrations since Soviet tanks andtroops put down a workers' revolt in 1953.   This time, however, the demonstrators are looking to the SovietUnion as a model of liberal reform.   On Sunday, West German television showed Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev saying that many East Germans have ``strongsympathy'' for his liberalizing of the Soviet political system andeconomy.   He said democratic changes in the Communist world were the maintopic of his talks Saturday with East Germany's 77-year-oldhard-line leader, Erich Honecker. Gorbachev returned to MoscowSaturday after spending two days in East Berling for anniversarycelebrations.   Sunday night's violence in East Berlin began when riot policebeat protesters as they left the Church, where about 5,000 peoplehad gathered for a vigil.   After negotiations between church officials and police, mostprotesters left, but some joined 2,000 others who were staging asit-in nearby on Schoenhauser Allee street.   Police used clubs and trucks with steel-mesh barriers welded tothe front to chase the protesters into side streets, witnesses said.   One man who watched the violence from his apartment window said,``It's getting worse and worse. Someday soon, rocks and Molotovcocktails are going to fly.''   East Germany's official ADN news agency accused Western newsmedia of aiding the weekend protests, calling the demonstrators``troublemakers.''   Authorities refused to renew the visas of dozens of Westernjournalists who were in East Berlin for the anniversaryfestivities. Reporters were told to leave the city when their visasexpired at midnight Sunday.   West Germany's ZDF television network on Sunday showed aninterview that Gorbachev apparently gave Soviet televisionimmediately after his meeting with Honecker.   ``After many talks I have the impression that the GermanDemocratic Republic's citizens, the veterans, the middle-aged andespecially the young, have strong sympathy for our perestroikapolicy,'' he said referring to the Soviet Union's reform program.``These are fiery fans, there is strong support.''   East Germans are considering ``what to change and improve, notonly in the economy and in social respects, but also in thepolitical and societal institutions,'' Gorbachev was quoted assaying.   Gorbachev's reform policies have made him popular among manyEast Germans. Protesters chanted his name and called for hissupport during his visit.   The anniversary celebrations were to illustrate the success ofCommunism in East Germany, which despite being a tightly controlledsociety is in better economic shape than its East bloc partners.   Instead, world attention focused on the protests, which were inpart stirred by an exodus of about 50,000 disgruntled East Germansthrough Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary since Sept. 10, whenBudapest opened its border with Austria.   Despite the growing unrest and exodus to the West, Honeckerreportedly told Gorbachev he would stick to his conservative course.   Hundreds of injuries were reported as police swinging truncheonsrepeatedly charged demonstrators in the capital Saturday and earlySunday.   Police punched, kicked, beat and dragged away the protesters,roughing up Western journalists as well. At least two Westernreporters were detained in separate incidents for six hours.   Also Sunday, activists demanding reform said they had formed aSocial Democratic Party to promote a ``rigorous democratization ofstate and society.'' The party's charter was signed by 43 people inSchwante, near Berlin.   The Communist government recently banned a prominent reformgroup, New Forum. The group says its membership has grown from theoriginal 30 members to more than 11,000.</TEXT></DOC>
