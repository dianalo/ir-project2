Norwaydoes not consume any of its very large gas reserves; it exports all ofits production. Norwegian gas is costly to develop. In the several decadesahead, gas from its northern areas will be very expensive at the &quot;burnertip&quot; compared to Dutch, Soviet, and possibly Algerian competition. Norwaywill be able to meet the market price from high-cost production only(1) if it, in effect, subsidizes the cost or (2) is able to charge Europeanbuyers a &quot;security premium.&quot; The author confronts these choices and discussesfor us the issues and options which confront Norway as a producer whoseexport market is the United Kingdom or on the European continent; thereare no other large opportunities. She reargues the issue of securitybut she does it from the Norwegian perspective. It has been the U.S.view since 1982 that Norwegian gas is an available, secure alternativeto additional Soviet gas exports to Europe. The issue of expense hasnot been so directly addressed by the U.S. government. There is a casefor a security premium without which the great gas reserves of northernoffshore Norway may be too long delayed. The author warns us how muchtime is needed from an importer's decision to buy to the developmentof the fields and the logistic system.</TEXT></DOC>
