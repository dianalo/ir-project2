(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tests show that a day-care centerowner accused of possessing child pornography does not have asexually transmitted disease found in three children who attendedhis preschool, police said Friday.   John W. Shaver, who faces felony charges of possessing childpornography and procuring the sexual performance of a child, iscurrently free on $75,000 bond. He was given a venereal testWednesday as part of the conditions for his release from jail.   ``We're trying to determine the source of that infection, and sofar, we have not,'' said police spokesman Ott Cefkin. ``At the timethat they took a sample from Mr. Shaver, that was a few days ago,it was negative (for the disease).''   Shaver, 56, was charged last month with possessing childpornography after authorities discovered 3,200 photos of nude andsemi-nude children at his home. Twenty children from Shaver'spreschool were identified in the photos, police said.   On Tuesday, police added 24 counts of procuring the sexualperformance of a child. The new charges involve allegedlypornographic photo montages found in Shaver's home that combinepictures of preschoolers with nude pictures from magazines.   None of the charges against Shaver relate to any known physicalcontact with children, and police have found no evidence thatchildren at the center were sexually abused, Cefkin said.   The court-ordered test of Shaver was made after policediscovered gonorrhea in throat cultures of three children whoattended Shaver's Rainbow Learning Center.   ``You have to look at everybody that had contact with thesechildren,'' Cefkin added. ``As far as Mr. Shaver is converned, theyattended his day-care center and this seems to be the only commonlink among the three.''   Shaver's attorney, J. David Bogenschutz, said the negativeresult from the Broward County Health Department would help toexonerate his client.   ``It means that three children have been found, at least as faras we know from the testing, to be positive, and my client has beennegative.''   The three children were treated for the disease. Gonorrhea canbe cured with penicillin or other antibiotics.   The county's Sexual Assault Treatment Center tested children whoattended the Fort Lauderdale preschool after police said they foundnude photographs of children at Shaver's home. Medical tests on allthe children have not been completed, Cefkin said.   Cefkin said he did not know of anyone else being tested forgonorrhea in connection with the police investigation into whetherchildren at the center were sexually abused.   About 200 children have attended Shaver's preschool since itsopening in 1985. County officials closed it down this month as thepolice investigation widened.   Shaver operated a day-care center in Hawaii before opening theRainbow Learning Center. But Hawaiian officials stripped his statelicense amid allegations that he fondled children in his care. Nocriminal charges were filed in that case.</TEXT></DOC>
