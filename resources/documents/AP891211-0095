(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Henry Sudduth's life started off bad andgot worse, but the pudgy, white-bearded, balding man said withoutthose experiences he couldn't do what he does best _ be Santa Claus.   Sudduth was an abused child and spent time in an outlawmotorcycle gang before a stint in the Marines and marriage helpedturn his life around. He's spent the last 14 years as ``Madison'sSanta Claus,'' refurbishing and distributing toys to needy children.   ``The kids let me into their lives every day,'' he said. ``Theycan relate to me. I know what they're going through. I have notbeen Mr. Lily White, but every bit of it gave me a deep knowledgeof children I'll never forget.''   The 55-year-old Sudduth, who also works as an apartment manager,works year-round with a group of volunteer elves to collect andrepair old toys in his workshop and distribute them to needychildren.   Although he never stops being Santa, the holidays _ obviously _are his busiest time of year.   ``When Christmas comes, I lose track of everything,'' he said.   But Sudduth, who doesn't need pillows or a false beard to looklike Santa, said this Christmas holds special meaning.   ``I'm just thankful to be alive,'' he said, his eyes squintingand his red, round cheeks jiggling with each giggle. ``And I'mthankful for all these fantastic people in this town. They blew meaway when I was in the hospital.''   Sudduth suffered a brain aneurysm in November 1988 that left himin the hospital for three weeks and required surgery.   When residents discovered Sudduth did not have health insurancethey started a ``Get Well Santa'' fund and raised more than $41,000.   ``The people came through for someone in need, just like he doesevery day for people in need,'' said Don Dahnke, owner of Don'sHallmark, who donated space for Santa's workshop.   Dahnke said his suppliers of toys, stuffed animals and candyused to think he was joking when he told them about Sudduth andasked for donations but ``they don't think it's a joke anymore.''   Sudduth's network of thousands of volunteers reaches acrossWisconsin and throughout the nation, but even if he had no help, hewould still be giving, friends said.   ``I know he's gone down to $2 in his checkbook to make surepeople would have a Christmas dinner,'' Dahnke said.   Sudduth refuses to accept money for being Santa, saying ``youcan't give to those who give.''   He used to hang uncashed checks on his walls and he has a frameof them in his crowded workshop, including a blank one made out to``Mr. S. Claus.''   Sudduth drives a 1972 Dodge with a holiday-style paint job andhugs everyone he meets _ something he hasn't always done.   ``I was a very abused child,'' he said, with his usually jollyvoice turning solemn. ``I equated that violence with love, and Ithought I was spreading that love with violence.''   Sudduth, whose mother died of cancer when he was 14, said hespent time in California as the president of a motorcycle gangbefore moving to the Midwest.   ``I went there looking for brotherhood and love,'' he said.``But it wasn't there. It's not anywhere but in your heart. Ididn't know that then, but I do now.''   Sudduth's wife, Kathy, has long, wavy hair parted in the middle,wears round, metal-framed glasses and is often called ``Mrs.Claus.'' Mr. Claus says she turned his life around.   Sudduth did not choose his first Santa assignment 32 years ago;he was drafted. He was a Marine staff sergeant and was pulled outof his barracks to play Santa ``because they needed someone fat.''</TEXT></DOC>
