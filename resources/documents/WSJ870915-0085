A retired four-star general, recalling the mood of those who favored rule by the gun, likens it to that of a &quot;waiting, hungry tiger.&quot;    But on June 19, cooler heads prevailed. Hours after a long afternoon meeting between Mr. Chun and U.S. Ambassador James Lilley, plans to put much of the country under the army's &quot;garrison command&quot; were called off. That, at least, is how four independent sources close to the Korean military recall the events of June. It may never be known if the military pulled back in response to U.S. pressure, or if opposition among influential military officers and former officers threw cold water on the plan -- or both.    But the events suggest that South Korea's military, while it remains as unpredictable as any &quot;waiting, hungry tiger,&quot; is under far more constraint these days. The fact that it didn't move shows more inhibition than in 1972, when the late President Park Chung Hee used it to impose martial law, dissolve the National Assembly and ban political activity.    Nor does it appear to have the freedom it had in 1980 when then-Gen. Chun used the military to seize power, put down a civil rebellion and institute a severe form of martial law.    Mr. Chun's own sentiments clearly put him in the hard-line camp, but so far, under pressure from various quarters, he has refrained from military intervention.    &quot;Military intervention needs the implicit consent of the U.S., the implicit consent of the middle class and some consensus within the military,&quot; says Suh Jin Young, a political scientist at Korea University. &quot;In June, it had none of these.&quot;    But just three months later, as social unrest has spread from the college campuses to the nation's factories, threatening South Korea's &quot;economic miracle,&quot; there are those who believe the 600,000-strong military is getting antsy again.    &quot;The hard-line in the military is anxious to move,&quot; contends one South Korean with military connections. &quot;The military is watching and waiting. Among them are people who wish to make a move.&quot;    But just as there were in June, there are overpowering reasons for the military to hold its temper. A military crackdown would be a shattering blow to the nascent democratic-reform process in this nation of 42 million. A military takeover would likely embarrass and alienate the U.S. government, which keeps 39,000 soldiers here to help protect South Korea and U.S. interests in the area; much of the Korean military is nominally under the command of a U.S. general. It would certainly spark a civilian revolt of unpredictable proportion, possibly plunging South Korea into its most severe crisis since the Korean War. And it could threaten next summer's Olympic Games in Seoul, either by causing them to be canceled outright or by weakening them if there is a military takeover and countries withdraw their teams in protest.    The U.S., moderate military elements, and fear that a violent popular counterreaction to any military takeover might threaten the economy -- not to mention fear of losing the Olympics -- may all be enough to keep the soldiers in their barracks. But the military men, who consider themselves the ultimate Korean patriots and thus the ultimate stabilizing force in the nation against internal and external threats, still face major tests of their willingness to accommodate political change.    Near the top of the list are the anti-government student protestors. The ruling party's candidate, Roh Tae Woo, an army general turned politician, diverted the government from confrontation with demonstrating students and workers in June by offering a sweeping, conciliatory package of democratic reforms, including the first free, direct presidential elections, set for December.    His moderation quickly cooled the crisis atmosphere, though tension has continued to simmer. Now, student protesters are back on campus and back in the streets, the more radical among them saying they want nothing less than to overthrow the government. They view Mr. Roh's meeting with President Reagan in Washington yesterday as evidence of U.S. favoritism toward the ruling party. (In Washington, the White House said the meeting wasn't an endorsement and added that Mr. Reagan would welcome visits by South Korean opposition figures.)    In addition, strikes caused major disruptions to the country's export industries, though the level of labor unrest has declined recently.    Mr. Roh's support within the military could erode if the reforms he pressed result in social chaos, though the military clearly prefers him over the opposition candidates. His major problem is getting enough votes to win.    But if the opposition wins the December election, the military's reaction would be less clear. The main opposition group hasn't decided which of its leading figures will run for president. The military might go along with the more-moderate Kim Young Sam. But if the winning opposition candidate is Kim Dae Jung, a firebrand dissident who has at one time or another been arrested, kidnapped and sentenced to death by the Korean government, that may be more than the military can tolerate.    Already, the army chief of staff, Gen. Park Hee Do, has been quoted as telling Korean reporters at a private briefing that &quot;something unhappy&quot; would happen if Kim Dae Jung became president. The military has angrily denied that the general made such a warning, which never saw print except outside South Korea.    Yet in private conversations, military officers express distrust, even hatred, for Kim Dae Jung. At their most vehement, some accuse him of being a communist, a serious charge in a country that spends one-third of its national budget defending itself against communist North Korea. At the very least, they consider him a troublemaker and a rebel who might seek revenge for his previous treatment at the hands of the military.    From listening to military men talk among themselves, it is easy to conclude that they distrust any &quot;outsider,&quot; not just Kim Dae Jung. They think only a military man could control the Korean military. That is the consensus, at least, around the lunch table where four middle-aged graduates of the Korean Military Academy gathered recently. Since the Korean War, the academy has turned out men who hold influential positions in the military, the government and in business. That includes President Chun and Mr. Roh, members of the KMA class of 1955.    The men -- an active army general, a university professor, a businessman and a retired general -- agree to talk only if they aren't identified. As they settle onto the floor of a Japanese restaurant in a Seoul hotel, nibbling on sashimi and sipping beer and sake, they talk about the form of government they would like.    &quot;The ideal is a civilian president, not from the military, who can control the military. But in such a short span of time? I don't think it's possible,&quot; says the active general. The others nod agreement. &quot;Kim Dae Jung hasn't shown he can get the support of the military,&quot; says the professor. &quot;He's never worn dog tags,&quot; adds another.    As they talk, the mood suggests another criterion for a favored candidate: &quot;Outsiders,&quot; it seems, aren't just non-military men, but anyone who isn't from KMA.    Three of them were in the same KMA class. Their business and personal ties go far back. The older former general once had one of the younger men on his staff. He had construction-business dealings with the man on his right. When the older man was sick in Europe several years ago, one of the younger men flew to visit him. All of them used to attend dinners at one another's homes to swap information about their children's education.    The group's members have ties to other groups, many of them KMA -- graduate groups, one of the strongest &quot;old boy&quot; networks in a society where school ties are much stronger than in the U.S.    Life in the South Korean military is spartan in the extreme. A Korean corporal makes about $7.50 a month, in contrast to $909 for his American counterpart. Korean officers face years of duty along the demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas, usually apart from their families, where they tend to get an acute sense of the military threat from North Korea.    &quot;There are 1.5 million military forces in North and South Korea,&quot; says retired Gen. Paik Sun Yup. &quot;This is unique in the world. They are on 24-hour alert. This is reality, and it is very dangerous.&quot;    The threat from the North is certainly real. But that threat is used by the Seoul government to stifle dissent in the South. Even hard-core anti-communists in South Korea believe the government uses the Northern threat as a blanket excuse for heavy surveillance, censorship and imprisonment of political dissidents.    &quot;Our government is too concerned about the North Korean hidden hand in everything,&quot; says Woo Jae Seung, director of the World Freedom Center, an anti-communist organization. &quot;The Korean CIA, the Defense Security Command, they became so zealous, arresting everybody,&quot; says Mr. Woo. &quot;We don't want that. We, the people, won't tolerate it.&quot;    Korea's vast police and intelligence apparatus is a relic of the Japanese colonial occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945. That centralized structure was still intact when Mr. Chun came to power in 1980. He took full advantage of the massive state machinery and quickly put his own people in the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, the national police and provincial posts.    Mr. Chun put several career military men in the Blue House, the presidential compound, to oversee the ministries. Lower-ranking officers, mostly colonels and majors, were sent into the guts of the agencies to keep tabs. His government, like previous governments, pressed private companies to hire military &quot;old boys.&quot; And he continued putting KMA colleagues in sensitive, quasi-governmental positions.    All of this might suggest that the military brotherhood is one big happy family. It isn't. Through business or other connections, some senior officers grow wealthy in retirement, but hundreds of others are relatively poor, disgruntled and embarrassed by the loss of their former status.    In the ranks of the military itself, there are distinctions and rivalries. Non-KMA graduates tend to be jealous of KMA graduates. There are regional conflicts and ideological differences between younger officers and older officers. Some analysts say those at the rank of two-star general and below are relatively more moderate and pro-democracy than the three-star and four-star generals in senior positions who often have close connections with President Chun.    There have been signs of fractiousness even among the senior ex-generals who run the government. Some notorious hard-liners have lost influence. In May, one of the most powerful, National Security Planning Chief Chang Se Dong, lost his job in a cabinet shuffle.    Moreover, a somewhat moderate exgeneral, Chung Ho Yung, has gained influence. According to several sources, Mr. Chung, a KMA classmate of President Chun and Mr. Roh, was strongly against the imposition of garrison law in mid-June and was instrumental in lining up military support for Mr. Roh's June 29 democratic reform package.    Mr. Chung recently became defense minister. Some analysts see this as Mr. Roh's handiwork. Mr. Chung has high standing within the army and is considered to have enough control over the chain of command to enable Mr. Roh to continue his conciliatory stance without serious threat of revolt from within the ranks.    &quot;The military has shown enthusiastic support for my decisions,&quot; Mr. Roh said in an interview. &quot;So I am now confident that we have a mature military that believes in democracy.&quot; He added that he was confident the police could handle the current unrest and strikes &quot;and that the military won't have to intervene.&quot;    At the same time, Mr. Roh's military background may be a weakness. As a two-star general, he played a crucial role in the 1979 military mutiny led by Mr. Chun, dispatching a regiment that helped Mr. Chun achieve victory.    Since then, Mr. Roh &quot;has slavishly followed Chun's policies,&quot; says a political critic. He has held three cabinet posts: state, sports and home affairs. At the time of the 1980 Kwangju incident, in which hundreds of rioting civilians were killed by army troops, he headed the powerful Defense Security Command, which is responsible for military intelligence and conducts domestic political surveillance.    But Mr. Roh isn't a carbon copy of President Chun. &quot;Chun is an operator type,&quot; says one military analyst. &quot;There are lots of operator types in the Korean military. They talk. They don't listen much. Roh is different, a rarity among Korean officers, a planner and a listener.&quot;    In a way, Mr. Roh is a creature of the military's unsettled role in a changing Korea. Seen in the light of the way things usually work here, he wants to retain power but has been forced into a corner by street protest and the rising clamor for less authoritarianism. But by recognizing that Koreans want change, he has put the opposition off balance and emerged as a credible candidate in the December vote.    ---             Korea: Rough Road Toward Democracy    June 25, 1950   North Korean troops launch blitzkrieg on                    the south, beginning Korean war.    April 19, 1960  Student demonstrations threaten to become                    a popular uprising. The government of                    President Syngman Rhee declares martial                    law. President Rhee resigns April 27.    May 16, 1961    Forces led by Gen. Park Chung Hee seize                    power. In 1963, after retiring from the                    army, Mr. Park wins election. Transition                    to civilian rule follows.    Oct. 17, 1972   President Park declares martial law,                    partially suspending the constitution                    and dissolving the national assembly.                    Political activities banned.    Oct. 26, 1979   President Park assasinated by director of                    Korean Central Intelligence Agency.    Dec. 12, 1979   Officers led by Maj. Gen. Chun Doo Hwan                    take control of the military in a revolt                    against their superiors. A few months                    later, Gen. Chun takes control of the                    Korean CIA and becomes most powerful man                    in South Korea.    May 17,1980     Extraordinary martial law is declared in                    the face of violent demonstrations. On                    May 18 an insurrection begins in the city                    of Kwangju, which is eventually put down                    by Korean troops, who kill at least 191                    people. Gen. Chun is inaugurated as                    president Sept. 1.    April 13, 1987  President Chun, due to leave office in                    February 1988, suspends debate on                    constitutional reform, decrees that his                    successor will be chosen by electoral                    college. Demonstrations for direct                    presidential elections, which had been                    simmering for more than a year, become                    more violent.    June 29         Roh Tae Woo, Mr. Chun's choice as his                    successor, accepts the opposition's                    demands, including direct presidential                    elections, strengthened human rights and                    press freedom.</TEXT></DOC>
