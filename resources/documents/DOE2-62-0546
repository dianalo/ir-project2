The characteristics of particle confinementand recycling of ohmically heated plasma in the JT-60 tokamak are investigatedby this model using H{alpha} data of observed eight sight lines. As aresult, it is inferred that recycled particles in the divertor influencethe estimation of particle confinement time in comparison with that ofanalysis from the function fitting method using the data of three verticalsight lines.</TEXT></DOC>
