European companies fear such taxes will make them lesscompetitive with their non-EC rivals. Opposition also isexpected from some member governments, though the commissionhas met some of their demands, such as exempting certainindustries. Passage, requiring unanimous approval, may bedifficult.   Under the proposals, EC governments would introduce anenergy tax in 1993, to rise gradually by the end of thedecade. The tax would be levied half each on nonrenewableenergy and on fuels' carbon content. Other ideas includetougher energy-efficiency standards for appliances and lowerspeed limits.   Separately, the commission may water down its proposal toreduce waste from packaging. Businesses say the measure wouldforce drastic changes in packaging and distributing goods.Possible revisions include a lower recycling target rate.                                                                                                          INVESTMENT IN EASTERN GERMANY                                                                                                          Deutsche Bank AG is creating an investment firm to buymajority stakes in eastern German factories and restructurethem to compete in free markets. The German banking giant'smove offers the best chance yet for independent companies toemerge from the economically devastated region. Mostmedium-sized and larger firms in eastern Germany are endingup as scaled-down units of western companies or goingbankrupt. Bonn wants independent eastern enterprises butcan't afford the transformation. Its privatization agency isdeep in the red.                                                                                                          HUNGARY CLEARS BANKRUPTCY BILL                                                                                                          Hungary's Parliament passed legislation allowing companiesto declare bankruptcy, effective Jan. 1. The measure appliesto businesses that are insolvent or unlikely to pay theirbills within a 12-month period. It allows a 90-day protectionperiod to negotiate with creditors before court proceedingsbegin. State-controlled enterprises have been barred fromfiling for bankruptcy, and cash injections for themcontributed to Hungary's $20 billion foreign debt.                                                                                                          SOUTH KOREAN GOODS TOO PRICEY?                                                                                                          A survey of 460 foreign buying offices in South Koreafound that two-thirds plan within two years to change theirpartners or shift their bases to China and Southeast Asiancountries, which can provide less expensive goods. The surveyby the Korea Traders Association showed that most buyers wereunhappy with prices offered by South Korean companies, labordisputes and delivery delays.                                                                                                          CUBA TO WOO FOREIGN INVESTORS                                                                                                          President Fidel Castro said Cuba aims to keep itssocialist system but collaborate with foreign capitalistinvestors. He said a Communist Party congress on Oct. 10would ratify Havana's efforts in the past year to woo foreigninvestment in Cuba's beleaguered economy, especially tourism.Over 200 foreign firms leaped in. &quot;It's an experiment thatcan be greatly enriched,&quot; Mr. Castro said. &quot;There are norigid precepts. We are ready to consider any kind ofproposition.&quot; Investor lures include immediate repatriationof profits and generous tax exemptions.                                                                                                          DELINQUENT TAXES IN JAPAN                                                                                                          Japan's tax agency said a record 1.41 trillion yen ($10.58billion) in taxes for the year ended March 31 remaineduncollected, most from real estate and construction firmshurt by slowing land-price growth. The sum was up 21% from ayear earlier. Expected tax revenues in the fiscal yeartotaled 62.3 trillion yen.                                                                                                          DISPUTE ABOUT AIRBUS BACKING                                                                                                          The next round in the dispute about government financingof Airbus Industrie is scheduled for today, but hope for asettlement appears slim.   The U.S. and the European Community will present theirarguments in Geneva to the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade conciliation committee. At issue is Europeangovernments' aid over 20 years to help Airbus launch aircraftmodels, estimated by the U.S. to total $13.5 billion, ordouble that sum had it been financed at market rates.   The U.S. claims this aid has allowed Airbus to offerattractive financing and increase its market share to morethan 35% at U.S. aircraft makers' expense. It wants the ECgovernments involved -- France, Germany, Britain and Spain --gradually to eliminate the subsidies, now about half of totaldevelopment costs. Washington also wants full disclosure ofAirbus's finances.   But the GATT debate is likely to focus on a proceduralquestion of whether to apply the subsidy code or the morelenient aircraft code. This could derail the talks, and theU.S. could ask for an arbitration panel to rule. Still,settlement incentives are great, as European governments'funds are needed for other uses, such as Germany's easterndevelopment.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          Switzerland's upper house of Parliament cleared away theremaining legislative hurdles to Swiss membership in theInternational Monetary Fund and World Bank. It hopes to joinby next fall. . . . Six of every 10 new government jobs inIndia will be reserved for the underprivileged. India, whichhas set aside 22.5% of these jobs for so-called untouchables,will designate an additional 27% for &quot;socially andeducationally backward classes&quot; and 10% for poor members ofthe upper castes in India's rigid Hindu social hierarchy.</TEXT></DOC>
