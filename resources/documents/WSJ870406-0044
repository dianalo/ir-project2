Traditionally, the Cincinnati Reds open each major-league baseball season. Yet by the time the Reds start today at 2:05 p.m., relief pitchers may already be working in Toronto, where the Blue Jays get under way at 12:35.    The Cincinnati City Council has sent a resolution to Toronto, protesting its quick-pitch timing. A copy also went to Secretary of State George Shultz. Since baseball is the national pastime in the U.S., &quot;there are some international implications here,&quot; explains council member David Mann.    But Brian Ashton, a member of the Metropolitan Toronto Council, says, &quot;You could settle arctic sovereignty and free-trade issues before you could settle opening day.&quot; Not acting the diplomat himself, he dismisses the U.S. as the place where Toronto keeps some of its farm clubs.    So in what is becoming a sport of jest, the Toronto council has challenged the Cincinnati council to a grudge match. Mr. Ashton talks of staging a charity event before a Blue Jays game in Toronto.    Asked about that possibility, a Blue Jays spokesman says, &quot;I wish they'd get on with important matters, like getting taxes down.&quot; The Reds, for their part, don't want to join the hubbub, either.    Still, Mr. Mann of Cincinnati is ready to go to bat. Even if his eight council colleagues show less zeal, they can't beg off by saying their trip to Toronto would waste taxpayers' money: Comair Inc., a Cincinnati-based airline, is offering free tickets for the council members.    Win or lose, the Cincinnati nine from city hall may have to adjust to the end of their tradition, which observes the formation of the first professional baseball team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, in 1869. The Blue Jays aren't the only irritant; a second American League team, the Detroit Tigers, also is opening before the Reds. The Tigers actually opened just before the Reds last year too, despite an objection from the Cincinnati council. Pat Harmon, a retired sports editor in Cincinnati, says that even in the Reds' own National League, other teams have occasionally opened earlier.    Meanwhile, no one in Cincinnati has heard from Mr. Shultz. The council will apparently have to do without him. &quot;I don't think we need him,&quot; reflects Mayor Charles Luken. &quot;What we need is a shortstop.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
