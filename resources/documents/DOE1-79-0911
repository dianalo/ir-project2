It emphasizes plasma proteinsand erythrocyte enzymes. Study of human allotypes is critically importantboth for clinical reasons and for the purpose of extending our knowledgeof the human genome. The immediate clinical applications include bloodcell transfusion, paternity exclusion, establishment of marrow and organtransplantation, and antenatal diagnosis. The ultimate clinical goalis effective treatment of severe inherited disease by gene replacementor modification either in utero or in early childhood. Although the lattergoal is certainly distant, immensely valuable biologic data are beingcollected en route as assignment of particular genes to particular chromosomesis in progress. This chapter is organized into two sections: The firstdeals with the major serum proteins in some detail; the second consistsof a much briefer review of blood cell enzymes. The genetic nomenclatureused is that proposed by an international committee and approved by theInternational Society for Human Genetics.</TEXT></DOC>
