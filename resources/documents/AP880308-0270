At a time when schools have been barraged by critics in theReagan administration and elsewhere, along comes Burger King,Honeywell, Metropolitan Life and others in the corporate communitywho not only are arguing public education's case, but are puttingconsiderable money where their mouths are.   A new book, ``American Business and the Public School: CaseStudies of Corporate Involvement in Public Education'' (TeachersCollege Press, $24.95), offers a valuable, scholarly dissection ofthis budding relationship between these formerly estrangedbedfellows, and it explodes several myths in the process.   The 278-page book was edited by Marsha Levine, an official ofthe American Federation of Teachers, and Roberta Trachtman,affiliated with the City University of New York. Their book arguesthat self-interest is too simple an explanation for the recentupsurge in corporate interest in better schools.   ``Business doesn't get involved in education just because itneeds skilled workers,'' argues Owen B. ``Brad'' Butler, retiredchairman of Procter andamp; Gamble who wrote a foreward to the book.   ``Most big companies are multinational,'' Butler said during arecent visit to New York. ``They can find the workers they needsomewhere. The primary interest they have in better schools is thatthe United States is their home base, and business can't remainhealthy unless the United States remains peaceful, prosperous anddemocratic.''   The book completes a trilogy of studies commissioned by theCommittee for Economic Development, a research organizationdominated by top business executives which Butler chairs. The twoearlier reports, ``Investing in Our Children,'' published in 1985,and ``Children in Need,'' published last September, were eachfront-page blockbusters.   Those previous reports, which called for such innovations asmassive new governmental investments in programs to help theneediest students, forced all who had typecast business executivesas socially callous arch-conservatives to reconsider.   The latest book, while not as headline-making, will likely bethe most enduring of the three. And like its predecessors, thisreport challenges some widely held notions about the nature ofbusiness-corporate partnerships.   It offers, for the first time, useful detailed case histories ofbusiness-school partnerships that work, written by insiders. A keyingredient seems to be a new willingness on the part of business toenter such relationships as partners, rather than superiors.   Metropolitan Life's chairman, John Creedon, is presented ashaving ``profound respect for education and educators.'' Thecompany's involvement in school reform has become renowned through,among other things, an annual survey of teacher attitudes it hasconducted for the past several years.   What's in it for Met Life? Three things, according to the book:its view that it has obligations to the nation as a corporatecitizen; its desire to ensure future employees have needed jobskills; and a belief that well-informed citizens are betterinsurance risks.   Honeywell, the Minneapolis-based computer firm, first becameinterested in education in the 1970s and decided that it had tohelp local school districts develop better curricula.   In Seattle, for example, Honeywell employees invited citizens inSnohomish County, Wash., to figure out ways to ``prepare studentsfor a high technology future in a low technology environment.'' Theresult is a school-business partnership dubbed LINK.   Burger King, meanwhile, has developed an awesome array ofeducational programs since 1983, from fast-food management courses,to scholarship programs and even a curriculum on crime prevention.The company also honors 100 principals and teachers each year. Thebudget for such programs has grown from $1.5 million in 1983 to$3.9 million in 1986. Some 3,000 workers in 900 restaurants havebenefitted from the programs.   ``The long-term benefit we are seeking is a consistent, unifiedpublic perception of Burger King as a good corporate citizen,''writes Burger King's Barbara Gothard. ``People come to Burger Kingbecause of quality, service and value. But they are also influencedby their perception of how good is the company backing theproduct.''   ``Seven or eight years ago, it was difficult to imagine thatthis would occur, that business and education would become sointerested in each other,'' said C. Michael Timpane, president ofColumbia Teachers College. ``Now business isn't just looking atnarrow job skills. They realize two things: that people changejobs, and jobs themselves change.   ``When educators looked at that, they thought that this was verycongenial. Business was asking us to do what we wanted to do allalong _ only better.'' For anyone interested in understanding oneof the most heartening developments of the 1980s, this book is anexcellent place to start.</TEXT><TEXT>   Lee Mitgang has covered education for the AP since 1981.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, March 18-20 and Thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
