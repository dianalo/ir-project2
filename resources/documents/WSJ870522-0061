BirnbaumStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDEST MDAEROSPACE (ARO)EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A senior Reagan administration official issued a veiled threat to Iran, suggesting that an Iranian attack on U.S. naval ships in the Persian Gulf could provoke a war between the two nations.    Meanwhile, amid heightened tensions caused by Iraq's unintentional attack last Sunday on a U.S. vessel, the Senate voted decisively to require the administration to outline its security plans in the troubled gulf region before sending any U.S. warships to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers. The administration earlier this week reaffirmed its agreement to a Kuwaiti request, made last December, to offer protection to 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers. Those tankers would fly the U.S. flag and be considered American ships.    The administration official, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy, told reporters yesterday that he believes it unlikely Iran would attack ships protected by the U.S., in part because such attacks &quot;would add a new dimension to the war&quot; between Iran and Iraq. &quot;They (the attacks) would divert Iranian attention from its principal enemy, Iraq. Iran hasn't won that war and we think it would be reluctant to initiate actions that would provoke a second (war).&quot;    Later yesterday, the White House tried to play down Mr. Murphy's remarks. Officials said the diplomat wasn't trying to warn of a danger of war but rather to emphasize that an American presence would keep the gulf conflict from widening. &quot;The point of this thing is deterrence and not to be provocative,&quot; one official said.    But the administration's actions yesterday clearly signaled to both Iran and Congress that it considers the stakes high. Just before the Senate's 91-5 vote approving the measure, President Reagan, in comments at the White House reiterating U.S. policy, said: &quot;Let no one doubt our resolve to protect our interests in the Persian Gulf or anywhere else.&quot;    And Mr. Murphy, a cautious career diplomat, said in an on-the-record briefing that if Iran were allowed to intimidate Kuwait and other gulf oil producers, &quot;it would lead to actual or psychological interruption, causing a major surge in oil prices, global inflation and recession, including in the United States, with adverse political and security ramifications for the West, as happened in 1973 and again in 1979.&quot;    While Kuwaiti ships in the gulf have been attacked regularly by Iran, Mr. Murphy said he didn't think U.S. ships were in danger. He noted that Iran hasn't attacked U.S. vessels and that it has said it won't unless provoked by the U.S. But he did concede that &quot;we can't be totally sure of anything where Iran is concerned.&quot; When asked directly whether he was suggesting that the U.S. would go to war if Iran attacked U.S. vessels, he said: &quot;I'm not suggesting any such thing. . . . I said I didn't think they would want to start a war.&quot;    Nevertheless, at a time of increased tension in the region, the administration's stance could confront the U.S. with a difficult choice: taking sides in the bitter gulf war, in which it is officially neutral, or losing credibility if it fails to respond to an Iranian attack. A senior administration official said privately this week that the U.S. would have a graduated response to any attack. He mentioned, for example, a U.S. counterattack on an Iranian missile battery, noting that many are vulnerable.    The Senate's heavily bipartisan vote was designed to promote caution. The measure would require the Defense Department to disclose what risks the U.S. might encounter by escorting the ships, what steps it is prepared to take in case those ships are attacked, presumably by Iranians, and to what extent U.S. efforts will be supplemented by its European and Saudi Arabian allies. Congress would have to be given the report before U.S. vessels could be deployed.    Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) said: &quot;If our operations are not conducted in such as way as to recognize the gravity of the threats which face our warships and men, and if appropriate measures are not now taken to prepare for all possible contingencies, then we should think twice, and three times, about putting ourselves in harm's way.&quot;    Separately, the White House said it intends to proceed with a sale to Saudi Arabia of F-15 jet fighters, made by McDonnell Douglas Corp. But the administration, which had planned to present its formal proposal of the sale to Congress this week, has delayed that move.    Some members of Congress, who had raised objections to the sale to the Saudis before Sunday's incident, now are criticizing Saudi Arabia for not responding to a request by U.S. military officers for two F-15s on routine patrol to intercept the Iraqi Mirage jet that crippled the USS Stark.    The administration says the Saudi pilots didn't get authority from their command center quickly enough to intercept the Mirage. </TEXT></DOC>
