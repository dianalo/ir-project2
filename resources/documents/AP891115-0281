SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Desktop video for personal computers is finallygetting past the hype stage, many computer experts say.   New computers and software let users knit writing and soundstogether with graphics, video and animation in a package that letsthe user control the images and ``talk back.''   Interactive multimedia or desktop video, the jargon phrases forall this, ``is like desktop publishing three years ago,'' accordingto Sam Albert, a longtime executive for International BusinessMachines Corp. who now runs a consulting business in Scarsdale, N.Y.   ``This thing is exploding very rapidly,'' Albert said Wednesday,the third day of the huge Comdex computer convention in Las Vegas.   Tim Bajarin, a strategic planning consultant to IBM, AppleComputer Inc., Compaq Computer Corp. and other companies, hascompiled the names of 350 people already producing multimedia.   Sample uses: worker trainees watch a master repairman in actionrather than read a boring manual, a salesman calls up video imagesof swatches of cloth and suggested configurations of desks andchairs for buyers of office furniture.   The recreational possibilities are also amazing, with thepotential for home computer users to integrate the functions ofstereos, videocassettes and compact disks.   The promise of the technology was blasted home toconvention-goers Monday by keynote speaker George H. Conrades,senior vice president at ordinarily conservative IBM and a prettyfair drummer back in his college days.   In a presentation that was more show than speech, Conradespulled out his drumsticks and started blamming away on syntheticdrums as part of an extravagant demonstration of controllable sightand sound.   At a touch, Conrades summoned images of swooping eagles,careening roller coasters and bridges that collapsed at whateverspeed he chose _ or whatever speed a structural engineer mightchoose, which was the point he was making.   ``Opportunity is everywhere,'' Conrades said, noting thatdespite the maturing of the computer industry, 90 percent of thebusinesses in the country are still without computers.   Training, education and sales are vast and obvious markets, withapplications from the mundane to the sublime.   John McCloskey of Leader Systems showed off a program thatexplains the complexities of insurance, with specifics on variousplans available at a touch.   UCLA music history professor Robert Winter uses multimedia toteach Beethoven: a click of the ``mouse'' controlling his Macintoshproduces biographical tidbits; another click might produce amusical theme or additional fragments to show how it's developed.   Because desktop computers have become so powerful, they can nowhold and manipulate enough information fast enough to producecontrollable television images with breathtaking resolution,pictures far sharper than on a conventional TV.   That could mean, for example, that images of every picture inthe Louvre can be stored for retrieval by art lovers or studentswho could zoom right in on Mona Lisa's smile, clear as a bell,experts said at a panel discussion involving officials of IBM,Apple and Commodore International Ltd., which makes the Amiga.   With add-ons to funnel sound, video and text in and combine themwith computer-generated graphics and text, multimedia can now bedone for perhaps $5,000, compared with $50,000 just a few yearsago, the experts said.   David Archambault, director of project marketing for Commodore,used an Amiga to generate an impromptu commercial that combinedpictures of the computers, music and a swirling, animated companylogo.   Archambault said that $2 billion is spent every year in theUnited States on computers for education alone.   ``We feel multimedia is deliverable to a number of these nichemarkets today,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
