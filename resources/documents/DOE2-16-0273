The spots have been in theimmediate vicinity of the T and B Plant stacks, within a radius of 1000feet of the stack. The spots found are limited to a maximum surface ofapproximately one square inch with essentially no depth. These spotswere probably discharged from the plant stacks and dropped to the surroundingarea, the distance from the stack depending upon the size of the particleand the weather conditions at the time of discharge. The present equipmentis not designed to control either condition. The condition describedabove is not consistent with accepted operating standards of contaminationcontrol. It constitutes a serious health hazard requiring the utmostexpediency in its correction. Since a filter system appears to be a positivemeans of removing these particles from the air emanating from the processbuilding, the Project Engineering Group of the Maintenance Departmentwill furnish the necessary design work covering the facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
