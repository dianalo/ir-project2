Ms. Farley said the ICLU is drafting a proposed amendment ``thatwill simply protect the status quo'' in the wake of a U.S. SupremeCourt ruling broadening state powers to restrict abortions.   ``It is clear that we can no longer rely upon the U.S. SupremeCourt to protect the right of reproductive choice,'' Ms. Farleysaid.   Iowa House Speaker Don Avenson said he doesn't expect theLegislature to approve abortion restrictions next year.   The National Organization for Women called Sunday for anamendment to the United States Constitution guaranteeing women theright to abortion and birth control. NOW issued its call for a``Bill of Rights for the 21st Century'' at a convention inCincinnati.   The proposed constitutional amendment in Iowa, which has yet tobe drafted, would require the approval of two successive GeneralAssemblies before being submitted to a statewide vote.   ``This will be a moderate proposal aimed at preservingestablished privacy rights,'' said ICLU lobbyist Mark Lambert.</TEXT></DOC>
