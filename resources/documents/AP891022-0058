Britain alone dissented.   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, rejecting keyprovisions of the Commonwealth summit declaration on South Africa,charged that U.S. and Commonwealth embargoes have strengthenedwhite extremism in South Africa.   But she went along with a stipulation that current tradeembargoes remain for the time being.   In its declaration, the organization of Britain and its formercolonies held off on seeking new embargoes for at least six months.   Britain objected to provisions setting up a new body toscrutinize South Africa's financial links and declaring that aforeign ministers' committee, which monitors sanctions and suggestsnew ones, will meet in six months.   The 12-page declaration gave muted acknowledgment of reformmoves by South Africa's new president, F.W. de Klerk, who has saidthe black majority could have a role in politics in five years.   It said there was a ``possibility that significant changes inapproach on the part of the South African regime ... may yet proveto be within reach.''   The declaration was issued Sunday after final approval by theCommonwealth leaders at a weekend retreat at Langkawi island, 210miles northwest of here.   In a separate statement Sunday, Mrs. Thatcher said, ``Thereseems to be a clear correlation between the imposition ofadditional sanctions by the U.S. Congress and the Commonwealth andthe strength of extreme right-wing parties in South Africa utterlyopposed to change.''   The statement took other countries by surprise. A seniorCommonwealth official, requesting anonymity, called it``despicable.''   British Foreign Secretary John Major, who was on the committeethat drew up the final Commonwealth declaration, said it showed ``anovel recognition'' by the Commonwealth that change is beginning inSouth Africa and that sanctions should not be punitive.   Tanzanian Foreign Minister Ben Wmkapa called Major'sinterpretation was ``laughable.''   ``This declaration expresses our judgment that South Africa hasundertaken no fundamental changes,'' Wmpaka said in an interview.``What's he crowing about?''   Canadian External Affairs Secretary Joe Clark, head of thecommittee, said ``nobody is buying'' that de Klerk has shifted awayfrom apartheid, the system that denies the black majority the vote.   The declaration noted that de Klerk had ``accepted a degree ofpeaceful political activity by the black majority and on the eve ofthis meeting had released from prison eight political leaders.''   In parts of the declaration, the tone was milder than that ofprevious Commonwealth pronouncements on South Africa, and itstressed the need for peaceful change.   The declaration incorporated an Australian proposal that theCommonwealth call on international banks to restrict South Africantrade credits to a maximum of 90 days and urge governments to makeit more difficult for South Africa to get credits.   It also said that a U.N. arms embargo should be intensified.   Current Commonwealth embargoes consist of 11 voluntarysanctions, including a ban on air links, drawn up in 1986.   Britain refuses to impose most of the Commonwealth embargoes.Black African states, which depend economically on South Africa, donot impose them.   The sanctions fall well short of those imposed by the UnitedStates.</TEXT></DOC>
