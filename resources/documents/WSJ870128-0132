BarnesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/28/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AXLN MATTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><TEXT>   The toy industry's practice of marketing products based on popular cartoons is about to be blasted into a new dimension with &quot;Tech Force.&quot;    Thanks to advances in toy technology, companies are introducing a handful of toys that are activated by a companion television cartoon. In the first so-called &quot;interactive&quot; toy expected on the market, &quot;Tech Force and the Moto-Monsters&quot; is the cartoon; as Tech Force characters battle evildoers on the tube, their toy counterparts will, for example, charge around the living-room floor firing toy lasers.    The instant locomotion, designed in part to differentiate the newer toy-based TV shows from the existing glut of such programs, is made possible by computer microchips in the toys that respond to broadcast signals. With Tech Force, the toys will move when they pick up inaudible signals on the cartoon's soundtrack.    The development could be the next major sales booster in the $12 billion-a-year toy industry, analysts say. &quot;It is clearly a breakthrough,&quot; says David S. Leibowitz, senior vice president at American Securities Corp., New York. &quot;It's not too extreme a statement to say we are looking at the possibility of a new form of play.&quot;    But even before such toys hit the stores, they are coming under attack by children's television activists, who have long charged that many cartoon shows are nothing more than lengthy commercials. Such interactive toys will give toy makers &quot;a whole new way to turn children into salespeople,&quot; says Peggy Charren, president of Cambridge, Mass.-based Action for Children's Television.    The new technology holds promise for other applications -- home education systems, for example. But at least two companies are already using it for toys.    Tech Force is being manufactured by Axlon Inc., a Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company organized by Nolan K. Bushnell, who invented Pong, the first video game, and founded Atari Inc. The Tech Force set includes four action figures who will also be in the cartoon. When attached to a small chassis, they zip across the floor in response to either broadcast signals or a simple computer game console. Tech Force sets will retail for about $250 and will be in stores next month.    Meanwhile, Mattel Inc., based in Hawthorne, Calif., is beginning production of Captain Power toys, which will be accompanied by a new kids' show, &quot;Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future,&quot; about a group of humans fighting for survival in the 21st century after a major war. Unlike &quot;Tech Force,&quot; the show will combine live action and computer animation.    Captain Power toys will also be activated differently from Tech Force. Instead of using inaudible signals, the show will relate to toys through action on the screen. Mattel executives won't disclose details of the technology. But in a recent demonstration, a toy rocket could be fired at light impulses on the screen to build up a score, much like a video game.    Both shows are scheduled to debut this fall, and videocassette versions of the programming will also be sold.    Marketing toys with television shows, typically under licensing agreements, isn't new. The Federal Communications Commission banned the practice in 1969 after finding that &quot;Hot Wheels,&quot; a cartoon that appeared on the ABC television network, was &quot;designed primarily to promote the sale of a sponsor's product, rather than to serve the public either by entertaining or informing it.&quot;    But under FCC Chairman Mark Fowler, who took office in 1981 and is now stepping down, the commission has eased the restrictions. Both Axlon and Mattel have received FCC staff approval to use over-the-air broadcast signals with toys.    Children's activists are continuing to fight. &quot;I am astounded and entranced by the technology that makes this possible,&quot; says William H. Dietz, chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on children and television. Nevertheless, he contends, toy makers are &quot;taking the Pavlovian response one step further.&quot; Among other things, Dr. Dietz worries that interactive toys will be a &quot;further invasion&quot; of television into children's lives and that they will help &quot;destroy imaginative play.&quot;    Toy executives disagree. &quot;When kids get involved (with Tech Force) and start making their own games and their own adventures, the creative possibilities are endless,&quot; says Robert Kecskemeti, vice president of international sales for Axlon. Colleague Andy Levison, Axlon's director of licensing, adds that the toy will have educational value as well. &quot;It certainly is a great way to expose children to a simple computer,&quot; he argues. </TEXT></DOC>
