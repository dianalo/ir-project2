Bennett, afrequent critic of low standards in America's schools and colleges,announced today he will leave President Reagan's Cabinet inmid-September.   Bennett, often a magnet for controversy during his 3{-yearstint, signalled last month that he intended to step down in thefall, a few months before the Reagan administration draws to aclose.   Bennett's spokesman, Loye Miller, issued the following statement:   ``Secretary Bennett met today with the president andsubsequently with Education Department staff to say that he intendsto leave his position in mid-September. He expressed his gratitudeto President Reagan for the opportunity to serve in his Cabinet.The secretary reiterated to his staff his intention to continue at`full speed ahead' during the next few months.''   Bennett told the staff he had recommended that Linus Wright, theundersecretary of education and a former superintendent of schoolsin Dallas, be nominated to fill the post for the final months ofReagan's term. There was no immediate word from the White House,however, on who Reagan would nominate.   Bennett was unavailable for further comment. He told the staffand the president that he wants to do some speaking and write abook.   In a jocular reference to the furor over former White Housechief of staff Donald Regan's memoirs, Bennett ``said to thepresident, `Not that kind of book. A book about education,''' hisspokesman related.   What lies ahead for the brash, combative Bennett, who hasclashed repeatedly with teachers' unions, quarreled with thesurgeon general over AIDS education, accused college presidents ofbeing greedy and upbraided Harvard and Stanford for changes intheir curriculum?   Bennett said after delivering the commencement address Saturdayat the University of Southern Mississippi that he hasn't made anydefinite plans.   But he is likely to hit the lecture circuit and says he wants towrite a book capsulizing his critiques of the quality of America'sschools and colleges.   Bennett, who converted from the Democratic to the Republicanparty on May Day in 1986, has already proven a big draw on the GOPfund-raising circuit, where he has been much in demand as anafter-dinner speaker.   One speculated post is apparently not in the cards: thevice-presidency on George Bush's tickets.   Although Bennett is widely believed to have had his eye on thatspot, Bush has been conspicuously silent about Bennett during allhis talk about being ``the education president.'' Aids to Bennett,who asked not to be identified, said they have had virtually nocontacts with the Bush camp in recent months, and Bennett is notexpecting to play any formal role in the Bush campaign.   But Bennett is expected to attend his first Republicanconvention in New Orleans this August, where party chairman FrankFahrenkopf has asked him to be on hand for the platformdeliberations, spokesman Miller said.   In the past three years, according to the trade publicationEducation Week, Bennett has spoken at 63 Republican functionsacross the country.   He has been a peripatetic Cabinet officer, visiting nearly 100elementary and secondary schools and 50 campuses, and giving dozensof speeches to school groups.   Bennett, 44, was chairman of the National Endowment for theHumanities for two years before succeeding T.H. Bell in theCabinet. Previously, he ran a humanities think-tank in NorthCarolina and taught at several universities. He holds both a Ph.D.in philosophy from the University of Texas and a law degree fromHarvard.   He has been a relative ``pauper'' in Reagan's inner circle,renting, not owning, a home in a pricey suburban Marylandneighborhood. He and his wife, Elayne, have a young son.   But his personal fortunes could pick up quickly if, as expected,he lands a big advance contract for a book and pulls down lecturefees running into thousands of dollars for each appearance.   There has been speculation that Bennett may eventually run foroffice, possibly from his adopted state of North Carolina. Heresisted an overture from Maryland GOP officials to seek thenomination to challenge Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.   Bennett said at the Education Writers Association meeting in NewOrleans April 17, ``I probably will step down in early fall. ...People tell me that once you get past the convention, everyonefocuses on politics and it's hard to get other things done. Ifthat's the case, I will leave and see what's available.''   Bennett said, ``I want to write a book that tells the truthabout education.''   Bennett's latest report, ``American Education: Making It Work,''concluded that American schools have improved somewhat over thepast five years, but still have a long way to go.</TEXT></DOC>
