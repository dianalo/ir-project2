How much disk space do theyhave? How do they do backup today? What else do they use tape drives for?andM;The second step of the process is to try to solve customers' problems in theabstract-matching available technologies to a high-level model of eachcustomer's business.andP;  The last step is to present a coherent vision of thefuture back to our customers.andP;  In essence, we are trying to help them lookpast the limitations of today's solutions and help them architect thesolutions of tomorrow.andP;  We call this developing an &quot;imaginative understandingof user needs.&quot; In probing more deeply with both HP system customers and OEMcustomers, we found that their responses to our simplistic market researchwere indeed conditioned by the properties and limitations of tape technology.andO;The truth is that customers don't like tapes.andP;  Tapes are inherently off-linedevices requiring sequential access to data and operator intervention tohandle the media.andP;  What customers really want is direct access to all oftheir archival data, without special utilities and without operatorintervention.andP;  We call this concept direct access secondary storage, or DASS.andO;When we clearly articulated this concept and fed it back to customers, wereceived consistently positive responses.andM;Rewritable optical disk technology, configured in an automated library, hasexactly the right properties to meet this customer need for direct access toarchival data.andP;  Optical disks are removable, rugged, reliable, and fairlyinexpensive on a cost-per-megabyte basis.andP;  Transfer rates are competitivewith many current tape products.andP;  And because it is a disk drive, an opticaldisk drive attaches to the host system using standard disk drivers and filesystems.andP;  This can give direct, transparent access from current applicationswithout modification.andP;  The connection between optical disks and secondarystorage makes perfect sense, but it was not obvious to either customers orthe optical drive vendors themselves.andM;The optical disk autochanger plays the other key role in the DASS concept.andO;With many gigabytes of on-line Winchester-disk storage, a typical host systemrequires tens or even hundreds of gigabytes of secondary storage for backupand archival information.andP;  In the DASS concept, this secondary storage mustbe on-line accessible without operator intervention or special recoveryutilities.andP;  Rewritable optical drives in an autochanger configuration providea cost-effective answer to the customer need for direct access to hugeamounts of historical data.andM;Reliability is the single most important attribute of an autochanger.andP;  Thecustomer perception is that autochangers are &quot;mechanical nightmares&quot; that arefascinating to watch at trade shows but frightening to consider as a vitallink in a company's computer operations.andP;  It was for this reason thatHewlett-Packard chose to design and build its own autochanger mechanism.andM;The philosophy used to guide the development was that reliability should notbe tested into a product, nor even designed in-it must be architected in.andP;  Anarchitecture that minimizes complexity, followed by careful design andrigorous testing, is the only way to achieve a quantum leap in reliability.andM;Optical Disc Library SystemandM;The result of these considerations is the HP Series 6300 Model 20GB/Arewritable optical disk library system, Fig.andP;  1.andP;  The Model 20GB/A combinesthe convenience and low storage cost of optical-disk technology with themassive capacity of a library system to provide on-line access to vastamounts of infrequently accessed information.andP;  The Model 20GB/A is a directaccess secondary storage (DASS) device that fills the price/performance gapbetween high-performance hard disks and low-cost tape storage (Fig.andP;  2).andO;Because of its huge, 20.8-Gbyte storage capacity and low cost per megabyte(Fig.andP;  3), the product makes it feasible to store information on-line thathas traditionally been stored off-line, and to automate labor-intensivebackup and recovery processes.andP;  It also greatly reduces the floor spacerequired for archiving (Fig.andP;  4).andM;The Model 20GB/A uses magnetooptical technology (see box, page 8).andP;  Data isstored on removable 5 1/4-inch disks.andP;  Optical disks are not susceptible tohead crashes and are much more tolerant of magnetic interference thanmagnetic media.andP;  Fingerprints and small scratches have no effect on the data.andO;Data can last over ten years without the retensioning or reconditioning thattapes require.andM;The Model 20GB/A consists of an autochanger, two magneto -optical diskdrives, and 32 5 1/4-inch, 650-Mbyte optical disk cartridges in a desksidecabinet.andP;  A mailslot is provided for loading or removing disks.andP;  Theautochanger automatically selects the appropriate cartridge and inserts itinto one of the two internal drives.andP;  Operation is transparent to users, whosee only a slightly slower response time when accessing optically storeddata-approximately 100 milliseconds if the disk is already in a drive, orabout 10 to 15 seconds if disks need to be exchanged.andP;  The HP-UX operatingsystem recognizes each disk side as a 325-Mbyte mountable file system, sodata access and software compatibility are the same as if the library systemwere a (slower) hard disk.andM;The Model 20GB/A conforms to ANSI and ISO specifications for continuouscomposite format 5 1/4-inch rewritable optical disks.andP;  This ensurescompatibility with the HP Series 6300 Model 650/A stand-alone rewritableoptical disk drive and the drives and media of other manufacturers.andP;  Thesystem implements the Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) in asynchronousmode with separate IDs for both drives and the autochanger.andP;  The product issupported on HP 9000 Series 300 and 800 computer systems running the HP-UX8.0 operating system.andM;Design PhilosophyandM;The design criteria for the HP Series 6300 Model 20CB/A rewritable opticaldisk library system were focused on three points that we felt were essentialto the successful launch of a peripheral with new functionality: minimizingtime to market, making the product very reliable, and completing full systemintegration.andP;  The major design and architecture philosophies we used werehigh leverage of existing successful designs, design simplicity, and modulardesign with limited coupling between modules.andM;Leveraged designs allowed us to produce early breadboards rapidly with a highlevel of sophistication.andP;  In using leveraged designs, we also gained all thebenefits of the engineer-years of effort that went into reliabilityengineering.andP;  We leveraged coupled servo architecture, motor/encoder design,a proprietary HP motor control IC, pulley and belt design practices andcapabilities, and carriage and way design.andP;  We limited ourselves tooff-the-shelf power supplies to decrease risk and tooling expense.andM;The design for reliability began with a study of failure rates on HP plotterproducts and the HP quarter-inch tape cartridge autochanger.andP;  We found thatthe predominant failures were associated with sensors, switches, motors, andsolenoids.andP;  We next generated graphs of annual failure rate as a function ofthe number of sensors and as a function of the number of actuators.andP;  Thearchitecture that followed from this analysis called for a minimum number ofsensors and motors, and for a &quot;passive payload&quot; design, which means that nosensors or actuators were allowed on any moving parts.andP;  This strategydecreased the number of high failure-rate parts and supporting parts as well,such as cables, connectors, and flexible circuits.andP;  It also eliminatedflexing wires, which have fatigue problems.andP;  We were well aware that asprinters have evolved in reliability, the hardest remaining reliabilityproblem is the flexible cable going to the printhead.andM;The mechanical design of the autochanger is described in the article on page14.andM;Another feature of the design is the servomechanism sense of touch,&quot; which istied directly to the passive payload concept.andP;  The ability for the controllerto sense forces and distance allowed us to remove physical sensors in thehardware.andP;  The architecture called for moving the sensors from the robot backinto the information processing capabilities of the motor controller andencoder.andP;  Sense of touch algorithms allow the controller to sense whetherthere is a cartridge in a location, verify a move, and so on.andM;Another reliability enhancement is overforce sensing and error recovery.andO;Using sense of touch, the robot stops motion before anything is broken.andP;  Anerror recovery algorithm is then invoked to clear the error condition andcomplete the move sequence.andP;  This design provides another chance to avoid aservice call.andM;Details of the servomechanism design are in the article on page 24.andM;The design is highly modular with limited coupling of the modules.andP;  Thiseffort paid off in many ways.andP;  The design areas could be assigned toengineers in a relatively uncoupled way, as long as the interactions of thedesign modules were relatively well-defined.andP;  In these design modules,functionality was the key.andP;  Designers had the ability to simplify or redesignwith measured effect on the rest of the project.andP;  This has been very fruitfulas the project has continued in its life.andP;  As reliability concerns areraised, they can be addressed with minimum impact on other aspects of thedesign.andP;  This allows improvement with limited risk of introducing newproblems in related designs.andM;Trying to achieve minimum system integration time and maximum flexibility ledto the concept of mounting the autochanger in either a stand-alone HP rack ora standard 19-inch rack.andP;  This would allow the library system to fit intomany different systems, both HP and non-HP.andP;  This design was adopted early inthe project, and is now being born in a follow-on product.andM;In selecting a system as an initial host, we chose the HP-UX operating systembecause it provides enough power and flexibility to support this peripheral,and is almost an open architecture.andP;  This provided us with a number ofoptions including developing a driver ourselves or developing a file levelinterface.andP;  Integration of the autochanger with the HP-UX operating system isthe subject of the box on page 11.andM;Autochanger ArchitectureandM;One of the major goals in the design of the autochanger architecture wasdefining a growth path future products.andP;  We did not want to lock ourselvesinto an architecture that would not allow us to meet the interfaceperformance demands of the future.andP;  The optical drives that were going to beused in the autochanger communicated via the SCSI, and since there was astandard emerging for an SCSI autochanger command set, we decided that theprimary interface of the autochanger would also be SCSI.andM;There are two drives in the standard configuration, and this means that theautochanger needs to use three SCSI bus IDs (two for the drives and one forthe autochanger controller and mechanism).andP;  This posed the problem that ifmore than two autochangers were used by a host on a single SCSI bus, theavailable bus IDs (8) would soon be used up.andP;  We investigated some otherarchitectures that would consume only one SCSI ID, with the autochanger andits two drives configured as logical unit numbers (LUNs) under that singleID.andP;  However, there were concerns about the performance degradation of doingthe SCSI-toSCSI command conversion for each LUN.andM;Even more ambitious than this architecture was the full file-level interfaceconcept.andP;  This entailed defining an entirely new interface that interacted ona file level and totally hid the SCSI in the drives.andP;  With this concept, wefelt we would have complete freedom to optimize the performance, throughput,and thrashing issues associated with an autochanger.andP;  On the other hand, thisapproach would also cause us to abandon the SCSI-II interface standard beingadopted by most of the industry, and the use of a standard interface was seenas essential if this product was going to have a viable life as an OEMproduct.andM;Although future growth was a major concern, time to market was an evengreater preoccupation.andP;  The autochanger was on an aggressive schedule, so weneeded to be careful about not taking on too big a task for the timeallotted.andP;  We were able to satisfy both goals by opting for the firstarchitectural option described-the use of three SCSI IDs on the bus.andM;Autochanger ControllerandM;The autochanger controller board is based on a 68000 microprocessor.andP;  The68000 controls or oversees all processes in the autochanger.andP;  Because of thearchitecture chosen, the 68000 has no direct communication with themagneto-optical drives over the SCSI bus.andP;  The autochanger is meant to be anSCSI target device only, and at present does not support any initiatorfunctions.andM;The 68000 operates with a time-sliced operating system whose primary functionis to control the two servo loops of the Y and Z motors.andP;  Operation of thesetwo loops can consume up to 70% of the processor's 12-MHz bandwidth.andP;  Theremainder of the processor's time is involved with command interpretation andthe overseeing of all other autochanger functions.andM;Commands to the autochanger can come from one of three different sources: theSCSI, an RS-232 port, or the front panel.andP;  The SCSI is the primary means forcontrolling the autochanger.andP;  The RS-232 port is primarily for diagnosticpurposes, although it can also be used as the primary interface for theautochanger controller.andP;  The front panel is the personal, direct userinterface.andP;  Commands can be entered through each of these interfaces, andalthough their formats differ, they are all processed through a commoncontrol flow in the 68000 firmware.andM;The hardware implementation of this architecture is highly integrated anduses either multifunction or intelligent off-the-shelf parts.andP;  The SCSI ismanaged by a proprietary controller IC, which frees the processor from allbut the most necessary processing tasks of the SCSI bus.andP;  The RS-232 port ismanaged by a multifunction peripheral chip.andP;  which also handles all theinterrupt vectoring and generates various timers used by the controller.andP;  Thefront panel is controlled by an 8051-type microcontroller, which manages allthe key presses and is responsible for updating the vacuum fluorescentdisplay.andP;  The low-level servo processing is serviced by another proprietaryIC, which manages the duty cycle of each motor and monitors the positionencoder information.andM;The controller board also contains 16K words of nonvolatile RAM.andP;  This RAM isused to store critical state information and positional parameters for use inautochanger error recovery and powerfail conditions.andP;  The nonvolatile RAMalso contains certain configuration parameters and certain logging valuesthat constantly reflect the age and health of the machine.andM;ReferencesandM;1.andP;
