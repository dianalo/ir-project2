The decision came after Ottawa late last month offered to impose a 15% surtax or export fee on lumber shipments to the U.S. in lieu of penalty duties the Reagan administration was preparing to impose.    The surcharge would be designed to help offset any advantage that Canadian producers receive from cut-rate fees for woodcutting rights provided by provincial governments. U.S. producers have contended that the discounts amount to unfair subsidies.    The issue has become an emotional one on both sides of the U.S.-Canadian border, threatening to derail attempts by the two countries to work out a broader free-trade accord.    Previously, Canada had refused to negotiate the issue, in part to allow its strategists time to see how the U.S. planned to respond to the American industry's complaints about the Canadian policy.    Canada insists that the discounts aren't a subsidy, and considers imposition of new U.S. penalties as protectionist. British Columbia's provincial government earlier proposed a 10% export tax, but U.S. sawmill operators rejected that as inadequate.    Spokesmen for the U.S. industry said yesterday that they believe any surcharge should be 25% or more, but they endorsed the idea of seeking a negotiated settlement after the Canadians offered to impose a 15% export charge. The U.S. industry originally had asked that the Commerce Department impose a 32% duty on Canadian lumber shipments to the U.S.    The new negotiations will be held under a procedure that enables the U.S. lumber industry effectively to veto any settlement that it doesn't consider adequate. If the talks produce an accord that American sawmill owners find satisfactory, they would withdraw their petition for countervailing U.S. duties. If the talks break down, the petition would stand and the U.S. would continue the process expected to result in penalty duties.    In a preliminary finding in October, the U.S. Commerce Department ruled that Canadian softwood exports are heavily subsidized and ought to be subject to offsetting penalty duties of about 15%. Currently, the department is conducting a required second review, and is scheduled to publish a final ruling Dec. 30.    In the meantime, U.S. importers of Canadian lumber are being required to post conditional bonds amounting to 15% of the value of their orders.    In 1983, the Reagan administration rejected a similar unfair trade practices complaint from the U.S. lumber industry, but it says it has found new evidence since then that the discounts Canada offers on cutting-rights fees do constitute unfair subsidies. </TEXT></DOC>
