Hiroshi Matsubara, 47 years old, a former top aide to the head of Recruit Cosmos, was charged with offering $38,000 in cash on three occasions to Yonosuke Narazaki of the opposition Social Democratic Alliance, officials said. One alleged attempt was filmed by a Tokyo television network.    Prosecutors said Mr. Matsubara offered Mr. Narazaki the money to cover up Recruit Cosmos's sale of unlisted stock to top politicians and business leaders, who then sold the shares for huge profits after the company went public. </TEXT></DOC>
