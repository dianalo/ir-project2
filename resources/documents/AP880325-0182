There were no reportsof injuries or damage.   The quake registered 6.0 on the Richter scale and was centeredabout 95 miles west of Fort Simpson, 750 miles northwest ofEdmonton, said Bob Wetmiller, a federal seismologist.   An earthquake of that magnitude can do serious damage, butWetmiller said it was too far from populated areas to pose a danger.   It struck 12:36 p.m. MST and was felt in communities severalhundred miles away, he said.   The last earthquakes of that magnitude in the region were in1985. One of 6.6 was reported Oct. 5 and another of 6.9 on Dec. 23that year.   The Richter scale is an open-ended gauge of energy released byan earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on aseismograph. Every increase of one number means that the groundmotion is 10 times greater.   A quake with a magnitude of 5 can cause considerable damage in apopulated area; a magnitude 6 quake severe damage, one of magnitude7 widespread, heavy damage and a magnitude 8 quake, a ``great''earthquake capable of tremendous damage.   A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans.</TEXT></DOC>
