Some were shot down and possibly killed. Some were captured byMoslem guerrillas and held in prison camps in Afghanistan, Iran orPakistan. Others just wandered outside one day and vanished.   Moscow has turned for help to the United States, which still istrying to trace the 2,400 American servicemen who disappearedduring the Vietnam War.   ``It's a problem that would cost the United States nothing tohelp solve and would mean a great deal to us,'' said Yuli M.Vorontsov, the Soviet Ambassador to Afghanistan and first deputyprime minister to President Mikhail Gorbachev.   ``You Americans shouldn't have any trouble understanding whythis is so important to us,'' Vorontsov said.   Vorontsov said the issue has been raised with the StateDepartment and the White House in hopes Washington will use itsinfluence as the guerrillas' principal weapons supplier.   The State Department says the issue is a ``matter ofhumanitarian concern,'' and it has urged the Soviets and guerrillarepresentatives to reach an agreement for the exchange of POWs.   ``We have discussed the exchange of POWs with representatives ofthe Afghan resistance. We have conveyed to the resistance and tothe Soviets our position that there should be no involuntaryrepatriation of POWs,'' said a department official, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   Vorontsov said his country has given the names of 313 missingsoldiers to the International Committee of the Red Cross.   ``We don't expect all of them to be alive,'' he said. ``We justwant to know what happened to them.''   The Red Cross is allowed to visit POW camps in Afghanistan andPakistan, which serves as the base for the guerrillas waging an11-year-old war with Afghanistan's Communist government.   Red Cross officials refuse to disclose any details about theirvisits, including prisoners' identifies and conditions.   They say it is difficult to say how many prisoners are held bythe Moslem guerrillas.   ``There are tens, maybe hundreds of groups fighting, and theirconnection is quite loose,'' said one Red Cross official.   ``Some (prisoners) are released, others are exchanged,transferred from one rebel group to another, or executed,'' theworker said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   According to rebel sources in Pakistan, four Soviet POWs weretraded recently for 100 guerrillas in one of Afghanistan's northernprovinces. There was no independent confirmation.   The rebel sources say it is unlikely there are more than 75Soviet prisoners _ if that many _ alive in Afghanistan.   And despite what the guerrillas call good will gestures, theyhave said they want to keep their prisoners as bargaining chipsshould they capture the capital of Kabul.   ``They always have an excuse,'' Vorontsov said. ``First theydidn't want to talk until the Soviet troops were gone. Now thatthey are, they say they'll only talk when there's a fullsettlement.''   On Feb. 15, under a U.N.-sponsored accord, the Soviet Unionpulled out the last of its troops, ending a military involvementthat began in December 1979. The communists had come to power in anApril 1978 coup that led to the guerrilla insurgency.</TEXT></DOC>
