Bernard Rogers, the departing North Atlantic Treaty Organization commander, said in a gloomy assessment of the future of Western security that he expects growing transatlantic friction, a cut in U.S. troops in Europe, and Soviet aggression against one of the allies to &quot;test&quot; the West's resolve.    Gen. Rogers, who disagrees sharply with U.S. arms-control plans, said in an interview at NATO military headquarters here that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev is exploiting Western divisions and public opinion to tip the balance of power toward the East and bring Western Europe under the Soviet sphere of influence. After eight years as allied military chief, Gen. Rogers was rejected by the White House for another two-year term and departs Friday. He will be succeeded by Gen. John R. Galvin.    Gen. Rogers, 65 years old, said he leaves his post with a &quot;pessimistic&quot; view of the outlook on defense. He said that view is made even gloomier by what he sees as a rush toward a dangerous U.S.-Soviet agreement to remove their land-based nuclear missiles from Europe. The Soviets, Gen. Rogers said, have expanded their conventional-arms advantage and want the pact to pave the way for a nuclear-free Europe that would be &quot;safe for conventional war.&quot; He also criticized the Reagan administration, which he said had pressured the Western Europeans into endorsing the European missile accord.    Mr. Gorbachev &quot;has got us just where he wants us,&quot; Gen. Rogers said. &quot;He's got all the initiative. And he's starting us down the slope toward the denuclearization of Western Europe. And when that happens, with the {Soviets'} massive conventional forces, to which piper's tune are {the Western Europeans} going to be dancing? They'll have no option but to accommodate to the East.&quot;    The conventional imbalance has widened so much during his term of command, the general said, that &quot;I personally think the day is coming that {the Soviet Union} is going to test us someplace -- northern Norway, eastern Turkey, Hamburg or Berlin -- and just see what the reaction would be. I'm not sure you could reach a consensus that NATO as a body would react to that test.&quot;    The Soviet Union's objective, Gen. Rogers said, is the &quot;intimidation, coercion and blackmail of Western Europe; I'm convinced that's her objective and the direction we're headed.&quot; Mr. Gorbachev will keep up a drumbeat of arms-control proposals, he predicted. He said the West should expect offers to eliminate nuclear weapons on warplanes, to withdraw Soviet troops from Eastern Europe in exchange for a U.S. troop pullout from Western Europe, and to scrap shorter-range nuclear missiles in Europe not covered by the accord already under negotiation.    While these proposals might appear attractive, Gen. Rogers said NATO should &quot;draw the line&quot; and say &quot;enough is enough.&quot; Further reductions of nuclear weapons wouldn't be in the West's interest, he said, because they &quot;will continue in the forseeable future to play the key factor in our deterrence of aggression.&quot;    Asked whether he had expressed this opinion directly to President Reagan, Gen. Rogers said he spoke only with aides when recently summoned to the Washington to explain his position.    He had sharp words for the administration's handling of the proposed accord to eliminate U.S. and Soviet missiles in Europe that have a range of 310 miles to 3,410 miles. Western leaders in general, he charged, had put political expedience first.    &quot;You've got governments that have a certain length of service, and one gets the impression that they want to accomplish this before that administration leaves,&quot; Gen. Rogers said. &quot;Particularly when you've got administrations that have major problems in other areas -- and I'm not just talking about the U.S.&quot;    After Secretary of State George Shultz's April meeting with the Soviets in Moscow, Gen. Rogers said the U.S. told its allies &quot;we have to make our mind up on this very quickly, we ought to do this in about three weeks, and incidentally we agree with Gorbachev's position. I think it's naive to think when you speak in those terms that there's not pressure being brought on the allies.&quot;    Mr. Shultz was quoted over the weekend as strongly disagreeing with Gen. Rogers, saying that the general was out of touch. Mr. Shultz also denied that the U.S. has hurried its allies.    Under the proposed European missile agreement, the Soviet Union would scrap or withdraw 1,300 warheads -- four times as many as the U.S. But Gen. Rogers said the Soviets would be giving up only about 8% of its warheads able to hit West Europe, while &quot;we're giving up the one thing that the Soviets fear most and that makes our deterrent the most credible&quot; -- Pershing II missiles that can hit the Soviet Union in 13 minutes from Western Europe.    On other topics, Gen. Rogers said U.S.-European tensions have grown during his eight year term, and were aggravated by U.S. behavior at the Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, last year, when proposals for a nuclear-free world were made without prior European consulation. &quot;People over here said: 'My God, they damn near gave away our security,'&quot; Gen. Rogers said.    Other signs of estrangement he sees are European concerns that the U.S. is developing its so-called Star Wars strategic defense system to protect itself, leaving its allies vulnerable. After the U.S. bombing of Libya last year, Gen. Rogers said, &quot;I have never sensed as much anti-Americanism in Western Europe, nor as much anti-Europeanism in the U.S. in response.&quot;    Within a decade, Gen. Rogers predicted, the U.S. will withdraw some of its 326,000 troops from Europe to save money, or out of resentment at West Europe's own defense efforts, or because the Americans will want to deploy them elsewhere. A proposal to withdraw troops &quot;would pass tomorrow&quot; in Congress, he said, if it were sponsored by a senior lawmaker with stature. He warned that such a move could &quot;begin to unravel this alliance&quot; and &quot;help the Soviets toward their objectives more than anything I know.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
