L. 100-233) (1987 Act) amended the Farm Credit Act of1971 (Act) by adding several new sections to Title IV of the Act relatingto the rights of those borrowing from System institutions. In particular,System institutions which are qualified lenders are directed to developpolicies governing the restructuring of distressed loans, as those termsare defined in the Act, and to submit such policies to FCA. Other revisedprovisions specify the review available to applicants and/or borrowerswho are denied credit or restructuring of their loans, provide protectionfor borrower stock and voluntary or involuntary advance payment accounts,clarify procedures to be used in informing borrowers about qualifying fordifferential interest rate programs, establish certain protections forborrowers who have met all loan obligations, and provide a right of firstrefusal to certain borrowers to repurchase or lease certain property acquiredby System institutions through foreclosure or voluntary conveyance. Inaddition, section 503(b) of the 1987 Act requires the FCA to prescriberules requiring System institutions to cooperate in good faith with requestsfor and analysis of information made in the course of mediation under anyState agricultural loan mediation program certified by the Secretary ofAgriculture in accordance with section 501 of the 1987 Act.On February 16, 1988, the FCA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(53 FR 4417) inviting public comment on how to revise FCA's current regulationsto address the new provisions of the Act. In response to the notice, commentswere received from the Farm Credit Corporation of America on behalf ofits 37 member banks. Supplemental comments were received from four individualdistricts. Five System associations, one State Attorney General, two groupsrepresenting family farmers, and three individuals also submitted comments.All comments received have been considered in drafting the proposed regulationswhich are published today. However, comments on sections of the Act concerningareas other than borrower rights, and opinions concerning enforcement ofany adopted regulations have not been individually addressed in this proposal.The proposed amendments to the regulations are explained below by sectionwithin the affected part of title 12, including any comments received onthe subject matter contained in that section. Comments which merely addressedthe need to delete sections of the existing regulations have not been referenced.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part 614_Loan Policies and Operations</ITAG>Subpart K_Disclosure of Loan InformationA technical amendment is proposed to be made to andSection; 614.4365 to referto ``qualified lender'' rather than System institution and to add a citationfor the Truth in Lending Act.The existing definitions in andSection; 614.4366 are proposed to be amendedto incorporate statutory language. Definitions of ``loan,'' ``loan originationcharges,'' and ``qualified lender'' are proposed to be added. The definitionsof loan and qualified lender are provided by the Act. Comments receivedindicated a need for clarification of the term ``loan origination charges''since that term is used, but not defined in the Act. The definition proposedin the regulation is based on similar terms used in the implementing regulationsand the commentary for the Truth in Lending Act. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR Part 226.Section 614.4367 is proposed to be revised to reflect the new languagein section 4.13 of the Act, including references to the qualified lender,the effect of loan origination charges on the effective interest rate,disclosure of the at-risk nature of borrower stock (except stock guaranteedunder section 4.9A of the Act), as well as the new disclosures requiredfor loans that will or may be pooled pursuant to section 8.9 of the Act.A minor change to Model Form 1 is proposed to reflect the new disclosurerequirements. One commenter questioned the usefulness of representativeexamples and sought borrower-specific loan disclosures. Given the clearstatutory language in this area, FCA does not believe it would be appropriateto require such disclosures. This commenter also requested that FCA developmodel disclosure forms for all the loan options available to borrowers,as well as for waiver of rights for loans sold in the secondary market.Considering the wide range of options which could be made available, FCAbelieves a model form in this area would be of little value. Another commenterrequested clarification of what ``loan options'' meant, indicating an assumptionthat such options mean the various interest rate programs available toborrowers. While FCA believes interest rate programs would be consideredloan options, individual lenders may have other types of programs whichshould also be disclosed. Therefore, FCA has not proposed a definitionof that term. With respect to loans sold in the secondary market, the disclosuresrequired by the statute and the regulations are explicit, obviating theneed for the requested model form. FCA has adopted a suggestion from thiscommenter and has included a requirement in andSection; 614.4367(b)(2) thatqualified lenders inform borrowers that rights, if any, under applicableState laws are not waived. A comment was received from one System institutionon the difficulty of timely compliance with the provisions of existingandSection; 614.4367(c), especially where rate changes were tied to anotherinstitution's rate changes or some other readily identifiable index. Thiscommenter recommended eliminating the requirement for advance notice ofa rate change in these cases. Although the time limit has not been changedin the proposed regulation, FCA requests comment on the extent of suchcompliance difficulties and suggestions for a revised timeframe if appropriate.Depending on the comments received, FCA will consider revising the timeframein the final regulation. The FCA disagrees with the commenter's assertionthat advance notice of rate changes is of little value to a borrower whoseonly option may be to refinance the obligation. In fact, the advance noticeis particularly relevant for such borrowers. It is also proposed to deleteexisting andSection; 614.4367(b) as the required disclosure has already beenmade. It is proposed to delete andSection; 614.4367 (e) and (f) and ModelForms 3 and 4 in their entirety as Banks for Cooperatives are no longersubject to the requirements. Deletion of andSection; 614.4367(g) is proposedas the Farm Credit System Capital Corporation was dissolved on January21, 1988 (53 FR 4072, February 11, 1988) pursuant to the 1987 Act.A new andSection; 614.4368 is proposed to address the disclosure of differentialinterest rates required by new section 4.13(b) of the Act. The languageof the proposed regulation tracks the statutory language.Subpart L_Notice of Action and ReviewIn order to more accurately reflect the topics covered, it is proposedto amend the heading of Subpart L to read as follows: <T3>``Subpart L_Actions on Applications; Review of Credit Decisions''.</T3>In andSection; 614.4440, the definitions of ``adverse credit decision'' and``applicant'' are proposed to be revised. One commenter requested thatFCA consider a denial of a formal application for a lower interest rateto be an adverse credit decision subject to credit review committe action.FCA believes the responsibilities of the credit review committee are clearlyestablished in the Act and therefore, has not adopted this suggestion.Definitions of ``application for restructuring,'' ``loan,'' ``qualifiedlender,'' and ``restructure'' or ``restructuring'' are proposed to be addedto this section based on the definitions of those terms in the Act.Section 614.4441 is proposed to be changed to delete references to ``Systeminstitutions'' and to substitute ``qualified lender'' as provided by theAct.Section 614.4442 is proposed to be changed to refer to qualified lendersand to provide that a loan officer who was involved in the adverse creditdecision on a loan may not participate in the credit review committee considerationof that loan, as provided by new section 4.14(a)(2) of the Act. One commenterindicated that, with the advent of the Farm Credit Banks as of July 5,1988, if a Federal Land Bank Association (FLBA) did not merge with a ProductionCredit Association (PCA), the Farm Credit Bank might be required to performall credit reviews at the bank level. The commenter suggested that Congresshad not intended this result. The FCA believes the definition of qualifiedlender in the statute is clear in that only direct lenders are affected.Therefore, FCA must assume that the result was intended. The make-up ofthe Farm Credit Bank's credit review committee is a matter for its discretion,provided, however, that a District board member serves on the committee.Other comments received on this section concerned providing for electionof the ``farmer'' on the board and the delegation of the duties of boardmembers on these credit review committees. The FCA thoroughly addressedsimilar concerns in adopting the existing regulations. The FCA finds nothingin the 1987 Act or its legislative history to support adopting a differentapproach at this time.Section 614.4443 is proposed to be revised to provide for the personalappearance of the borrower, accompanied by counsel and/or another representativeof choice, submission of documentation to the credit review committee,and the request for independent appraisals as provided in new section 4.14of the Act.Section 614.4444 is proposed to be revised to refer to qualified lendersand the maintenance of credit review committee records, and records, ifappropriate, on restructuring and participation in state mediation programs.One commenter suggested that FCA should clarify the purpose of such recordsand identify the class of persons intended to have access to such records.FCA establishes recordkeeping requirements such as these for System institutionsas part of its regulatory and examination responsibilities, in order toenable FCA to perform its examination functions properly. The circumstancesunder which other persons might obtain access to institution records arevaried and FCA believes it is inappropriate to specify them in this regulation.Subpart N_Loan Servicing RequirementsIn order to more accurately reflect the topics covered, it is proposedto amend the heading of Subpart N to read as follows: <T3>``Subpart N_Loan Servicing Requirements; Restructuring; State AgriculturalLoan Mediation Programs; Right of First Refusal''.</T3>One commenter requested that FCA continue the requirement in andSection;614.4510 that originating lenders ``<T3>shall</T3> be responsible for servicing the loans which they make,''in light of the provision in new section 8.9(d)(3) of the Act which providesthat originating lenders <T3>may</T3> retain servicing on loans which are pooled for sale in thesecondary market. (Emphasis added.) FCA believes the intent of the newprovision of the Act was to provide flexibility in this area to the lenders.However, no changes are proposed to the regulation at this time. Revisionsto the language of andSection; 614.4510 will be proposed in a separate <T4>Federal Register</T4> document. This commenter also requested FCA toclarify the language of andSection; 614.4510(d) to provide that loan servicingpolicies must be approved by FCA rather than ``furnished'' to FCA. Thetitle ``Approved policies'' refers to those policies approved by the banknot by FCA. The policies are, of course, subject to review for compliancewith the regulatory requirements and adequacy of direction to management.However, no specific FCA approval is required prior to implementation.As indicated above, FCA will propose amendments to andSection; 614.4510 ina separate <T4>Federal Register</T4> document.A new andSection; 614.4512 is proposed to provide definitions, for use inthe subpart, of ``Application for restructuring,'' ``Cost of foreclosure,''``distressed loan,'' ``foreclosure proceeding,'' ``loan,'' ``qualifiedlender,'' and ``restructure'' or ``restructuring.'' The definitions trackthe statutory language concerning these terms. Several commenters expressedconcern that the elements of the cost of foreclosure be clearly defined.While FCA appreciates the need to have all costs considered, it believesa regulation cannot exhaustively list what all such costs are, as theymay vary from State to State and possibly even loan to loan. Therefore,the definition includes item (5) which is intended to address any costnot specified but which nonetheless must be considered. One commenter wasconcerned that the definition of restructuring in section 4.14A(a)(7) ofthe Act be clarified so as not to apply in situations where routine extensionsand other changes in loan contracts were made, as a result of product marketingplans or other changes in operational plans where distress is not involved.FCA believes this commenter may have misinterpreted the scope of section4.14A of the Act as the definition of restructuring only applies to loanswhich are distressed. Furthermore, institutions may consider restructuringon loans at any time if it is determined to be in the best interest ofthe lender.It is proposed to delete existing andSection; 614.4513 ``Forbearance,'' inits entirety as the Act's provisions concerning restructuring are now applicable.To implement the provisions of new section 4.37 of the Act, ``Applicationof Uninsured Accounts,'' a new andSection; 614.4513 is proposed to be addedproviding for the establishment of advance payment accounts by all qualifiedlenders. Necessary revisions to the regulations in 12 CFR Part 611 concerningthe disposition of these accounts by receivers, and revisions to andSection;614.4090 concerning Federal land bank lending authorities, will be proposedin separate <T4>Federal Register</T4> documents.A new andSection; 614.4514, ``Protection of Borrowers Who Meet All Loan Obligations,''is proposed to address the prohibitions contained in new section 4.14Dof the Act. The language of this section tracks the statutory language.One commenter requested clarification that advanced taxes, insurance premiums,attorneys' fees, and advertising costs must be collected before a loanis considered current. FCA believes that the loan documents specificallyidentify that money must be collected before a loan is considered currentand that to specify a list in the regulation would be inappropriate. Anothercommenter stated that FCA should require that an agreement to alter theprohibition against required principal reduction in section 4.14D(b)(2)of the Act be a separately negotiated document from the original loan contract.The FCA has not adopted this suggestion as it believes the form of theagreement is a matter to be decided by the parties.The proposed new andSection;andSection; 614.4515 through 614.4520 address thequalified lenders' obligations under the restructuring provisions of theAct, including the procedures to be followed in determining when to restructure,the borrower's right to a review of a denial of restructuring by the creditreview committee of the lender, the notice required before foreclosure,and when foreclosure proceedings must be terminated. Although FCA is proposingregulations addressing these areas, the requirements were applicable toall distressed loans of qualified lenders, as those terms are defined inthe Act, on the date of enactment of the 1987 Act. A commenter expressedconcern that the qualified lender's policies concerning restructuring issuedpursuant to section 4.14A(g) of the Act were not informative enough asthey merely echoed the statutory provisions. This commenter requested FCAto specify the contents of the policies. FCA will review the policies submittedpursuant to section 4.14A(g)(3) of the Act to determine compliance withthe statutory provisions but has not included specific requirements forsuch policies as they were required to be adopted prior to the promulgationof these regulations. FCA anticipates that lenders will update their policiesas they gain experience in implementing the provisions of the Act. Whilethe language of these sections generally tracks the statutory provisions,new andSection; 614.4514(d) includes an example of an adverse action in connectionwith placing a loan in nonaccrual status. FCA invites comments on whetherfurther examples, or a definition of ``adverse action,'' should be includedin the subsection.One commenter requested that the notice of denial of restructuring, requiredby andSection; 615.4518, include the calculations used by the lender to determinethe cost of restructuring and foreclosure, and any other evidence usedby the institution in considering the application. While FCA does not agreethat this information should be required as part of the notice, it acknowledgesthat access to some of the critical assumptions and calculations used bythe lender in reaching its determinations could be helpful to the borrowerin deciding whether to appeal. Therefore, in andSection; 615.4518(d), theFCA has included a requirement for notice of whom to contact at the lenderto obtain access to this information. FCA has not specified what informationthe lender must make available but invites comment on whether such a listingis required, and if so, the type of information that should be included.One commenter indicated that FCA's authority to issue a directive requiringcompliance with the restructuring provisions in new section 4.14A of theAct requires additional regulations. FCA has not proposed any new regulationsspecifically concerning its enforcement authority in this area as it believesregulations are not warranted given the clear statutory language. Thiscommenter also requested that FCA monitor credit review committee activityin districts where no Special Asset group existed and othewise ensure thatinstitutions were complying with the applicable provisions of these sections.FCA is, of course, required to do so by statute and is committed to doingso. Another commenter requested that andSection; 614.4519 provide that therequired 45-day notice period runs prior to the time the lender issuesa summons and complaint in a foreclosure proceeding, as that term is definedin section 4.14A(a)(4) of the Act and proposed andSection; 614.4512(e) ofthe regulations. This would allow the notice of intent to foreclose periodto run concurrently with the 45-day distressed loan restructure period.FCA has not adopted this suggestion but invites comment on whether theregulation should specify when a foreclosure proceeding begins, e.g., whena loan is accelerated, issuance of a summons and complaint, etc. This commenteralso requested that FCA specify that debtors' rights under bankruptcy lawssubstitute for the rights provided under the Act when a borrower filesbankruptcy. FCA believes this is a determination for the Courts to makeand has not included such a provision in the proposed regulations. Section614.4519(c) provides that a certified lender may commence foreclosure proceedingsafter any applicable credit review committee consideration has been completed.However, since the restructuring decisions of certified lenders are subjectto review by the District Special Asset Group, foreclosure proceedingswould have to be terminated if that group prescribed a restructuring planacceptable to the borrower. FCA believes this balances the borrower's rightto review of the denial of restructuring against the certified lender'sright to timely foreclosure action where it is warranted.A new andSection; 614.4520 is proposed to address the review of restructuringdecisions required for institutions which are certified eligible to receiveassistance under new section 6.4 of the Act.A new andSection; 614.4521 is proposed to address the requirement for cooperationwith certified State agricultural loan mediation programs and providesthat such participation may occur concurrently with the required restructuringunder new section 4.14A of the Act. Comments received supported the provisionthat the processes could occur simultaneously. Given the requirement forcertification by the Secretary of Agriculture and the possibility of widevariations in State programs, the FCA does not currently anticipate a needto specify more detailed processes for cooperation. However, FCA will considerdoing so if experience with the programs demonstrates it is necessary.One commenter sought to have FCA mandate participation in mediation programseven if the mediation is initiated by another creditor of the borrower.FCA believes that participation in State mediation programs, other thanthose specified in section 503(b) of the 1987 Act, is governed by the applicableState law and has not adopted this suggestion. Section 614.4521 would alsoimplement the provisions of new section 4.14E of the Act by prohibitingconditioning of a loan from a System institution on the waiver of rightsunder a State mediation program. One commenter expressed concern that sucha general prohibition be included in the regulations. One non-System commenterexpressed support for the mediation process in general, based on experiencein that commenter's State, and commended the process for use by Systeminstitutions. This commenter also supported disclosure of lender informationto the borrower in the process of the mediation to ensure meaningful negotiations.This issue was addressed more fully above in connection with proposed andSection;614.4518.A new andSection; 614.4522 is proposed to address the right of first refusalprovided in new section 4.36 of the Act. One commenter requested that FCAspecify that all acquired property be sold through public auction as itwas asserted that this process would assure the highest price for the property.This commenter also wanted to assure competition between auctioneers forthe right to sell the property. FCA believes the decision concerning themanner of disposing of acquired property, if consistent with sound businesspractices, is a matter of discretion for the lender and, therefore, hasnot adopted this commenter's suggestions. Another commenter indicated thatsale by public auction has become more commonplace since enactment of the1987 Act. This commenter requested FCA to require notification to the borrowerof the fair market value of the property even if it is to be sold at publicauction, and to require that a minimum bid must always be specified. FCAbelieves such requirements go beyond those in the statute and has not adoptedthese suggestions.<ITAG tagnum="85">Part 615_Funding and Fiscal Affairs, Loan Policies and Operations,and Funding Operations</ITAG>Subpart J_Prescription, Subscription and Retirementof StockIn order to implement the provisions of new section 4.14B of the Act, itis proposed to add three new paragraphs, (e), (f), and (g) to andSection;615.5255. Paragraphs (e) and (f) address the cancellation of stock by anFLB and FLBA, or by a PCA in the event principal is forgiven in the courseof a restructuring under new andSection; 614.4516. Paragraph (g) providesthat a borrower shall be entitled to retain at least one share of stockto maintain membership and voting rights in the association.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part 618_General Provisions</ITAG>Subpart G_Releasing InformationIn order to implement the provisions of new section 4.12A of the Act, ``Communicationswith Stockholders'', it is proposed to revise andSection; 618.8310(b)(1)to provide that System institutions will make stockholder lists availablewithin 7 days of receipt of a request from a stockholder. No other changesare proposed to the language of that section.It is also proposed to amend andSection; 618.8320(b) to add a new paragraphnumbered (9) which would authorize release of data concerning borrowersand loan applicants to the appropriate District Special Asset Group, ifany, and the National Special Asset Council upon the request of eitherof these entities.To implement the new provisions of section 4.13A of the Act, ``Access toDocuments and Information,'' it is proposed to revise andSection; 618.8325(a)to add new definitions of ``loan'' and ``qualified lender.'' Paragraph(b) is revised to substitute qualified lender wherever ``bank or association''is used in the existing regulation. Paragraph (b) is further revised toinclude the requirement to furnish a copy of each appraisal of the borrower'sassets made or used by the qualified lender. In response to comments received,the FCA also proposes to add language that one copy of the documents shallbe furnished free of charge to the borrower but that the lender may assessreasonable copying charges for any additional copies requested by the borrower.One commenter suggested that appraisal documents only need be providedto one primary obligor. However, FCA believes it is appropriate to furnisheach borrower, as that term is defined in this section, with a copy ofany appraisal of that borrower's assets. Another commenter suggested thata request from a borrower for a copy of ``my appraisal'' should be interpretedto mean only the most recent appraisal. Since the statute provides thatcopies of documents shall be provided at the request of the borrower, FCAbelieves the language of the borrower's request would control what documentswould be responsive to that request. Since the statute also clearly says``copies of each appraisal,'' FCA believes it would be contrary to legislativeintent to narrowly interpret the language of a request to mean only themost recent appraisal, unless such an interpretation is clearly intendedby the borrower. FCA acknowledges the time and expense to the qualifiedlender in order to comply with this statutory provision but believes theseexpenses must be construed as business expenses pursuant to the Act. Finally,comments were received on the need to protect confidential informationused by the lender in the appraisal process, such as information on thevalue of other borrowers' property, private sales of acquired property,and benchmark comparables obtained under a pledge of confidentiality. TheFCA invites comments on whether and how to limit disclosure of such informationin the regulation or whether this issue can more appropriately be addressedon an individual basis.Finally, the notice published on February 16, 1988 (53 FR 4417) requestedcomment on whether a public hearing would contribute to the FCA's considerationof these topics. Three comments were received, two in support of such ahearing and one which indicated a hearing was not necessary. It is anticipatedthat a hearing will be scheduled.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Parts 614, 615, and 618</ITAG>Agriculture, Banks, Banking, Credit, Foreign trade, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Rural areas, Accounting, Government securities, Investments,Archives and records, Insurance, Technical assistance.For the reasons stated in the preamble, Parts 614, 615, and 618 of ChapterVI of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations are proposed to be amendedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 614_LOAN POLICIES AND OPERATIONS</ITAG>1.
