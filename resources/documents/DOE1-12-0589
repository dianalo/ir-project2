Afterthe conclusion of sampling the filter activity is measured for another10 minutes. In order to then determine the latent energy of the radon222 daughter products and to bring into account the radon 220 daughterproducts in the total activity measurements of the filter are taken fora second time for 30 minutes five hours after initial sampling. The levelof latent energy of the combined daughter products are calculated byan equation which incorporates alpha particle detection efficiency, aerosolretention efficiency in the filter, and the Kuznets coefficients, andanalyzes the separate and combined contributions of both daughter productsfrom both sampling periods. A statistical analysis employing the Markovmethod is also depicted in modified form and is recommended when a morerapid analysis of air radioactivity is mandated.</TEXT></DOC>
