Moammar Gadhafi's promise ofcontinued support for liberation and alleged terrorist groups aroundthe world, Western and Palestinian sources say the Libyan leader iscutting back on such aid.   The sources said Sunday that Gadhafi has told several Palestiniangroups they no longer will receive direct funding from hisgovernment and they should close their offices in Libya.   The reports could signal an effort by Gadhafi to appear moremoderate as he tries to rebuild international ties.   The sources, speaking on condition they not be identified, werein Tripoli for weekend ceremonies celebrating the coup 20 years agothat brought Gadhafi to power.   One source in the Palestine Liberation Organization said Gadhafihas provided about $5 million since April 1988 to support thePalestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and GazaStrip, with the money going direcly to hospitals, universities andrelief organizations. The uprising began in December 1987.   The source also said Gadhafi's regime has not given any money tothe PLO since 1975.   If the reports are true, the actions could reflect what appearedto be Gadhafi's efforts during the weekend ceremonies to improve hisimage with the West and reduce Libya's isolation from theinternational community.   But Gadhafi, in his main anniversary speech Friday, promised tocontinue to support ``freedom-fighters'' around the world,declaring, ``We stand in the trenches with you. It is our duty.''   Economics also may be a factor in the stinginess. Libya currentlyreceives up to $6 billion annually from oil revenues, but it isestimated the government spends up to $8 billion a year and itsforeign reserves are dwindling.   The Palestinian source said Gadhafi angered Syria-basedPalestinian groups when he told them three months ago they would nolonger receive direct funding.   A Western diplomat said Gadhafi refused to meet with leaders ofthe Palestinian groups who flew to Tripoli last month to ask theLibyan leader to reconsider and he refused.   PLO chief Yasser Arafat attended the anniversary celebrations butleaders of various other Palestinian factions did not.   One Western diplomat said Saturday that Gadhafi called inrepresentatives of 70 different groups in August and told them``they had to close shop here (in Tripoli) and for financialassistance they had to go through official channels.''   The diplomat, who added he could not identify the 70 groups, said``official channels'' meant the request for funds had to be made toLibyan officials and if money was granted it would be distributedthrough relief organizations.   U.S. officials accused Libya of being involved in the 1986terrorist bombing of a disco in West Berlin that killed an Americanserviceman and a Turkish woman. U.S. warplanes bombed Tripoli andBenghazi in retaliation.   President Ronald Reagan ordered an embargo on Libya the same yearbecause of terrorists attacks at the Rome and Vienna airports inDecember 1985. The United States blamed Palestinian terrorist AbuNidal for the attacks and accused Gadhafi of harboring him.</TEXT></DOC>
