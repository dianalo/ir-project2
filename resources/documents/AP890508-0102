KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A group of American and Soviet scientists,saying technology is available to verify virtually all forms ofarms control agreements, urged on Monday that up to 90 percent ofexisting U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons and warheads eventually bedestroyed.   At a briefing in a House hearing room, American physicists alsodemonstrated a device which they said shows the feasibility ofdetecting anti-satellite laser bursts, effectively monitoring afuture ban on laser beams of destructive intensity.   The briefing was held under the auspices of Rep. George Brown,D-Calif., who said that ``these scientists have shown thatessentially all the major verification problems can be solved,given a little creativity and some solid cooperation.''   The problem of assuring effective verification is an obstacle toa new treaty making deep cuts in strategic, intercontinentalnuclear weapons. U.S.-Soviet negotiations on such a treaty areexpected to resume in Geneva later this year.   Previous treaties, such as the pact banning medium-range,nuclear-armed missiles in Europe and elsewhere, require thedestruction of only the delivery systems, not the actual warheads.   Warheads were not affected for various reasons, including thefear on both sides that an inspection of their destruction wouldreveal the secrets of their design.   Frank von Hipple, a physicist and professor of public policy atPrinceton University, representing the American Federation ofScientists, outlined a system in which, for example, Soviet nuclearwarheads would be taken to a central facility to be dismantled inprivacy by Soviet technicians.   American inspectors on the perimeter of the facility would makesure that actual warheads entered the facility and that no warheadswere removed.   The fissionable material would be removed under internationalsafeguards to civilian reactors, and the facility would beinspected to make sure no warheads had been hidden.   Von Hipple said other verification obstacles also could beovercome.   For example, a limit on the number of nuclear-armed warheads ona single missile could be verified by sensors without the necessityof actually looking under the weapon's protective shroud, he said.   Von Hipple said that effective verification could lead to fardeeper reductions in nuclear arms than so far contemplated and toshutting down nuclear reactors producing weapons-grade material.   ``We are looking toward 90 percent reductions,'' he said, addingthat he believes the remaining nuclear deterrent on both sideswould be secure and stabilizing.   A senior Soviet scientist, Roald Z. Sagdeev, chairman of theCommittee on International Security and Arms Control of the SovietAcademy of Sciences, said the proposals outlined by Von Hipplewould provide ``a technical basis for the future.''   ``It is conceptually feasible to create the technology forverification which would at the same time provide protection forthe secrets of military design,'' he said.   A team of American scientists, who had set up a small laser inthe hearing room, demonstrated how the scattered light produced bythe laser beam could be detected by a monitoring device and fedinto a computer to measure its intensity.   They suggested that equipment could be developed that would fitinto a van to be parked in the vicinity of an actual or suspectedlaser generating facility.   They said laser rays could be detected from a site up to akilometer away from such a site. The distance would be sufficient,they said, not to intrude on the actual site itself.   Sagdeev was asked if the Soviet Union would permit suchintrusive on-site inspection.   ``I would suspect it's negotiable,'' he replied.   Brown said if it can be proved that bursts from a ground-basedlaser can be monitored and measured, that could serve as the basisfor a treaty blocking the development of such laser-poweredanti-satellite weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
