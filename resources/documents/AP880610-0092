The arrest, announced Thursday, was the latest event in agrowing scandal over dumping of toxic wastes in Africa by developedcountries.   Proposals for shipping such material are on the increase,according to a Greenpeace International report released Thursday inCaracas, Venezuela.

The toxic material, which was dumped on the island of Kassa offConakry, originated in the United States, Diaby said. He said itwas shipped from Philadelphia.   The West African nation's government said a Norwegian companywith government links, Aluko-Guinee, imported the waste and wasstill holding 85,000 tons.   Diaby said the waste had been imported under the guise ofconstruction materials, and the company was to receive $50 per tonfor each ton of waste.   The government has demanded that the waste be returned at thecost of the company.   The dumping was discovered when trees began dying on the island,the government said.
