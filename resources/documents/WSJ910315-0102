Greenberger   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/28/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><CO>   JAPAN EUROP MDEST</CO><GV>EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG)DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The head of the Congressional Budget Officesaid the Bush administration's estimates of the cost of thewar with Iraq appear to be &quot;overstated.&quot;   CBO Director Robert Reischauer, testifying before theHouse Budget Committee yesterday, also said that &quot;alliedcontributions may well offset the substantial majority of theadded costs of the war.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   However, Mr. Reischauer said he doesn't anticipate thatall $9 billion of Japan's public pledge toward the war costswill come to the U.S. Although Bush administration tallieshave counted the whole sum toward the promised $53.5 billionin foreign contributions, administration officials nowconfirm that while most will come to the U.S., some will goto other countries, principally France and Britain.   Using cost figures provided publicly by theadministration, Mr. Reischauer said the entire operationprobably will cost the U.S. about $45 billion &quot;if the warends today or tomorrow, which is obviously what ishappening.&quot;   But Mr. Reischauer said that figure inappropriatelyincludes $2.8 billion for higher fuel bills not just forforces involved in Operation Desert Storm but for all U.S.forces world-wide. In addition, the Pentagon numbers assumedoil prices higher than those that currently prevail.   He also said the administration appears to be planning toreplace more destroyed equipment and munitions than Congressmay decide is necessary in the post-Cold War era. ThePentagon says it intends to rebuild inventories only tolevels it projected before the Gulf war, but it doesn't planto reconsider whether those inventory levels are stillappropriate.   The administration hasn't provided a firm estimate of warcosts, saying the uncertainties were too great.   Word that the Japanese contribution is to be shared is &quot;amajor change,&quot; said Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), a memberof the committee. &quot;My impression was that the $9 billion wasall for the U.S.&quot;   A Japanese Embassy official said Japan's contributionwould go to the Gulf Cooperation Council, made up of Arabstates arrayed against Saddam Hussein. The council wouldallocate the money, and the &quot;predominant part&quot; would go tothe U.S., the embassy official said. Japan says the councilalso received last year's contribution of $2 billion, ofwhich $1.7 billion went to the U.S.   American officials haven't gone out of their way toexplain how the Japanese contribution is being routed. Duringa State Department briefing earlier this year, spokeswomanMargaret Tutwiler said the U.S. had agreed that, at Japan'srequest, the money would be used for logistical items and notfor weapons.   The Japanese Embassy official noted that before the moneycan be released it will have to be approved by Japan's Diet,or parliament. The official said he expected that theappropriation would be approved today by the lower house, butthat the upper house might not take up the measure forseveral weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
