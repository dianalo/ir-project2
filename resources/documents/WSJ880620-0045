However, several communists and sympathizers interviewed since the March 29 raids maintain that despite the raids their movement isn't in retreat. President Corazon Aquino said the raids demonstrate that the government's counterinsurgent effort is winning. The communists disagree.    &quot;By having been able to make these arrests and seizures, the government acquired the ground to claim the armed forces is capable of outwitting or tactically putting one over on the left,&quot; says Satur Ocampo, spokesman for the radical coalition National Democratic Front, which includes the Communist Party. &quot;But that's far from being able to claim that they've turned the tide.&quot;    The front was set up in the early 1970s to link several leftist organizations. Mr. Ocampo, who the military alleges is one of the communist movement's senior officials, made his comments in a clandestine interview. Mr. Ocampo and other rebel sources presented a picture of an insurgency slowed -- but not stalled -- by several events over the past few months. These include not only the Manila raids and some less-dramatic arrests a month earlier, but a buoyant economy and the continued popularity of President Aquino.    The communists also admitted that with the seizure of documents and computer files, the military has gained insights into what a communist official termed medium-term &quot;tactical and strategic guidelines&quot; of the communists that could assist counterinsurgency efforts.    The rebels acknowledge that by feeding the public a mix of accurate and inaccurate information, the military can keep its own credibility high while it keeps both rebel sympathizers and rank-and-file insurgents off guard. Loss of morale is &quot;definitely an effect,&quot; one NPA spokesman says.    Mr. Ocampo believes that the people most affected by the March events are the so-called &quot;middle forces,&quot; once-sympathetic professionals, intellectuals and bureaucrats who have vacillated between support for the Aquino government and the underground, anti-government movement.    Mr. Ocampo says that, contrary to previous speculation, U.S. civilians aren't being singled out by communist hit squads. However, he adds that agents of the Central Intelligence Agency and U.S. military personnel assisting the Philippine military are legitimate targets. (The U.S. denies allegations that its personnel assist the counterinsurgency effort.)    Last October, communists killed three U.S. servicemen outside Clark Air Base, a decision made by the local command but supported by communist officials. &quot;We project if the war intensifies to the disadvantage of the Aquino government, more direct {U.S.} intervention may take place,&quot; Mr. Ocampo says. &quot;We'd like to prevent that.&quot;    The communist sources also made the following disclosures:   --Multinational companies, especially those with plantations on the southern island of Mindanao, are likely to be attacked.    --Several non-U.S. foreigners, mostly those involved in development projects, have been warned about their work in areas where the NPA operates. The warnings are so far the extent of any possible action against the foreigners.    --NPA hit squads, known as &quot;sparrow units,&quot; were responsible for the April murder of a Manila businessman and an unsuccessful attempt to kill the mayor of a Manila suburb a month earlier. (Both attacks appear to represent a change in policy. In the past, the sparrow units concentrated on killing police and military personnel.)    --The number of armed NPA personnel is substantially lower than military -- and U.S. government -- estimates. However, the NPA spokesman wouldn't reveal the army's exact strength. Earlier this year, Armed Forces Chief of Staff Renato de Villa said that the NPA has 15,000 armed guerrillas. He placed the total number of Communist Party/NPA members at 23,000 to 25,000. </TEXT></DOC>
