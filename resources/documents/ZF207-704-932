 To do so, theyneed a tool that can illustrate spatially complex data and make it easier towork with.andP;  Tactics International's Fastmap is such a tool.andM;Fastmap is a computer-assisted mapping and analysis program that can helpmanagers organize and analyze data, particularly geographic data.andP;  UsingFastmap, managers can work directly with the geography of the marketingworld.andM;Tacties International was established in the early 1970s as a marketingconsulting agency in Australia.andP;  At that time, most of the company's clientswere engaged in retailing and sales-territory management, and turned toTactics International to help them research and resolve complex issues.andM;An executive for a clothingstore chain who wanted to open a new retailoutlet, for example, might ask Tactics International to evaluate consumerdemand, determine competitors' locations and weaknesses and estimatepotential annual gross revenues.andM;Because the data needed to analyze issues like these is often voluminous andcomplex, a manual analysis of the data often proves tedious and isnecessarily cursory.andP;  So, with the aid of an Australian government researchorganization, Tactics International developed a software program calledFastmap for its own in-house use.andM;Interest in the new analysis tool grew, and in 1987 the company was invitedto exhibit at DEC-world.andP;  As a result of the response to this exhibit,Tactics International decided to market the system commercially and to phaseout of the marketing consulting business by the end of next year.andM;Fastmap consists of a highly interactive mapping, analysis andreport-generation tool tied to an Oracle database management engine.andP;  Inpractice, the system requires a combination of hardware, software and twodatabases--a cartographic database and an attribute database.andM;WHAT IT DOESandM;Fastmap's cartographic database is typically used to define market-resourceregions such as census tracts and ZIP code boundaries, as well as referencedata such as highways, coastlines and streets.andP;  The attribute databaseconsists of data that applies to the market-resource regions defined in thecartographic database.andP;  The attribute database might include census data,commercial marketing data and a company's own sales, retail and marketingdata.andM;Fastmap runs under VMS on any of DEC's eight-plane colorworkstations--including the VAX-station 2000, II/GPX, 3200 and 3500--whichhave a minimum of 8MB of memory.andP;  DR Labs reviewed Fastmap running on aVAXstation II/GPX and using a proprietary Tactics database consisting of U.S.andO;Census, ZIP code region and shopping center data.andM;Mass storage requirements vary, depending on database size.andP;  However, aspokesperson for Tactics International told us that typical applicationsrange from 150MB to 2,000MB.andM;Most users will need to invest in companion software.andP;  Oracle is almostessential, because Fastmap's attribute data tables and report-generationfacilities are organized on the Oracle system.andP;  Users can merge any Oracletable with a Fastmap data table by including a feature identifier key in theOracle table to link the table's attributes to a geographical feature in thecurrent cartographic database.andM;Fastmap doesn't include any utilities for creating the cartographic database.andO;Most users purchase their data from a commercial or government databasevendor.andP;  The preferred format in Fastmap is the U.S.andP;  Geological Survey'sDLG-3 (Digital Line Graph Level 3) format.andP;  However, several other formats,such as AutoCAD's DXF, the U.S.andP;  Census Burean's DIME (Dual Independent MapEncoded) and Etak Inc.'s Etak, are supported for use with other commercialand government cartographic databases.andM;The only output driver that comes with Fastmap is a PostScript driver, butFastmap can also produce Uniras plot files and allows users to preview thesefiles on the screen.andM;NAVIGATING THE DATAandM;Working with Fastmap is a delight.andP;  Once the appropiate databases areinstalled, users can navigate them visually as though they were working withone seamless entity.andM;For our review, DR Labs worked with a database supplied by TacticsInternational.andP;  The map data included census tracts, ZIP code boundaries,highways, interstates and shopping centers for the entire United States.andO;Some urban areas also included city streets.andM;All regions (including census tracts and ZIP codes) and shopping centers hada wealth of demographic and socioeconomic data, along with data on the marketpotential for a variety of commodities.andM;After loading the program, the user begins a Fastmap session by clicking on amenu named Overlays.andP;  Like most automated mapping systems, the Fastmapdatabase is organized into layers.andP;  For example, ZIP code boundaries mightform one layer, and highways might form another.andM;The Overlays menu allows users to enable or disable different layers in thecartographic database, creating visual overlays when the layers are drawn onthe screen.andP;  The visual priority of layers is dictated by their order in alist that determines which overlay will appear in areas of conflict.andP;  Userscan also set the color and size (e.g., line thickness or symbol size) ofoverlay features by using the Overlays menu.andM;After building a list of overlays, users can access the Move menu to navigatethrough the database.andP;  The screen center can be selected by choosing a ZIPcode number, place name (e.g., Boston) or state name.andP;  After a state name isspecified, a list of possible ZIP codes or place names appears.andM;Users can also specify the center of the screen by entering x and ycoordinates or by &quot;panning&quot; (shifting) the map from the previous position.andO;The map can also be positioned to fit a given overlay or a subset of overlayfeatures defined by a separate attribute data table.andM;Asking Fastmap to fit the screen to a data set obviously determines the scaleof the map as well as its position.andP;  Users who specify only the center of themap can use Fastmap's scaling features (Fig.andP;  1).andM;Like most automated mapping systems, Fastmap allows the user to zoom in andout from any location.andP;  However, the user can also specify the scale directlyby indicating the &quot;height&quot; above the map surface.andP;  In essence, the heightmeasurement provides a view that corresponds to the view that would beavailable from an airplane or spacecraft at that height.andM;When users start to move around the database, they'll find that Fastmap livesup to its name.andP;  Moving from a height of several thousand miles to only twomiles and then from the East Coast to the West Coast takes only a fewseconds.andM;The overlay system is sensitive to scale.andP;  Users can attach information toeach overlay in the database to indicate at which height the overlay shouldbecome active.andP;  For example, because a county boundary layer might providetoo much detail at some scales and not enough at others, users can choose todraw it only when the height is less than 1,000 miles but greater than 10miles.andM;Fastmap's simplest and most useful feature may be its facility for examiningthe attributes of map features.andP;  The first and most direct means of examiningmap attributes is to use the &quot;Where am I?&quot; feature on the Other menu.andM;As the name suggests, &quot;Where am I?&quot; allows users to point to a location withthe mouse to determine its position.andP;  However, in addition to geographicalcoordinates, &quot;Where am I?&quot; also returns the name and identifier of thenearest feature in each of the active overlays.andP;  By clicking the mousebutton, users can bring up specific attribute data related to that feature.andM;The first time that users request attribute data for a specific overlay,Fastmap asks for the name of the appropriate Oracle table.andP;  Subsequentinquiries are serviced using the same table unless the user requests a tablechange.andM;OTHER CHOICESandM;While the Other menu can be used to specify a location and ask for itsattributes, users can also access this menu to specify the attributes and askfor associated locations.andP;  Using SQL, users can address a query to Oraclesuch as SELECT FEATURE ID FROM ZIPDDATA WHERE MEDIAN INCOME [IS GREATER THAN]30000.andP;  All ZIP code areas meeting that criterion would then be highlightedin red on the map.andM;For a more dramatic effect, users can access the Data menu to display thevariable attributes for a layer in the form of a thematic map.andP;  Like the&quot;Where am I?&quot; command, the thematic mapping option requires a specific linkbetween the features in an overlay and an Oracle data table.andP;  If such a linkdoesn't exist, the user must establish it.andM;The Data menu also allows the user to create a subset of the database toproduce a thematic map for a specific region.andM;After defining the data variable and map region, users can produce achoropleth map, which Fastmap calls a &quot;Color Map,&quot; to depict regional data.andO;The data range is divided into a few data classes, each of which is assigneda color.andP;  The map is then produced by assigning a color to each region, basedon the appropriate data class (Fig.andP;  2).andM;Fastmap provides eight methods for classifying data.andP;  The &quot;By Values&quot; (equalintervals) method divides the data range into any user-assigned number ofclasses, each with an equal range.andP;  For example, a map of percentage datawith four classes by value would have classes from 0 to 24 percent, 25 to 49percent, 50 to 74 percent and 75 to 100 percent.andM;Classifying data &quot;By Counts&quot; (or quantiles) puts regions in order by rank andthen divides them into equal numbers in each class.andP;  The &quot;By Means&quot; method(otherwise known as the &quot;standard deviation units&quot; scheme) divides the datarange into an even number of standard deviation units on either side of themean.andM;Three further methods let users set specific break values or frequencieswithin each class, and the final two techniques allow users to examine twovariables at once.andM;The next step is to assign a color scheme to the data classes constructed.andO;Usually this is done so the colors visually mimic the logic of theclassification scheme, the simplest color scheme being one that progressesfrom light to dark.andP;  Fastmap offers an extensive set of schemes, along withthe ability to create and store new schemes to meet user requirements.andM;INTERACTIVE ANALYSISandM;Although Fastmap's capabilities for examining and mapping data are among itsmore useful features, its interactive map analysis capability may be the mostdistinctive one.andP;  This capability is embodied in two menu systems--the Sitesmenu and the Territories menu.andM;The Sites menu includes a list of operations that can be used to illustratethe resources available to a location.andP;  The items in the Territories menu, onthe other hand, deal with regions, such as sales territories, that must beanalyzed and balanced with respect to one or more data variables.andP;  Both menusare specially tailored to address the problems that marketing specialiststypically encounter.andM;Using the Sites menu, users first define the trade areas for one or morelocations (such as retail outlets, for example).andP;  These areas can becircular--defined by center and radius--or irregular polygon zones that aredigitized on the screen.andP;  Once the trade areas are defined, they can bestored in a permanent &quot;site file&quot; for future use.andM;After defining the trade areas, users can use the Sites menu to determine howdata will be apportioned to the sites.andP;  One of the options allows users toassign all of the data from each marketing region whose central point fallswithin the site boundary.andM;The other option assigns only a portion of a marketing region's data,depending on the proportion of the region's area that is enclosed by the siteboundary.andP;  After using either option, users can aggregate the data from aselected attribute file for each site according to the logic of the optionselected.andM;Of course, users can aggregate data by sites to generate specific reportsabout site locations.andP;  However, one of the chief applications of the Sitesfacility is to interactively vary the trade boundaries of sites and observethe effect on aggregated data values (Fig.andP;  3).andM;Using Fastmap's interactive site analysis feature, it is quite easy todetermine the relative market potential of different sites for differentproducts.andP;  In addition, users may add or delete sites, redefine trade areasand receive immediate feedback on the change in market potential.andM;Like the Sites operations, the Territories operations are used primarily foraggregating and displaying map data.andP;  But the Territories options are usedspecifically to balance sales territories with hierarchical levels ofresponsibility.andM;Unlike site trade areas, sales territories cannot include partial marketreporting zones, such as ZIP code regions.andP;  Each territory is built byassigning market zones to a specific territory.andP;  In addition, territories maybe further aggregated into districts and regions.andM;OCCUPIED TERRITORIESandM;Once users have created their territories, a spreadsheet window can be openedto examine the aggregated total on a set of selected variables for eachterritory.andP;  This spreadsheet also shows a simple histogram and each zone'spercentage of deviation from the average for all zones.andP;  In addition, agraphic portrayal of the balance between territories on a single variable canbe displayed in the legend.andM;It is quite easy to redefine boundaries interactively and to compare theeffects on aggregated totals.andP;  For example, one could devise an index of thenumber of hours required to service each marketing zone.andP;  The Territoriesspreadsheet will then show a summary of the total number of hours requiredfor each salesperson.andP;  Users can then resolve imbalances interactively byreassigning zones on a trial-and-error basis.andM;The Territories menu also provides a special optimization technique that canbe used as an alternative means of balancing territories.andP;  Using thisoptimization technique, users can select the set of territory centers thatwill minimize the &quot;cost&quot; of servicing zones within the territories.andM;Cost is defined both in terms of distance and the magnitude of the&quot;commodity&quot; (attribute) involved.andP;  More specifically, the cost of servicing azone within a territory is the sum of the weighted distances (using thecommodity volume as a weight) between the zones in the territory and theterritory's center.andM;Rather than conducting an exhaustive test to determine which combination ofcenters will produce the optimal arrangement--an endeavor that would probablyoverburden the computer's resources--Fastmap's procedure starts with anarbitrary set of centers or with an existing set specified by the user andthen seeks a better arrangement using an iterative procedure known as the&quot;Tietz-Bart&quot; method.andP;  This method eventually arrives at a well-balancedarrangement that approaches the theoretical optimum.andM;According to a Tactics International representative, few users employ theoptimization routine to define new sales territories, probably because mostusers already have a well-defined set of territories.andP;  However, it should benoted that the technique can be used to improve an existing set ofterritories.andP;  To use the optimization technique for this purpose, users startthe routine using an existing set of centers rather than an arbitrary set.andM;In addition to the facilities that are available directly from Fastmap'smenu, Tactics International supplies a variety of supporting utilities thatusers can run from the DCL prompt.andP;  Many of these routines arestraightforward.andM;The Fastmap/Plot utility, as its name suggests, facilitates the generation ofhard-copy output to Uniras-compatible devices.andP;  Another utility,Fastmap/Components, creates an Oracle table that lists the relationshipbetween either Sites or Territories and basic marketing zones and--mostimportant--the proportional areas of marketing zones within each territory orsite trading area.andM;This table can then be submitted to the Fastmap/Consol (short for&quot;consolidate&quot;) utility to create an Oracle table that aggregates any selectedvariables by sites or territories.andP;  This table can in turn be submitted toanother utility named Fastmap/Report, a simple report-generating utility thatacts upon Oracle files.andM;The two final utilities, Fastmap/BPI and Fastmap/Evaluate, deserve specialmention.andP;  BPI stands for Buying Power Index.andP;  The utility can be used tocreate any index that is a weighted linear combination of some subset ofvariables in an Oracle database.andM;Using Fastmap/BPI, the user specifies the variables to be included in theindex, as well as their relative weights.andP;  Fastmap/BPI then normalizes all ofthe variables and outputs the constants and multipliers (technically, theintercepts and slopes) required to achieve this weighting, given the numericscaling of each variable.andP;  In this manner, for example, one might set up aWidget Buying Power Index based on some relative weighting of variables suchas median income, population 25 to 40 years of age and total owner-occupiedhousing units.andM;In essence, the Fastmap/BPI utility translates the relative weightingsspecified for the index into specific numeric values.andP;  The output can then besubmitted to Fastmap/Evaluate, which takes the index coefficients generatedby Fastmap/BPI and outputs a new Oracle table with columns for each of theinput variables and a new column for the evaluated result.andM;Marketing indices are among a marketing executive's most important tools, soit's likely that the Fastmap/BPI utility will be considered an importantcomponent of the Fastmap system.andM;Each of Fastmap's support utilities can be operated from the DCL prompt incommand mode.andP;  However, each utility can also be used interactively.andP;  Byattaching a /INTERACTIVE parameter to the DCL command, users can launch asession in which the utility provides menus and prompts to elicit parameterselections.andM;IN PERSPECTIVEandM;By any definition, Fastmap is an impressive product.andP;  It is tailored formarketing professionals and reflects the marketing experience that TacticsInternational brings to its design.andP;  The speed with which users canmanipulate the cartographic database, the simplicity of the product's graphicdisplays and the product's graphic approach to marketing analysis are allcommendable.andP;  However, several of Fastmap's features betray its youth.andM;When we started our evaluation of Fastmap, representatives from TacticsInternational cautioned that the system manual was temporary, pending therelease of a DECwindows version of Fastmap later this year.andP;  We found theinterim product lacking in detail and too specifically oriented to examplesdrawn from a particular client's database.andM;The version of Fastmap that we tested ran on a VAXstation II/GPX.andP;  For manyoperations, this slower machine caused delays.andP;  Unfortunately, unless thedisk drives were active during this pause, there was no way to determinewhether the system was occupied or whether we had used the mouse incorrectly.andM;The system also had a strange way of reporting locational coordinates.andP;  Onthe database we used, for example, coordinates were not reported inlatitude/longitude, but in Albers' projection coordinates--numerical valuesthat aren't relevant to users.andM;The lack of &quot;hot links&quot; between system operations may be more significant.andO;For example, if a site trading area is changed when using the Sites facility,the pie sectors summarizing the resources available to that site aren'tupdated immediately.andP;  The user must first reprocess the sites to determinetheir relationship to marketing zones and then reaggregate the data to thesenew sites.andP;  We would have preferred to see these operations performedautomatically.andP;  Implementing this change would make the product even moreinteractive than it is now.andM;Tactics International markets the VMS workstation version of Fastmap with anannual single CPU license price of $20,000 or a onetime license fee of$47,500 with an annual maintenance fee of 15 percent.andP;  Both packages includea guarantee that the annual price or maintenance price will never increasemore than 10 percent beyond what the buyer originally paid.andP;  A variety ofsite licensing packages are available.andM;Tactics International plans to release a Macintosh II version along with thenew DECwindows version by the end of the year.andP;  The Mac II version'sdatabases will reside on a VAX, and Fastmap will access them via theSQL-based connectivity language CL/1.andP;  VAX users will thus have a variety ofoptions for configuring a Fastmap station.andM;Fastmap is a strong and growing product that is sure to be a delight toanyone who has tried to cope with the geography of marketing and sales-forcemanagement by hand.andM;The investment is high, both in software and database resources, but thereturn is extraordinary.andP;  Clearly, the face of marketing analysis has changedirreversibly--and for the better.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
