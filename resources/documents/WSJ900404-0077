The board, on request by the negotiating railroads andunions, proffered arbitration to the parties. Railroadmanagement quickly rejected the offer.</LP><TEXT>   This sets the stage for President Bush to name anemergency board, which the White House says he's willing todo. While such a board usually has 30 days to makerecommendations for settling the bargaining issues, thenegotiating parties say they will give the board until Sept.15. Then, the railroads would be free to put any contractterms into effect that they wish, and the unions would befree to strike. The two sides are at odds over health-carecosts, work rules and wages.   The parties also agreed that they wouldn't take any actionuntil 30 days after the emergency board reports, and unlessCongress is in session. Typically, Congress has averted along railroad strike by enacting the emergency board'srecommendations after the negotiating parties have rejectedthem.</TEXT></DOC>
