WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Michael Dukakis turned asidesharpened criticism from rival Jesse Jackson on Friday and said itwould be a ``tragedy'' if President Reagan vetoes legislationrequiring companies to give notice before closing factories.   He said workers ``deserve better from America.''   Dukakis criticized the Reagan administration on issues rangingfrom homelessness to problems with the nation's airlines underderegulation as he began campaigning toward Ohio's Democraticpresidential primary next Tuesday.   Campaigning on the one-year anniversary of his formal entry intothe presidential race, Dukakis urged supporters to ignore pollsshowing him far ahead.   Dukakis did not mention his remaining Democratic rival, Jackson,nor did he respond with criticism when asked about Jackson's sharpcomments in Ohio that Dukakis would merely ``manage'' Reagan'seconomic program rather than change it.   ``I just don't talk about these things _ I have a record,''Dukakis said. ``... Not only that, I balance budgets, and that'ssomething that hasn't been a feature of Reaganomics.''   Dukakis mentioned disagreements he has with Jackson on theMiddle East and other issues and said, ``I think you'll continue tosee us conduct this campaign with a lot of mutual respect andgenuine friendship, and the fact that we disagree on some issues Idon't think will change that.''   Appearing before labor leaders at a local union hall inColumbus, and later before a lunchtime crowd in downtown Dayton,the Massachusetts governor pointed to his own state's law requiringcompanies to make public their plans to close plants. He said ithad saved jobs by giving workers and local governments the chanceto prepare or find alternatives.   ``I hope the president will take the time to think about thethree million American workers who lose their jobs in this countryevery year through plant shutdowns,'' Dukakis said. ``In at leasthalf those cases, those plants shut down with little or no noticeto those most affected _ their own employees.   ``These people are our neighbors,'' he said. ``They deservebetter from their employers. They deserve better from America.''   Reagan has said he would veto trade legislation passedoverwhelmingly by the Senate this week because of a provisionrequiring 60-days' notice on plant closings.   ``I hope he will reconsider,'' Dukakis said.   Speaking to reporters later in Youngstown, Dukakis said: ``Ithink it would be a tragedy if it was vetoed. ... I think he mightreconsider.''   Dukakis, the likely Democratic nominee after big wins in NewYork and Pennsylvania, is battling Jesse Jackson for Ohio's 159Democratic delegates at stake Tuesday. After flying around OhioFriday and Saturday, he also planned to visit Indiana, where 79delegates are also at stake in that state's primary Tuesday.   Before leaving for Ohio, Dukakis released copies of letters sentto Reagan and congressional leaders urging enactment of the tradebill and said he would make the bill a major part of his attack onVice President George Bush, the certain GOP nominee, if the measureis vetoed by Reagan.   Dukakis appeared in Columbus with Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, wholast year had flirted with the idea of running for the presidency.Celeste spoke warmly of Dukakis but later said he was taking nostand in the race.   ``It's a desire to ensure an open, enthusiastic primary in thestate in which Reverend Jackson knows he's as welcome as GovernorDukakis at every place, including the governor's office, and hissupporters know we expect them to be part of a unified effort inthe fall,'' Celeste said.   Dukakis did not cite Bush by name but referred to him in sayingthe Republican Party ``is going to be asking Americans to keepthings as they are. But I say we have to change.''   Repeating his call for reinvestment in American jobs, Dukakissaid: ``I'm not running for president to overthrow governments inCentral America. I want to create jobs in middle America.''</TEXT></DOC>
