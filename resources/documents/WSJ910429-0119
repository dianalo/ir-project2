In testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, ComptrollerGeneral Charles Bowsher said a preliminary GAO audit of theBank Insurance Fund suggests &quot;it's highly probable that thefund will be insolvent at the end of 199l.&quot; He recommended acombination of borrowing from the Treasury and a specialassessment that would more than triple the premium largebanks pay into the fund.</LP><TEXT>   Such a premium increase &quot;would likely kill the recovery byworsening the credit crunch,&quot; said Robert Dugger, chiefeconomist for the American Bankers Association. He noted thatFederal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan recently warnedof the risks of raising deposit insurance premiums at a timebank earnings are low. Wendy Samuels, general counsel for theNational Association of Savings Institutions, said that &quot;aspecial assessment could be devastating to a lot of banks.&quot;Sen. Alan Dixon (D., Ill.) said the GAO hadn't sufficientlyanalyzed the economic impact of a special assessment.   Mr. Bowsher's suggestion came in testimony detailing theGAO's dispute with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. overthe size of the Bank Insurance Fund. The FDIC believes thefund had a balance of $8.4 billion at the end of 1990, butpreliminary results of the GAO's annual audit suggest thatthe balance could be between $2 billion and $5 billion less.   The GAO believes the FDIC underestimated the number ofbanks likely to fail in 1991; under FDIC procedures, lossesfrom banks expected to fail this year must be reflected inlast year's figures. The FDIC disagrees with the GAO'sestimates and has hired an accounting firm to help it makeits case.   Both Mr. Bowsher and FDIC Chairman William Seidman callthe dispute &quot;an accounting issue&quot; that deals primarily withwhen to accrue losses, rather than involving the ultimatesize of losses to the fund. But the dispute has attractedattention in Congress, which is worried about the shrinkingdeposit insurance fund.   Both the government and the banking industry want to avoida taxpayer bailout of the Bank Insurance Fund, which issupported by a premium paid by banks, currently 19.5 centsper $100 of domestic deposits. That premium is scheduled torise to 23 cents on July 1 in order to support the FDIC'splans to borrow $10 billion to bolster the fund. The Bushadministration has proposed a plan that would allow the fundto borrow up to $70 billion, if necessary. The money would bepaid back out of premium income, not tax revenue.   Mr. Bowsher thinks the banks should recapitalize the fundmuch more quickly and directly. He proposed a one-timespecial assessment of 40 cents by the end of the year, ormore gradual payments of 20 cents a year as long asnecessary, on top of the 23-cent premium. He also wants thepremiums to be paid on total assets, rather than domesticdeposits. This would hurt large banks that raise considerableamounts of deposits through foreign branches.   The GAO's assertion that the bank deposit insurance fundmay be smaller than previously thought has spurred Rep. HenryGonzalez (D., Texas), the chairman of the House BankingCommittee, to push for rapid action to expand the fund'sborrowing authority. The administration, many members of theHouse panel and a majority of the Senate Banking Committeewant to tie the recapitalization plan to a broader bill thatwould modernize banking laws.   After his testimony Friday, Mr. Bowsher mistakenlydeclared that Goldome Financial Corp., a Buffalo, N.Y.,savings bank, had failed. Goldome is on the FDIC's list oftroubled institutions and is actively looking for a buyer,but it hasn't been taken over by the FDIC.</TEXT></DOC>
