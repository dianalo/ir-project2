Mighty debates were held on abortion, flag burning, capitalgains taxes, and the unprecedented resignation of the speaker ofthe House _ none of which added much to a meager legislativeportfolio.   ``There's a sense that we didn't do a damn thing this year,''said a discouraged Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif.   ``It's sort of the lost year,'' agreed Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn.   That's not to say there were no accomplishments:   _The minimum wage was raised for the first time since 1981.   _A costly but important bailout and reregulation of the savingsand loan industry was enacted.   _A legislative truce was reached, phasing out military aid tothe Contra rebels in Nicaragua.   _Separate bills were passed by the House and Senate on oil spillliability to help prevent or deal with another Exxon Valdezdisaster but resolving the differences between them was put offuntil next year.   _Aid was approved for Poland and Hungary and more moneyearmarked for anti-drug efforts.   And congressional leaders, trying to put a positive face onthings, say they laid a lot of ``groundwork.'' Make judgments nextyear, ``when we have completed action,'' Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell, D-Maine, implored reporters.   But while some was done, more noteworthy were the things andpeople that were undone.   The most celebrated undoings of the year were the cases of twoTexans, House Speaker Jim Wright and former Sen. John Tower.   Bush's nomination of Tower as secretary of defense seemed a surewinner at first. The Senate almost never rejects an alumnus.   But Tower became portrayed as a drunk and a womanizer who hadnegotiated treaties for the United States and then turned aroundand cashed in his knowledge with private interests. The rejectiongave Bush a black eye with his administration barely out of thegate.   The Tower episode left partisan scars in the Senate, but nothinglike the institutional heart attack suffered in the House.   Democrat Wright was toppled after the House ethics committeecharged him with violating rules that limit gifts and outsideincome received by lawmakers. Wright maintained his innocence, butresigned before the full House could rule.   Then his third in command, House Majority Whip Tony Coelho,D-Calif., quit rather than face an inquiry into his privatefinancial dealings.   ``Given the way we started the year, I think the big success iswe're up and running again,'' said Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla.   An entire new House Democratic leadership team, headed bySpeaker Thomas S. Foley, was installed. Wright's chief accuser,Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, was promoted to the No. 2 spot amongHouse Republicans _ and himself became target of an ethics probe.   And other ethics cases linger.   Five senators are under investigation for intervening with thegovernment on behalf of a savings and loan executive who gave theircampaigns thousands, and whose thrift later went under at a cost tothe taxpayers of billions.   Several House members are being investigated after allegationsof sexual misdeeds, including one convicted of sex with an underagegirl and another who hired a male prostitute as a personal aide.   A spectacular legislative undoing was the case of the Medicarecatastrophic illness law.   Passed only a year earlier with great bipartisan fanfare, itpromised to protect retirees from financial ruin in cases ofextended serious illness. But Congress repealed it this year afterprotests from angry elderly constituents who objected to paying upto $800 a year to cover the costs.   The Democratic-controlled Congress spent most of the yeardisagreeing with Bush over the minimum wage. Legislation to raiseit to $4.25 an hour was passed this month only after both sides sawembarrassment if they didn't act before the visit of PolishSolidarity leader Lech Walesa.   Another stalemate, over Bush's proposal for a cut in the capitalgains tax, poisoned the atmosphere for any serious effort to reducethe federal deficit.   Bush eventually agreed to wait until next year on his tax cutand a last-minute deal was struck that claimed $14.7 billion indeficit reduction _ at a time of $150 billion deficits _ and muchof it was just accounting changes.   Two Supreme Court rulings resulted in huge debate but littlelegislation.   When the high court gave states more ability to restrictabortion, it rekindled an issue that had been quiet for years.Suddenly, lawmakers who had comfortably sat on the fence werepushed over to the pro-choice side.   But President Bush used his veto to beat back attempts byCongress to restore federal spending on abortions for poor womenwho were raped or victims of incest.   When the court ruled unconstitutional a Texas law banning flagburning, Bush, with rhetoric and events reminiscent of hispresidential campaign, pressed for a flag-protecting constitutionalamendment.   Democratic leaders stalled action until public opinion turnedagainst such tinkering with the Bill of Rights, and Congress passeda simple statute designed to meet the court's objections. If thenew statute is also overturned, the issue will be back.   The Democrats point to the flag, abortion, and especiallycapital gains as examples of how Bush took stands which had littleto do with problems Congress is equipped to solve. Next year, theyvow to move their agenda and bring Bush along.   Republicans defend Bush as taking a wise and prudent course, andshare with Democrats the defense that this was only the first yearof a two-year Congress.   ``A significant amount of shadow boxing occurred, but that isn'tall bad,'' said Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M. ``Shadow boxingsometimes gets people ready.''   For example, next year's clean air and child care legislation``are going to be much better for it,'' he said.   An ambitious clean air bill to attack the three major problemsof air pollution _ acid rain, urban smog and toxic chemicals in theatmosphere _ got bogged down in the House in regional disputes overacid rain and requirements for clean burning motor vehicle fuels.Separate measures to increase federal child care assistance passedthe House and Senate, but end-of-session arguments in the Houseprevented final agreement.   Lawmakers are hoping they'll accomplish so much next year thatvoters won't be upset next November about the pay raise they votedthemselves.   A storm of public protest forced rejection of a 51 percent payraise proposal last winter. Congressional leaders never gave up,and this month approved with broad bipartisan support a new plan.   By Jan. 1, 1991, House salaries will jump to about $125,000,with members then barred from making paid speeches before interestgroups. Senate salaries will probably just top $100,000 by then _but they'll keep taking the lobbyists' speech money. Members ofboth houses now make $89,500.   Speaker Foley said the ethics reforms make the House bill a``landmark'' and many House and Senate members said the Senate willbe forced to revisit its decision next year.</TEXT></DOC>
