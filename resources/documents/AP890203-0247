There are alwayslittle pimples that have the potential to become open sores.   The jobless figures are one of them.   Unemployment is now down to 5.2 percent of the labor force, alevel that many economists feel is scraping the bottom of thebarrel. It is, after all, less than half the unemployment rate atwhich the current expansion began.   When you scrape bottom you tend to get inferior workers. Theyhave fewer skills, and probably none at all. They require expensivetraining, and even then tend to perform poorly. They are costly.   Such a situation puts pressure on profits and, according toinflation theorists, causes employers to raise prices. Thus, aninflationary spiral is begun.   But is there an alternative to that thesis? That's just one ofthe questions being asked by a small number of economists who arequestioning a lot of the conventional thinking of late.   One of those challenges to convention is that a labor shortgage,rather than forcing up prices, will finally force some industries todo without additional labor and, instead, institute more efficientprocedures.   Some of those industries, it is argued, have had it too good. Insome of the retail service industries, for example, employers havebeen able to tap a huge supply of unskilled workers and homemakersseeking part-time jobs.   Tremendous numbers of workers have been hired by fast-foodoutlets, for example, because there was an available supply ofteenagers and adult women seeking part-time jobs. It was easier tohire than to improve efficiency.   Edward Yardeni, Prudential-Bache economist, observes that from1968 to 1988, when payroll employment rose by 38 million,service-producing jobs accounted for an astounding 95 percent of thetotal gain.   These employers are now facing a critical situation. Do they seekto hire more workers from a smaller labor supply and pay themever-higher wages? Or will they be forced to reconsider thesituation and take another course?   Giving urgency to that consideration is another factor: Manyservice companies are facing a profits squeeze because of consumerresistance to higher prices. If puts them in the position of beingunable to tolerate higher costs.   Looking for a solution to the problem, many companies might beforced to reconsider their labor policies. They might seek, instead,to obtain higher productivity through better systems for producingand delivering products.   There is nothing new in this, and it might have been forced onservice companies long ago were it not for the availability oflow-cost labor. But now that pool may be drying up; and no matter,it is getting more costly.   If this occurs, says Yardeni and like-thinkers, then low joblessrates in effect will boost national productivity, which shouldreduce inflationary pressures.   ``During the 1970s, we experienced high unemployment and highinflation. In the 1990s, we should experience low unemployment andlow inflation,'' he says.   It is something to think about when you hear the inflationalarmists shouting their equivalent of ``fire.'' They have been atit for several years now, and one day they might be right.   But, as Yardeni and others remind us, inflation is not aninevitable and automatic response to any uncomfortable news.Sometimes we put the proper salve on the pimple. Sometimes inflationdoesn't happen.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Monday, Feb. 6</NOTE></DOC>
