And he beat them.   Faulk's story, in interviews with Bill Moyers and narration byStuds Terkel, is an American tragedy that began in one of ournation's nastier eras, the era of the blacklist, Red scares andloyalty oaths.   AWARE Inc., a self-appointed public guardian would _ for a fee _tell broadcasters if certain performers were communistsympathizers. If a broadcaster balked, AWARE Inc. would pressuresponsors and ad agencies.   Such was the tenor of the times. It was said that Ed Sullivanwould not allow performers on his show that AWARE Inc. had notcleared.   Faulk, host of CBS Radio's popular afternoon show, ``Johnny'sFront Porch,'' won office in 1955 with members of the performers'union, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, whopledged to end AWARE's influence.   In 1956, AWARE falsely accused him of being a ``known communistsympathizer.'' His show's sponsors and stations started gettingcalls about Faulk's alleged involvement with commie frontorganizations.   AWARE accused him of attending a meeting at which a ``knownCommunist'' was present. True, Faulk acknowledged: It was the firstanniversary dinner of the United Nations and the Communist wasSoviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko.   His sponsors began deserting the show. By coincidence, hisratings dropped and CBS fired him in the summer of 1957. He wassucceeded by Arthur Godfrey and was never to work in networkbroadcasting again.   Unemployed and unemployable, Faulk did the unthinkable: He fileda libel lawsuit against AWARE Inc. and its officers, seeking $1.5million in damages.   Faulk was broke and living on loans from friends, but heretained the great attorney Louis Nizer. The great newsman EdwardR. Murrow, by then a CBS board member, gave him $7,500 to help payNizer's retainer.   ``I am not making a personal loan to you of this money,'' Murrowsaid. ``I am investing in America.''   For five years, AWARE delayed the trial. Faulk moved back to hisnative Texas, started an advertising agency and eked out a living.Finally, in 1962, the case was played out in an 11-week trial.   The jury awarded him a then-record $3.5 million.   ``One lone man with virtually no resources,'' Nizer later wrote,``dragged the defendants into court and although outrageouslyoutnumbered, withstood starvation and disgrace and summoned upenough strength to battle them into submission.''   The jury's award marked an end to the blacklist and the demiseof AWARE Inc., but the damage to Faulk's career was complete. Hestill couldn't get a job.   The record award was reduced by an appeals court to $725,000. Ofthat, the moribund AWARE Inc. eventually paid $175,000, but it wentto Faulk's creditors.   He stayed in Texas and achieved prominence in the South as anafter-dinner speaker and a passionate advocate for the FirstAmendment. He also mounted a one-man show ``Pear Orchard, Texas,''in which he portrayed a number of the mythical town's inhabitants.   Faulk died of cancer on April 9, 1990.   In the interviews with Moyers, which took place in the last yearof his life, he was cheerful, merry and passionate about his lifeand his battle.   The final irony of ``The Man Who Beat the Blacklist'' is thatFaulk didn't really beat it; he fought the blacklist to a draw. Hedid it alone, and asked no quarter from the scoundrels whooppressed him.</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television ...   LAST OF THE BEAST?
