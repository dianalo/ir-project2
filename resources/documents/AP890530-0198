Delegates from 56 nations and 36 representatives ofinternational organizations are attending the U.N.-sponsoredConference on Central American Refugees that opened Monday and endsWednesday.   Mexico, Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, andCosta Rica submitted the three-year plan to be considered. Detailswere not released.   Hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced people, most ofthem women and children, have been ``innocent victims of conflicts,the roots of which lie in the unjust socio-economic structures inthe region,'' said U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellarin opening the conference.   Guatemala President Vinicio Cerezo told a news conference hisgovernment has been able to help Guatemalan refugees who returnvoluntarily in small numbers but is not prepared for a repatriationof thousands.   He said at least 43,000 Guatemalan refugees are living in Mexicowhile some 200,000 refugees, most of them from Nicaragua and ElSalvador, are living in Guatemala.   ``Their massive return could be grave because we do not have thephysical and economic capacity to solve their problems,'' he saidof the Guatemalan refugees.   Cerezo said democray in Guatemala would be ``complete when theGuatemalan refugees have been able to return and live in theirnation, enjoying liberty.''   Guatemala returned to elected civilian rule three years agoafter years of military control. Cerezo's government has survivedtwo coup attempts.   According to the United Nations, 146,000 registered refugees arein Central America and Mexico, and 893,000 Central Americans areliving illegally throughout the region. About 872,000 people havebeen displaced inside their countries. The U.N. figures show 61,500refugees have been repatriated.   Representatives of several groups helping refugees held theirnews conference Tuesday and complained that their groups had notbeen invited to the conference.   Rolalinda Tuyc, president of the Commission of Those Displacedby Violence, said her organization had asked Guatemala to allow itto participate but was told the United Nations had made up theguest list.   Oswaldo Enriquez, a member of the Guatemalan Human RightsCommission in Mexico, said, ``We reject the manipulation by thegovernment over the problem of refugees and people displaced byviolence.''   He said the Guatemalan government has not improved conditionssufficiently to encourage the Guatemalan refugees living in Mexicancamps to return home.   A delegation of Miskito Indians from Nicaragua made public aletter they said had been sent to the U.N. Office of HighCommissioner for Refugees asking that the Indians be reclassifiedas refugees.   It said that during the past few years the U.N. agency hadhelped Nicaraguan Indians classified as refugees return to theirhomeland from camps in Honduras.   The letter said ``there persists a climate of repression againstus'' in Nicarauga, and this and ``other circumstances motivated thereturn to Honduras of the great majority of those who had beenrepatriated.''</TEXT></DOC>
