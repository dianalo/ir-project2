OFA evaluates whether a good ortechnology is: (1) Available in fact to proscribed countries, (2) fromsources outside the United States, (3) in sufficient quantity, (4) andof comparable quality to render the validated license requirement ineffectivein achieving the national security purposes of the Act. Part 391 of theExport Administration Regulations establishes the procedures and criteriafor initiating and reviewing claims of foreign availability on items controlledfor national security purposes.Section 5(f) of the Act identifies several examples of evidence that canbe submitted to substantiate a claim of foreign availability (i.e., brochures,operation manuals, articles, photographs, and depositions based on eyewitnessaccounts). In addition, after several years of experience, OFA has identifieda wide variety of additional information that it has found useful in assessingforeign availability.OFA recognizes industry's need for additional guidance concerning the specifickinds of evidence that OFA uses in its analysis. This rule amends the Regulationsby adding a Supplement No. 1 to Part 391. This Supplement provides examplesof evidence that OFA has used in its assessments and additional guidanceconcerning the kinds of evidence the OFA has found useful in making assessments.The Bureau hopes that by providing this assistance, foreign availabilitysubmissions will be improved and the assessment process will be more effective.This list is not all-inclusive. Acceptable evidence is not limited to theseexamples. A foreign availability submission should include as much reasonableevidence as possible on <T3>all four</T3> of the criteria which are listed in the first paragraph.A combination of several types of evidence will usually be required. Thelist is representative of the types of evidence OFA has found to be usefulin its assessments. The Office of Foreign Availability will combine thisevidence with data that it collects from other government and public sources.The Office of Foreign Availability will evaluate carefully and fully allthe accumulated evidence, taking into account factors that may include,but are not limited to: Information concerning the source of the evidence;corroborative or contradictory indications; and experience concerning thereliability or reasonableness of such evidence. OFA will assess whetherthe four criteria are met.From time to time, as OFA identifies new examples of evidence that wouldenhance the assessment submission, we will amend this informational list.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Effective September 16, 1988.

Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared.2. This rule clarifies a requirement for the collection of informationwhich is subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act and which the Office ofManagement and Budget has approved under OMB Control Number 0694-0004.A request to renew the data collection is pending before the Office ofManagement and Budget. The Department of Commerce estimates that the publicburden for the collection of this information averages three hours perresponse which includes the time for reviewing instructions, searchingexisting data sources, gathering and maintaining data, reviewing, and submittingthe information collected. Comments regarding the burden estimate of thisdata collection including suggestions for reducing this burden are to besent to both the Director of the Office of Foreign Availability, and theOffice of Management and Budget. See paragraph 11 for addresses.3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opporunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in the effective date. This rule is alsoexempt from APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruledoes not impose a new control. Further, no other law requires that a noticeof proposed rulemaking and opportunity for public comment be provided forthis rule.6. However, because of the importance of the issues raised by these regulations,this rule is issued in interim form and comments will be considered inthe development of final regulations.7. The period for submission of comments will close November 15, 1988.The Department will consider all comments received before the close ofthe comment period in developing final regulations. Comments received afterthe end of the comment period will be considered if possible, but theirconsideration cannot be assured. Accordingly, the Department encouragesinterested persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possibletime to permit the fullest consideration of their views.8. The Department will not accept public comments accompanied by a requestthat part or all of the material be treated confidentially because of itsbusiness proprietary nature or for any other reason. The Department willreturn such comments and materials to the person submitting them and willnot consider them in the development of final regulations.9. All public comments on these regulations will be a matter of publicrecord and will be available for public inspection and copying. In theinterest of accuracy and completeness, the Department requires writtencomments. Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which willalso be a matter of public record and will be available for public reviewand copying. Communications from agencies of the United States Governmentor foreign governments will not be made available for public inspection.10. The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained inthe Bureau of Export Administration's Freedom of Information Record InspectionFacility, Room 4886, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and PennsylvaniaAvenue NW., Washington, DC 20230. Records in this facility, including writtenpublic comments and memoranda summarizing the substance of oral communications,may be inspected and copied in accordance with regulations published inPart 4 of Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
