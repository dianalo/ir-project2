A St. Petersburg, Fla., jury awarded the former salesman $26 million in damages after deciding his former employers libeled and slandered him. Of the amount, $25 million was punitive damages, intended to punish Hancock.    &quot;It wasn't right and, doggone it, I wasn't going to let anyone take that one asset I had -- my good name,&quot; Mr. Zalay, 65 years old, said in a telephone interview. &quot;It took me 30 years to get it.&quot;    Although ranked in the top 2% of Hancock sales people, Mr. Zalay was fired in January 1979 in a falling out with company officials over his work style and business practices. Mr. Zalay fought back with a wrongful-discharge suit that also alleged libel and slander.    The wrongful-discharge count was dismissed, but Mr. Zalay's Clearwater, Fla., attorney, Elihu Berman, successfully argued that Hancock officials damaged his client's reputation by distributing a copy of a company letter reprimanding Mr. Zalay for giving a policyholder bad advice. Mr. Zalay, according to Mr. Berman, never gave the policyholder any advice.    Mr. Zalay also maintained that Hancock officials crippled his job performance by sending investigators to Florida to interview his clients. The investigators told several policyholders he was under investigation for &quot;shady dealings&quot; in Chicago, though none was ever substantiated.    Mr. Zalay's suit is part of a trend among fired white-collar workers, who are increasingly suing their former employers for punitive damages.    A Hancock spokesman said the company plans to ask the judge to overturn the jury verdict. If that fails, the company will consider an appeal, he said.    Mr. Berman said the jury award was fair. &quot;I don't think the award was excessive.&quot; he said, &quot;in view of John Hancock's assets.&quot; ---    THE WEIGHT LOSS WARS have gone to court.    Nutri/System Inc. has sued Weight Watchers International Inc., a subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Inc., alleging that Weight Watchers obtained trade secrets by hiring key Nutri/System executives.    Heinz, a food-processing concern, said the allegations are groundless.    Nutri/System claims Weight Watchers received proprietary information on marketing, pricing and sales from nine former employees who currently work at the Heinz subsidiary.    The suit alleges that Jean Bakken, a former vice president of competitive marketing who left Nutri/System last week, attended a marketing and pricing meeting Aug. 31 with A. Donald McCulloch Jr., Nutri/System chairman and president. Nutri/System says that on the day Ms. Bakken resigned, Sept. 5, many confidential documents were missing from her office.    Heinz, Pittsburgh, says it has hired Ms. Bakken, but declines to comment further on the specific charges.    Nutri/System, Willow Grove, Pa., operates 1,363 weight-loss clinics in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Britain. Its sales of counseling services and low-calorie foods totaled $433 million last year.    Heinz acquired Weight Watchers 10 years ago, and the boom in low-calorie foods and exercise classes has turned the division into a money machine.    The world's largest weight-loss and dietary organization, Weight Watchers generated $1.3 billion of Heinz's $5.8 billion in revenue last year.    ---   TENANTS FACING EVICTION have a possible escape hatch: bankruptcy court.    But in Los Angeles, where the courts have been flooded with more than 50,000 new bankruptcy filings a year, eviction-related bankruptcies are under attack.    Until now, judges have generally interpreted federal bankruptcy law to block landlords from putting bankrupt tenants out on the street. Such rulings have emboldened non-lawyer &quot;tenant services&quot; groups, which urge tenants to seek bankruptcy protection -- and often charge hundreds of dollars for their advice.    But judges, landlords and even legal-aid firms have condemned the practice. For one thing, the tenants are often poor or non-English speaking and &quot;do not know what they are filing,&quot; says Roberto Aldape, a lawyer for the Los Angeles Legal Aid Foundation. The relief is fleeting, usually just a few weeks. The tenants' financial problems usually end up being compounded because of the firms' high fees.    Enter bankruptcy Judge Vincent Zurzolo. In a little-noticed opinion last month, he held that a landlord has a right to obtain possession after all.    &quot;Bankruptcy mills,&quot; he pointed out, &quot;prey upon the desperate and ignorant tenants who come to them for help and are defrauded out of money which could better be used to pay rent to their current landlords or to obtain new living quarters.&quot;    Whether the decision will be embraced by other judges -- or the city itself, which carries out the actual evictions -- isn't yet clear. But for landlords, &quot;it is a great ruling,&quot; says Los Angeles lawyer Jeffrey Riffer, who has represented landlords.    Other lawyers for landlords, pointing out that such bankruptcy cases have been a brisk source of business, weren't so sure the decision was an unmitigated blessing. &quot;You are killing the golden goose,&quot; one quipped.    ---   SPIN CONTROL: Both liberal and conservative groups have scheduled a record number of briefings to outline their hopes and expectations for the new Supreme Court term that begins Oct. 2. Yesterday, the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood of America jointly warned of the risk that the justices will cut back further on the right to abortion in three cases likely to be argued in December. Among other groups, the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund plans a session on cases affecting women's rights. On the conservative end of the spectrum, briefings are planned by the Washington Legal Foundation and the National Legal Center for the Public Interest. A business viewpoint? That will be offered by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce National Chamber Litigation Center.    ---   QUOTABLE: When the National Law Journal recognized two Philadelphia lawyers as being &quot;well on their way to achieving power,&quot; the lawyers' suburban weekly newspaper couldn't resist doing a front-page article on its hometown celebrities. &quot;Local Lawyers Recognized for Clout,&quot; said the headline last week in the Suburban andamp; Wayne Times. But one of the lawyers, David Girard-diCarlo, 46, managing partner of Blank, Rome, Comisky andamp; McCauley, couldn't leave well enough alone. Asked by the Suburban how he felt about being one of 50 lawyers under age 50 who were selected, he said: &quot;I wasn't surprised. I know my reach in the community and across the country.&quot; Mr. Girard-diCarlo, a fundraiser for President Bush, also told the Suburban reporter that, if he needed the recognition, he wouldn't have been named in the first place. Mr. Girard-diCarlo says he regrets speaking to the Suburban, which he says didn't understand he was talking in jest. &quot;That was an awful article,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
