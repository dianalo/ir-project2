In a communique after several days of deliberations, the InterimCommittee of the IMF also said many of the organization's 152member nations support a ``substantial increase'' in the lendingfunds provided by the institution.   The question of increasing the lending reserves is one of thecentral issues at this year's annual meeting of the IMF and itssister organization, the World Bank, which was to begin Tuesday.   IMF Director Michel Camdessus is urging the member nations todouble so-called quotas from $120 billion. Others say he will onlyget a 50 perent to 70 percent increase, while U.S. officials havesaid they believe the IMF has adequate resources to respond to theneeds of poorer countries.   The United States is the largest contributor to bothorganizations and has the biggest voting share.   ``There was widespread support in the committee on the need fora substantial increase in quotas ... although a few members believethat the Fund has adequate resources at the present time to fulfillits responsibilities,'' said the statement issued at the end of thepanel's deliberations.   The committee called for a decision to be made on the proposedincreases by the end of the year.   The panel welcomed ``the significant reduction in the number ofmembers in arrears.'' But is also was ``concerned that the overallamount of arrears had nonetheless continued to rise, owing to thefailure of a few countries with protracted arrears to meet theirfinancial obligations.''   The back dues to the IMF totaled $3.75 billion at the end ofSeptember, compared with $2.37 billion at the same time last year.   Those with the longest back dues, which have been declaredineligible for further lending until they repay some of the money,are Cambodia, Guyana, Liberia, Panama, Peru, Sierra Leone, Somalia,the Sudan and Zambia.   ``The committee again called on all members in arrears to adoptpolicies promptly to correct their economic imbalances andregularize their relations with the fund, bearing in mind theburden that overdue obligations impose on other fund members,'' thestatement said.</TEXT></DOC>
