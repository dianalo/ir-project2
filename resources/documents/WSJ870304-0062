Prices of some 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds slumped just over 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Corporate bond prices also edged lower. Municipal bond prices wound up mixed even as a huge volume of new state and local government debt issues hit the market. Most short-term interest rates edged higher.    Despite the sharp increase in oil prices, &quot;It was a very quiet day&quot; in the credit markets, said Bruce R. Lakefield, executive vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. &quot;The market is trading in a very tight range.&quot;    &quot;It's a very thin, fragile market,&quot; said Ernest M. Grunebaum, senior executive vice president at Yamaichi International (America) Inc. &quot;There hasn't been much activity lately, although people have begun to focus once again on oil.&quot;    Trading volume has been lethargic for the past few weeks, partly reflecting confusion about the economic outlook. Important clues are expected to emerge Friday when the Labor Department reports employment figures for February. Many analysts expect the statistics to indicate that the economy remains weak and that lower interest rates lie ahead. But the employment statistics are very difficult to predict, and individual estimates vary widely.    Nervousness about higher oil prices yesterday overshadowed a government report showing an unexpectedly large 1% drop in the Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators during January. That followed a 2.3% surge in December.    Several analysts contended that the leading indicators often have proven misleading and that the latest two months' figures probably were distorted by special factors, mainly the new tax law. Others, though, said the big decline in the index lent additional support to the view that the economy is listless and that the Federal Reserve System will have to drive down interest rates to prevent a recession.    The Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 fell yesterday to a price of 100 5/32 from 100 15/32 Monday. The yield rose slightly to 7.49% from 7.46%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 declined to a price of 100 13/32 from 100 20/32, raising the yield to 7.19% from 7.16%.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 4.11 points to close at 1426.08. It hovered between 1425.34 and 1430.82, a relatively narrow range.    Interest rates rose on short-term Treasury bills. The rate on the latest three-month bill increased to 5.53% bid from an average rate of 5.47% set at Monday's auction. The rate on the latest six-month Treasury bill rose to 5.56% bid from an average of 5.51% Monday.    The federal funds rate edged higher. The rate on funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged about 6.22% yesterday after averaging 6.18% Monday and 6.02% last Friday.    In the corporate sector, a $250 million issue of five-year notes of General Electric Co. was offered through underwriters led by Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. The 7% notes were priced at par. The issue is rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Sources close to the transaction said that GE's decision to negotiate the note sale through Kidder, instead of following its usual practice of putting the securities out for competitive bids, represented a show of support for the Kidder unit, of which GE owns 80%.    Kidder has been drawn into the insider trading scandal as a result of the guilty plea of its former investment banking star, Martin Siegel.    Separately, a $100 million issue of Pitney Bowes Credit Corp. 7 1/4% notes, due in five years, was offered through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. The notes, rated single-A-1 by Moody's and double-A-minus by Sandamp;P, were priced at par.    First Union Corp. offered $100 million of 8 1/8% subordinated notes, due Dec. 15, 1996, through underwriters led by Shearson Lehman. The notes were priced at par.    In the municipal bond sector, underwriters led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. tentatively priced a $1.15 billion offering of revenue bonds by Grand River Dam Authority, Okla. Under the proposed scale, yields would range from 4.5% on bonds due 1989 to 7.245% on bonds due 2010.    Among the other large new state and local government debt issues were:    --$236.1 million of Georgia general obligation bonds. Salomon Brothers heads the underwriting group. The issue was priced after an auction yesterday to yield from 3.5% on bonds due 1988 to 6.1% on bonds due 2006 and 2007. The unsold balance as of late yesterday was about $182.4 million, underwriters said. The bonds are rated triple-A by Moody's and double-A-plus by Sandamp;P.    --$201.6 million of Hawaii general obligation bonds. Underwriters led by BankAmerica Capital Markets priced the issue after auction yesterday to yield from 4.2% on bonds due 1990 to 6.25% on bonds due 2006 and 2007. The unsold balance among the underwriters as of yesterday afternoon was only about $66.4 million. The issue is rated double-A by both Moody's and Sandamp;P.    --$50 million of bonds by Anne Arundel County, Md. Salomon Brothers heads the underwriters. After an auction yesterday, the issue was priced to yield from 3.65% on bonds due 1988 to 6.30% on bonds due 2017. The issue is rated double-A by both Moody's and Sandamp;P. Underwriters said the unsold balance was $42.6 million.    Separately, underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets priced an offering of about $116.4 million of revenue bonds by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.
