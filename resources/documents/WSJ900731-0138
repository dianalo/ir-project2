Fialka   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/31/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A10</SO><CO>   FREST</CO><LP>   MOSCOW -- The Soviet military, facing a growing generationgap within its ranks, is preparing to take tentative stepstoward an all-volunteer force.   The Ministry of Defense will ask the Supreme Soviet, thenation's legislature, for money this fall to begincontracting for skilled sailors who volunteer to servethree-year terms in the Soviet navy, a spokesman said. Thenew volunteers will be paid 200 rubles a month, 20 times thepay of sailors who are drafted and a level that approachesthe average Soviet worker's pay. At the same time, thespokesman said, the navy will drop the service period forconscripted sailors to two years from three.</LP><TEXT>   The Defense Ministry's position is a compromise betweenolder generals and admirals, who oppose any changes in thedraft system, and a rising group of younger officers, such as30-year-old Maj. Vladimir Lopotin, who are pushing for rapidchange to a smaller, all-volunteer force.   In the formerly rigid hierarchy of the Soviet military thetop brass would win, hands down. But Maj. Lopotin and hisallies have outflanked their commanders, establishing abeachhead in the Supreme Soviet, which must decide the issue.   Maj. Lopotin, a political commissar in the Russianmerchant marines, was recently named by the Supreme Soviet'sdefense committee to head a commission that is drawing up alist of needed reforms, and the all-volunteer force is one ofthe main proposals. &quot;It is best,&quot; says Maj. Lopotin, who seesSoviet forces some day operating as allies with U.S. troopsin a revised North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   Working with him, he says, are a core group of 20 youngerofficers who serve as elected members of the Supreme Sovietor, like Maj. Lopotin, as elected members of the largerCongress of Peoples' Deputies, which meets less frequently.   Despite their political powers, the major says, this isstill a dangerous game for the young officers. &quot;The militaryleadership is now rooting out dissidents in the army, usingthe pretext of reduction of military forces to give the sackto anyone who doesn't agree with them,&quot; he says.   The result, he worries, could be a much more conservativemilitary. &quot;If part of the military falls to the bait andjoins with the most conservative part of the society, theytogether would become a most dangerous force. It givesconservatives more chances to turn society back to the past.This is dangerous not only to the U.S.S.R. but to the wholeworld.&quot;   The major contributor to the growing unrest in themilitary, he says, is the reluctance of the Soviet militaryhierarchy to provide housing for some 300,000 families ofofficers who have left the services. Recently, the governmentannounced that it is the job of local communities to findhousing for returning officers.   This is unacceptable, Maj. Lopotin says, because it pitsthe needs of the officers against the needs of the poor. Hisgroup is lobbying to have housing funds come out of themilitary budget.   Little is known here about the costs of an all-volunteerforce, and discussion of reform proposals is prohibitedwithin the military. Outside groups, such as the Institute ofthe U.S.A. and Canada, have been studying the U.S. shift fromthe draft in the late 1970s.   Olga Pobortseva, a researcher at the institute, was sentto the Brookings Institution in Washington this spring tostudy the U.S. experience. &quot;I think our congress will approvesome sort of all-volunteer army,&quot; she says, noting that asmaller Soviet force must rely more on skilled soldiers forhigh-technology weaponry.   Citing a recent shortfall in army conscription, especiallyfrom the Baltic and Central Asian republics, she asserts: &quot;Itis stupid to draft those who don't want to serve and to makethose resign who want to stay in.&quot;   Pvt. K. Avilov, a Muscovite drafted into the Soviet armyin the fall of 1988, says the experience convinced him thatthe army should be further reorganized along ethnic lines toprevent racial strife, which, he says, makes life a&quot;permanent war&quot; within the enlisted ranks. Writing in themagazine Ogonyok, Pvt. Avilov says he found a &quot;veryoppressive situation&quot; in his regiment, which was sent to stopethnic fighting in the Caucasus last winter.   The force, he said, broke down into ethnic gangs thatoften fought each other. Officers didn't punish theringleaders, he wrote; rather, they tried to cool offpassions by having the troops stand in the frost in theirshorts. Such cruelty, he said, &quot;might destroy the army frominside.&quot;   Vadim Bakatin, who heads the Soviet Ministry of InternalAffairs, also favors the all-volunteer format for his MVDtroops, whose primary mission is to curb ethnic fighting. Ina recent newspaper interview, he said he has asked theSupreme Soviet for additional money to shift away from theuse of draftees.</TEXT></DOC>
