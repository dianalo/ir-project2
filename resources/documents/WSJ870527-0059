The court also said the airline can't favor replacement attendants who were still trainees when the strike ended. But the court said TWA can give preference to the 1,220 replacements for striking attendants it hired at the time of the strike.    The ruling by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in Kansas City, Mo., means that TWA will have to replace some attendants who went on strike but later crossed picket lines and all 463 attendants who were trainees at the end of the strike with striking attendants of greater seniority who didn't cross picket lines. TWA said it will seek a Supreme Court review of those aspects of the court's decision.    More than 2,000 flight attendants were denied reinstatement by TWA after the strike.    The appeals court also let stand an earlier court order granting full back pay to the striking attendants who were replaced by the trainees.    The decision was a partial victory for the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants, which represents the TWA attendants and had appealed an earlier district court ruling that TWA could favor both replacement attendants and striking attendants who crossed picket lines. Vicki Frankovich, the union's president, said the appeals court decision is &quot;further vindication of our membership's fight with TWA.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
