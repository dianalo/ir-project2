To deter a pinpointed nuclearattack on its key European war-making targets, NATO must possess weaponsthat the Soviets know could survive attack and be used with precisionagainst their military targets in turn. That requires a missile forcewith four characteristics: First, it must be highly accurate. Second,low-yield warheads must be available to destroy military targets withair bursts creating minimum fallout. Third, the missile supply must beadequate. And finally, it must be fully mobile, so that it can't be destroyedby the Soviet surprise attack with which a future war would start. TheU.S. is on the right track toward meeting these objectives with its Europeanmissile-deployment program. Such a defense would improve stability inthe region by cutting the rewards of a sudden attack, would reduce ourdependence on huge, inaccurate weapons and would diminish Europe's vulnerabilityto blackmail while its periphery is undermined.</TEXT></DOC>
