Ultrasonographic diagnosis was classified into five groups- M', SM', PM', SS' {similar_to} S' center dot A'/sub 1/ {similar_to}A'/sub 2/, and Si' center dot Ai', the accuracy rate being 85.7 % inthe M' group, 71.4 % in SM', 60.0 % in PM', 90.2 % in SS' {similar_to}S' center dot A'/sub 1/ {similar_to} A'/sub 2/ and 64.3 % in Si' centerdot Ai'. Diagnoses by CT and MRI were classified into 3 groups - I, IIand III, the accuracy rate by CT being 66.7 % in group I, 81.5 % in IIand 32.1 % in III. The accuracy rate by MRI was 80.0 % in group I, 91.7% in II and 50.0 % in III. Intrarectal echography was thus superior toCT and MRI for detailed diagnosis of the depth of invasion, and MRI wasthe best examination nodality for detecting infiltration of other organs.</TEXT></DOC>
