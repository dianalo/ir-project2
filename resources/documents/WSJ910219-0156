When it outlined its offer last Friday, Charter said itomitted interest payments on its 14% senior subordinated debtand 14.25% subordinated debt, saying it needed &quot;additionalflexibility and liquidity.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The Macon, Ga., company also said the loss for its firstquarter ended Dec. 31 widened to $46.4 million from $24.2million a year ago. Revenue fell 12% to $284.8 million from$324.5 million.   Last month, Charter said it would move to restructure itsdebt to stave off default. Taken private in 1988 in aleveraged buyout, the company has been battered by insurers'efforts to reduce medical costs -- particularly inmental-health services, Charter's primary business.   If the new plan isn't approved, Charter said Friday, &quot;thecompany might be forced to seek to complete its financialrestructuring by filing for protection under Chapter 11 ofthe Bankruptcy Code.&quot;   Under the plan, bondholders would receive new debt or somecombination of debt and equity. Holders of the 14% seniorsubordinated debt, for instance, would receive, for each$1,000 principal amount, between $270.88 and $357.15principal amount of 10% senior subordinated debt due Feb. 15,2003, as well as 15.251 to 16.045 shares of new Class Acommon stock.   Meanwhile, Charter's preferred shareholders would receive,depending on the series of preferred, varying amounts of newClass A or new Class B stock.   Charter said the offer would eliminate about $700 millionin debt and would reduce 1992 interest payments by about $140million. The company's current bondholders and preferredstockholders would end up holding about 73% of the commonshares outstanding. William A. Fickling Jr., Charter'spresident and chairman, and his family would see their stakefall to about 16% of the company's equity from about 53%.   The company estimated its liabilities would total about$1.1 billion after the offer, leaving shareholders with&quot;significant equity value&quot; in Charter. But it declined toestimate what that value might be.   Wilbur Ross, managing director at Rothschild Inc. in NewYork and representative for holders of Charter's seniordiscount notes, said the proposal was valuable in that it&quot;tries to be a permanent solution rather than a temporarypatch job.&quot; Charter's hospitals, he said, are &quot;pretty goodproperties&quot; that are &quot;trapped&quot; in an overleveraged company.But he declined to discuss particulars of the offer.   George Pillari, president of Health Care InvestmentAnalysts Inc. in Baltimore, characterized the proposal as a&quot;good starting point.&quot; But investors who end up with equityin Charter, he said, still face the problem that &quot;thecompany's underlying business continues to deteriorate.&quot;   Indeed, Charter said Friday that the number ofpatient-days in its core group of about 90 psychiatrichospitals fell 10% in its first quarter from the yearearlier. (Admissions rose 9% -- but Charter added ninehospitals in the past year.) Patient-days at its generalhospitals also fell 10%, and admissions slipped 7% -- at atime when admissions in most hospitals are down only 2.5%,Mr. Pillari said.   While acknowledging the problem with patient days andadmissions, Charter officials pointed out that efforts to cutcosts, coupled with recent price increases, helped pushoperating income to $46.5 million in the company's firstquarter from $14 million in its fourth quarter ended Sept.30.</TEXT></DOC>
