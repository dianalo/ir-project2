The relationship between P and D was regular and allowed extrapolationto higher doses corresponding to the generally accepted probability ofoccurrence of a nonsterile item or sterility assurance level (SAL), andbeyond. An absorbed dose of 7.5 kGy was estimated to be sufficient togive a value of P of 10/sup -6/, whereas a dose of 25 kGy would be expectedto give a P of 10/sup -18/.</TEXT></DOC>
