Rapid pyrolysis reactions will likelyfind application in indirect processes. Such processes (e.g., the synthesisof methanol from syngas) generally operate at pressure of 30-35 atmospheres,and it is recognized that operation of the gasification section of theplant at elevated pressures would save downstream compression costs.High-heating-rate, high-temperature devolatilization experiments arecarried out in a 10 liter batch reactor which serves to pyrolyze a suspensionof pulverized coal in a mixture of steam and nitrogen. The high heatingrate of coal particles is achieved by igniting a stoichiometric mixtureof hydrogen and oxygen in nitrogen diluent. A rapid quench sampling system,designed to accept gas and particle sample from the reactor interiorfor a short interval (4ms), at a prescribed time after initiation ofreaction, is used to obtain transient reaction data. At 2400 K, steamto carbon molar ratio of 2, and reaction times greater than 100 ms, anincrease in pressure from 4 atm to 45 atm is found to have a small positiveeffect on the coal carbon conversion. The yields of CO and hydrogen increasecorrespondingly. The carbon dioxide yield is independent of pressure.From economic considerations these results are of direct importance asan increase in pressure increases the yields of desirable products (COand hydrogen), without affecting the yield of the undesirable product(carbon dioxide).</TEXT></DOC>
