As we approach the 35th anniversay ofthe cease-fire that marked the end of active combat in the Korean War,it is appropriate that we take time to remember and express our gratitudeto those who served in that fierce conflict. We do so proudly, knowingthat their spirit will define forever the words ``courage'' and ``liberty.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In June 1950, when the Communist North Korean army invaded the Republicof Korea in a brazen attempt to extinguish the light of freedom there,American forces joined with those of many other nations to repel this unprovokedassault. Weary of war ourselves and ready to lead an era of peaceful recovery,we nonetheless came to Korea's defense because instinct and experiencehave taught us that freedom can have no borders, that an attack on freemen anywhere is an attack on free men everywhere.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Standing shoulder to shoulder with the valiant South Korean armiesand troops of 16 other countries operating under United Nations command,nearly six million of our service men and women_more than served in WorldWar I_participated in the drive to preserve Korea's territorial integrityand political independence. At Inchon and the Chosin Reservoir, on OldBaldy and Pork Chop Hill, in battle and siege all across the Korean Peninsula,our forces endured unspeakable hardships for a fellow people strugglingto keep feee. Over 54,000 Americans died, more than 100,000 suffered wounds,and over 8,000 remain missing in action. Theirs has been called the ``ForgottenWar,'' but, as President Eisenhower told the Nation 35 years ago on thesigning of the Korean Armistice, they proved ``once again that only courageand sacrifice can keep freedom alive upon the earth.'' This is a messagethat must forever live on in the memories and in the hearts of all whocherish liberty.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 318, has designated the weekof July 25 through July 31, 1988, as ``National Week of Recognition andRemembrance for Those Who Served in the Korean War'' and authorized andrequested the President to issue a proclamation observing this week andurging the departments and agencies of the United States and interestedorganizations, groups, and individuals to fly the American flag at half-staffon July 27, 1988, in memory of those Americans who died as a result oftheir service in Korea.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States ofAmerica, do hereby proclaim the week of July 25 through July 31, 1988,as National Week of Recognition and Remembrance for Those Who Served inthe Korean War.
