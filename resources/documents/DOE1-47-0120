The system comprises means, including amatrix of lenses, for focusing solar radiation onto a focal plane toform a set of solar images in the plane; a set of optical fibers, eachof the fibers having an open end; a positioning plate holding the openends of the fibers within a common plane which is coincident with thefocal plane; and positioning means for moving the plate laterally relativeto the matrix of lenses. The optical fibers are substantially equal innumber to the number of lenses in the matrix and positioned within theplate with the open ends being in the same pattern or configuration asthe lenses in the matrix and such that each open end is at the focalpoint of a corresponding lens in the matrix. The positioning means movethe plate laterally relative to the matrix of lenses in such manner thatthe pattern of open ends of the fibers can always be made to coincidewith the pattern of solar images as the sun traverses the solar collector.</TEXT></DOC>
