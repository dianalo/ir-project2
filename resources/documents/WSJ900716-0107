The $20.7 billion measure won easy approval on a 300-72roll call, but the expanded power for the Secret Service isprovoking a behind-the-scenes turf war with the FederalBureau of Investigation over control of savings and loancases.</LP><TEXT>   While Secret Service officials have quietly welcomed theinitiative, the White House has lined up behind the JusticeDepartment and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, whoserepresentatives scrambled unsuccessfully to put any suchSecret Service operations under the authority of AttorneyGeneral Richard Thornburgh.   &quot;There are more FBI guys up here than investigating theSandamp;Ls,&quot; joked Rep. Silvio Conte of Massachusetts, the rankingRepublican on the House Appropriations Committee. And whileall sides promised to coordinate efforts, Mr. Conte and HouseDemocratic Caucus Chairman Steny Hoyer of Maryland used theirpositions to establish a legislative record allowing theSecret Service to initiate investigations where the FBI isn'tdirectly involved.   The underlying measure, which goes next to the Senate,funds the Treasury Department, Postal Service and much of theWhite House's own operations for the new fiscal yearbeginning Oct. 1. IRS funding would grow almost $633.7million, to $6.13 billion, and the bill requires the agencyto use at least $10 million of the new money to crack down onforeign-owned businesses.   The administration has protested this provision, butpolitically the issue has drawn support from a strikingcoalition of Republicans, opposed to raising new taxes, andindustrial-state Democrats looking for a vehicle to strikeback at competing Japanese companies.   By a 201-178 margin, the House rejected a proposal to cut2% from all accounts other than the IRS. But the committeeleadership agreed separately to freeze allowances for formerpresidents at the current fiscal 1990 level of $1.8 million.Reflecting concern over former President Reagan's trip toJapan last year, where he reportedly received $2 million inspeaking fees, the bill directs the Treasury to report in sixmonths on how to reduce expenditures in such cases. Themeasure gives the Secret Service authority to accept privatedonations to offset security costs in cases where a formerpresident travels for the purpose of earning a speaking fee.   Among White House accounts, the Office of Management andBudget would grow to $49.3 million. After late-nightnegotiations between the administration and the HouseGovernment Operations Committee, Director Richard Darman wasable to sidestep a move to strike an estimated $4.5 millionfor the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.   Government Operations Committee Chairman John Conyers, whomet Friday with Mr. Darman and White House counsel C. BoydenGray, said he was satisfied that an &quot;agreement in principle&quot;had been reached on changes sought by Congress in along-running fight over the role of the office in determiningregulatory decisions. The Michigan Democrat is among criticswho have demanded greater access to internal documents andjustification on any cost-benefit analysis used in futurecases. Mr. Conyers indicated concessions made by the WhiteHouse could expedite new authorization legislation pending inhis committee.   The House action came as Senate Appropriations CommitteeChairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) signaled he would seek tocut military spending to the level called for in the Housebudget resolution. But he said he would trim back as well onincreases in House-passed appropriations bills for domesticand foreign aid accounts. Discretionary appropriations fornon-defense programs would be $4.8 billion less than theHouse, but to preserve some flexibility under Gramm-Rudmanrules, outlays would be pared back by only $3 billion.   Mr. Byrd's defense numbers are more favorable to thePentagon in some respects than the Senate Budget Committee'sinitial recommendations. But by accepting the House ceiling,he is also demanding an estimated $1.5 billion more indirect-outlay cuts than the Senate Armed Services Committeebill reported last week.</TEXT></DOC>
