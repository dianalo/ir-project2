And more than the price of petroleum may hang on the action, or inaction, of the eight leading oil ministers gathering in the Spanish capital. Industry experts say the very future of the 28-year-old cartel is at stake.    Deeply in crisis -- perhaps its worst crisis ever -- for much of this year, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries seeks a fresh start and a new course from this week's meeting of its pricing and long-term-strategy committees. &quot;If there is no OPEC revival, or if it is unsustainable, free-market conditions could keep the world price of oil below $10 a barrel for several years,&quot; says John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, New York.    For economies throughout the world, the stakes are huge. Each $1-a-barrel price change is worth $23 billion a year to oil producers and consumers. In the U.S., OPEC's current disarray and the accompanying price plunge, if uncorrected, could reduce next year's consumer-price index by 1.3 percentage points and add 0.3% to national growth, according to calculations by Data Resources, an economics-consulting concern in Lexington, Mass.    &quot;Everyone is looking on this meeting as the last chance that OPEC has to pull together,&quot; says Joyce Yanchar, the Data Resources economist who made the calculations.    The world is full of doubters. &quot;Dominance of the old OPEC is coming to an end,&quot; asserts John S. Herrington, the U.S. energy secretary, &quot;and we will see continued strong downward pressure on oil prices.&quot; Such doubts yesterday caused the November-delivery price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, to plunge 60 cents a barrel to $14.61 in New York futures trading.    But other well-informed observers think OPEC has a good chance of reaching a new agreement that will stabilize prices. Herman Franssen, an oil economist who advises the oil minister of Oman, which isn't a member of OPEC, says that only three weeks ago $5 oil appeared inevitable. But now he sees a &quot;consensus of willingness shaping up in OPEC,&quot; particularly with the conciliation emerging between the war foes, Iran and Iraq.    As a result, Mr. Franssen, who has served as a liaison between OPEC and non-OPEC exporters, sees a 50-50 chance that the oil ministers &quot;will put something together at Madrid.&quot;    In any event, leading OPEC spokesmen -- including Subroto , the secretary-general -- caution that Madrid can only be the starting point toward drafting any new course for OPEC. They suggest that the cartel has to return to its very roots to redefine its goals.    &quot;Trying to solve our issues, like overproduction, before defining the objective isn't productive,&quot; says a senior OPEC official. &quot;To get it in proper sequence,&quot; he adds, &quot;the ministers will define the objective, define the strategy and then solve the problems.&quot;    Perhaps. OPEC's original purpose, by statute, was to help its members maximize their oil revenues. That meant setting fixed prices for OPEC oil at politically dictated levels. But, with oil output continuing to surge outside OPEC, that approach no longer works, and the fixed-price scheme has been abandoned, in effect.    The cartel hasn't abandoned its production controls. But they have become largely academic in recent months, with most members exceeding their quotas, worsening the already-burdensome world oil glut.    The current OPEC ceiling is theoretically 17.5 million barrels a day, assuming that Iraq, which refuses to accept a quota, is brought back into the system at the same production level as that of Iran. Early this week, the Persian Gulf Arab members of OPEC, including heavyweight Saudi Arabia, called for a return to that 17.5 million-barrel ceiling -- or a higher one if all members shared proportionally in the quota increases. The idea is that the exporters would adhere to quotas set at more-realistic levels.    What the Saudis have in mind, explains one source close to developments in the kingdom, is to have every OPEC member specify how much it may want to produce. &quot;Everybody states his needs,&quot; the Saudi source says. &quot;The total is probably going to be 23 {million} or 24 million barrels a day,&quot; he adds, &quot;and then we ask: What price will you get at this level? Is it $2 or $1.50 a barrel?&quot;    Once it's determined what production level might provide a more-satisfactory price, the Saudi source says, then that could become the new ceiling. Other OPEC sources say this new ceiling might be in the range of 18.5 million to 19 million barrels a day.    If such new quotas were indeed observed, that would mean a reduction in OPEC output of as much as 2.5 million barrels a day. And it would put production more in line with demand for OPEC oil, at least after the first quarter of 1989.    Joseph Stanislaw, Paris-based official of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, suggests that whatever develops, OPEC doesn't plan to lose any more of its market share. &quot;For the short term at least,&quot; he says, &quot;volume is the game&quot; for OPEC. </TEXT></DOC>
