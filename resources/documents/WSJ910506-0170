The good news isthat the worst may be over.   In the January-March period, net income of 646 majorcorporations dropped 16% from a year earlier, a Wall StreetJournal survey shows. After-tax earnings from continuingoperations also fell 16%. The numbers are particularly weakbecause the comparison is with a poor quarter in 1990, whennet fell 18%.</LP><TEXT>   Susan C. Lakatos of the brokerage firm of Kidder, Peabodyandamp; Co., has a simple explanation for worse-than-expectedprofits in the March quarter: weakness in the first-quartereconomy. &quot;The odds are,&quot; she says, &quot;that the economy maysurprise us on the upside later in the year.&quot;   The Commerce Department estimated that theinflation-adjusted gross national product, the total value ofthe nation's output of goods and services, fell at a 2.8%annual rate in the first period. Those economists braveenough to submit quarterly forecasts to Blue Chip EconomicIndicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, had on averagepredicted only a 1.8% decline.   But the first quarter, many analysts believe, may havebeen the trough for both economic growth and profits. TheBlue Chip analysts look for growth at a slim 0.9% rate in thecurrent quarter. William C. Melton, chief economist of IDSFinancial Services, Minneapolis, is more optimistic. Heexpects the economy to grow at an annual rate of 2.2% in thecurrent quarter and at a 3.2% pace in the second half.   Mr. Melton looks for a sharp improvement in profits as therecovery begins. He thinks the stage already is set forstrong gains by manufacturers because of earliercost-cutting. Gains by nonmanufacturing companies, he says,will lag because they have been slower to reduce costs.   Lynne Reaser, senior economist at First Interstate Bank ofLos Angeles, looks for profits to be &quot;fairly flat&quot; or perhapsup slightly in the current quarter, with better numbers inthe second half. She expects after-tax profits for the fullyear to be up about 4% from 1990. &quot;There have been two majornegatives for the economy: the Mideast war and tight money,&quot;she says. &quot;Now that those negatives have been removed, theeconomy should start looking better.&quot;   Among major groups, oil companies and securities brokersreported sharply higher earnings. Generally lower profitswere logged by big banks, while auto makers and the steelindustry were hit with large losses.   Oil earnings soared, particularly for companies withsizable international refining and marketing operations.Profit margins in Asia were unusually fat because of supplydisruptions caused by the Middle East conflict. That alsoboosted European refining margins, as did a burst of coldweather. In other segments of the oil business, results wereflat. Oil prices were about the same as last year, butnatural gas prices were sharply lower. That ate away at someexploration and production profits. Petrochemical operationscontinued to slump.   Amoco's net income rose mostly because of an accountingchange; without it profit increased 5.6%. Phillips Petroleumhad a gain of $70 million from asset sales and a loss of $26million related to the early retirement of debt; a yearearlier it had gains of $148 million. Phillips said thatwithout the special items, profit would have risen 39%.   Securities brokers, boosted by a surging stock market,rebounded to post their biggest gains since the October 1987stock market crash. Pretax profits for the securitiesindustry exceeded $1 billion in the first quarter, analystsestimate, reversing a $162 million pretax loss for all of1990.   The strong U.S. stock and bond markets and volatilecurrency markets triggered fat trading gains at many firms.Revenue from principal trading surged 57% to a record atMerrill Lynch, 47% at Salomon, 43% at PaineWebber, 41% atMorgan Stanley and 28% at Bear Stearns.   Small investors started returning to the market, boostingcommission revenue, which rose 20% at several firms from aweak year-earlier period. A jump in stock and bondunderwriting, meantime, helped boost investment-bankingrevenue at firms such as Salomon, up 18%, Morgan Stanley, up15%, and Alex. Brown, up 41%.   Major banks generally reported lower earnings. Those weakresults, however, compared favorably with big losses in thethird and fourth quarters of last year for many banks.Analysts expect second-quarter earnings to remain lacklustercompared with year-earlier levels.   In the March quarter, many banks continued to set asidelarger-than-usual provisions for expected losses oncommercial real-estate loans. The recession and risingunemployment began to take a toll as some banks set biggerprovisions for losses on consumer loans, especially on creditcards. At Citicorp, the loan-loss provision jumped to $812million (including $531 million for consumer loans) from $570million. Shawmut's provision soared to $234 million from $69million. Bank of New York's provision, mostly on commercialloans, jumped to $343 million from $64 million.   MNC Financial increased its loan-loss provision and had$109 million of other losses, write-downs and restructuringexpenses, but that was more than offset by a $444 millionpretax gain on the sale of its credit-card unit. Year-earliernet at J.P. Morgan was boosted by $230 million from anaccounting change; Chemical's year-earlier results included a$114.7 million gain from the sale of an investment and a$52.3 million restructuring charge. Banks reporting earningsincreases, such as Chase Manhattan, benefited from fallinginterest rates, cost-cutting, improved trading gains, androbust fee income.   The Big Three auto makers' losses from operations in thefirst quarter totaled $2.33 billion, not only setting arecord for the industry but also practically guaranteeing anunprofitable year for each company. Indeed, 1991 most likelywill be the first full year of losses for each of the BigThree since 1980.   With a first-quarter operating deficit of $1.1 billion,General Motors now has posted losses for three consecutivequarters. GM partially offset the red ink with one-time gainsof $403 million from the sale of its building in New YorkCity and $306.5 billion from a shift to more liberalaccounting for parts inventories.   Ford Motor, meanwhile, felt the pinch from the U.S.recession and downturns in overseas markets that had giventhe No. 2 auto maker big financial lifts in the past. Ford'sfirst-quarter net loss included a $947 million deficit fromNorth American auto operations and $208 million in red inkfrom its international auto business. Ford atributed theoverseas decline to weakness in most European countries andAustralia.   Chrysler spent much of the first quarter scrambling tofind buyers for some of its assets, and its financial resultsfrom the period show why. The No. 3 U.S. auto maker posted aloss from operations of $341 million. But its net loss alsoincluded a one-time, $257 million charge for changing the wayit accounts for sales incentive costs.   All major steelmakers posted losses for the first quarter,and some have already said they expect more of the same inthe second quarter.   Squeezed by lower shipments and prices because of theslumping automotive and construction markets, steel companieshad little good news. Only smaller, specialized steelmakersmanaged to stay out of the red, though even they had poorresults. Allegheny Ludlum benefited from strong exports ofits stainless steel.   Here are the first-quarter profits for various industrygroups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter.

Pricesfor primary aluminum ingot weren't much lower on ayear-to-year basis, but the consistently low prices finallypulled down prices for can sheet and other fabricatedaluminum goods.   Despite the recessionary slump in demand, chemicalcompanies generally reported better than expected earningsdue to a drop in raw material costs caused by the end of thewar in the Persian Gulf. But results were skewed by severalnonrecurring charges and gains. Many chemical companyexecutives are bracing for bad news in subsequent quarters.More optimistic executives are pinning their hopes forcontinued quarterly gains on a rebound in the economy laterthis year.

The drillingmarket overseas has been stronger and steadier than in theU.S., and is expected to stay that way. After the PersianGulf conflict, many companies plan to step up their searchfor oil outside that troubled region. In addition, prices forsome products and services rose world-wide.   Profits at natural gas pipeline companies generally fellbecause of weak demand stemming from yet another quarter ofunseasonably warm weather and continued slowness in theeconomy.   Burlington Resources minimized its earnings declinedespite falling natural gas prices by increasing itsdiscovery and pumping operations; the company saidcost-reduction strategies helped results. At Panhandle, ahigher tax rate hurt net income even though three of thecompany's four major pipelines actually posted smallincreases in operating profit. Analysts said the warm weatherwill also probably tarnish the second quarter because naturalgas customers often replenish supplies but needn't do so thisyear after burning so little over the winter. Natural gasprices have recently plunged to five-year lows.

Burlington Northern washurt by declines in grain shipments and the effect of a $46million pretax accrual for potential labor settlements. OnlyUnion Pacific posted an increase in rail traffic. Santa FePacific's improvement reflected cost-cutting measures;without the effects of litigation settlements anddiscontinued operations, Santa Fe's first-quarter 1990 netloss would have been about $3 million.   Trucking company earnings were hurt by lower freightvolume, some rate deterioration and higher labor and benefitcosts. However, Consolidated Freightways cut losses at itsair freight unit, reflecting charters in support of OperationDesert Storm and increased postal business.   The big air-freight companies continued to be hurt by aslowdown in volume, the recession and high fuel costs.Federal Express suffered from losses on its overseasoperations, despite extra revenue from assisting with theGulf military buildup. The company's comparison was hurt bycharges for restructuring its British operations and aprovision against losses on payroll taxes. Among marinetransporters, American President benefited from militaryshipments to the Middle East for Operation Desert Storm andan increase in revenue per container in the company'sintra-Asia trade.   The deepest slump in years continued for heavy trucks andthe engines that power them. Companies reacted with morelayoffs and cost-cutting. Cummins Engine says production ofheavy-duty trucks in North America was down 45% from thefirst quarter of 1989. It predicts further declines in thesecond quarter. The company was saved from another loss inthe latest quarter by two one-time gains totaling $51.5million from accounting changes. One ray of hope: Eaton, atruck-parts maker, says that with customers' inventories atlow levels, &quot;even a modest recovery should help our shipmentlevels sometime in the second half.&quot;   Recession in the U.S. and in important overseas marketswere behind losses for some of the biggest makers of heavymachinery. Slack demand led to price-cutting, slicing furtherinto margins. While many machinery makers blamed the PersianGulf war for some of their problems, optimism hasn't returnedwith the war's quick end: &quot;There is no evidence this hascaused a surge in consumer spending or business investment,&quot;says Caterpillar. Clark Equipment's backlog fell 18% fromyear-earlier levels.

The lower volumes and margins from theprevious quarter constrained first-quarter earnings eventhough home sales improved, Kaufman andamp; Broad said. It alsosaid orders in its important California market rose 22% fromthe year-before period, and orders are continuing to showstrength in the second quarter. Standard Pacific said it alsosaw an increase in demand during the first quarter that iscontinuing in this quarter.   The recession hurt retailers in the traditionally slowApril quarter, depressing sales and pinching profits. ButWal-Mart, Gap and Dillard Department Stores aggressivelyexpanded market share and are expected to show earningsincreases. Analysts also expect Nordstrom to show an increasefrom weak year-earlier results.   Sears Roebuck, which operates on a calendar year, hasalready reported that earnings for its retailing andfinancial services operations jumped 91%, but much of thegain came from the sale of a shopping center; the company'score U.S. stores and catalogs posted lower sales for theperiod, but their losses narrowed to $102.5 million from$134.2 million a year earlier. J.C. Penney, Woolworth, DaytonHudson, May Department Stores and Limited are expected topost lower profits than a year earlier. Kmart's earnings areexpected to be essentially flat.   Penney, still trying to transform itself into a moderatelypriced department store, was hurt by soft sales and biginventories. The strong dollar hurt Woolworth, which hasEuropean operations. Dayton Hudson will suffer because of its1990 acquisition of Marshall Field's department stores andthe recession in California. Analysts credit May withslashing expenses to limit damage from the recession.   The Persian Gulf war, recession and overcapacitycontributed to one of the softest quarters in recent yearsfor the lodging and casino businesses. Travel and tourismtook a beating in January and February, pressuring profitmargins in a normally soft quarter and prompting someoperators to begin special promotions and other marketingcampaigns to boost business.   Hilton Hotels' hotel business suffered from sharpdownturns at its big properties catering to foreign tourists,while Marriott felt the effects of the slow market forreal-estate sales. Promus and Aztar reported net losses tiedto the drop in gambling customers in Atlantic City, N.J., andLas Vegas, Nev. Results at Circus Circus Enterprises werehelped by its big, relatively new Las Vegas casino, whileCaesars World profited from a streak of good luck at itshigh-end table games in Nevada. Despite the overall poorperformance, companies report a strengthening of travel sinceMarch, and   several analysts foresee markedly improvedresults in the second quarter as consumer confidence rises.   Restaurants had mixed results. Competitive pricing boostedsame-store sales roughly 6% at Wendy's, Chili's and PepsiCo'sTaco Bell. But pricing hurt McDonald's, which didn'tintroduce a lower-cost menu until late February. Thecompany's U.S. sales and profit margins fell. Overseas,McDonald's posted a 19% sales gain and higher profit margins.Shoney's earnings benefited from repayment of debt anddecreased interest expenses, but same-store sales rose only1%. TCBY's results suffered as same-store sales declined 11%and the number of stores fell by 28.   Although movie box offices were strong during the war anda home video slump was blamed on weak products rather thanoutside conditions, large entertainment companies sufferedanyway because of other, less recession-proof operations.Disney was hurt by sharply lower theme-park attendance, whileParamount and Time Warner were negatively affected by theirpublishing operations. Polaroid blamed its earnings declineon weak sales of its consumer-oriented instant film; salesare expected to rise if the economy strengthens.   American Greetings enjoyed a record quarter, buoyed bysales of greeting cards, which sold well during the war andwhich many consumers buy instead of gifts in tough times.Hasbro and Mattel had strong international sales.   In the media sector, television networks were hampered bysoft advertising and huge costs related to coverage of thePersian Gulf War. CBS had high war coverage costs but alsomounting sports-rights expenses. Capital Cities/ABC cited notonly poor earnings at the ABC network but also in itsmagazine and newspaper businesses.   For newspaper publishing companies, the advertising slumpdeepened yet again in the quarter, the steepest drops comingin classified advertising at most major papers. Gannett saida troubled retailing industry has choked off crucial ads forits papers. McGraw-Hill and New York Times were also hurt bypoor advertising levels in the trade and consumer magazinepublishing divisions.   Airline profits vanished during the first quarter, for thesecond consecutive period of record losses for the industry.The reason was simple: People stopped flying in January andFebruary, scared off by the uncertainties of the gulf war,fear of terrorism and the recession.   Although higher fuel prices were a factor for the carriersearly in the quarter, jet fuel costs fell and by March wereclose to year-before levels. Airlines tried to kick-starttravel by offering discount fares late in the quarter. Thatprovided a slight revenue infusion, but couldn't pull thequarter into the black. High-margin business travel, the mostlucrative kind of ticket for airlines to sell, still appearsto be off as many companies struggle through the recession orfind they can make do without travel.   Continued sluggish retail traffic depressed textile andapparel earnings. Springs Industries attributed its slump tothe recession and said a reduction of orders in homefurnishings has forced it to curtail production. Russellblamed &quot;significant costs associated with idle capacity&quot; atits factories. VF's profit rose because of higher sales ofjeans and a corporate restructuring that began a yearearlier.

Dean Foods benefited from higher operatingmargins largely because of lower raw-milk costs. But rivalBorden reported flat earnings due to nonoperating factors.   The nation's two largest cereal companies, Kellogg andGeneral Mills, rolled up hefty gains in cereal sales. Heinzhelped itself by boosting prices of soups, baby food andfrozen potato products. But Flowers Industries cited a shiftto lower-margin products by consumers and a difficult pricingenvironment for its earnings decline. Ralston's earnings gota charge from its batteries unit while earnings from humanand pet foods faded. McCormick said agribusiness, packagingand international operations improved sharply from a yearearlier. Flat sales combined with higher raw-materials coststo slash Lance's profits.   Food retailers with stores based in the economicallyhard-hit Northeast continued to report the weakest resultsfor their industry, while grocery chains in the Midwest,Southwest and Northwest  maintained somewhat healthier, ifnot robust, profits. Quarterly profits fell, for example, atthe already ailing Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea, which ismost rooted in the Northeast, and the chain recentlypredicted that by next quarter, its earnings may slide by asmuch as 30%. On the other hand, retailers like Albertson's,which has consistently been one of the strongest grocerychains in the country, had better results.   The big beverage companies reported gains in earnings, butvolume was hurt by the recession. Coca-Cola profited from aweaker dollar and higher case sales overseas, especially inits two biggest markets abroad, Germany and Japan. Domesticbottle and can volume gained 2%. Pepsi reported stronginternational growth, but case sales in the U.S. dropped 1%,reflecting the loss of the Burger King account to Coke.Coca-Cola Enterprises posted a larger-than-expected declinein volume, as case sales fell 2.5%, but it benefited from aprice increase.   Hospital and nursing home companies performed well despitecost-containment pressures, a trend expected to continue inthe current quarter. Moderating labor costs helped earningsacross the board, while some improvement in state Medicaidreimbursement rates also helped nursing home concerns, saysSmith Barney analyst Geoffrey Harris. Humana's fiscal secondquarter was aided by a 28% increase in health plan membershipfrom a year earlier.   Medical supply companies continued their double-digitearnings growth on strong domestic and international salesand a boost from favorable currency exchanges. But a strongdollar will temper the exchange effect in the currentquarter, says Joseph D. France, analyst at Smith Barney, andneutralize it in the second half.   C.R. Bard showed signs of recovering from regulatoryproblems with its angioplasty catheter business, and therecent approval of a new angioplasty catheter should help thecurrent quarter. Baxter International enjoyed more benefitsfrom a restructuring, which resulted in a $566 million pretaxcharge in the year-before period.   Pharmaceutical profits were buoyed by the continued strongsales of premium-priced pharmaceuticals and a rise in revenuefrom overseas operations. Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb andLilly benefited particularly from the robust sales ofrelatively new drugs that carry high price tags. Severalcompanies said sales outside the U.S. were driven byfavorable foreign currency exchanges. Pfizer's profitcomparison was hurt by a one-time gain in the 1990 firstquarter.   Analysts expect drug companies' profit on average tocontinue to rise about 17% for the year, barring a surge bythe U.S. dollar.   Profits at some cosmetic and personal-care companies werestrong, but weak unit sales in the U.S. characterized thefirst-quarter performance for practically all personal-careconcerns, as con sumer demand remained soft and retailerstrimmed inventories. Gillette got a boost from strong salesof its new Sensor razor. Earnings plunged at Neutrogena, assales of its shampoos and conditioners slipped.   Household-product companies also experienced sluggish unitsales in the U.S. After nearly two years of relative calm,marketing battles broke out in such product categories aslaundry detergents, toilet tissue and coffee. Clorox blamedthe recession and last year's purchase of the Pine-Solcleaner/Combat insecticide lines for its decline in earnings.Higher interest costs, the depressed U.S. economy and repairsat a paper mill caused Scott Paper to post sharply lowerprofit.

The bad news first erupted March19, when International Business Machines disclosed that saleswere slumping and said it would post only half as muchoperating profit as expected. That was devastating enough,but IBM also said it believed tough times loomed for theentire industry.   As it turned out, IBM's problems  were related more to thecompany than it let on: Its personal computers lost ground,and minicomputer sales stalled as IBM groomed a newgeneration. IBM also took a $2.26 billion non-cash charge toreflect its adoption of a new accounting rule, resulting inits first-ever quarterly loss.   Still, the period proved dismal for plenty of othercomputer companies. Among makers of large machines, gloomyresults from Amdahl and Unisys confirmed IBM's assessment ofthe economy's effect and held out little hope of an earlyrecovery. While acknowledging some slowness, DigitalEquipment was more upbeat, citing tight expense controls asprofit more than quadrupled from the year-before period,which included a $150 million charge for work-forcereduction.   On the PC side, Apple Computer and Compaq Computer saidtheir profit margins were hurt by new low-price policies.Only high-flying Sun Microsystems seemed untouched by thetroubles, as it posted record sales of its workstationcomputers. Data General, the aging minicomputer maker,reported its second consecutive quarterly profit, andanalysts started to believe its claims of a comeback.   Economic conditions continued to hurt office-equipmentmakers, which posted lackluster results for the quarter andpredicted uncertain times ahead. Xerox met analysts'expectations, but a strong dollar inflated results and thecompany said its big-ticket machines languished in &quot;verysoft&quot; markets. Last year's first-quarter results included aone-time charge of $375 million for abandoned real-estateinvestments. Pitney Bowes bucked the trend, posting higherprofit and saying it was &quot;cautiously optimistic.&quot;   In the semiconductor industry, Intel continued to postimpressive gains in net income, riding a wave of popularityof its 386 microprocessor, the basic chip in IBM personalcomputers and compatibles. On the strength of itsmicroprocessor family, Intel outpaced semiconductor rivals,which posted only slim profits. But despite a year-to-yeardrop in net, Advanced Micro Devices shows signs of breakingahead from the pack of domestic chip-makers chasing Intel.AMD recently began selling a clone of the popular 386 chip.   Among software makers, Microsoft and Novell continued toroll up big profit increases on the strength of a slew of hotproducts. Ashton-Tate posted a major gain resulting fromcost-cutting and a promising reception to a long-delayed newproduct. But Lotus Development saw profit tumble as demandfor its flagship 1-2-3 spreadsheet cooled in anticipation ofa new version later this year.   In the communications sector, Americn Telephone andamp;Telegraph was hurt by the recession, start-up costs of itsUniversal credit card and its battle to acquire NCR Corp.Analysts viewed the results as good, considering thecredit-card business costs. ATandamp;T got a boost from sale of astake in its Unix software business; otherwise profit wouldhave been flat.   Although Motorola's net declined, analysts had expectedfar worse after bad third and fourth quarters. Cost-controlmeasures helped, and semiconductor sales and profit were up.But higher cellular sales were offset by increased re searchand development costs. Lower customer inventories and theprospect of the recession easing in the second half wereencouraging, however, and several analysts raised theirearnings estimates.   While profits in the aerospace and defense group weremixed, the biggest drops in net income resulted from unusualgains a year earlier, and operating performance was generallyimproved.   General Dynamics had a $61.5 million gain in the 1990first quarter from the settlement of a lawsuit, whileNorthrop had a windfall of $67.1 million from the sale of itsheadquarters complex. Minus the year-earlier gain, Northrop'soperating profit actually climbed 36%. Lockheed blamed thedrop in its net on a higher tax rate, though analysts saidits performance was somewhat disappointing, with operatingprofit little changed. The jump in McDonnell Douglas's netlargely reflected the turnaround at its transport aircraftsegment, which went from an $84 million operating loss in the1990 first quarter to an $11 million profit this year.   In the diversified technology group, United Technologiessaid that for the first time, all three of its corebusinesses -- aircraft engines, automotive products andindustrial products -- were simultaneously in slumps. Theindustrial products segment includes Otis elevators andCarrier air conditioners.   Texas Instruments suffered from weak semiconductor pricesand a continued reduction in defense spending, althoughorders rose. It also had higher investment costs for newproducts and manufacturing capacity.   Rockwell and TRW, big suppliers of automotive components,have suffered along with the auto industry. TRW's information systems business, mainly credit reporting, also wasdown substantially.   In the medical/biotechnology group, Cetus's lossescontinue to come from frustration in the launch of itsflagship drug product, IL-2 for kidney cancer. It is expectedto continue logging losses until its IL-2 receives U.S.market approval. Analysts expect the company to post about a$13 million loss in the June 30 fiscal fourth quarter,compared with a loss of $16.5 million in last year's fourthquarter.   St. Jude Medical said its profit growth stems fromcontinued penetration of the world-wide heart valve market.And analysts expect the company to post the same degree ofprofit growth from steady demand for the current quarter tobetween $20 million and $22 million, compared with $16.4million last year. Stryker attributed its growth to steadilyincreasing demand for its medical and surgical products.Analysts generally forecast a continued profit growth ofabout 20%.

In the long-distance segment, MCI's declinereflected competitive pressures as well as the ailingeconomy. Continuing problems at US Sprint hurt UnitedTelecommunications. GTE, which is digesting its $6 billionmerger with Contel, posted a solid gain of 7.7% afterexcluding a one-time merger charge of $245 million. The sevenBaby Bells continued to report anemic growth in customertelephone lines and relatively flat earnings.   Denver-based U S West, the least dependent on businesscustomers, fared somewhat better than its siblings, but thecompany will probably feel less of a boost once the economyimproves. Ameritech and Southwestern Bell surprised analystswith sharper-than-expected declines.                                                                                                          --TELEPHONE                                                                                                                                        1st Qtr.    1st Qtr.    %   15 Firms                        1991        1990     Chg                                                                                                          Alltel Corp                   46,801      45,648      +3   Ameritech Corp               283,000     303,500      -7   Bell Atlantic Corp           353,600     355,300       0   BellSouth Corp               402,300     423,200      -5   Centel Corp                    7,942      14,166     -44   Cincinnati Bell               15,536      18,336     -15   GTE Corp                     200,000     407,000     -51   McCaw Cellular              -169,100     851,900     ...

Some of them said they didn't see anymajor turnaround in the economy soon.   General Electric's profit increase in a weak economyimpressed analysts. GE attributed the gain to strongperformance by its &quot;long cycle&quot; businesses and a significantimprovement in operating margin. ITT's financial unit hadhigher losses on consumer loans, its Sheraton hotelsoperation was hurt by the war, and its auto componentsbusiness slid because of lower world-wide auto output.Textron said that consumer spending for autos and otherdurable goods is likely to re main weak through the secondquarter, but that &quot;our balanced diversity will help usachieve another good year for Textron.&quot;                                                                                                          -- CONGLOMERATES                                                                                                                                        1st Qtr.    1st Qtr.    %   5 Firms                         1991        1990     Chg                                                                                                          General Electric             999,000     950,000      +5   Greyhound Dial Corp           17,548      16,890      +4   ITT Corp                     229,000     253,000      -9   Teledyne Inc                  15,300      58,300     -74   Textron Inc                   66,400      66,200       0   TOTAL                      1,327,248   1,344,390      -1</TEXT></DOC>
