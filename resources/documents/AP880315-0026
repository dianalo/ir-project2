The three were the only candidates to wage substantial mediacampaigns in Illinois. Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis and TennesseeSen. Gore, both Democrats, were spending in the $250,000 rangewhile Republican Vice President Bush reported a $400,000advertising buy.   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., started running ads last Monday but cutthem off in a pre-weekend strategy shift and had nothing on the airin the final days before the primary. Instead he bought a half-hourof time Saturday night, but his broadcast was beset by technicalproblems.   Democrat Richard Gephardt was bypassing Illinois to focus onMichigan's March 26 caucuses. And neither of the favorite sons,Democratic Sen. Paul Simon and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson,were advertising in their home state.   Front-runner Bush was running two ads he has used before _ one abiographical spot and the other showing him with world leaders andPresident Reagan. The latter says there is a difference betweencongressional and presidential leadership _ the closest Bush getsto criticizing Dole.   Gore was on the air with several ads including a new one inwhich he stresses his youth and service in Vietnam. ``There's onlyone choice for a new generation of leadership,'' says the narrator,echoing Gore's frequent contention that Dukakis can't get electedbecause he represents ``the old politics.''   For his part, Dukakis is taking a poke at Simon's insistencethat the Democratic race is wide open and ripe for a brokeredconvention.   The ad never mentions Simon, however. It merely says ``somepeople'' would like to go back to the days of brokered conventions``when voters didn't really pick their nominee. ... But you don'thave to do this. On Tuesday, you can pick the next president'' byvoting for Dukakis.   The low-key tone adopted by all three candidates was a dramaticchange from the ads leading up to last week's Super Tuesdaycontests in 20 states. At that time, Bush, Dole, Gephardt, Dukakisand Gore specifically attacked each other's records, character andcampaign themes in barbed commercials that didn't hesitate to namenames.   Dukakis held the lead in Democratic delegates going intoIllinois and was making some late progress toward the upper tier ofthe contest, where polls showed Simon and Jackson neck and neck.   In addition to his brokered convention spot, Dukakis was usingtwo ads he had run in Super Tuesday states _ one stressing hisexperience as a chief executive and another in which a unionofficial says Dukakis is not a ``shot-and-beer kinda guy'' but hiseconomic policies put people to work.   Gore also was running two other ads he had used for SuperTuesday, when he won six states. One spot chides U.S. companies forinvesting in jobs overseas rather than at home and the other saysbig chemical polluters, price fixers, corporate law breakers andgreedy drug manufacturers ``don't want Al Gore to be president''because he's fought them in the past.</TEXT></DOC>
