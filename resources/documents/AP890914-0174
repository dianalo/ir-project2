In a study released Thursday, the National Association of LatinoElected and Appointed Officials said 3,783 Hispanic electedofficials hold office in 37 states.   Texas leads the country, with 1,693 elected officials who accountfor 44.75 percent of the total, followed by New Mexico, with 647Hispanic elected officials who account for 17.1 percent of the total.   Despite their gains, however, elected Hispanic officials stillaccount for less than 1 percent of all elected officials nationwide,the organization said, while Latinos account for 8 percent of thepopulation.   ``Civic participation is the key to economic and politicaladvancement in the Latino community,'' said Rep. Solomon Ortiz,D-Texas., a board member of the group. ``The 1990 census and thereapportionment that follows will play a vital role in Latinoelectoral representation for the next decade.''   The Hispanic group found there are 10 Hispanic members ofCongress _ four from Texas, three from California, and one each fromNew York, Florida and New Mexico.   The study said there are 128 state legislators, 1,340 schoolboard members, 1,178 municipal officials, 246 mayors, and onegovernor _ Bob Martinez of Florida.   ``Hispanics continue to make impressive electoral gains at everylevel of office,'' said Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., the group'sboard president. ``A barometer of an ethnic group's integration intothe political system and society can be measured through theirnumber of elected officials.''   National Director Harry Pachon said that while growth continuesin such traditionally Hispanic states as Texas, California andFlorida, Latinos are also making gains elsewhere, includingIllinois, New Jersey and Washington.   Elected Hispanic women account for 19.7 percent of the Hispanicoffice holders, the study said.</TEXT></DOC>
