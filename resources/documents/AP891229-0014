The Commerce Department assessed the prospects of 350 U.S.industries for its 31st edition of the ``U.S. Industrial Outlook.''   On the industrial side, it predicted that three-fourths of the193 manufacturing firms it reviewed should enjoy rising shipmentsnext year while 18 percent will suffer declines and the rest willhave stagnant shipments.   It predicted a median growth rate in manufacturing shipments of2 percent next year, after removing the effects of inflation. Thatwould compare with estimated growth of 2.2 percent this year and2.5 percent in 1988.   The department predicted that service industries, especiallythose providing information and health care, would outperform themanufacturing sector.   Commerce Undersecretary J. Michael Farren, briefing reporters onthe forecast Thursday, said the United States is evolving steadilyinto an ``information economy.''   ``Industries involved in the collection, processing andcommunication of information are among the fastest growing,'' hesaid.   For 1990, the government projected the fastest growth inservices would be in satellite communication and electronicinformation services, both forecast to enjoy revenue gains of 20percent next year.   Computer software, data processing, management consulting,medical services and the cable television industry all wereprojected to have growth rates of 10 percent or higher.   In manufacturing, the big winners in 1990 were expected to bethe makers of surgical and medical instruments, with a projected 10percent rise in shipments, followed by makers of surgical supplies,with shipments forecast to be up by 9 percent.   The biggest loser in manufacturing was forecast to be makers ofhousehold washers and dryers, where shipments were projected todecline by 5 percent, followed by glass makers, facing a forecasted4.9 percent drop in shipments.   Both of those industries are tied closely to housingconstruction, which is expected to be lackluster next year.   Overall, construction was expected to show no gains as a modestincrease in housing construction will be offset by a decline innon-residential construction, reflecting expected declines inoffice and hotel construction, two sectors with high vacancy rates.   Another key sector likely to perform poorly next year is autos.Car sales were projected to drop another 1 percent to 9.9 millionunits in 1990 following a 5 percent fall in 1989.   Many of the industries that are not expected to do well in 1990are closely tied to the auto or construction sectors, includingproducers of construction materials, big-ticket householdappliances and steel.   Steel shipments should drop by 4 percent in 1990, down to alevel of 78 million tons. While that would be the lowest levelsince 1987, it still would be above the depressed sales recordedfrom 1982 through 1986.   Farren said that U.S. export sales, which have been one of theeconomy's main supports over the past two years, will continue torise next year although the trade deficit will show only a smallimprovement, in part because U.S. demand for imports remains high.   Among the exporting industries expected to do the best areaircraft makers, chemical producers and businesses catering toforeign tourists.   ``For the first time, receipts from foreigners traveling in theUnited States will exceed expenditures by Americans travelingabroad,'' Farren said, forecasting that the surplus in travel willlower the U.S. trade deficit by about $1 billion next year.   In 1989, shipments of civilian aircraft surpassed militaryaircraft shipments for the first time since 1981 and the governmentforecast that trend will continue. Based on record orders alreadyreceived, the department predicted approximately 512 deliveries ofcommercial jetliners in 1990, more than three times the level ofcommercial shipments just six years ago.   Chemicals, the leading U.S. export industry, will see moderategrowth in 1990 with export sales topping $38 billion, enough togenerate a $16 billion surplus over the amount of chemical productsexpected to be imported into the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
