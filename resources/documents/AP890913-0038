Feinberg.   Nearly all of the IMF's member governments are devoted to privateenterprise, although China, Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia belong.The Soviet Union does not. The United States has the largest blockof votes with 19.14 percent.   Gwin is special program adviser at the Rockefeller Foundation.Feinberg, a former member of the State Department Policy PlanningStaff, is executive vice president of the Overseas DevelopmentCouncil, a private group financed largely by foundations.   Their volume is called ``The International Monetary Fund in aMultipolar World: Pulling Together.''   The IMF provides loans and other assistance to developing nations.   Gorbachev has expressed interest in joining the fund, but theU.S. government has opposed the idea.   The authors suggested the Soviets could get advice from the fundas China has done from the IMF's sister organization, the WorldBank. Membership in the fund is a condition for joining the bank andthe two organizations have the same 151 member countries.   The authors said the Soviets need guidance on money, banking,price reform and exchange and trade relations.   As ``confidence-building'' measures, they recommended:   _Consultations among officials of the fund and the Soviet Union.   _Provision by the Soviets of data on their aid to the Third World.   _Soviet co-financing of some World Bank aid projects.   _Cooperation with the World Bank in some areas such as protectionof the environment.   Integrating the Soviets into the world economy could give thefund a central purpose for the 1990s, the writers suggested.   The IMF has been a failure in the past decade, according toanother writer in the volume, Jeffrey D. Sachs, professor ofinternational trade at Harvard University.   Sachs said few of the 39 developing nations the fund has tried tohelp this decade have become able to meet their internationalobligations without undermining their internal economies.   ``Most of the problem debtor countries are further away than everfrom renewed creditworthiness.''   A fund official said there would be no immediate comment fromfund Managing Director Michel Camdessus.</TEXT></DOC>
