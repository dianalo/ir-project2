Background  <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Legislation</ITAG>Section 123 of the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983 (Pub. L.98-181) authorized the Neighborhood Development Demonstration program.The report of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urbar Affairsreferred to the new authority as a:<ITAG tagnum="21">Demonstration Program to assist neighborhood organizations to carryout community development activities through an innovative matching grantmechanism. Designed to encourage greater financial self-sufficiency onthe part of non-profit neighborhood development groups, the program wouldprovide federal matching funds of up to $50,000 per organization on thebasis of charitable contributions which organizations raise from individuals,businesses, and religious institutions in their areas. Different matchnigratios would be established for participating organizations based uponthe size and economic condition of the community in which those organizationsoperate, although the ratio could not be lower than 50/50. [S. Rep. No.142, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 29 (1983).]</ITAG>Under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-242,approved February 5, 1988) $2 million was authorized for the program forFY 1988; however, only $1 million was actually appropriated to fund theprogram. See section 101(f) of Pub. L. 100-202. (In the interest of ensuringan efficient and timely distribution of funds, HUD will hold only one competition,but selected enough applications so that in the event additional fundsare appropriated in FY 1989, some of the applicants not assisted from theoriginal appropriation of $1 million may be assisted from the FY 1989 appropriation.)Under section 123(e)(6)(E), HUD may use no more than five percent of theappropriation for HUD administrative or other expenses in connection withthe demonstration. The remaining funds are to be used to match monetarysupport raised over a one-year grant period from individuals, businesses,and non-profit and other organizations located within established neighborhoodboundaries. Federal payments will be made on a quarterly basis, beginningwith the first quarter of the one-year period, as neighborhood organizationsreport and verify the amount of funds raised from private sector sourcesduring the previous quarter.  <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Program Objectives</ITAG>The Neighborhood Development Demonstration program is designed to determinethe ability of neighborhood organizations to fund and implement neighborhooddevelopment activities, using cooperative efforts and monetary supportfrom individuals, businesses and non-profit and other organizations locatedwithin the neighborhood boundaries. The Federal matching funds are incentivefunds to promote the development of this concept and to encourage neighborhoodorganizations to become more self-sufficient in their development activities.The Neighborhood Development Demonstration program has the following objectives:<ITAG tagnum="15">_To evaluate the degree to which new monetary contributions and otherprivate sector support can be generated and new activities undertaken atthe neighborhood level through Federal incentive funding;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_To determine the correlation, if any, between the demographics ofa neighborhood (</ITAG><T3>i.e., </T3>the income level of its occupants, the amount of non-residentialdevelopment, the percent of persons employed, the tenant/homeowner breakdown,the racial/ethnic makeup of the neighborhood, etc.) and the neighborhoodorganization's ability to raise funds within the neighborhood boundaries;<ITAG tagnum="15">_To determine the correlation, if any, between the type of neighborhoodimprovement activities proposed and the success of fund-raising efforts;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_To determine the correlation, if any, between the characteristicsof an organization and the success of its fund-raising efforts.</ITAG>II.Allocation and Distribution of FundsThe Department proposes to make grants, in the form of matching funds,to eligible neighborhood development organizations. Under section 123(e)(3),grantee organizations may receive no more than $50,000 in Federal matchingfunds in a single program year. The amount of Federal matching funds thatan organization may receive depends in part upon the amount of monetarycontributions raised from within the established neighborhood boundariesin the preceding quarter. <T3>Funds raised from organizations or persons not residing in or conductingbusiness within the grantee's neighborhood, loans, in-kind services, contributionsby owners of properties to be improved, fees for services, public funds,and any in-lieu-of-cash contributions cannot be used to match Federal funds.Such contributions may, however, be used to carry out project activities.</T3>The neighborhood monetary contributions for matching purposes mustbe raised within the one-year grant period. However, grant activities maybe programmed over a period of one to three years.Maximum Federal matching ratios are to be established in accordance withthe statutorily required `` smallest number of households or greatest degreeof economic distress'' criteria. Subject to the statutory maximum of $50,000.00,with Federal match will range from one to six Federal dollars for eachqualifying dollar raised by the grantee. Applications selected to receiveFederal funds will be rank-ordered, and the matching ratio determined,based on application of these two criteria. Applications will be rankedon <T3>each </T3>of the two criteria. Applications best satisfying <T3>either </T3>criterion will be placed in the matching ratio categoryeligible to receive six Federal dollars for each neighborhood dollar. Applicationsplaced in the other matching ratio categories will receive proportionallyless, with those in the matching ratio category least satisfying eithertest being eligible to receive one Federal dollar for each neighborhooddollar.Any application selected for the award of Federal funds that proposed amatching funds ratio <T3>in excess </T3>of the ratio HUD determines for it will be offered anaward of funds at the HUD-determined ratio. However, any application selectedfor award that proposed a match <T3>below </T3>the maximum ratio HUD determines for it will be funded atthe level proposed by the applicant.Federal payments to participating neighborhood organizations will be madeon a quarterly basis following receipt of quarterly performance and financialreports. The maximum Federal payment will be governed by the amount ofverified, qualifying monetary contributions received in the preceding quarter,multiplied by the appropriate matching funds ratio.III.
