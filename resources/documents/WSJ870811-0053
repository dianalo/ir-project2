The company wasn't more specific.    The Fountain Valley, Calif.-based health maintenance organization had net income for the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter of $2.7 million, or 26 cents a share, on revenue of $75.4 million. For the year, net income was $9.2 million, or 89 cents a share, on revenue of $264.7 million.    FHP said the loss for the latest quarter stemmed from several one-time charges, including expenses related to the start-up of new operations, an increase in reserves for doubtful accounts, and the failure of one contractor to pay certain claims owed to third parties. </TEXT></DOC>
