The only major changes from the NPRM in these final regulations are theinclusion of a definition of ``similar family-centered'' services in theselection criterion ``Percentage of eligible children and parents to beserved'' (andSection; 212.21(b)), a change in the selection criterion ``Promiseas a Model'' (andSection; 212.21(e)) to give more emphasis to an applicant'spreliminary evaluation plan, and changes in the allocation of points amongthe selection criteria in andSection; 212.21. The NPRM referred to a new process for appealing adverse agency decisionsto an Office of Administrative Law Judges (53 FR 43178). For further information,refer to proposed regulations published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 2, 1988 (53 FR 48866). For informationon the Migrant Education Even Start program, refer to the NPRM publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 21, 1988 (53 FR 51530). <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes </ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 29 parties submittedcomments on the proposed regulations. Many comments were favorable, withno suggested changes. An analysis of the other comments and of the changesin the regulations since the publications of the NPRM follows. Major issuesare grouped according to the subject, with appropriate sections of theregulations referenced. Technical and other minor changes are not addressed.Description of the Program Section 212.1 <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested the inclusion of language fromsection 1051 of the Act to more adequately describe the program. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that addition of this languagewould be helpful. <T3>Changes: </T3>Section 212.1 has been amended to include the languagesuggested by the commenter. Eligibility Section 212.2 <ITAG tagnum="81">(a) Eligible Children </ITAG><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters objected to the provision in andSection;212.2(b)(2), restricting eligibility to those children residing in an elementaryschool attendance area designated for participation in the basic Chapter1 program. Commenters noted that section 1055(2) of the Act does not specificallylimit eligible attendance areas to elementary school attendance areas andargued that the Department should adopt the broader interpretation in orderto extend the program's benefits to as many families as possible. One commenterspecifically supported the restriction. <T3>Discussion: </T3>In the preamble to the proposed regulations, the Secretaryparticularly invited comment on this issue. Three provisions of the Act,along with research on the needs of educationally disadvantaged children,lead the Secretary to retain the restriction that only children residingin participating elementary school attendance areas be eligible for EvenStart. Section 1055(2) of the Act limits eligibility to children ages 1-7. Thesechildren are properly considered as residing in an elementary school attendancearea rather than a secondary school attendance area, because they wouldnot be served by the secondary schools at their ages. It is thus appropriateto interpret the term ``attendance area'' in the Even Start statute tomean only elementary school attendance areas. In addition, the Act further limits eligibility to those children, ages1-7, residing in school attendance areas ``designated for participation''in the basic Chapter 1 program. The limitation to participating, as opposedto eligible, Chapter 1 schools seems intended to ensure that Even Startbe coordinated with the basic Chapter 1 program, as required by sections1054(b)(7) and 1056(c)(6) of the Act. This coordination will occur andbe most meaningful to the children if the attendance areas in which EvenStart children reside are those of their elementary schools. Further, section 1056(c)(5)(A) of the Act requires an applicant's planto include methods to ensure that projects ``will serve those eligibleparticipants most in need of activities and services provided by this part.''Elementary school attendance areas tend to target Chapter 1 services tothe most needy areas more effectively, because in general they are smallerthan secondary school attendance areas. Finally, the Department has found that children who do not receive continuedservices, especially those children most in need, frequently do not sustaininto the middle elementary grades the gains acquired in preschool programs.Although it is the of Even Start to enable children to succeed as learnersin the regular classroom, by limiting Even Start eligibility to childrenresiding in participating elementary school attendance areas, the Secretaryensures that basic Chapter 1 services will be available to Even Start participantsif they need them. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <ITAG tagnum="81">(b) Eligible Parents </ITAG><T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter was concerned that the eligibility requirementfor parents would exclude those parents who are receiving mandated educationalservices through programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children(AFDC). <T3>Discussion: </T3>Parents who are eligible for participation in an adulteducation program under the Adult Education Act are eligible to receiveEven Start services. The eligibility requirements of the Adult EducationAct, set forth fully in the preamble to the Even Start NPRM, include asan eligible adult those ``who are not enrolled in secondary school'' and``who are not currently required to be enrolled in school.'' The latterphrase is interpreted to mean that only those who, because of their age,are required by State attendance laws to be enrolled in school, are ineligiblefor adult education programs. Therefore, a parent who is required to receiveeducational services through programs such as AFDC or the Job TrainingPartnership Act is not excluded from Even Start eligibility by the definitionin the Adult Education Act. Based on further internal review of the eligibility provision in andSection;212.2(b)(1), the Secretary has determined that the phrase ``eligible forparticipation in an adult basic education program'' might be confusing.The Adult Education Act no longer uses the term ``adult basic education''but rather refers to ``adult education.'' In order to avoid confusion betweenthe eligibility requirement in the Adult Education Act and the Department'suse of the phrase ``adult <T3>basic </T3>education'' (as opposed to other types of adult education),the Secretary is changing the language in andSection; 212.2(b)(1) to be consistentwith the current Adult Education Act. <T3>Changes: </T3>The word ``basic'' has been deleted from the phrase ``adultbasic education program'' in andSection; 212.2(b)(1). <ITAG tagnum="81">(c) Eligible Applicants </ITAG><T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter requested an emphasis in the regulationson collaboration, if appropriate, with institutions of higher education,community-based organizations, the appropriate State educational agency(SEA), or other appropriate nonprofit organizations.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Although the Act requires the Secretary to award grantsto a ``local educational agency'' (defined in section 1471 of the Act),sections 1054(a) and 1056(c)(4) of the Act provide that an applicant LEAshall, if appropriate, collaborate with institutions of higher education,community-based organizations, the appropriate SEA, or other appropriatenonprofit organizations. <T3>Changes: </T3>Section 212.2 has been amended to provide that an eligibleapplicant shall have collaborated with these entities if appropriate. Definitions Section 212.6 <T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter suggested defining the term ``home-basedprogram,'' which is used in section 1054(b)(6) of the Act. The commenternoted that the term may have different meanings in different locations.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary recognizes that the term ``home-basedprogram'' is not precise; in general, however, it is understood to meanprograms that are provided to parents and children in their homes, as opposedto those in schools or centers to which participants must travel. Whilea regulatory definition would standardize the term for Even Start, theSecretary is concerned that such a definition may conflict with existingState or local laws, regulations, or policies. Therefore, the Secretaryhas not included a definition in the regulations. <T3>Changes: </T3>None.Selection Criteria Section 212.21 <ITAG tagnum="81">(a) Percentage of Eligible Children and Parents to be Served. andSection;212.21(b) </ITAG><T3>Comments: </T3>Two commenters objected to the language in the preamblestating that some Head Start participants may be considered unserved bysimilar family-centered projects (53 FR 43179). The commenters suggestedthat all Head Start participants be considered served because they receivefamily-centered services. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Even Start program contains some features thatmay not be included in other family-centered programs. The Even Start programis intended to help parents be their children's first teachers and becomemore literate in the process, rather than to teach parents and childrenin separate and distinct programs. Thus, Even Start projects must focuson the parents and children as a unit, include activities on which parentsand children can work together, and provide services in the home if possible. A definition of the term ``similar family-centered services'' will helpapplicants to decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether potential participantsshould be considered served or unserved. This will allow for a more accuratecount of those actually receiving the same type of services that the EvenStart program provides. <T3>Changes: </T3>A definition of ``similar family-centered services''for the purpose of these regulations has been added to the selection criterionin andSection; 212.21(b). <ITAG tagnum="81">(b) Promise as a Model Section 212.21(e). </ITAG><T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter requested stronger wording for the ``willingnessto serve as a model'' element, andSection; 212.21(e)(3). <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes that the criterion regardingwillingness to serve as a model, as proposed, should be retained becauseit is not a program requirement; it is one element of the selection criterion.Based on internal review, however, the Secretary has determined that thesub-element regarding project evaluations, andSection; 212.21(e)(1), shouldcontain a more explicit description of the contents of the preliminaryevaluation plan or approach to be included in applications. This will providemore guidance to both applicants and the panel members. The Secretary hasalso determined that, due to the important role that evaluations play ina demonstration program such as this, this sub-element should be strengthened,and points transferred from the sub-element in paragraph (e)(2) of thissection to that in paragraph (e)(1). <T3>Changes: </T3>In andSection; 212.21(e)(1), three elements of a preliminaryevaluation plan are specified, and two points are added to this sub-element.Two points are removed from andSection; 212.21(e)(2). <ITAG tagnum="81">(c) Other Changes in Number of Points Assigned </ITAG><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters suggested giving more points to ``percentageof eligible children and parents to be served,'' andSection; 212.21(b). Onecommenter also suggested that more points be given within that selectioncriterion on a sliding scale that extends higher than 50 percent of theeligible children and their parents, rather than assigning the same pointvalue to all applications that indicate serving more than 50 percent ofeligible children and parents. One commenter suggested a shift in pointsfrom ``degree of cooperation and coordination'' to ``percentage of eligiblechildren and parents to be served.'' One commenter suggested increasingthe number of points assigned to sub-elements (5) and (6) listed within``likelihood of success in meeting the Even Start goals,'' andSection; 212.21(a).Another commenter gave a suggested breakdown in points among the sub-elementsin the ``reasonableness of budget'' criterion, andSection; 212.21(d). <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary has reconsidered the number of pointsassigned to each criterion, particularly those assigned to ``percentageof eligible children and parents to be served.'' Given the specific requirementin section 1057(a) of the Act that this criterion be used, the Secretaryagrees that it should be given more weight, and agrees that additionalpoints be given for projects serving more than 50 percent of the unservedeligible population. The Secretary believes that the number of points for the criterion ``degreeof cooperation and coordination'' should not be reduced, inasmuch as manyof the services Even Start will provide may also be supported with otherfunds, and by agencies other than LEAs. As shown by the legislative historyof the statute, Congress intended this aspect of the program to be especiallyimportant. (H.R. Rep. No. 100-95, p. 15; S. Rep. No. 100-222, p. 31). The points to be added to ``percentage of eligible children and parentsto be served'' are most properly taken from ``likelihood of success inmeeting the Even Start goals,'' the most heavily weighted criterion. TheSecretary believes that points have been properly allocated to sub-elements(5) and (6) of that criterion, and that the five points should be removedfrom sub-elements (1) and (2), both of which are broadly defined and weremore heavily weighted. The Secretary also does not believe that the points assigned to the ``reasonablenessof budget'' criterion should be sub-divided among its sub-component items,because the points assigned to this criterion are so small. Further breakdownwould not allow a sufficient range of points to provide adequate discriminationamong applicants. <T3>Changes: </T3>Five points are added to andSection; 212.21(b), ``percentageof eligible children and parents to be served.'' A new percentage cutoffand new percentage ranges are included in this paragraph. Five points areremoved from andSection; 212.21(a), ``likelihood of success in meeting theEven Start goals.'' <ITAG tagnum="81">(d) Other Suggested Changes </ITAG><T3>Comments: </T3>Commenters addressed five additional issues regardingselection criteria. (1) A few commenters suggested that coordination withState and locally funded programs be mentioned specifically in andSection;212.21(c). (2) Two commenters suggested the inclusion of references topupil services and pupil services personnel in some of the selection criteria,and one commenter suggested the inclusion of references to enrichment activities.(3) One commenter suggested that andSection; 212.21(a)(6) refer to instructionaland developmental activities that are appropriate for children and parents,not just children. (4) One commenter suggested that the regulations recognizethat adults participating in the program need instruction from personswith special skill in that field, as opposed to early childhood specialistswho serve children. <T3>Discussion: </T3>(1) The Secretary agrees that coordination with Stateand locally funded programs should be mentioned specifically, particularlybecause Congress intended for Even Start to ``build on existing communityresources . . .'' (section 1051 of the Act). (2) The Secretary agrees thatthe inclusion of pupil services and enrichment activities may be appropriatefor some Even Start projects; however, their inclusion in project designshould be left to local discretion. (3) The Secretary agrees that instructiondirected towards parents and their children may be different, and thatactivities should be appropriate for all participants. (4) The Secretaryrecognizes that different specialists may be needed to serve differentage levels; this issue is addressed in andSection; 212.21(a)(3) of the regulations.However, specific staffing patterns are left to local project discretion.<T3>Changes: </T3>References to State and locally funded programs are addedto andSection;andSection; 212.21(c) (1) and (3). The word ``children'' in andSection;212.21(a)(6) is changed to ``participants.'' Urban-Rural Distribution Section 212.22 <ITAG tagnum="81">(a) Funding Mechanism</ITAG><T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter expressed concern that the mechanism offirst funding the top-ranked urban and rural applications from each Statecould result in low-rated applications being funded from States from whichall applications were rated low, whereas highly ranked, but not top-scoring,applications from other States would go unfunded. The commenter wantedto ensure that, while an equitable geographic distribution of grants ismade, only highly qualified applicants will be funded.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 212.22(b)(3) states that the Secretary willfund equal numbers of projects in each category ``<T3>provided there are sufficient acceptable applications in each category</T3>''(italics supplied). By including the word ``acceptable'' here and in andSection;212.22(b)(3)(i)and (ii), the Secretary will ensure that a poor application is not selected,even if the application is the highest scoring one in a State.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<ITAG tagnum="81">(b) Designation as Urban or Rural</ITAG><T3>Comments:</T3> None.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Based on internal review, the Secretary believes thata clarification of urban LEA and rural LEA is necessary because the regulationsdo not address a situation in which an LEA contains areas that are withina Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) and areas that are not.<T3>Changes:</T3> Section 212.22(c) has been amended to state that if anLEA encompasses areas both within and outside an SMSA, the LEA should designatethe category (urban or rural) in which the majority of expected participantslive. The application will then be placed in that category.<T3>Transition Provisions Section 212.40</T3><T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter suggested that the regulations includea provision requiring the Secretary to notify SEAs of all grants to LEAsin their States and apprise SEAs annually of new awards and continuationawards.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Although these regulations do not include provisionsrequiring the Secretary to notify SEAs of awards in their States, it isthe intention of the Secretary to notify SEAs of grant awards, keep themapprised of grantees' progress, and provide necessary information on thetransfer of administration to SEAs if that becomes necessary.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Comments pertaining to statutory requirements<T3>Comments:</T3> Many commenters requested changes concerning issuesthat are governed by statutory requirements. These include: creation ofthe Even Start program; the requirement that only LEAs (defined in section1471 of the Act) are eligible to apply; the limitation on eligibility toresidents of participating Chapter 1 attendance areas; the parent age limitationscontained in the Adult Education Act; limitations on the Federal shareof project costs; limiation of grants to four years; the requirement <T3>of</T3> a discretionary grant process from the Federal Government toLEAs; and the requirement that applicants give public notice and hold anopen meeting before submitting an application (20 U.S.C. 3386).In addition, several commenters suggested that the regulations specificallyrepeat certain statutory information. The suggested inclusions were: Thedeclining Federal share of costs (section 1054(c) of the Act); the requiredprogram elements (section 1054(b) of the Act) and the other programs withwhich Even Start projects must coordinate (section 1054(b)(7) of the Act).One commenter requested that the Department interpret the statutory requirementthat grantees provide services to ``special populations, such as individualswith limited English proficiency and individuals with handicaps'' (section105(c)(5)(6) of the Act), to specifically require grantees to serve individualswho have not mastered standard English proficiency.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary may not change statutory requirements.The Secretary realizes that Even Start applicants will need to refer tothe statute. The application package will contain statutory requirements,including those mentioned by the commenters.The statute provides two examples of ``special populations'' but does notlimit ``special populations'' to those two. The Secretary does not wishto limit the phrase ``special populations'' for the purpose of this programby providing a further interpretation of the phrase in these regulations,but rather leaves to grantees the flexibility to serve different typesof special populations. An applicant must set forth in its plan the methodsto be used to serve those special populations (section 1056(c) of the Act).<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12291.
