The exploratory well, Carmen Central-5, drilled in Block 1-AB, is currently testing at a rate of about 4,150 barrels a day of 20.7 degree API gravity crude oil, the company said. The oil is a moderately heavy crude oil. Further drilling will be required to determine the extent of the new field, a spokesman said.    The Carmen Central-5 well is 10 miles from the Shiviyacu field extension well, Shiviyacu-20, which was disclosed as an 11,200-barrel-a-day producer in October, the company said. Occidental said it currently produces more than 80,000 barrels a day from 12 fields in its Block 1-AB. The company said it recently initiated a seismic program to define additional prospects in Block 1-AB.    Separately, Occidental said it signed an exploration contract with Y.P.F., Argentine National Oil Co. regarding Tierra Del Fuego, at the southernmost tip of the country. Occidental is the operator and has a 98% interest.    The contract is for the one-million-acre Rio Grande Sur block, which is three miles south of the nearest field, Occidental said. The contract is part of the Argentine government's policy to encourage private investment, Occidental said.    On another issue, an Occidental spokesman said yesterday that bad weather in the North Sea continued to prevent repair work on an oil pipeline and extended the disruption of output from Occidental's fields there to the 12th day in a row.    Pipeline repairs have halted production at the Flotta terminal, which serves the Piper, Scapa and Claymore fields operated by Occidental and two fields operated by Texaco North Sea U.K. Ltd., a unit of Texaco Inc. The Occidental spokesman said it remains uncertain when output from the Flotta system will resume.    Occidental's share of output from its three North Sea fields accounts for more than one-fourth of its world-wide average daily production of 325,000 barrels. </TEXT></DOC>
