Tuesday's battle in Zamboanga del Sur province, about 500 milessoutheast of Manila, was the bloodiest clash with Moslem rebelssince a cease-fire went into effect in 1986.   Also, a judge in Manila on Wednesday acquitted a former associateof ex-President Ferdinand Marcos of rebellion charges in connectionwith an attempt to topple the government of President Corazon Aquino.   The Aug. 28, 1987, coup attempt left more than 50 dead and wasthe most serious attempt to overthrow Mrs. Aquino, who becamepresident after a popular and military uprising ousted Marcos in1986.   The battle Tuesday between Philippine Army troops and Moslemrebels claimed the lives of 32 guerrillas, eight civilians, twogovernment militiamen and one soldier.   Reports said fighting erupted after about 300 rebels from theMoro National Liberation Front and the Moro Islamic Liberation Frontattacked the village of Kulasian to avenge the deaths of somecolleagues.   Gunboats were dispatched to the area to prevent the rebels fromescaping by sea, reports said. Troops then conducted an air andground assault.   Both the Moro National Liberation Front and the rival MoroIslamic Liberation Front have been fighting for Moslem rule onMindanao and other southern islands since 1972. But fighting hasbeen reduced to sporadic skirmishes since the guerrillas agreed to acease-fire in 1986.   Officials estimate that more than 50,000 people were killed atthe height of the Moslem rebellion in the mid-1970s.   In Manila, Judge Maximiano Asuncion ruled there was insufficientevidence to convict former provincial Gov. Orlando Dulay ofrebellion charges in connection with his takeover of the provincialcapitol building in Quirino province north of Manila.   But the judge sentenced Dulay to 10 months in prison and finedhim $50 for trying to strangle then-Quirino Gov. Renicolas Delizoand holding several employees during the takeover.   Asuncion said Dulay's takeover of the building was not part of a``public uprising'' necessary to convict him of rebellion. Theincident took place as more than 2,000 mutineers led by renegade Lt.Col. Gregorio Honasan stormed the presidential palace and media andmilitary facilities in Manila.   At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded inthe coup attempt. Honasan escaped from a prison ship with some ofhis guards in April and has not been found.   Dulay had been held in a Quirino jail since March 1987 inconnection with the slaying of two Aquino supporters during the 1986presidential election between Marcos and Mrs. Aquino.   Witnesses testified that Dulay was released during the coupattempt and, dressed in combat fatigues, led a force to the capitolbuilding, where he herded Delizo and others into the governor'soffice at gunpoint.</TEXT></DOC>
