Q+E extends Excel's built-in database toany dBase file on disk by automatically generating structured query languageto extract from any dBase-compatible file, and dynamic data exchange linksbetween spreadsheet cells and the database ensure that the data is accurate;Q+E is claimed to look like Excel so that it will present users with afamiliar unser interface; new Excel users can get it as a special offer at$10 by completing a coupon in the Excel box, but current registered userswill have to pay $50 for Q+E.andM;- o -andM;Software developer Saros Corp in Bellevue, Washington isandM;generating some excitement with a program called FileShare, designed toenable users of MS-DOS personal computers to track down a file whose name andlocation they have forgotten, no matter where it is on the network: accordingto the Wall Street Journal, the user gives FileShare a set of paramaters -such as who created the file, when, the subject or whatever, and the programdoes the rest, coming back with a set of electronic index cards, one for eachfile that matches the parameters.andM;- o -andM;Mitel Telecom Ltd says that its SX-50 PABX is the first BritishandM;telephone system to be accepted in Norway since the country changed itstelecommunications approvals regulations in January last year.andM;- o -andM;The GE Information Services arm of General Electric Co has beenandM;awarded a one-year contract by the US General Services Administration toprovide Electronic Data Interchange services to the GSA-Federal SupplyService: the value of the contract, which includes options covering twoyears, has not been disclosed.andM;- o -andM;STC Plc's Defence Systems Division will become a value addedandM;reseller of Proteon International Ltd's ProNET-80 local area network productand p4100 and p4200 internetworking routers from the end of this year.andP;  Japanhas removed all the controls on exports of memory chips to the EuropeanCommunity in compliance with international trade rules, the EuropeanCommission said: the restrictions arose from the controversial third countryfair market value provisions of the US-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement,which were declared illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs andamp; Trade -but the Commission is still studying possible dumping of memory chips inEurope by Japan.andM;- o -andM;Cellular Communications Inc has agreed to sell some equipment to aandM;non-wireline cellular operator for about $11.3m as part of its changeover toNorthern Telecom Ltd equipment in its Southern Ohio system: since the salesprice of the old equipment is less than its book value, the company will takea one-time book loss of about $9m; replacement of the present equipment withthe Northern Telecom kit will be done in stages but should be completed bythe end of 1989; the cost of the new equipment, at about $13m, is only about$2m more than the firm will get for the equipment being sold, and as pricesof cellular network equipment have declined dramatically, it is costing $10mless than the equipment being sold.andM;- o -andM;Sand Technology Systems International wants to buy in up to 5.5mandM;of its 118.7m Class A common shares between July 10 to July 10, 1990, withfunds for the purchase coming from the company's working capital, saying itbelieves the current market price of its shares fails adequately to reflectthe value of its business or future prospects but does represent anattractive investment and an appropriate and desirable use of its resources.andM;- o -andM;Cap Gemini Sogeti SA's Spanish subsidiary Cap Gemini Espana isandM;looking to acquire any other companies active in consulting and custominformation technology services: Cap Gemini Espana already owns 7% ofInisel's computer subsidiary Eria but denies that it has plans to expand itsinterest;

and as part of the effort, the two will providemutual support of each other's efforts in the area of computer-supportedtelephony within the various standards organisations.andM;- o -andM;McDonnell Douglas Corp has agreed to do a version of its Pro-IVandM;application development language for minicomputers made by Toshiba Corp, andthe McDonnell Douglas' Information Systems Co subsidiary estimates that theagreement will produce over $5m in payments over the first three years of theagreement, which will give Toshiba a 10-year exclusive worldwide licence forthe new version, being written for the OS-III and OS-V operating systems.andM;- o -andM;Hewlett-Packard Co, Du Pont Co and the Los Alamos NationalandM;Laboratory are to join forces in a high-temperature superconductivityresearch programme in rivalry to the one that brings together ATandamp;T Co andIBM: the joint technical programme will first focus on development ofthin-film, high-temperature superconductors for electronic components, andthe collaboration will involve the equivalent of 25 or more researchers andan estimated $10m of equipment and facilities.andM;- o -andM;Mentor Graphics Corp is to pay $4.3m up-front and up to $30m overandM;four years in royalties for the assets of Trimeter Technologies Corp, notablya design synthesis system.andM;- o -andM;Daisy Systems Corp says its results for the the quarter to June 30andM;will include a charge of about $32m to cover its loss on sale of HHB Systemsto Racal Redac Ltd for $19m.andM;- o -andM;Michael O'Donnell is president and acting chairman of UltimateandM;Corp, East Hanover, New Jersey after founder Ted Sabarese filed for personalbankruptcy under Chapter XI of the Federal Bankruptcy code, listing assets of$18.79m and liabilities of $30.74m, and claiming that he was the victim of &quot;agigantic fraud&quot;; he holds 6% of the company's shares and his family speaksfor another 14% of the total stock.andM;- o -andM;Fronting a meeting with analysts in the enforced absence ofandM;Sabarese, Michael O'Donnell, credited with turning Ultimate Corp around bystrengthening its focus on its key vertical markets and abandoning thePick-on-DEC VAX business, said that he looks for between $1.10 and $1.40 ashare for the year to April 30, 1990, on turnover up 15% to between $210m and$230m in the absence of any acquisitions that Ultimate might make during theyear.andM;- o -andM;The Bell Canada regulated telephone company arm of BCE Inc isandM;having to repay about $219m to subscribers following a ruling in the SupremeCourt of Canada upholding a decision by the Canadian Radio-Television andamp;Telecommunications Commission that it had  overcharged customers.andM;- o -andM;The board of the Deutsche Bundespost narrowly voted to abandon itsandM;volume-related tariffs on high-speed leased data lines so that in future,users who lease 64Kbps and 2Mbps lines will pay a flat lease fee regardlessof traffic volume.andM;- o -andM;Unisys Corp has reached a settlement with the US Navy on some ofandM;the outstanding issues between the two, and three units of the company cannow resume bidding on US government defence contracts: Unisys is paying$200,000 and making organisational changes to settle the charges, but largerissues may require the company to pay out more than $30m and plead guilty tocriminal charges; Unisys already agreed not to bill the Pentagon for $20m dueon some consultancy contracts.andM;- o -andM;The New York Times went overboard last week on the reiteration byandM;IBM president Jack Kuehler that IBM is in volume production of 4M-bit memorychips, highlighting the fact that that it means that IBM is a month or threeahead of the main Japanese manufacturers: it was in fact already widely knownthat IBM would be introducing the new generation parts into products beforethe end of the year, and the expectation is that memory-hungry AS/400 usersare right at the front of the queue, although next year the new parts shouldalso be infiltrating main memory and disk controllers on the 3090s andgetting into 80486-based - and perhaps some 80386 - models of the PersonalSystem/2.andM;- o -andM;The Financial Times has rather belatedly picked up on the storyandM;that GEC Plessey Telecommunications Ltd is working on a combination of theStromberg Carlson DCO rural exchange and that of System X in an effort to winUS business where larger rural exchanges are required, as reported here lastmonth (CI No 1,178): the FT highlights the potential the conflict with theSiemens AG EWSD exchange in the event that the West German becomes a 40%shareholder in GEC Plessey - but the Siemens exchanges are pitched primarilyat large main exchange contracts with the US Baby Bells.andM;- o -andM;Hello sailor! Hewlett-Packard Co has brought out the HP VectraandM;Mariner II, a #3,160 version of the 80286-based Vectra ES/12 specificallydesigned to withstand the rigours of a life on the ocean wave.andM;- o -andM;Ever felt like shooting your computer? We don't recommend this atandM;all - that glass is far from shatter-proof, but Newsbytes reports that a guyin West Palm Beach, Florida is offering a Hong Kong-developed game calledCount Disk which consists of a program on floppy that puts up a dart board onthe screen and can detect the suction cap arrows fired from a little plasticgun - but we fear that it won't appeal to Eric Bristow at all - there's nosound generation in the thing, so if you want the full satisfaction of threetreble 20s, you're going to have to shout &quot;One Hundred and Eighty!&quot; all byyourself; still there are several brewers we know and hate who would love tohave the thing in their pubs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
