Operating earnings increased 39%.    The financial and travel services giant had net of $252.3 million, or $1.14 a share, in the latest quarter. That was down from $321 million, or $1.40 a share, a year earlier, when operating profit was $181.4 million, or 77 cents a share.    Earnings in the year-earlier quarter included a gain of $139.6 million, or 63 cents a share, from the sale of the company's interest in Warner Amex Cable Communications Inc.    Revenue increased 8.8% to $3.7 billion from $3.4 billion.    Operating results were aided in the 1987 first quarter by a sharp decline in after-tax corporate charges, such as business development expenses, which dropped to $19.2 million from $86.7 million, American Express said.    The company's IDS Financial Services Inc. unit posted a 22% earnings increase, and its travel services unit recorded a 17% increase. However, earnings of the Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. securities unit fell 16%, and earnings at American Express Bank dropped 15%.    John Keefe, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said results generally were in line with expectations, except for travel services, which he said outperformed his estimates.    The travel services unit earned $132.9 million in the quarter. Charge card volume was almost $17 billion, a 17% increase. Charge cards in force increased 7.3%, to 24.2 million world-wide. Travelers-check sales were up 19%, to more than $4 billion.    The IDS subsidiary earned $26 million in the quarter, up from the year-earlier $21 million, on stronger sales of mutual funds and annuities. Assets owned or managed climbed 25% to $34 billion.    Shearson earned $76 million in the quarter, down from $90 million a year earlier. The unit's revenue increased 13% to $1.26 billion. American Express said the earnings drop mainly reflected a 13% decline in trading revenue. Expenses increased 18%. Investment advisory revenue increased 44% and investment banking revenue was up 37%.    Earnings at the international bank unit fell to $37 million from $44 million. They were diminished by about $8 million after the bank reclassified to non-accrual status $430 million in medium-term and long-term loans to Brazil and $52 million in loans to Ecuador. When a bank classifies loans under non-accrual status, it records interest payments as cash only when they actually are received. An increase in the bank's effective tax rate to 22% from 8.3% diminished earnings a further $6 million. Certain foreign income previously excluded from U.S. taxation was made taxable by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
