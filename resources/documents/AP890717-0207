Prudential Securities Group on Friday called off its plan topurchase all of Thomson McKinnon, which could have created thenation's third-largest brokerage operation.   The deal, announced June 13, was canceled after Prudentialdiscovered problems with Thomson McKinnon's financial records,including a reported $80 million difference between its liabilitiesand assets.   But negotiations over the weekend yielded the retail brokeragedeal, under which Prudential-Bache will take over Thomson McKinnon's154 branch offices and 2,000 brokers. Prudential-Bache is thebrokerage arm of Prudential Securities, which in turn is owned byPrudential Insurance Co. of America.   ``When it became clear a merger was not feasible, rather thanparting ways, we worked together to develop this new arrangement,''Prudential-Bache Chairman George L. Ball and Thomson McKinnonChairman J. Ronald Morgan said in a joint statement.   People familiar with the deal said today that Prudential-Bachewould pay $60 million for the offices and accounts plus $60 millionover three years as part of an incentive package to keep ThomsonMcKinnon brokers from leaving.   Prudential-Bache also said it plans to purchase about a 5 percentinterest in Thomson McKinnon Asset Management LP, the firm's onlypublicly traded entity, which operates its money and investmentmanagement business.   Prudential-Bache said it will distribute mutual funds managed byThomson McKinnon Asset Management.   Thomson McKinnon, founded in 1885, has struggled since the 1987stock market crash and repeatedly entered into sale negotiationswith other major Wall Street firms.   Last October, Thomson McKinnon, the nation's ninth-largestbrokerage, said it was looking for a buyer to purchase the 23percent stake in the privately held company owned by the HartfordInsurance Group, a unit of ITT Corp. Thomson McKinnon, considered amid-size brokerage, has 4,700 employees.   Thomson McKinnon said they planned to sell the firm's remainingassets, such as its capital markets, Hong King and administrativeoperations, in the coming months, marking an end to the firm.   Prudential-Bache, the nation's fourth-largest securities firm,has about 16,000 employees and more than 320 offices worldwide. Thedeal adds to Prudential-Bache's exisiting retail sales force ofabout 6,000.</TEXT></DOC>
