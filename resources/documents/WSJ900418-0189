Consider James D. Robinson III. His compensation fromAmerican Express Co. totaled $2.6 million last year. But heearned up to $139,000 more by serving as a director ofBristol-Myers Squibb Co., Coca-Cola Co. and Union PacificCorp.   Lawrence G. Rawl did pretty well, too. On top of the $1.4million he received from Exxon Corp., his director fees fromChampion International Corp., Chemical Banking Corp., andWarner-Lambert Co. totaled as much as $118,000 last year.   Takeover threats and time pressures have prompted many topexecutives to trim outside board obligations over the lastdecade, from an average of about six to about three, saysAbraham Nad, who runs Directorship DataBank of Westport,Conn. His data, based on proxies issued last year, show that214 chairmen of Fortune 1,000 companies sit on four or moremajor company boards outside their own. Several prominentCEOs, including Walt Disney Co.'s Michael Eisner and ChryslerCorp.'s Lee A. Iacocca, don't serve on any.   Companies typically don't disclose attendance or fees forcommittee meetings, so it's tough to know precisely how muchindividual directors earn. Roger Smith of General MotorsCorp., for one, got $30,000 in retainers for serving on theboard of Citicorp and its consulting committee. But he mighthave earned as much as $30,400 more with perfect attendanceon those panels and two other board committees, which met atotal of 32 times at $950 a pop.   In all, Mr. Smith's board fees -- he's also a director ofJohnson andamp; Johnson, PepsiCo Inc., and International Paper --totaled as much as $158,000, nice pocket change for a man whoearned $2.5 million last year from his day job.                                                                                                          THE LITTLE THINGS                                                                                                          Sure, Michael Eisner makes millions. But in the wonderfulworld of Walt Disney Co., little things count, too. Like the$3,813 the company put out last year to match Mr. Eisner'ssavings and investment plan contribution. And the $1,800 inpremiums it paid toward his supplemental medical insurance.Not to mention -- but the proxy does -- the $197 in premiumsto keep active Mr. Eisner's $1 million excess-liabilityinsurance plan. The proxy notes that Mr. Eisner has a $3million life-insurance policy, but doesn't specify what thepremiums were last year.                                                                                                          GOLDEN AGE                                                                                                          Earning your age. There was a time when that was thestandard of measurement for executives. Making $45,000 at 45years old? You're doing just fine. Then came the inflation ofthe '70s, coupled with the huge run-up in executive salariesin recent years. Suddenly, it seems more appropriate to earnyour great-great-grandfather's age -- at the least. Considerthe calculations if today's CEOs were to be judged by the oldstandard: They'd have to be older than Methuselah to merittheir pay. Based on last year's compensation, Paul Fireman ofReebok International would be 14,600 years old, Coca-ColaCo.'s Roberto C. Goizueta would be 2,500 years old, and JohnF. Akers of International Business Machines Corp., 1,400years old. No wonder they get all those health and retirementbenefits.                                                                                                          CULTURE SHOCK                                                                                                          Looking for hefty bonuses and nice annual raises? Ifyou're an American working for a Japanese company, you may belooking in the wrong place.   &quot;The Japanese don't reward on individual performance,&quot;says Christine R. Houston, a consultant with Tasa Inc. whohas conducted executive searches for the American offices ofmany Japanese concerns. &quot;It's against their ethic.&quot;   That ethic has its costs. Japanese banks in New York, forinstance, often have problems recruiting and keepingfirst-rate American managers, Ms. Houston says. That'slargely because the banks' pay packages average about 20%below what a top U.S. competitor might offer, she says.   One vice president now at a major U.S. bank left TokaiBank's New York office last fall after a year and a half onthe job, in part because his first annual raise trailedinflation and his bonus was just 10%, not the 25% he says thebank told him to expect.   &quot;Our system says you have to do certain things foremployees or they will leave,&quot; he says. &quot;Japanese employeesdon't leave.&quot;   Several major Japanese banks in this country, includingTokai, recently hired Americans to help them grapple withU.S. ways of paying. Fuji Bank Ltd., among other changes, hasintroduced 401K plans for the 170 employees in its New Yorkoffice and has doubled some potential bonus levels. &quot;Weweren't getting the quality of person we needed,&quot; admitsBrian T. Thompson, who joined Fuji last year as senior vicepresident for human resources. Now, he says, &quot;we want to dealwith Americans the way they would expect to be dealt with inan American company.&quot;                                                                                                          NO DEPOSIT                                                                                                          Computers may promise a paperless society, but there's onebit of paper that's unlikely to disappear from the Americanworkplace any time soon: the paycheck.   Just 14% of private-sector employees have their checksdeposited in their bank accounts electronically. Thatcompares with 70% of federal workers and more than 95% of allemployees in Japan and some European countries, according tothe National Automated Clearinghouse Association, a tradegroup that promotes direct deposit.   Many employees clearly don't want direct deposit.According to the clearinghouse association, more than halfthe major U.S. companies offer it, though some restrict theoption to managers and senior executives. Dallas-based AMRCorp., parent of American Airlines, recently rejected directdeposit as an option for its 77,000 employees, after a pollof workers showed insufficient interest.   Other companies prefer not to offer direct deposit becauseof the cost-both of adopting a new payroll system and ofgiving up a day or two of bank float on every paycheck. Andsome firms may not want to lose the opportunity thatdisbursing checks can provide. &quot;It's a weekly reminder ofwho's boss,&quot; says Larry Hirschhorn, a specialist inorganizational behavior at the Wharton Center for AppliedResearch.                                                                                                          ALL YOUR EGGS                                                                                                          More companies are tying compensation to performance byincreasing the role of stock in the pay of top executives.But it's causing a problem for many executives: Can they holdbig chunks of company stock and also maintain balancedpersonal portfolios?   &quot;It's a struggle,&quot; says Carol R. Caruthers, a PriceWaterhouse consultant who advises senior managers on personalfinance. At some companies, &quot;it would not appear you're partof the team or the leadership if you didn't hold largeamounts of company stock.&quot;   Younger executives with growing families feel the painmost, she says. After covering expenses, they often findcompany stock their only remaining asset. One told her hiscash flow was better when he was working a paper route as a14-year-old.   To relieve the pressure, Ms. Caruthers says, somecompanies are becoming more flexible about letting employeessell their stock in order to raise cash to exercise new stockoptions. And they're giving more bonuses and special rewardsin cash, not stock. &quot;That gives people a chance todiversify,&quot; she says.   ---   Mr. Fuchsberg is a staff reporter in The Wall StreetJournal's New York bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
