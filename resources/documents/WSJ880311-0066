Nearly all day, it looked as though the British pound's five trading-day gallop against the dollar had ended. But late in New York Thursday, sterling was bid up to $1.8460, slightly higher than the $1.8445 quoted late Wednesday.    Also in late New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.6640 marks from 1.6710 marks Wednesday, and to 128.00 yen from 128.15.    The decline continued in early Tokyo trading, where the dollar opened at 127.85 yen.    After hitting an intraday high of $1.8477 in early Far Eastern trading, Britain's currency began falling on unfounded rumors that the Bank of England had placed orders to sell sterling. &quot;It had the effect of inducing people to take profits or square positions,&quot; said Kenneth De La Salle, foreign exchange manager for National Westminster Bank in London.    Currency dealers were whipsawed by contradictory statements to Britain's Parliament by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. Mr. Lawson said sterling's recent rise against the mark was &quot;unsustainable.&quot; Yet at the same time, the chancellor conceded that fighting inflation would remain at the &quot;heart&quot; of London's economic policy and that interest rates would be used to damp inflationary expectations.    Minutes later, Prime Minister Thatcher also said that battling inflation was of &quot;paramount importance&quot; and that occasionally &quot;adjustments are needed&quot; in any exchange rate system. Yet, referring to the pound's recent strength, she added that &quot;there is no way to buck the market.&quot;    For more than a year, Britain maintained a policy of holding the pound below 3.00 marks, using aggressive intervention to do so when needed. The motive was to keep British exports competitive against the goods of its main European trading partners. But Monday the pound was allowed to rise above 3.00 marks. And on Tuesday, Mrs. Thatcher said the central bank wouldn't intervene nor cut interest rates to weaken sterling.    Now, &quot;People are confused about the signals coming from political leadership in the U.K.,&quot; said Charles Minnaar, a vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank.    Sterling's rise has been mostly attributed to Britain's relatively high interest rates. For example, the three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for sterling is 8 15/16%, compared with 6 7/8% for U.S. dollars and 3 7/16% for marks. Libor is the rate at which major banks in London lend funds to each other.    At one point in yesterday's trading, the pound rose as high as 3.0850 marks before falling back to 3.0718 marks late in New York. Nevertheless, the British currency &quot;is still well bid,&quot; said Robert Hatcher, a vice president at Barclays Bank PLC in New York.    Dealers attributed the pound's rebound in late New York trading to the dollar's softness against other currencies, as well as thin late afternoon markets, where one dealer said a $10 million or $15 million order could easily move exchange rates. With &quot;no clear direction in the dollar, people will generally continue holding currencies with high yields,&quot; said Mr. Minnaar of Chase Manhattan.    Nonetheless, traders and others remain nervous, wondering at what level the Bank of England might intervene to stop sterling's rise. Many believe it could be around 3.10 marks. &quot;They will intervene at some time,&quot; said Mr. De La Salle of National Westminster Bank. &quot;But only to smooth it out, when sterling rises too rapidly. They will let the pound reach its own equilibrium.&quot;    Traders also expect next Tuesday's announcement of Britain's budget for the fiscal year beginning April 5 to signal the U.K. government's deficit targets, tax program and overall borrowing needs.    In other activity, the mark surged against its weaker counterparts -- particularly the French franc and Italian lira -- in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, of which the pound is not a member. Traders said the advance began when the Banque de France declined to quote prices on the so-called mark-franc cross rate to commercial banks.    Dealers read that as a decision not to defend the French currency, and investors who had sold marks for higher-yielding francs began unwinding their short mark positions. Others noted apprehension over the two-part French presidential elections April 24 and May 8. One dealer mentioned a market rumor of a large speculative order to buy marks and sell francs based on a belief that as-yet-undeclared French President Francois Mitterrand wouldn't run.    The franc fell to just above its preset floor against the mark in the EMS, raising speculation about whether the joint-float of eight continental currencies would have to be realigned before the French elections.    &quot;I don't think anything will happen,&quot; said Roberto Bianchi, a vice president with Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich. &quot;But uncertainty increases as we get closer to the (French) election.&quot;    Meanwhile, traders attributed the dollar's stability against the yen to Japanese interest in keeping the dollar from falling further before the end of Japan's fiscal year at month's end. If the yen rises more than 15% from April 1 to March 31, big institutional investors in Japan could be forced to revalue their dollar portfolios and possibly have large losses.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $443.20 an ounce, up $7. Volume was very heavy at an estimated six million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $442.05 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                 Late New York Trading               Thursday, March 10, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
