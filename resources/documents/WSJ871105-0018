Carl-Johan Aberg, Sweden's undersecretary for foreign trade, indicated a number of countries have been asked to inspect their stockpiles of Robot-70s, portable anti-aircraft missiles, to determine if any are missing. He wouldn't elaborate further on the missile audit.    But the head of a special committee investigating Swedish arms exports was reported to have said that eight countries -- Argentina, Australia, Indonesia, Ireland, Norway, Pakistan, Singapore and Tunisia -- were asked to account for any Robot-70s purchased over the last decade.    The committee chairman, Olof Rydbeck, told the newspaper Dagens Nyheter that the inspections were requested as part of his inquiry into allegations that Bofors, a unit of Nobel Industrier Sverige AB, smuggled the weapons, as well as large quantities of munitions, to Iran. Swedish policy prohibits arms exports to countries at war or likely to become engaged in conflict.    The findings of earlier investigations into Bofors arms shipments suggest the accounting effort may not encompass enough countries. Nobel has admitted that many of the Robot-70 missiles sold to Singapore were illicitly shipped to Bahrain, Dubai and Oman-all off-limits for Swedish arms sales. </TEXT></DOC>
