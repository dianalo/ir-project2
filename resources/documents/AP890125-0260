The agreement, announced on Tuesday, sets a standard for thedigital cellular phones that are expected to begin appearing in1991. A digital system can handle many more calls in the limitedfrequency band that is available because calls can be ``compressed''by computers.   At a meeting in San Antonio, the Cellular TelecommunicationsIndustry Association said its board of directors had on Mondayunanimously endorsed a decision reached last week by thestandard-setting Telecommunications Industry Association.   Cellular phones, typically used in cars, are actually radioreceivers and transmitters. Calls are sent to central offices, wherethey plug into the regular phone network. Los Angeles and New Yorkare already running up against capacity with the current system.   In addition to providing more capacity, a digital system will bemore secure because calls will be harder to intercept. Initially itwill be more expensive, but costs will come down because of thegreater efficiency of digital technology.   The standards setters agreed that digital calls would be funneledonto channels using a technique known as time-division multiplexing.   The alternative standard, which had been supported by MotorolaInc. and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., is known as frequencydivision multiplexing. The standards setters decided thattime-division multiplexing had more potential for future growth.   Although the decision went against them, Motorola and ATandamp;T saidthey were pleased with the agreement because it would allow theindustry to move forward.   ``We feel that this is a very positive step,'' said Jerry Wilson,a Motorola spokesman.   Several other decisions on standards remain to be made, but thiswas a major one.   ``This decision needed to be made before any other decisionscould be made in the digital standards process,'' Lynne Rose, aspokeswoman for the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association.   The voting members of her association are operators of cellularphone systems. The standard-setting Telecommunications IndustryAssociation, in contrast, comprises both system operators andequipment manufacturers.</TEXT></DOC>
