MILLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Panama began four days of Carnival thisweekend with the country's future as unpredictable as the route ofshambling revelers wending from one sidewalk beer stall to another.   The festival was expected to be subdued this year, clouded bymonths of political unrest and the recent indictments in the UnitedStates of the country's de facto leader, Gen. Manuel AntonioNoriega. He was charged in Miami and Tampa, Fla., with drugtrafficking and money laundering.   The indictments deepened the polarization of a nation alreadysharply split along economic lines. They caused Noriega to try toreinforce his power by criticizing the United States and left hisopponents confused.   ``If there ever was a chance that Noriega would relinquish powergracefully, the indictments in Florida appear to have quashed it,''said one European diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Leaders of Panama's growing opposition movement acknowledge thattheir goal of removing the general was made more difficult by theindictments and subsequent congressional testimony last week byseveral former Noriega associates.   The grand juries in Miami and Tampa and the testimony ofNoriega's former friends lent weight to what the opposition hasbeen charging all along _ that the general is up to his jowls incorruption.   ``But what can we do now?'' asked Aurelio Barria, president ofthe Panamanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a leadingopposition figure who returned home two weeks ago after severalmonths of self-imposed exile.   The opposition has ruled out further demonstrations like theones that shook the country last summer when Noriega sent the armyinto the streets with guns, clubs and tear gas.   At least three people were killed and hundreds injured in thedisturbances organized by the National Civic Crusade, a coalitionof civic, professional, labor and other groups.   Subsequent calls for popular demonstrations met with dwindlingenthusiasm.   ``We just can't ask people to go out in the streets and facethat kind of repression,'' said Ricardo Arias Calderon, thepresident of the Christian Democratic Party and another leadingopposition figure.   Barria, Arias Calderon and other opposition leaders spokehopefully of arranging the general's ouster through talks with hissupporters in the Democratic Revolutionary Party, which is closelylinked to Panama's military.   But they acknowledged that they may not be able to arrange suchtalks and they appeared to have no other firm course of action tooust the general from his post as head of Panama's Defense Forces.   Barria spoke of the possibilities of a coup by junior officers,a presidential order removing Noriega, a nationwide general strike,greater involvement in the ouster effort by the Roman CatholicChurch and united diplomatic and financial pressure by other LatinAmerican nations.   Opposition leaders began talking about a general strike a weekago, but Barrios said they were still discussing the action ``withvarious (economic) factions'' and no date has been set for theshutdown attempt. Previous strikes have been only partly effective.   And few officers in the military seem to command enough respectto launch a successful coup.   Barria said he and other opposition leaders have personallytaken their case to the presidents of Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil,Guatemala and Uruguay, but none of those leaders has yet spoken outagainst Noriega.   Nor has the Roman Catholic Church, widely respected in thispredominantly Catholic country, given the opposition movement thesupport that Barria and others would like to see.   President Eric Arturo Delvalle, widely seen as a puppet dancingon Noriega's strings, has the constitutional authority to dismissthe general. But few believe he will do it.   Still, Delvalle was the object of much speculation. Grafittiappeared on walls in Panama City saying ``Watch Out For Delvalle.''   He was absent Thursday night when an estimated 8,000 peoplecrowded into a Panama City convention center to pay homage to Gen.Noriega on his birthday _ either his 50th or 54th, depending ondiffering records.   Noriega's triumphant appearance at the gathering capped a weekof speeches around the country in which he blamed his troubles on aplot by the Reagan administration to renege on a 1977 treaty thatwill turn over control of the Panama Canal to Panama at the turn ofthe century.   That accusation is vigorously denied in Washington, but Noriegahas been using it for months to whip up anti-U.S. sentiment.   Noriega also demanded the removal of the U.S. Southern Commandfrom Panama, which the Pentagon and the White House initiallyinterpreted as a call for the transfer of some 10,000 servicemenand their 20,000 dependents from Panamanian soil.   Washington immediately rejected that, saying the the Americantroops were legally in the country and would remain here to protectthe canal until it is handed over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.   Noriega later said he was referring only to the headquartersunit responsible for U.S. strategic military planning. Americanmilitary sources said that would involve the removal of only about300 officers and men.   During his birthday speech, Noriega's biggest ovation came whenhe declared: ``If they want me out, they'll have to kill me.''</TEXT></DOC>
