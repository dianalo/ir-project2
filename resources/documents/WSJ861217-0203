The transaction is part of a planned liquidation of SFN, a closely held broadcaster and publisher, which was taken private last year in a leveraged buyout by a group of investors including E.M. Warburg, Pincus andamp; Co., and Hallmark Cards Inc.    South-Western publishes business and mathematics textbooks. Toronto-based International Thomson has interests in publishing, information, travel and oil and gas.
