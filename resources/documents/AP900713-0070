The accusation comes amid reports that Mengistu's hard-lineMarxist government is teetering as secessionist rebels gain groundin their battle to topple him.   An Israeli government spokesman said the claim was untrue.   Rahamim Elazar, chairman of the Public Council for EthiopianAffairs in Israel, said Mengistu was demanding arms from Israel inexchange for allowing more Jews to leave his country for Israel.   ``Mengistu is trying to use them for military aid,'' he said.   Israel has sought to bring out all of Ethiopia's Jews sinceimmigration was cut off in 1984 when a secret airlift campaignknown as Operation Moses was halted after the Ethiopian governmentlearned of it.   About 8,000 Ethiopian Jews were brought to Israel in theU.S.-supported, three-month operation. About 15,000 Jews arebelieved to remain in the North African country.   Elazar told The Associated Press that 10,000 Ethiopian Jews wereencamped in Addis Ababa after leaving villages in the province ofGondar in hope of eventually emigrating to Israel.   The Jews went to the Ethiopian capital after Israel andMengistu's government resumed diplomatic relations in October,Elazar said. He said his information came from Jews who managed toleave Ethiopia.   On Wednesday, the chairman of the U.S. House Subcommittee onAfrican Affairs charged that Mengistu was trying to pressure Israelinto supplying Ethiopia with 1,000 cluster bombs.   Rep. Howard Wolpe, a Michigan Democrat, was quoted by thenewspaper Washington Jewish Week as warning Mengistu not to useEthiopian Jews to pressure Israel.   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister YitzhakShamir, denied that Mengistu asked Israel to supply him withweapons. He also denied that Ethiopia was placing obstacles in theway of Jews wanting to leave.   ``The situation there is so complicated, there is a war there,confusion, famine,'' said Pazner. ``This is the reason they arebeing held up.''   An Italian newspaper reported Saturday that Mengistu made asecret visit to Israel on July 3 to meet Israeli leaders. Israeliofficials denied the report.   In January, The New York Times quoted unidentified U.S.officials as saying they strongly suspected Israel had suppliedEthiopia with cluster bombs for it war against the rebels. Otherreports said Israel also supplied Mengistu with military advisers,ammunition and spare parts.   Israel has denied it supplied cluster bombs to Ethiopia. It hasrefused to confirm or deny reports of other supposed arms salesunder its standing policy of not discussing any weapons deals.   A recent article in the independent Hebrew daily Haaretz writtenby Zeev Schiff, a respected military analyst, said U.S. officialswere trying to damage Israel's image by fabricating the reports ofcluster bomb sales.   The United States has criticized Israeli support for Ethiopia.The U.S. government objects to sale of cluster bombs withoutWashington's permission since the weapons were developed with U.S.technology.</TEXT></DOC>
