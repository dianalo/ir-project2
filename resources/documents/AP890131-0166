Human RightsCommission meeting Tuesday that Israeli soldiers have fired tear gasinto hospitals and homes during the Palestinian uprising, causing upto 60 deaths.   Israel denied the charges.   An envoy of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in an apparentreference to the accusation, told the 43-nation meeting Palestinianchildren had died in ``Israeli gas chambers.''   Amnesty spokeswoman Ingrid Kircher read a statement saying theIsraeli forces fired tear gas into hospitals and homes, a``deliberate misuse'' because manufacturers' instructions say thegas can kill in confined places.   She said about 60 people were reported to have died in teargas-related incidents, ``some of them as a direct result of itsmisuse.''   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said inJerusalem: ``It's all a great lie. Israel has certainly not shotinto hospitals.''   An army spokesman said Israeli troops in the occupied West Bankand Gaza Strip act ``in accordance with the international law andjudicial procedures.''   The spokesman said on condition of anonymity that the army willprovide a detailed response to the allegations after a ``carefulstudy of the report.''   The PLO observer, Nabil Ramlawi, made the reference to ``Israeligas chambers'' in his remarks to the U.N. meeting in Geneva.   Many of the 6 million Jews who died in the Nazi holocaust werekilled in Nazi gas chambers.   Ramlawi also accused the Israelis of beating pregnant women tocause them to miscarry, burying people alive to save ammunitioninstead of shooting them, and stealing organs from woundedPalestinian patients to be used in transplant operations on Israelis.   The statement of London-based Amnesty expressed grave concernover what it called ``extensive human rights violations'' by Israeldespite growing domestic and international protests. It said Israeliauthorities ``appear so far to have condoned _ if not encouraged _the excessive use of force.''   More than 365 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have died in the13-month revolt. The Palestinians are protesting occupation byIsrael, which seized the lands from neighboring Arab states in the1967 Middle East war.   Amnesty said about 300 civilians have been shot to death byIsraeli soldiers.   The group's statement also said thousands of Palestinians _including children, elderly people, and wounded patients _ have been``forcibly removed from hospitals'' and beaten by Israeli army andsecurity forces. It said at least eight of the victims died.   Amnesty urged the Israeli government to crack down on excessiveuse of force and prosecute those guilty of abuses.</TEXT></DOC>
