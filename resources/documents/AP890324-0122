But because the new bipartisan approach leans heavily on howNicaragua's Sandinista government behaves over the coming months, itrepresents a respite, rather than a final settlement of thelong-running policy dispute between Congress and the White House.   For now, both sides on Capitol Hill are willing to read thesomewhat vague and artfully drawn two-page policy agreement in theirown ways.   Democrats stress language supporting regional peace efforts andprovisions permitting aid to the Contra rebels to be used torelocate them into Nicaragua and re-integrate them into thepolitical process there. Republicans emphasize that suchresettlement is strictly voluntary, and that the agreement does notbar future military aid to the rebels should Sandinista promises beunfulfilled.   The agreement means the United States ``still supports theContras as a viable force,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,R-Kan., whose most conservative colleagues were restless about thepolicy accord signed by Bush and congressional leaders.   Dole said he hoped the peace process would work and that theNicaraguan government would open its political system to opponents.``But if not, if the Sandinistas continue to do what they have beendoing _ saying one thing and doing another _ you're going to see atleast an effort for military aid in the Congress.''   But Democrats pointed out that Bush's new secretary of state,James A. Baker III, had specifically de-emphasized that kind ofthinking during hours of talks with key lawmakers over the pastmonth. At the very outset of those conversations, they noted, Bakersaid military aid _ the issue that bedeviled President Reagan'srelations with Congress _ would play no role in the discussions.   Announcing the new policy at the White House on Friday, Bakersaid, ``We all have to admit that the policy basically failed tosome extent, because we were not united.''   That conclusion is underscored by an unreleased draft report fromthe General Accounting Office, which concludes that Reagan'ssingle-minded reliance on military solutions, both in Nicaragua andother countries in the region, ``slowed progress toward economicreforms and development,'' which it says are the region's realproblems.   ``U.S. policies toward the region since 1980 appear to have beendriven largely by a need to counter the threat of Soviet Blocexpansionism,'' says the report, being prepared for Senate ForeignRelations Committee Democrats.   The new accord between Congress and the White House puts thatgoal on a diplomatic track. It notes that continued communistsupport for ``violence and subversion'' in the region violate thefive nations' peace agreements. But it calls on the Soviets andCubans to themselves come into compliance with the peace process byending their military backing for the Sandinistas and the rebelsfighting El Salvador's government.   Congress' next step will be to pass, soon after it returns fromits Easter break next month, legislation providing the $45 millionor so needed to continue ``humanitarian'' aid to the Contras throughFebruary 1990, after Nicaragua's scheduled national elections.   Because of Baker's efforts to reach bipartisan accord on theunderlying policy, that step is expected to be far easier than pastaid renewals.   More significant in the long run than the agreement to give thenew administration an extension of Contra aid is Congress'willingness to restore to Bush the latitude to conduct policy inCentral America that it had revoked from Reagan.   ``The Congress recognizes the need for consistency and continuityin policy and the responsibility of the executive to administer andcarry out that policy, the programs based upon it, and to conductAmerican diplomacy in the region,'' the document stated.   Reagan's covert war against the Sandinistas, which led to theIran-Contra affair, also prompted a plethora of restrictions onmoney spent in the region.   For Bush, lawmakers are willing simply to say that they supportthe use of rewards and punishments to encourage the Sandinistasalong the road to democratization, and for now will let theadministration decide which actions to take and when to take them.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE: Jim Drinkard covers foreign policy on Capitol</NOTE><TEXT>   Hill for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
