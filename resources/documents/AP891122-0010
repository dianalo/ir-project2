WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   James Brady, felled by a shot from the samegun that wounded President Reagan eight years ago, says lawmakerswho don't want handgun controls should ``try being in my wheels forjust one day.''   In a wheelchair, the former White House press secretary appearedbefore a Senate panel Tuesday to push for a bill that would requirea seven-day waiting period before buying a handgun.   ``I had no choice but to be here today because too many membersof Congress have been gutless on this issue,'' Brady said. ``Theyhave closed their eyes to tragedies like mine. They ignore thestatistics.''   It was the first time since Brady was shot in the brain duringthe attack on Reagan on March 30, 1981, that the formerpresidential spokesman had personally lobbied Congress on guncontrol.   His wife Sarah, who appeared at his side, has become a leadingnational speaker on the issue as head of the group Handgun ControlInc. The bill carries their name as the Brady Bill.   With a strong voice, Brady said the bill would reduce handgunviolence. He described the impairment he has endured and how itdestroyed his realized dream of serving as Reagan's press secretary.   ``I experience pain _ pain sometimes so intense I cry,'' hesaid. But even that, he said, is less difficult to endure than hisloss of independence.   ``Those members of Congress who oppose a simple seven-daywaiting period should try being in my wheels for just one day,''Brady said.   ``You should know what I go through every day. I need helpgetting out of bed, help taking a shower and help getting dressed.And damn it, I even need help to go to the bathroom.''   In addition to providing a cooling-off period for buyers ofhandguns, the bill would require that gun dealers obtainidentifying information and send it to police, who would check tosee if the purchaser was a convicted felon barred by law frompurchasing a weapon.   The bill is opposed by the National Rifle Association and by theBush administration.   ``I understand,'' Brady said, ``that many of you are intimidatedby the gun lobby. But you've got to look squarely at the facts.   ``There are too many cowardly lions walking the halls ofCongress,'' he said.   The Bush administration says it favors a more limited method forchecking criminal records.   But Mrs. Brady said the waiting period has proven effective inkeeping guns away from convicted felons in several states that havetheir own versions of the law. Illinois, she said, reportedblocking 2,470 applications for gun sales to felons in 1988 underits 72-hour waiting requirement.   The bill was strongly opposed by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, whocharged it would cause ``harassment'' of ``law-abiding sportsmen.''   Hatch left the hearing before Brady spoke.   Brady said: ``I don't question the rights of responsible gunowners. That's not the issue. The issue is whether the JohnHinckleys of the world should be able to walk into a gun store andpurchase a handgun instantly.''   Hinckley was acquitted by reason of insanity in 1982 for theshooting of Reagan, Brady, a Washington police officer and a SecretService agent.</TEXT></DOC>
