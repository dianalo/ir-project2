Several American Jewish leaders said they trusted PresidentReagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz in their decision toopen a ``substantive dialogue'' with the PLO, but called on PLOChairman Yasser Arafat to back his words of peace with action.   ``We understand that the United States, having set standards forspeaking with the PLO and the PLO having met those minimumstandards, that it is appropriate for us to live up to itscommitment,'' said Abraham H. Foxman, national director of theAnti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in New York.   ``It is a first step. Now we must watch to see if the PLO willmatch words with deeds.''   James Zogby, executive director of the Arab-American Institute inWashington, called the government's decision to end its longtimerejection of the PLO as a party to Middle East peace efforts an``important step forward.''   ``The dialogue should throw into sharp relief the failure ofIsrael to say yes to the very issues that the PLO has now accededto,'' Zogby said. ``Our hope is that the dialogue is productive andthat peace is now possible.''   In Washington, legislators from both parties cautiously endorsedthe move.   ``It may be a blind alley, but an alley worth treading with eyesopen,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind. ``This dialogue in no waymitigates our steadfast support of Israel. But I hope Israel will atleast be willing to informally acknowledge this process as a worthyattempt.''   ``In the interest of peace and security for Israel and allparties in the region, the U.S. has no sensible choice but to begina dialogue,'' said U.S. Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of theHouse foreign operations appropriations subcommittee.   But, he added, ``the proof will still lie in deeds and notwords.''   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, who nearly a decade ago was forced bythen-President Carter to resign as the U.S. ambassador to the UnitedNations for meeting with a PLO representative, applauded thedecision, saying, ``People were not ready for this before now.''   Reagan said Wednesday he authorized the State Department to enterinto ``a substantive dialogue'' with the Palestinian group afterArafat said he was renouncing ``all forms of terrorism.''   Shultz, who only two weeks ago barred Arafat from entering theUnited States and called him an ``accessory'' to terrorism, said thePLO issued a statement in which it met all three U.S. conditions fora dialogue. The conditions were acceptance of U.N. Security Councilresolutions affirming the right of all states to live in peace,recognition of Israel and renunciation of terrorism.   While the Israeli government swiftly criticized the move, manyU.S. Jewish groups were reluctant to do so, reflecting thedissension that has marred relations between Israel and manyAmerican Jews over Israel's hardline policies on the West Bank andGaza Strip.   Morris B. Abram, chairman of the Conference of Presidents ofMajor American Jewish Organizations in New York, said in astatement: ``We neither approve nor disapprove. We accept it. Wetrust the United States.''   ``The first action the U.S. should take in its conversations withthe PLO should be to demand that the PLO repeal the PalestineNational Covenant, which calls for the destruction of the state ofIsrael,'' he said.   ``Unless and until the PLO translates its words into the deed ofrepealing that covenant, there can be no progress toward peace inthe Middle East.''   However, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, dedicated tothe study of the Holocaust and promoting Israel in world affairs,said it was disappointed with the decision.   ``While both President Reagan and Secretary of State GeorgeShultz have proven themselves to be the staunchest friends of thestate of Israel, the road they have chosen to embark is fraught withdanger,'' said the statement read by a spokesman, Rabbi AbrahamCooper.   The response from Arab-American organizations, while generallyfavorable, was in some cases tinged with bitterness. M.T. Mehdi,president of the American Arab Relations Committee in New York, saidhis organization was ``not impressed.''   ``The State Department should talk to Israel and urge it not toshoot at the Palestinian youth nor to use American airplanes toattack Palestinian camps in Lebanon,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
