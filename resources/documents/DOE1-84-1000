Gamma-beam densitometry was used to measurethe material's effective porosity distribution prior to the drying experiment.It was then used to measure liquid saturation distributions during a1400 hour drying period. The core selected for study was taken from theBusted Butte outcrop at the Nevada Test Site, part of the Topopah SpringMember of Paintbursh tuff. This specimen contained several microfracturestransversely oriented to the direction of the water or vapor migration.These fractures were found to be regions of rapid dryout or low saturationeven though they were displaced from the surface over which dry nitrogenwas flowing. An imbibition experiment was performed earlier on the samecore. In the imbibition experiment the presence of most of these microfractureswas detected by discontinuities in the measured saturation curves, whichindicated a delay in liquid transport past the microfractures.</TEXT></DOC>
