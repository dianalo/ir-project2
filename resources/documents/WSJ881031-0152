Court documents here show 41 banks have had their records subpoenaed in the far-flung investigation, which came to light earlier this month when a grand jury here indicted 85 people. Nine of those indicted were executives of Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit andamp; Commerce International S.A., or its parent, BCCI Holdings S.A. The indictments allege BCCI conspired with international cocaine traffickers to launder millions of dollars of drug profits.    Law enforcement officials said they don't yet know whether any of the banks knowingly acted as conduits for drug money. Nonetheless, the new documents illustrate the vast scope of the money-laundering operation.    The banks involved were used by members of several trafficking organizations, most of which had links to the Medellin Cartel, Colombia's largest narcotics groups. The traffickers ran their proceeds through several banks in New York and California, but were busiest in southern Florida. Of the 41 banks subpoenaed, at least half were Florida banks or Florida branches of foreign banks. Most are in Miami.    They include some of the largest banks in the Southeast, such as Barnett Banks Inc., Jacksonville, Fla., and Miami-based Southeast Banking Corp. But most are smaller, little-known institutions, such as Florida National Bank of Miami.    According to court records, at least $279,141 was held in the Florida National account of Universal Export Parts Inc., a front company believed to be controlled by associates of Roberto Alcairo and Gonzalo Mora. Mr. Alcairo, now in custody in New York on cocaine smuggling charges, is named in the Tampa indictments as a major smuggler and money launderer. Mr. Mora is described as heading the Medellin Cartel's laundering operations in Florida, New York and California.    The money was deposited in increments ranging from $8,750 to $150,000 over the course of a few weeks this summer. The court records allege the money was part of proceeds from cocaine deals in New York, Miami and Chicago that yielded nearly $3 million.    In the court documents, prosecutors seek to force the bank to turn over any funds left in the account. Florida National officials couldn't be reached for comment.    Other banks listed in the documents include some of the industry's biggest names. New York-based Manufacturers Hanover allegedly has a trafficker's account holding $71,250, part of two New York drug deals that netted $2.2 million. An account at Republic National Bank, New York, allegedly holds $450,000. Security Pacific Corp. and Wells Fargo andamp; Co. also have had records subpoenaed. As previously reported, BankAmerica Corp. is also among those subpoenaed.    Besides BCCI, at least seven foreign banks are listed. They include Israel Discount Bank Ltd. and Deutsch Sudamerikanische Bank as well as Spanish, Italian and Colombian banks.    Over the weekend, none of the banks listed could be reached for comment. Even if they weren't knowingly laundering funds, they may still face troubles. In the wake of the indictment, federal officials have said that international banks must do more to police their own customers. &quot;It is clear to us that in many cases, bankers know, or ought to know, where this money is coming from,&quot; said one federal law-enforcement official. &quot;'See-no-evil' banking will not cut it anymore.&quot; Bankers expect the issue to wind up in court.    Here are the rest of the banks allegedly used by the money-laundering ring:   Atico Savings Bank; Banco Central S.A. (Spain); Banca de Bogata; Banco Ganadero de Colombia; Bank Real Miami S.A.; Capital Bank; Consolidated Bank N.A.; Dadeland Bank; Eagle National Bank; Eastern National Bank; First Federal Savings of Palm Beach; First Nationwide Bank; Florida International Bank; Marine Midland International Bank; Miami National Bank; NCNB National Bank of Florida; Northern Trust Bank of Florida; Peoples First National Bank; Professional Savings Bank; United National Bank; Westchester Bank; Banco Atlantico; Banco Leumi Trust Co. of New York; Philadelphia International Bank; Lorain County Bank; California First Bank; Philadelphia National Bank; Sun Bank N.A. </TEXT></DOC>
