One year after a ballyhooed $300 million real estateauction flopped, the savings and loan bailout agency istrying again. Today, the Resolution Trust Corp.'s biggestauction to date -- 14 offices, hotels and apartment buildingsvalued at roughly $200 million -- will be held at a PalmSprings, Calif., hotel that's on the block itself.</LP><TEXT>   The agency is also using an open-cry auction next month tosell off $300 million in non-paying loans. Down the street atthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., bank regulators areplanning an auction next month of 175 commercial propertiesvalued at $500 million.   Today's attempt will go a long way to determine whetherthe government can increase its auction sales, and sell moreunusual financial assets from the podium. It would like to.&quot;More and more, we realize you can't sell commercialproperties one at a time,&quot; says Penny Larson, who headsauctions for the RTC.   Auctions have attractions that are lacking in sealed-bidsales and asset-by-asset sales. Auctions are a way to sell inbulk, but they can also reach individual investors who areoften put off by the agency's slow responses and bulk sales.Using terms that are understood at the outset, auctions salesclose faster. Bidders know what others are willing to pay.   &quot;When the gavel drops, everyone knows that it sold and forwhat price,&quot; said James Peterson, senior vice president ofKenned-Wilson Inc., a Santa Monica, Calif., auction companymanaging today's sale.   The auction industry is just learning how to dispose ofbigger, more complex assets. So far, of the $179 billion inRTC assets sold, open-cry auctions account for just $183million. Most of the auctions so far have been forsingle-family homes, which are less complicated and requireless up-front analysis for buyers. Over the weekend, forexample, 844 houses were sold at a Texas auction under alow-income housing program.   This time, in contrast to last year's unsuccessful effort,the RTC is relying more on experts -- professionalauctioneers and marketers. It's providing financing, giving a15% discount for cash buyers, and is paying a fat 1.25% feefor brokers who deliver buyers.   For today's auction, Kenneth Leventhal andamp; Co., theaccounting firm, completed analyses for all the properties,including cash flows, engineering reports, comparable salesand leases. Such detailed information, available monthsbefore the sale, was sorely lacking in last year's attempt.   The agency also placed minimum bid prices as low aspossible. It appraised each property, and discounted thevalue to account for the holding costs the auction willavoid. Then it set the minimum bid price at 70% of that. Thatmeans the agency will accept minimum bids as little asone-third of the original value on the books of the Sandamp;Ls.   For example, bidding will start for the Doubletree Resort,a hotel and golf course in Palm Springs, Calif., at $9.09million -- well below the $34.9 million value that GibraltarSavings claimed it was worth before being seized by thegovernment.   &quot;We have to be sure that buyers know how sincere we are interms of selling,&quot; says Ms. Larson. &quot;By pushing the priceslower, we are encouraging buyers to investigate theopportunity.&quot;   As one measure of interest, the agency has sold 700information packages for the properties at $100 each. Fiftypackages were requested for the Cottingham Retirement Center,in a Cincinnati suburb.   The agency is also relying more on the broker community.Any broker who represents a buyer will earn a hefty 1.25%commission, a far cry from the 0.25% that is often standardon big commercial deals, Ms. Larson says. &quot;We wanted to givethem a significant incentive,&quot; she says. &quot;That's the best wayto advertise.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
