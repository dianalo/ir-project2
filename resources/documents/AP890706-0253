JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government today ordered a ban on almostall uses of asbestos, ending a decade-long debate over the healthrisk posed by the cancer-causing substance in such items as brakelinings and water pipes.   The regulatory action, which will end the manufacture of mostasbestos products in three phases over the next seven years, willnot affect asbestos products already in use. Officials saidreplacing some of those products might be more hazardous than agradual phaseout.   ``This is pollution prevention. We're eliminating a knowncancer-causing substance from the marketplace,'' declared EPAAdministrator William Reilly. He said despite government attempts tocurb asbestos emissions, the fibers continue to pose ``a significantrisk to current and future populations.''   Reilly said the cost of getting asbestos out of most productswould be minimal because safer alternative products are available.The EPA estimated the regulation would cost society $459 millionover 13 years.   The regulatory action does not affect ongoing efforts to ridbuildings, including hundreds of schools, of asbestos insulation.Reilly said such efforts should continue under careful control tominimize exposure.   Under the new ban, the EPA will allow asbestos to be a componentin only a small number of items such as guided missile liners,acetylene cylinders, and some types of sealant tape and packaging.   But the ban by 1997 will cover an estimated 94 percent by volumeof all asbestos used in a variety of products currentlymanufactured, the agency said.   Among those products are automobile brake pads and linings,cement water distribution pipes, roofing shingles, floor and pipewrapping, asbestos millboard, gaskets and other constructionproducts.   Because asbestos has been singled out as a cause of lung cancer,its use has been restricted in recent years. Loosely formed asbestosinsulation for buildings and pipes no longer is used and asbestosemissions into the air are regulated.   School officials across the country have been directed to inspectfor asbestos and develop plans to eliminate it from school buildings.   But asbestos continues to be used in various forms for a widevariety of products. As recently as 1987 it was estimated that85,000 tons of asbestos went into hundreds of products annually.Three years earlier the estimates were 240,000 tons a year.   Asbestos is part of the nation's water system with an estimated400,000 miles of concrete-asbestos piping carrying drinking water tothousands of communities. Most automobile and truck brake liningsand pads are made of asbestos because the product is strong andrelatively inexpensive.   Its use has continued, although scientists have known for yearsthat asbestos fibers when inhaled can cause lung cancer and otherlung disorders that may not show up for decades.   But while there is widespread agreement about the health risksfrom loosely packed asbestos found in building insulation or fromhigh-levels of certain occupational exposure, the risks posed fromits other uses has been debated for nearly a decade.   The government first considered a ban on asbestos use in 1979.   But EPA attempts to propose a regulation covering a wide varietyof asbestos products were stymied in the Reagan administrationbecause of strong opposition from the Office of Management andBudget. Finally in 1986 the EPA proposed a ban covering a variety ofasbestos products.   The final EPA rule does not affect products already in use suchas asbestos brake pads in many cars and trucks now on the road orthe thousands of miles of cement-asbestos water distribution pipesfound in many parts of the country.   However, the ban covers:   _A variety of felt products for roofing, flooring and pipe wrap,as well as construction sheet products beginning next year.   _Automobile and small truck brake linings, disc brake pads,clutches and automatic transmission components in all new carsbeginning in 1994.   _Cement water distribution pipes, in used auto and truckreplacement parts and repairs, roof shingles and paper productsbeginning in 1997.   The expected regulatory action was praised by environmentalistseven in advance of its release.   ``This is the first time since 1980 that the EPA has done a majorindustry-wide ban on a particular toxic substance,'' said JacquelineWarren, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.   She said the action represents a change in focus from trying tocontrol emissions of certain toxic substances to halting their use.``This is a new approach _ pollution prevention,'' she said in aninterview.   In 1980, the EPA directed a ban on PCBs at the insistence ofCongress.</TEXT></DOC>
