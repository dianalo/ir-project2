(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three unmanned locomotives today spedthrough three towns at speeds up to 40 mph before stopping on theirown, officials said.   The runaway engines traveled about 10 miles between the towns ofOrange and Gardner in north central Massachusetts.   There were no injuries reported as a result of the runawayengines, said Colin Pease, spokesman for Guilford TransportationIndustries, which operates the trains.   Pease said a crew working on engines near the Gardner rail yarddiscovered the string of locomotives was gone at about 5 a.m. andthey notified a dispatcher, who alerted local authorities.   He said he believes the trains were released by vandals, and hesaid it was at least the second runaway since another string oflocomotives sped out of control through nine towns last Novemberuntil they were deliberately slammed into empty freight cars inDeerfield.   There were no injuries in that incident, and the FBI said it hasfound no evidence of sabotage.   Pease, however, said the two runaways and a third last Januaryform a pattern that cannot be coincidental.   ``The circumstances are just too close,'' Pease said.``Hopefully somebody will begin realizing this is a serious problemand that we need help.''   The latest incident came four days after striking rail workersbegan returning to work, ending a six-month walkout over safetyissues.   Union leader Mike Maloof said today that the workers could nothave been involved in the alleged vandalism because they were busytaking physical exams.</TEXT></DOC>
