They'dlike more freedom to set prices, in some cases to lower them.&quot;Competition&quot; has been the company's mantra since Mr. Rust'sgrandfather and father were running things, when mostinsurers took comfort in having benign bureaucrats orcaptured commissioners do rate reviews.   Today, activist state insurance czars scout politicalopportunities, at the expense of many policy issuers. At thesame time, and especially in the wake of the recent ExecutiveLife seizures, new pressure has built for federal oversightof the industry. All the while, talk is heard of Congressrepealing the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which exempts insurersfrom antitrust rules in return for state regulation. Mr. Rustdoesn't care who's the watchdog, as long as buyer and sellermay agree on terms.</LP><TEXT>   State Farm's carved out about a fifth of the nation's autoand homeowner business and is among the top dozen lifecompanies. A key has been selling directly through its ownforce, rather than independent agents. Lately, discountoperations such as Geico and Twentieth Century have goneState Farm one better in mass marketing, while the number offull-service independent agencies steadily dwindles.   For the moment, basic consumer issues must share thespotlight with concerns about solvency. In one respect, thoseworries work to the benefit of State Farm, with its $18billion in equity. They serve to take some of the bite out ofcomplaints that profits are being amassed off premiums. &quot;Ifind it quite ironic,&quot; Mr. Rust says, &quot;that some of ourcritics today are chastising us for being too strongfinancially.&quot;   It might be self-serving, if no less legitimate, to arguefor pricing freedom on the eve of what some analysts believewill be an upward cycle in premiums in order to repairunderwriting margins. But Mr. Rust finds a public interest:&quot;When you have a solvency problem, typically in the past it'sbeen where the state has been oppressively involved in thepricing decisions of companies, holding back on needed rateincreases.&quot;   He admits, however, that he &quot;would be hard pressed to givean example&quot; of a company that folded because it couldn't geta rate approved. Giant USFandamp;G has lately pulled out ofunprofitable states. But pricing freedom &quot;is not going tochange bad investment decisions or bad management decisions,&quot;Mr. Rust says, arguing for capital and asset-qualitystandards as a safeguard there.   As a life insurer that felt the hot breath of Fred Carr'sFirst Executive unit and its promised payoffs from high-yieldpaper, State Farm might be expected to join the juggernautagainst junk. Mr. Rust obliges. &quot;Where some life companieshave gotten themselves into difficulty is that they haveworked with products that turn more on investment risk thanthe guarantees that traditional life insurance products usedto provide,&quot; he says. Variations are okay by him, withdisclosure, but he frets that all life insurers will be &quot;hitwith the same paint brush&quot; as troubles make news.   In auto policies, State Farm's original line, Mr. Rust'scampaign for competition faces a rout. California, now in itsthird year of trying to administer more popular premiums, isthe bloodiest battlefield. New Jersey, meanwhile, &quot;isgradually grinding itself into a hole,&quot; Mr. Rust says.   Price controls on insurance, as on other items, have theeffect if not the intent of cross-subsidy: Costs are loweredfor some consumers basically by increasing them for others.And it's not even &quot;zero sum&quot; because less product is madeavailable than would otherwise be the case.   On the cost side, Mr. Rust sees litigation as thegenerator. It's a familiar plaint, but still draws a lot ofblank looks. People may know what results from suing overevery scratch, but the average American nevertheless won'tbuy an alternative called &quot;no fault.&quot;   &quot;No fault is a lousy term. We would like to find a betterway to characterize it,&quot; he says. &quot;There is still a strongbelief -- appropriately so, I think -- in this country thatsomeone who has done wrong should pay. They should be heldresponsible for it. No fault carries the connotation that,okay, if you go out and cause all this havoc, you aren't heldresponsible. And that turns people the wrong way.&quot; He wantsto convince them that a &quot;first-party reparations-compensationsystem&quot; by any other name &quot;gets far more dollars of premium,that the individual has paid, back to the person or to theinjured party than the tort liability system.&quot;   As matters stand, the moolah leaks to lawyers. That is thepoint of a new book by Walter Olson of the ManhattanInstitute that grew out of work partly supported by StateFarm. Mr. Olson cites a study showing that in New Jersey,where lawyers were about twice as likely to be retained inminor-accident cases as in North Carolina, back and neckinjury claims were about 50% more frequent. Medical expenses,the book notes, run three times higher when lawyers areinvolved.   If Mr. Rust is having trouble bypassing the bar, he's gotanother losing cause when he opposes mandatory autoinsurance. It's now the law in 42 states, with his home stateof Illinois recently joining in. Better-off drivers tend toinsist that everybody carry their share of coverage. Mr. Rustargues this leads to a subsidized &quot;assigned risk&quot; motoristpool, and to even more shirkers if a substantial liabilitypolicy is required.   But he concedes universal coverage is here to stay, sohe's behind a mandated &quot;minipolicy&quot; that would cover theholder's own injuries in an accident, but nothing more. Thisrevised form of no-fault has support from California Gov.Pete Wilson. The trial lawyers oppose it.   Marketplace man though he is, Mr. Rust would contain theanimal spirits of attorneys. (He happens to be one.) He'snoticed that daytime television has &quot;five times&quot; as manypersonal-injury solicitations as it used to. He'd like toregulate the tone of the pitches. &quot;It's almost a feeling youhave in a state where there's a lottery -- that if you don'tbuy a ticket, somehow you have lost out on some substantialdollars. It's just that easy.&quot;   Nor is Mr. Rust so gung-ho on other financial institutionsentering the insurance field. &quot;Level playing ground&quot; areabout his first three words on the subject. He wants anyinterlopers subject to all the conditions that governcompanies such as his -- no cream skimming for the bestrisks, in other words. And no pressuring depositors andborrowers to pony up for insurance. Anyway, Mr. Rust saysnobody with a healthy capital base wants to get too close totort liability.   That's why State Farm, with its hefty surplus, must mixsome fancy footwork to protect its mutual holders with itsfighting stance in pursuit of new business. But at least it'sgot legs.</TEXT></DOC>
