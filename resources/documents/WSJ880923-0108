As the U.S. space shuttle Discovery sat waiting to lift off in Cape Canaveral, Fla. yesterday morning, a tiny winged craft atop a squat rocket plunged into the Pacific off southern Japan and sank.    Astronauts weren't aboard the scaled-down, 6 1/2-foot-long model of Japan's future shuttle, which was supposed to blast off from a gondola hanging from a helium balloon once it reached an altitude of 13 miles. But 11 1/2 miles up, the U.S.-made balloon apparently tore and dropped the $2.2 million craft.    The mishap is a blot on a Japanese space program otherwise notable for a lack of catastrophes and a minimum of cost overruns. It symbolizes Japan's frustration with American technology, which it has blamed for a string of other setbacks. Earlier this year, for instance, Japan attributed a rocket-launch delay to a faulty U.S. computer chip.    Ironically, Japan's space-shuttle efforts were bolstered by the greatest U.S. failure of all. &quot;After the Challenger disaster in 1986, Japan saw it had to develop its own shuttle instead of depending completely on the U.S.,&quot; says Eiichiro Sekigawa, a Japanese aerospace consultant. Yesterday's experiment was meant to be &quot;a significant first step in that direction.&quot;    The minishuttle flight, code-named Hope, was designed to provide lessons for a full-scale shuttle Japan wants to launch in the 1990s. But the failure wasn't a huge setback. The modest shuttle was only one part of a broader Japanese effort to exploit outer space. A series of Japanese space successes and American failures has spurred government and corporate space-development funding.    Japan is so confident in its quality and reliability that the National Space Development Agency of Japan didn't bother to buy launch insurance for a communications satellite it blasted into orbit last week on an H-1 rocket built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Japan's biggest aerospace contractor. &quot;The kind of quality you see in Japanese products is the same quality you see in aerospace,&quot; says Donald MacDonald, president of McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Tokyo subsidiary.    But while Japan congratulates itself on its space technology, that technology is inextricably linked to American innovation. The H-1, for example, is a refinement of rocket technology from McDonnell Douglas. By waiting for the West to set precedents, Japan limits risk and invests in only the most promising technologies.    &quot;A lot of technology associated with {a shuttle} is a given. It isn't that difficult a thing after 10 or 20 years&quot; of experimentation by the U.S., says Akio Yamaguchi, a former McDonnell Douglas official who now consults for the company. &quot;They can get it without paying any money.&quot;    One of the biggest things Japan has learned is not to jump into manned shuttle flight. Only after refining the reliability of its shuttles will Japan put several astronauts in space, probably early in the next century.    Yesterday's minishuttle, built by aerospace concerns like Nissan Motor Co. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., was put in the sky by the Education Ministry's space lab. Its purpose was to test how the Japanese aerodynamics and flight-control systems handle re-entry into the earth's atmosphere. Japan's space agency is expected to launch a shuttle half the size of the U.S. shuttle around 1995.    Although U.S.-industry experts think Japan's rockets and shuttles eventually will offer commercial launch services, few expect the vehicles to challenge America's in a big way. The government spent only $1.05 billion on space last year, and Japanese industry officials say they are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of U.S. rocket and satellite production. Instead, Japan's challenge will focus on high-quality aerospace technologies such as electronics and temperature-resistant ceramics and on commercial space exploitation.    Evidence of stepped-up space efforts is everywhere. In June, Nissan Motor, which made the rocket motors for yesterday's failed launch, formed an aerospace subsidiary to reinforce its space-development business. The same month, Toshiba Corp. opened a large space-development center that will create composites for satellites and spacecraft. &quot;The space business is one of the key fields in which Toshiba intends to achieve strong growth,&quot; says Tomoya Okuda, senior vice president in charge of space development.    Japanese construction companies are eagerly publicizing blueprints for such projects as space stations and exotic space shuttle launch systems using the principle of magnetic levitation. Forty-two companies have formed a consortium to lay the groundwork for space exploitation. And the Japanese government increased its space spending 16% last year after letting it go flat for much of the early 1980s.    Until 1986, Japan counted on the U.S. to help it into space. In the late 1960s, Japan set out to acquire U.S. technology. Then companies methodically designed their own parts to replace U.S.-made components. Mitsubishi Heavy bought the technology for McDonnell Douglas's Delta rocket; Mitsubishi's next-generation H-2 rocket, which will launch Japan's shuttle in the 1990s, will be 100% Japanese.    Likewise, Toshiba, NEC Corp. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. began acquiring satellite-building skills from U.S. companies in the 1960s; the Mitsubishi-made satellite launched last week was designed without U.S. technology.    &quot;Our dreams are looking more and more achievable,&quot; says Takaaki Yamada, aerospace manager at Mitsubishi Heavy. &quot;The Japanese are good at going after dreams once they look achievable.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
