 Telefonica-Barcelona's recent annual reportshows that the company has succeeded, in this region, in reducing the waitinglist for lines to 36,951 from 1987's figure of 44,097 and is laboriouslyimproving the service it offers, increasing the rate of installation of linesby 19% while demand went up only 11%.andP;  Furthermore, digital connections wereup 182%, staff increased by 700, while total investment in Barcelona was$390m, up 53% on 1987.andP;  With regard to demand, the most notable increaseswere for services such as X25 (up 99%), cellular phones (up 141%), andIbercom (up 282%), while, in actual traffic, international calls increased by28% and cellular mobile phone calls went up 188%.andP;  In response, Telefonicaincreased the number of X25 ports available by 36%, lines by 34% and fibreoptic cable by 172%.andP;  Looking to the future, Telefonica-Barcelona's budgetfor 1989 comes out at $667m which is 116% up on that for 1988.andP;  The Reportalso mentions Telefonica's main telecommunications projects.andP;  These includethe laying of a ring channel around the Olympic Games stadium and villagearea to enable phone links to be tapped in as required.andP;  Optical fibre cableswill be installed in the channelling to support delivery of speech, data andvideo over Telefonica's network.andP;  Secondly, the Olympic Village is to bereconverted into homes after the Games and Telefonica has recently signed acontract of sale with Barcelona's council for a $1.2m plot in the Villagewhere the telephone company will build its $25.6m &quot;Barcelona-92&quot; telephoneexchange to deal with telecommunications in the north and north-east of thecity both during and after the Games.andP;  The building will consist of twosections, one housing 20,000 digital lines, an Iberpac packet-switchingcentre to connect terminals in the Village to the rest of the network, anIbermic centre for data and image high speed circuit connections and a basestation for the mobile phone and and radiopaging services; the other willhouse the administrative offices and management.andM;Barcelona TeleportandM;The building will also be an international exchange distributing foreignphone traffic from surrounding provinces via optical fibre cable to France,submarine communications (MAT-2 and EMOS cables) to Italy, Greece, Turkey andIsrael, and via TAT-9 cable to the UK, the US and Canada; it will also housethe international transmission and data maintenance centre.andP;  The thirdTelefonica project is the $252m Telecommunications Tower to support all typesof microwave service including Telefonica services, broadcasting of TV and FMservices in the metropolitan area, connection of TV production centres to thebroadcasting centre, interconnection of the mobile TV radio links and a basestation for any type of private radiotelephony.andP;  An earth station for alltypes of international communications via satellite is also planned.andP;  It willhave several parabolic antennae and an advanced satellite tracking system,enabling telegraphy services, high speed data transfer, videoconferences,faxes and TV signals to be provided via Intelsat and Eutelsat.andP;  Other plansinclude, the Barcelona Teleport consisting of a satellite farm with parabolicantennae for the IBS and SMS services via satellites and an annexe building,complete with all the transmission and radio equipment required for thelinking the terrestrial network to the parabolic antennae; a networkmanagement centre with service and supplementary buildings; the TelecomValles Programme for a new telecommunications infrastructure in the Vallesarea which supports Barcelona's technological park and various researchinstitutions; and the creation of a new company to produce and distributeBarcelona Cable TV.andP;  The city will also be connected by fibre optic cable toMadrid, Valencia, and France adding to the province's existing wide areanetwork.andP;  Telefonica-Barcelona's future projects also span promotion anddevelopment of its viewdata service, and, last but not least, the extensionof the basic phone service.andM;Bull takes tighter control of its Spanish operations; CP8 card ventureandM;After two years of being overshadowed by the progress of other multinationalsin Spain, Bull Espana SA has reported turnover up 22%.andP;  Now that Bull SA hasfull control of Bull HN, it wants to support its multi-national Europeanmajor accounts more efficiently so as to provide a better service at lesscost to its local subsidiaries.andP;  In Spain, Bull has already teamed up withAmper SA via its subsidiary Bull CP8 for the joint manufacture of Smart Cardsfor payphones (CI No 1,105).andP;  This project was initiated by Telefonica whichpicked the French company because of Smart Card penetration in the Frenchmarket, and then paid $21.3m for a 10% share in Bull CP8 so that it couldhave a say in its management and marketing.andP;  The resulting factory willassemble chips in the cards and hopes to produce 750,000 cards a year,increasing this to 10,000,000 by 1992.andP;  In addition, Bull has increased itsinvestment in Spain with the acquisition of most of Telesincro SA and the twocompanies are at present working on technology required by the Banca Catalanafor a new electronic payment service using Smart Cards capable of storinglarge amounts of data.andP;  Total investment for this project should be about$20m and Telesincro will manufacture the card readers.andP;  If this system, newon the Spanish market, is as successful as Bull hopes in Catalonia, it willbe extended across the country.andP;  Bull has also been retained by Basqueelectrotechnical group Fagor SA to implement a major automation systemcosting a total $21m over the five years.andP;  Bull will supply computerequipment and technical assistance and train staff.andP;  The other main Bullmarkets in Spain are government, finance and industry.andM;Arthur Andersen manufacturing ventureandM;Arthur Anderson Consulting and Spanish technical and financial co-ordinationcompany Centunion SA have set up a new group, Accent SA to offer acomprehensive assessment and development service for industrial companiesstarting out or updating their production systems.andP;  Formation of the groupwas prompted by the fact that many industrial modernisation programmes faildue to a lack of efficient integration of management and technology.andP;  Atpresent Spain is relatively undeveloped in production process automation inEurope, but plans for the future indicate that investments incomputer-integrated manufacturing will grow 30% annually over the next fewyears, taking it to $4,300m by 1992.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
