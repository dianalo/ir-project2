Brokers described the session as characterless with sluggish participation by institutional investors.    Share prices also ended lower in London and were off sharply from their intraday highs as the market was undermined by a weak opening on Wall Street.    Tokyo's Nikkei 225-stock average fell 26.48 to 35114.35. The index rose 77.69 points Monday to its latest record.    In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index was down 59.72 points, to 35054.63, midway through the morning session.    The market started Tuesday weaker, recovered to carry the Nikkei average into the plus column by midmorning, then fell back again. Volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section was estimated at 450 million shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 496-378, with 229 issues unchanged.    The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which gained 6.58 points Monday, was down 5.63, or 0.21%, at 2653.45.    The second section index, which gained 22.60 Monday, was up 19.65, or 0.60%, to close at 3279.81. Volume in the second section was estimated at 30 million shares, compared with 23 million shares Monday.    Institutional investors largely stayed on the sidelines out of fear that the market is vulnerable to a correction. Last Thursday was the first time the Nikkei average had ever closed above 35000.    &quot;There was no incentive to buy on today's market,&quot; said a fund manager at a major life insurance company. &quot;On the other hand, there is also no reason for the market to lose heavily.    &quot;In spite of the low daily volume, the Nikkei has maintained the 35000 level since Thursday. I think the market is now taking time to solidify at the new level.&quot;    What little buying there was came from individual investors hunting for issues with strong earnings outlooks and low price-earnings ratios and for other incentive-backed issues. But the trickle of bids wasn't enough to produce a notable advance in any sector, traders said.    Sony fell back on profit-taking. The stock's advance to the 9,000 yen ($62.89) level Monday attracted investor interest and even prompted talk the price could rise to 10,000 yen. The stock has also moved up and down as expectations of a gratis distribution by the company have grown and receded, one fund manager said.    Sony, which reached an intraday high of 9,000 Monday, closed yesterday at 8,680 yen a share, down 120. Other gainers included Toyota, which gained 20 to 2,720.    Housing issues again were bought by major Japanese brokerages in what was widely seen as an effort to stir investor interest in the sector, but the dealers' efforts weren't successful, traders said.    Misawa Homes gained 50 to 2,660, but Daiwa House lost 60 to 2,640, and Sekisui House was down 20 at 2,330.    London's retreat was accentuated by the actions of market-makers, who juggled prices to try to reignite buying interest.    The market opened lower in response to Wall Street's 40.97-point decline Monday, rallied around midday as several major stocks attracted investor interest, then slid back into negative territory as Wall Street again opened easier.    The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended down 3.9 points at 2370.8, compared with an intraday high of 2385.2. Dealers said, however, that the retreat occurred in thin trading and didn't denote significant profit-taking.    &quot;The market is still very short of stock,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;Although private clients are sticking to the sidelines, most institutions are still on the lookout for a good, reasonably priced line of stock.&quot;    The Financial Times 30-share index was down 2.7 at 1966.3. Volume was 391.6 million shares, compared with 349.7 million Monday.    Chemical giant Imperial Chemical Industries was a standout issue, closing 31 pence stronger at #13.18 ($20.72) a share. Dealers said the stock benefited from rumors that the company has built up a war chest to finance an imminent bid, with Wellcome mentioned as a possible candidate.    Wellcome continued to surge on the strength of reports last week that U.S. health officials have found the company's drug AZT more effective than originally thought in treating the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus. The stock rose 27 to 756 pence.    Great Universal Stores rose 24 to #11.34 as players continued to evaluate it against the rest of the stores sector. &quot;GUS has got very strong assets and is a good defensive stock during a downturn,&quot; one trader said.    B.A.T rose 14 to 847 as the market continued to applaud the company's defense document issued Monday against Hoylake's hostile #13.4 billion bid for the U.K. conglomerate.    BICC, a cables and construction group, advanced 23 to 558 after reporting a 37% rise in interim pretax profit. It cited a strong performance by European and North American cable units.    Several stocks that have led the market higher in recent weeks encountered profit-taking. Among them, Reuters shed 13 to 950, Scottish andamp; Newcastle fell 5 to 404, and Pearson declined 7 to 807.    Saatchi andamp; Saatchi fell 20 to 304 after a report in The Wall Street Journal in which the company said revenue on the agency side will remain depressed in the current year.    English China Clay retreated 7 to 477 after U.K. brokerage concern UBS Phillips andamp; Drew lowered its pretax profit forecast for the year ending in September to #150 million from #155 million.    In other European markets, share prices closed higher in Zurich and Milan, lower in Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Stockholm and mixed in Brussels. In South Africa, gold stocks closed lower.    Elsewhere, prices closed lower in Singapore and Taipei and were mixed in Manila, higher in Hong Kong, Seoul and Wellington and little changed in Sydney.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end. @ % This @ Aug 21 Aug 18 Year @ U.S. ................... 313.9 318.8 +22.6 @ Britain ................ 712.8 714.0 +30.5 @ Canada ................. 430.0 432.7 +17.1 @ Japan .................. 1572.5 1569.4 +10.7 @ France ................. 523.1 523.1 +18.2 @ Germany ................ 251.1 247.9 +20.7 @ Hong Kong .............. 1890.7 1930.8 - 6.8 @ Switzerland ............ 235.7 235.1 +36.3 @ Australia .............. 345.0 343.7 +18.8 @ World index ............ 536.9 538.2 + 8.6 </TEXT></DOC>
