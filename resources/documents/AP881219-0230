It was the year rescuers decided to free a trio of battered,barnacle-encrusted gray whales trapped in the ice at the top of theworld. It was the year an early decision to let Yellowstone burnaltered the face of the showcase national park for a century to come.   It was the year Oprah decided to diet, Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev decided he wanted to be president, Attorney General EdwinMeese III decided to resign, evangelist Jimmy Swaggart decided toconfess his sins and Michael Spinks decided to challenge worldheavyweight champion Mike Tyson.   Some decisions worked; others didn't.   Soviets and Americans pulled together to free two survivingwhales, last seen cruising toward warmer waters. Soviet PresidentAndrei Gromyko bowed out, and Gorbachev took over. Oprah Winfrey,the TV host, lost 67 pounds.   In Yellowstone, however, officials realized too late they mighthave made the wrong decision. By the time firefighters arrived,unusually dry weather and high winds had fires ripping out ofcontrol, forcing evacuation of towns and causing an uproar amongarea residents.   Swaggart preached on but lost much of his audience after theAssemblies of God decided to defrock him. Spinks lasted for just 91seconds and eight decisive blows.   The wisdom of other decisions remained to be seen.   Faced with the choice between Vice President George Bush andMassachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, and frustrated by one of themost low-down, dirty presidential campaigns ever, an ambivalentelectorate waffled and fidgeted and finally succumbed tooverwhelming inertia.   ``I've always loved election years,'' President Reagan said, butit seemed hardly anyone else did. Bush's 54-46 percent victory overhis Democratic opponent was based on a 50 percent voter turnout, thelowest in 64 years.   Political analysts looked at exit polls and determined that manyvoters weren't voting for anyone so much as they were voting againstthe other guy. They also determined that Bush lost 2 percent of hissupporters because they were turned off by his first major decision_ to tap as his running mate Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, the first``baby boomer'' on a national ticket and a choice that surprisedeven Bush's advisers.   It was Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen, thesilver-haired, smooth-talking senator from Texas, who provided theonly memorable line from the three nationally televised debates.   ``Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy,'' Bentsen told a flusteredQuayle, after the 41-year-old senator had compared himself with thelate Democratic president.   The Kennedy image haunted the campaign and the nation. The 25thanniversary of his assassination became a time to reflect onidealism lost and a world changed.   Nowhere was that change more apparent than in U.S.-Sovietrelations.   Kennedy, on the campaign trail himself 28 years ago, shunnedNikita Khrushchev when he visited New York. But Gorbachev, the firstSoviet leader since Khrushchev to taste the Big Apple, had asuper-power lunch with Reagan and Bush on Dec. 7 and addressed theUnited Nations, with no Khrushchev-style shoe-thumping. Instead, hepromised to trim 500,000 men and 10,000 tanks from the Soviet armedforces.   The visit ended abruptly when a devastating earthquake hit SovietArmenia. The Soviet leader rushed home to learn that an estimated60,000 had died and 500,000 were left homeless as whole citiescrumbled under the quake's force.   Rescue teams, doctors and planes loaded with supplies poured infrom around the world. It was the first time since World War II thatthe Soviet Union had accepted disaster relief from the United States.   Reagan paid his first visit to Moscow in June for a summit thatfailed to break new ground in arms control. The president hammeredaway on human rights issues, and Gorbachev later sent America livingproof of his commitment to change.   Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov, father of the Soviet dissidentmovement, was allowed his first trip outside the Soviet Union afteryears of agitation over Soviet human rights policies.   Americans vigorously agitated for their own causes. More than5,000 people were arrested in anti-abortion protests that began inJuly in 32 cities and continued through the year. Roe vs. Wade, theSupreme Court decision legalizing abortion, turned 15 years old,intact.   Anthony McLeod Kennedy, confirmed as a Supreme Court justice by aunanimous Senate, inherited a pivotal vote on the abortion issue butgave no hint of his views.   Court dockets bulged with the celebrated cases of theonce-powerful.   Former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife,Imelda, were indicted on racketeering charges alleging theyplundered their homeland of millions and defrauded U.S. banks. Harryand Leona Helmsley, the king and queen of New York real estate,pleaded innocent to dozens of tax evasion charges.   Republican Evan Mecham of Arizona became the first governor in ahalf-century to be impeached and removed from office, although hewas acquitted on criminal charges of concealing a $350,000 campaignloan.   Oliver North, John Poindexter, Richard Secord and Albert Hakimpleaded innocent to charges of defrauding the government by sellingarms to Iran and giving the proceeds to the Contras at a time whenU.S. aid to the Nicaraguan rebels was banned.   Congress refused to restore military aid to the Contras butdecided to approve humanitarian aid after the Nicaraguan rebels andthe Sandinista government reached a temporary truce.   In a decision that stunned Israel, President Reagan authorizedtalks with Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization for thefirst time in at least 13 years. ``Our object is not a dialogue,''Secretary of State George P. Shultz said. ``Our object is peace.''   Uneasy peace prevailed in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq War after aUnited Nations-sponsored cease-fire began Aug. 20. Peace talksopened five days later; they were deadlocked within 24 hours. InAfghanistan, Soviet troops began a withdrawal in 1988, but theguerrilla war raged on.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
