At the bottom of the column there would be anote to the effect that, for the record, there is adissenting view on Mr. Meese's tenure in Washington. Thisthought is the product of reading through news accounts ofAttorney General Dick Thornburgh's decision to run for theSenate; all manage to say that Mr. Thornburgh inherited theJustice job from Mr. Meese, who's term is dismissed as&quot;stormy&quot; or worse.   If you are a liberal, which is to say if you were out ofpower during the 1980s, the view of Mr. Meese that you wouldlike history to accept as true and given is that his term asAttorney General was a failure.</LP><TEXT>   If, however, you supported the ideas and policies that wonRonald Reagan election to the presidency twice this period,your instinct is not to be a party to the long campaign ofreputation assassination waged against Mr. Meese, beginningwith the unforgettable ad-hominen attacks of the Bidennomination hearings.   Ed Meese was the subject of two investigations byCongress's Star Chamber creation, the independent counsel.Resulting in a year's delay in Mr. Meese's confirmation,prosecutor Jacob Stein investigated his financial affairs butcleared him of any wrongdoing.   This was followed by Independent Counsel James McKay'salmost $2 million investigation into several matters,including Wedtech, whose mere mention was supposed to provein the public's mind that Mr. Meese and &quot;sleaze&quot; were one.The Wedtech story, of course, crashed to pieces last week onthe unimpressed rocks of an appellate-court panel, whichreversed the convictions of Robert Wallach and two othersbecause the prosecution's main witness was a perjurer.   The 814-page McKay report was itself a perfect reflectionof the independent-counsel phenomenon rampant in those years.It concluded that Mr. Meese had done nothing for which hemerited indictment, but it said some of what Mr. Meese did&quot;probably violated&quot; the law. &quot;Probably&quot; is such a useful wordin an era when &quot;appearances&quot; carry more legal weight thanprevious common-law notions of guilt and innocence.   Let's get clear why Ed Meese remains a controversialfigure and what he's actually guilty of.   For many conservatives, Mr. Meese was guilty, in one trulystormy news conference, of putting the Reagan administrationon the defensive about Iran-Contra from Day One.   For liberals, the primary source of Mr. Meese's &quot;guilt&quot; isthat he remade the federal judiciary. Many had apparentlycome to believe that the era of legislative expansions bylife-tenured judges of laws passed between 1965 and 1988would never end. But it did. Under Mr. Meese's direction, theReagan administration appointed to the federal judiciaryindividuals such as Robert Bork, Antonin Scalia, RichardPosner, Frank Easterbrook, Alex Kozinski, Ralph Winter andLaurence Silberman.   The strategy behind reflexively imputing flaws ofcharacter and performance to Ed Meese as Attorney General isthat if the public buys it, the public may also devalue Mr.Meese's policy achievements. In like fashion, the phrase &quot;adecade of greed&quot; is supposed to delegitimize the entire twoterms of the Reagan presidency.   Well, all is fair in love and war and American politics.But it would be nice if eventually the opposition would comeout in the open and fight with policies instead of pillories.</TEXT></DOC>
