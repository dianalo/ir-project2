As previously reported, News Corp., an Australian publishing concern that acquired Harper andamp; Row last month for $300 million, said it was exploring the sale of the operations. A number of other publishers expressed interest, but a Harper andamp; Row official said News Corp. determined that &quot;it would make the most sense&quot; to hang on to the operations. </TEXT></DOC>
