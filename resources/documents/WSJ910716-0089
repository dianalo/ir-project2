A New York surgeonwants to help.   Upset by the sight of his mother-in-law sitting in awheelchair in a nursing home, and inspired by the wheeledwalker that his young children used, Julius Jacobson hascreated a &quot;chairwalker&quot; for adults. Aided by the Tanaka KapecDesign Group, South Norwalk, Conn., Dr. Jacobson designed thewalker with a pneumatic seat that automatically helps usersstand up, swings out of the way to let them walk and catchesthem if they fall.   By giving people confidence that they won't get hurt ifthey fall, the device encourages walking, says Dr. Jacobson,director of vascular surgery at Manhattan's Mount SinaiHospital. Failure to keep walking causes muscle atrophy anddegeneration of the rest of the body, he adds.   Though the chair-walker has yet to go beyond a prototype,it has won an award from International Design magazine. Intrials at two nursing homes, it has received mixed reviews.Helena Schanzer, rehabilitation coordinator at Beth AbrahamNursing Home in the Bronx, says the device gave patients &quot;asense of independence&quot; and prevented dangerous falls forthose with balance problems. But the chair-walker is &quot;alittle bit too big,&quot; Mrs. Schanzer adds, and patients neededhelp opening the device's back gate to get in or out.   Dr. Jacobson has shown a film of his invention to Lumex, aBay Shore, N.Y., maker of walkers. Lawrence Delahaba, Lumex'sdirector of marketing, is cautious about its prospects butsays &quot;there is a market&quot; for a device to help people learn towalk again after hip surgery.                                                                                                          San Francisco Firms   Confront Computer Law                                                                                                          SIZE makes a difference. Big San Francisco companies seemto like the city's new computer comfort ordinance; smallfirms say the law hurts.   Starting this year, San Francisco employers must providepeople who work at video-display tubes with adjustable seats,nonglare lighting, rest breaks and training in ergonomics.   Some companies anticipated the law. Last fall, LeviStrauss began requiring employees to attend a one-hour coursein computer comfort and safety. BankAmerica has been buyingergonomic furniture since 1985.   But Bob Tessler, president of DPAS Co., says the law isforcing the company to consider moving out of San Francisco.It would cost the data-processing company as much as $500,000to replace equipment for its 110 data-entry workers, he says.   Makers of furniture and other products are using theordinance to make new sales pitches. Linda Coleman, generalmanager of Escape Ergonomics, Sunnyvale, Calif., says SanFrancisco employers are showing interest in software made byher company that prompts the user with several sets ofstretching exercises throughout the day.                                                                                                          Mighty Mouse, Spaceball   Vie as Design Tools                                                                                                          ENGINEERS groping for better ways to move threedimensional images around on computer screens are gettingsome help.   The traditional mouse remains the most popular controldevice. But the mouse was designed to operate in twodimensions and works awkwardly in three. Some engineers anddesigners use a &quot;dial box,&quot; with as many as eight knobs tocontrol movement.   More recent entrants are the Spaceball and the FlyingMouse. The Spaceball resembles a globe in the palm of a hand.The ball doesn't move, but it senses pressure as users push,pull and twist it. Made by Spaceball Technologies of Lowell,Mass., the device has just been redesigned by Boston's DesignContinuum. The latest version is smaller, simpler andapparently less fatiguing to use than the earlier one.   The Flying Mouse feels and acts like a standard mouse whenlying on the table. Lifted up, it automatically changes to3-D. Whatever way the user moves the Flying Mouse, the imageon the screen follows suit.   Steve Tice, chief executive of the Flying Mouse's maker,SimGraphics Engineering in South Pasadena, Calif., says thedevice is easy to use because &quot;you do with your hand what youwant the image to do.&quot; But Stephen Wolfe, publisher ofComputer Aided Design Report, says he suspects &quot;your arm getstired&quot; from holding up the Flying Mouse.   John Shealy, a Motorola engineer, says he likes theSpaceball because &quot;you don't have to keep taking your eyesoff the screen and over to the dial box.&quot; But Mr. Wolfeobjects to Spaceball's fixity. &quot;I'm used to things that movewhen I touch them,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
