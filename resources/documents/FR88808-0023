The regulations establish requirementsnecessary to apply consistently and equitably the SES pay provisions ofthe Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, as amended. In particular, the regulationsfocus on setting individual basic pay under the SES and implementing thestatutory provisions on aggregate compensation. They attempt to provideas much flexibility to agencies as possible under the statutory provisionswhile providing adequate protections for career appointees. The regulationswould also permit more flexibility on the part of agencies in operatingtheir SES performance appraisal systems by revising current requirementson the number of SES summary rating levels and the ending date of the SESperformance appraisal period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments will be considered if received no later than October7, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Send or deliver written comments to the Director, Officeof Executive Personnel, Office of Executive Administration, Office of PersonnelManagement, Room 6R48, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20415.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Neal Harwood, (202) 632-4625.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>These proposed regulations revise currentregulations on SES pay and performance to fully implement the provisionsof the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-454), as amended,in as flexible a manner as possible. <ITAG tagnum="84">(1) Pay Under the Senior Executive Service (Part 534, Subpart D) </ITAG>Since the passage of the CSRA, policy on the administration of pay forthe SES has evolved from decisions on specific issues and OPM responsesto individual agency inquiries. Additional changes have resulted from enactmentof Pub. L. 98-615 on November 8, 1984. The pay provisions of this law wereeffective February 6, 1985. These regulations would implement the new law,codify interpretations of previous law, and incorporate, or change wherenecessary, current regulations at 5 CFR Part 534, Subpart D. They providea basis for consistent and equitable application of the provisions of theCSRA and Pub. L. 98-615. The statutory authority for these regulationsmay be found in 5 U.S.C. 5382, 5383, and 5385. Under the SES, which is a gradeless system, management officials enjoyconsiderable latitude to use pay flexibly. Before CSRA, the specific gradesto which positions were classified (e.g., GS-16, 17, 18) most often determinedthe differences in pay among employees. CSRA removed this automatic linkage.Thus, managers may use pay as an inducement in recruiting, as a means torecognize organizational hierarchy and the responsibility of positions,as a reward for good performance, or as an incentive to improve poor performance.These regulations are written to optimize this flexibility and, at thesame time, ensure against arbitrary decisions. The regulations help assurethe public and the workforce that pay decisions are made in a reasonablemanner and are based upon sound management principles. Pay Setting Upon Initial Appointment and While in the SES Under 5 U.S.C. 5383(c), pay for SES members may be adjusted only once ina 12-month period by an appointing authority. The change made by the Presidentin the salary attached to each pay rate is not considered a pay adjustmentfor the purpose of this restriction. A number of questions have arisen,however, over whether other actions affecting an individual's pay are consideredadjustments and thus subject to the 12-month waiting period. The proposed regulations at andSection; 534.401 (b) and (c) provide thatpay upon initial SES appointment may be set at any ES rate and clarifythat this pay setting action is considered a pay adjustment. Therefore,for example, if an individual is appointed to the SES as an ES-2, thatpay rate could not be changed for 12 months. When the rate is changed (e.g.,to ES-3), the individual would have to begin a new 12-month waiting periodbefore being eligible for another change. The 12-month restriction is not applicable if the individual transfersbetween agencies because the individual is now under a new appointing authority,who can set pay at any SES rate. A new 12-month waiting period would begin,however, if there is a change in the ES rate upon the transfer. Pay settingupon transfer is clarified in the proposed andSection; 534.401(d). The provision in the current andSection; 534.401 that restricts the reductionof an SES member's pay to no more than one rate in a 12-month period isretained in the proposed andSection; 534.401(c)(3), which also incorporatesthe requirement in 5 U.S.C. 5383(d) that career SES members be given 15-days'advance notice when pay is to be reduced. There is no restriction on the number of rates that pay may be adjustedupwards at one time. The current andSection; 534.402 restrictions on reducing the pay of SES memberswho converted to the SES under Subpart C of Part 317 are continued in theproposed andSection; 534.401(f). Pay Setting Following Break in SES Service The proposed regulations at andSection; 534.401(e)(1) provide that if thereis a break in SES service of more than 30 days, pay may be set at any rateupon reappointment to the SES. A new 12-month waiting period begins uponthe reappointment action. The proposed andSection; 534.401(e)(2), however, provides that if a careersenior executive elected to retain SES pay while serving under a Presidentialappointment with Senate confirmation, pay may not be adjusted upon reinstatementto the SES unless 12 months have elapsed since the individual's last payadjustment. If the executive did not elect to retain SES pay, pay may beset at any rate upon reinstatement. Restrictions on Aggregate Compensation The proposed regulations at andSection; 534.402(a) define an individual'saggregate compensation to consist of basic pay, performance awards, Presidentialrank awards, and physicians comparability allowances. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5383(b), the regulations at andSection; 534.402(b)state that an individual's aggregate compensation may not exceed the ExecutiveLevel I pay rate in effect at the end of that fiscal year. For example,if an executive received a distinguished rank award of $20,000 in FY 1987,had basic pay that equaled $75,000, and received $10,000 in physicianscomparability allowance, the executive's aggregate compensation for thefiscal year would be $105,000. The pay rate for Executive Level I at theend of FY 1987, however, was only $99,500. Therefore, as a result of therank award, the executive would have surplus compensation of $5,500 thatcould not be paid during FY 1987.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>As in the example here, if either a performance award ora rank award would cause the executive's aggregate compensation to exceedthe Executive Level I ceiling by the end of the fiscal year, the excessamount is withheld from the award, rather than from the individual's basicsalary.</ITAG>Before the changes made by Pub. L. 98-615, the executive would have lostthe $5,500 surplus. Based on the law, however, proposed andSection; 534.402(c)provides that_ (a) Any surplus compensation (i.e., compensation in excess of the ExecutiveLevel I ceiling) will be paid in a lump sum at the beginning of the nextfiscal year. In this case, the $5,500 would be paid at the beginning ofFY 1988 and become part of that fiscal year's aggregate compensation. (Notethat if the full surplus compensation would cause the individual's aggregatecompensation for FY 1988 to exceed the Executive Level I ceiling for thatyear, then the individual would be paid only that portion of the surpluscompensation which would bring him to the ceiling; and the remainder wouldbe paid at the beginning of FY 1989.) (b) The individual is still entitled to any surplus amount in case of separationfrom the Federal service (e.g., resignation or retirement), or acceptanceof a position outside the SES (e.g., at GS-15). As with individuals whoremain in the SES, payment may not be made until the beginning of the nextfiscal year for individuals who take a position outside the SES. For individualswho leave the Federal service, or who die, payment will be made in accordancewith andSection; 534.402(c)(3). The requirement for a 30-day break in servicefor individuals who separate before payment may be made is to prevent anindividual from retiring or resigning solely to receive the payment andthen being immediately reemployed.(c) If the individual transfers between agencies, the agency the individualwas in at the time the surplus amount was created is responsible for payingthe amount at the beginning of the next fiscal year. For example, if anindividual receives a rank award in agency A in FY 1987, and there is asurplus amount of $5,500, but transfers to agency B, agency A must paythe $5,500 when FY 1988 begins. This provision is based on the principlethat the agency which creates the obligation should be responsible forpaying it. Note that although payment is made by agency A, agency B muststill keep a record of it since the payment counts against the aggregatecompensation for the new fiscal year. <ITAG tagnum="84">(2) Performance Appraisal for the Senior Executive Service (Part 430,Subpart C) </ITAG>Final SES performance appraisal regulations were issued in 1986. Basedon experience operating under those regulations, two changes are beingproposed. The first change would eliminate the requirement for five summaryrating levels. The CSRA (5 U.S.C. 4314(a)) required only three levels (unsatisfactory,minimally satisfactory, and fully successful); and until the 1986 regulations,agencies had the option of determining whether to have additional levels.We believe this option should be returned to agencies, and the proposedregulations would allow agencies to have a three, four, or five-level system.The second change would eliminate the requirement that SES appraisal periodsend between June 30 and September 30. Again, this requirement was addedby the 1986 regulations, but is not required by law. One other change was considered, but is not being proposed. Under 5 U.S.C.4312(b)(3), an SES member is entitled to have a supervisor's rating reviewedby an employee in a higher level in the agency before the rating becomesfinal. Section 430.306(a)(3) of the current regulations requires that thereview take place before review by the agency Performance Review Board(PRB). Some agencies have suggested that the regulation be changed so thatagencies could provide the higher level review after, rather than before,the PRB acts. In our view, the intent of the statutory provision was tohave the higher level reviewer's comments available for consideration bythe PRB. Therefore, no change is being proposed in the regulations. Nevertheless,it should be noted that under the current regulations, those agencies thatwant to provide a higher level review after PRB action, in addition tobefore, may do so. <ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291.
