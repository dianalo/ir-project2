The Bild newspaper of Hamburg, which is known to have closecontacts to intelligence sources, quoted an unidentified WestGerman security official as saying Clyde Lee Conrad had sold``extraordinarily important information.''   A special Supreme Court panel ordered Conrad held in prisonpending further investigation following his arrest Tuesday. He wascharged with ``compelling suspicion of espionage activities in anespecially grave case,'' according to the prosecutor's office.   Two men who officials said were part of the ring were arraignedtoday in Sweden.   Kurt Rebmann, the chief federal prosecutor, said Conrad alsorecruited a second American soldier who received a ``five-figuresum'' of money for supplying the ring with military secrets.Rebmann refused to elaborate.   Bild said information contained in documents that Conradallegedly sold included ``secret locations of nuclear missiles,classified documents about pipeline systems, defense plans of NATOand of U.S. divisions, and top-secret troop mobilization plans.''   West Germany's ARD television network and The New York Timesalso reported that such information was sold by the ring, whichallegedly had been operating since the late 1970s.   The Times quoted U.S. and German officials as saying Conradguarded a safe that stored documents at the U.S. Army base in BadKreuznach in central West Germany.   Bild said Conrad lived in an elegantly furnished apartment nearthe base.   Officials have said the ring was believed to have stolendocuments concerning NATO defense plans for Europe and U.S. Armycontingency plans for a ground war with the Soviet Union in Europe.   Alexander Prechtel, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor'soffice, said Thursday that it's too early to determine what damagethe spying caused the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   ``We can't exclude the possibility that millions of dollars areinvolved,'' he said.   ``It could take months before we know the full extent of thedamage to NATO defenses,'' he added. He refused to release anyfurther details about the probe.   In Goteborg, Sweden, a district court today arraigned twoHungarian-born brothers, who Prechtel said were part of the ring.Chief Prosecutor Sven-Olof Hakansson said the men, arrestedTuesday, acknowledged working for the Hungarian intelligenceservice.   Security officials said Sandor Kercsik, 48, and Imre Kercsik,34, were suspected of ``preparing unlawful intellegence activityand supporting preparations of criminal acts.''   A third suspect, the wife of one of the brothers, was detainedfor questioning and released. Her arraignment was not immediatelysought.   A U.S. Justice Department official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, called the spy case ``a serious encroachment on ournational security.''   Army records released in Washington said Conrad, of Sebring,Ohio, was born in 1947 and worked for the U.S. military for 20years, first as an infantryman and then as an ``administrationspecialist.''   According to his service records, Conrad received the NationalDefense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, five ArmyCommendation medals, the Army Achievement Medal, three MeritoriousService medals and seven Good Conduct medals.   Prechtel said Conrad worked with classified military defenseplans for seven years at the U.S. Army base in Bad Kreuznach withaccess to a wide array of secret documents.   Conrad allegedly engaged in espionage work after he left theservice in 1985, Prechtel said.   In a statement, Rebmann alleged that Conrad had turned over themost recent batch of information to his Soviet bloc contact inVienna last month.   Rebmann said officials still were investigating to determineexactly what was missing.   Cable News Network on Thursday quoted unidentified West Germansources as saying Conrad systematically photographed files from1980 to 1985. The CNN report said investigators believe he may havetransferred material onto a personal computer, which was seized athis home.   Prechtel said that while ``several'' people had been taken intocustody or arrested, he could not confirm a New York Times reportThursday that eight people were rounded up.   The Times said the network was uncovered by West German and U.S.officials, including agents from the FBI and the Army. The Army hasabout 250,000 military personnel in West Germany at more than 200installations and frequently warns its personnel to beware ofSoviet bloc spies.</TEXT></DOC>
