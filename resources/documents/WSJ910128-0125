At the same time, the Commerce Department all butabandoned hopes of negotiating an extension of a separatepublic-works accord, raising the possibility of U.S.retaliation against alleged barriers blocking theparticipation of U.S. companies in Japanese public works.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Our general sense is that the Japanese just want to keepus talking and are just playing for time,&quot; a U.S. officialsaid about last week's talks on the two issues. Thesediscussions in Tokyo reviewed not only these two troublingsectors but also the indifferent results so far of theStructural Impediments Initiative, a broader forum forattacking the root causes of the bilateral trade imbalance.   After the session on computer chips ended Friday, U.S.negotiators said they favor a new arrangement &quot;along thelines&quot; of a recent U.S. industry proposal urging theretention of the current agreement's goal of providing U.S.suppliers a 20% share of the Japanese market. Currently, U.S.vendors have 13% of the Japanese chip market.   The Japanese want no new agreement to succeed the currentpact, arguing that U.S. vendors have reached the maximummarket share that they are capable of achieving.   This was the first time the U.S. government officiallystated its position on what should happen after the 1986semiconductor pact ends. The issue places the Bushadministration in the awkward position of reconciling itsfree-trade ideology with the &quot;managed trade&quot; bent of currentU.S. semiconductor trade policy, which aims to set a marketoutcome.   U.S. officials said a successor agreement could retain the20% target, but be somewhat short of a legally binding&quot;market-sharing&quot; agreement. The administration also isconsidering doing away with price floors on imported chipsand terminating or easing U.S. anti-dumping actions on twotypes of these products. This position is a recognition thatthe 1986 accord has largely halted unfair pricing of Japanesechip exports to the U.S. and other countries.   The U.S. industry has proposed extending the deadline forJapan to comply with the 20% goal to the end of 1992 and tonegotiate further steps based on what results materialize atthat time. However, U.S. officials said they still are todetermine how long any new arrangement should run.   U.S. efforts to renew the 1988 public-works agreementafter it expires in May are running into even tougherobstacles. Commerce Department negotiators failed last weekto persuade Tokyo to widen the scope to include allpublic-works projects instead of the 17 that it currentlyprovides for.   Tokyo rejected other U.S. proposals to have a single setof rules for all types of public-works projects and to haveclearer guidelines for competition in design-and-buildingawards. The Japanese insist on one set of rules for dealingwith official agencies and another for quasi-public ones likethe New Kansai International Airport. The Japanese alsoinsist on retaining certain discretionary authority inselecting design-and-build contractors.   The U.S., morever, hasn't succeeded in getting Tokyo todrop an allegedly discriminatory practice of rankingcontractors and to allow U.S. companies to independently bidfor contracts instead of being compelled to be part of jointventures with Japanese contractors.   A U.S. negotiator said the two governments have to agreeon the terms for extending the public-works accord by thismonth, or &quot;we'd have to go our separate ways.&quot; The 1988 tradelaw requires the administration to retaliate against Japan ifit's deemed to be unwilling to open its public-works marketto U.S. companies.   The nonrenewal of the accord could hurt the prospects of afew U.S. contractors that have succeeded in breaking intothis market. Bechtel Group Inc. and Austin Co. of Clevelandare among this select group. But the Bush administration isseeking a wider gateway that can benefit more U.S.contractors.   ---   Jacob M.
