U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel filed an order Fridaysaying he found fair and reasonable a settlement to the suitoffered by the U.S. Department of Energy, owner of the FeedMaterials Production Center. The settlement will support long-termmedical studies of residents within five miles of the plant.   The 38-year-old facility located 18 miles northwest ofCincinnati processes uranium for use in nuclear reactors andweapons.   The Energy Department offered June 30 to settle a $300 millionclaim by neighbors who said radioactive pollution from the plantinflicted emotional suffering and reduced their property values.Spiegel ruled that the settlement is limited to those two issues.   Chesley has said lawyers expect medical monitoring to last 30 to40 years and track such ailments as lung cancer and kidney disease.   Claims by individual residents were certified as a class-actionlawsuit in September 1986.   Spiegel rejected the government's contention that the settlementprotects the Energy Department from claims by neighbors for thecost of cleaning up radioactive contamination of their property. Hesaid the neighbors are free to file such claims.   Henry Gill Jr., the Energy Department's chief lawyer in thecase, declined to comment Friday from his Washington office, sayinghe had not seen the judge's order.   Spiegel dismissed objections to the settlement by Ruetgers-NeaseChemical Co. and Delta Steel Corp., commercial neighbors of theFernald plant. Spiegel ruled that the companies lack legal standingto object to the settlement because they don't own the property onwhich they operate in the five-mile radius set as a requirement forparticipation in the lawsuit.   William Kennedy, a lawyer for Ruetgers-Nease, also declinedcomment from his Philadelphia office, saying he hadn't seenSpiegel's order.   Spiegel appointed three people to serve as court-supervisedmasters and trustees to oversee implementation of the settlement.</TEXT></DOC>
