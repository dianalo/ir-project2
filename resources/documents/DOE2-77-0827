<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-77-0827 </DOCNO><TEXT>Various papers on laser optics for intracavity and extracavity applicationsare presented. The general topics addressed include: design and requirementsfor high-power lasers, active elements, damage in optical components,FELs, and thin films. Individual subjects considered include: thermaleffects in high-power Q-switched lasers, influence of self-focusing onbulk laser-induced damage, fly's eye modular optic concept for high-powerlasers, liquid crystal optics for laser systems, thin-film coatings forlaser cavity optics, and production of resonator optics for the 1315nm oxygen iodine laser.</TEXT></DOC>
