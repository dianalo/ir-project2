He's a lawyer, in his late 20s and, as Mr. Allen puts it, &quot;rich, or at least highly paid.&quot; And this afternoon, he's scheduled to shove off on a cruise.    &quot;I know, I know, you think cruises are only for old folks, but hey, our ship has a gym on it, it's got bars, it's got round-the-clock action,&quot; says Mr. Allen, who sails for Nassau, the Bahamas, on Carnival Cruise Lines' 481-berth Carnivale today. &quot;I've cruised before, and you can't beat it.&quot;    Cruise ships, long stuck with the image of being little more than floating shuffleboard games, are catching on with many people whose only cruising used to be done in fern bars. A recent study by Simmons Market Research Bureau shows 46% of those going on cruises are younger than 45 years old. Industry surveys show no age group with as much interest in a cruise as people between 25 and 39 years old.    This is a big reason the cruise ship business is booming. Sales should total $7 billion this year, after growing an estimated 10% a year since 1982. That has set off a wave of mergers and consolidations, the latest and most significant coming Wednesday when Carnival paid $260 million to acquire cruise ship interests of London-based Gotaas-Larsen Shipping Corp.    Companies are going for size largely to help handle the high costs of appealing to a younger crowd. Until recently, only Carnival bothered with expensive network television advertising. Lately, lines such as Sitmar Cruises and Holland America Line have started TV campaigns. &quot;Everybody's going to be advertising more, and the message is going to be: 'No longer can you only go on a cruise if you're rich, old and retired,&quot; says Nancy Loewenherz, spokeswoman for Sitmar Cruises, Los Angeles.    Carnival seems ahead of the pack in targeting younger customers. Last month, it joined with Coca-Cola and MTV, the music video station, to hold a July 4 weekend bash aboard one of its ships. The party was broadcast on MTV, and one cruiser won a small, private Caribbean island.    Cruise operators are trying to cash in on other trends-of-the-day. Numerous lines offer &quot;spa cruises&quot; -- basically, floating fitness sessions. Some seem to cover all modern ills: Costa Cruise Lines recently put one together featuring seminars on &quot;lifestyle changes,&quot; &quot;substance abuse&quot; and diet. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines offers a &quot;shipshape program,&quot; featuring lectures on diet and stress reduction.    The scramble to appeal to the trendy set has led operators to steam off for ever more exotic climes. &quot;It's appealing to the younger affluent people of today who want less regimentation and more adventure in life,&quot; says Ron Kurtz, senior vice president of Windstar Sail Cruises, Miami. Windstar recently began sailing to places such as French Polynesia and St. Tropez.    Not surprisingly, the emphasis on youth has caused grumbling in a few corners. Industry executives say some cruises out of Miami have been marred by rowdy, late-night revelry that has soured some older passengers. &quot;It's not a common problem, but it's something we have to stay on top of,&quot; says a cruise line official.    For larger companies, the drive for new customers carries a touch of urgency. Carnival, for example, has three costly new ships on order that will increase capacity 75% by the early 1990s. &quot;We're trying to appeal to all segments of the marketplace, not just young people,&quot; says Mickey Arison, Carnival's president. &quot;We have been trying to get away (from the image of cruises being only for old people) for years, and we've done it successfully.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
