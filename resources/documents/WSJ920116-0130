The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade panel wasformed in March to study a German government plan thatprotected Deutsche Airbus, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG, againstexchange-rate fluctuations. The U.S. claimed that in 1990alone those subsidies amounted to more than 390 million marks($244.4 million), or about $2.5 million for each Airbus jetdelivered that year.</LP><TEXT>   The ruling, while a plus for Washington, isn't the bigvictory that the U.S. has been looking for on the issue ofAirbus funding. U.S. officials are more concerned with thegovernment aid given to Airbus member companies for thedevelopment of new aircraft -- an amount one U.S. studyplaced at $13.5 billion over the course of the consortium's20-year history.   Last month, the EC countered that complaint by releasing astudy claiming that the U.S. civil aviation industry hasbenefited from up to $22 billion in indirect subsidies fromthe U.S. government. Also last month, the consortiumannounced plans to pay back by 1996 more than $4 billion tothe four European governments that gave launch aid.   Nonetheless, the issue continues to be the focus of aseparate dispute under the GATT framework. In September, theU.S. and the EC unsuccessfully concluded talks held beforethe GATT conciliation committee on the subject of launch aid.The U.S. now can request the formation of a panel similar tothe one studying the exchange-rate case to resolve thelaunch-aid issue, but informal talks between the two sidesare continuing.   Although the exchange-rate case is considered separatefrom the broader talks on government aid, its outcome islikely to affect the handling of the launch-aid dispute. ECofficials were upset that the panel was set up under thesubsidies code rather than the GATT's more liberal civilaircraft code, and even before news of the ruling had vowednot to let the Airbus aid dispute fall under the same rules.   The exchange-rate ruling likely will be made formal at thenext meeting of the GATT subsidy code committee in the comingthree to four weeks. Although the panel's decision could beblocked if the EC and Germany refuse to go along with theruling-panel decisions require a consensus of GATT's membersto take effectthat prospect is considered unlikely.   Officials from both the U.S. Trade Representative's officeand the European Community Commission declined to comment onwhether they received any report from the panel, but a personfamiliar with the proceedings said the two sides have beenadvised of the panel's intentions.   &quot;We haven't been informed of it yet,&quot; an Airbusspokeswoman said. &quot;But this has always been considered aGerman case and not an Airbus case.&quot;   Officials from Deutsche Airbus couldn't be reached forcomment.   In addition to Deutsche Airbus, the consortium's partnersare British Aerospace PLC, Aerospatiale S.A. of France andConstrucciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.   Airbus's growing market share has set off alarm bellsthroughout the U.S. aircraft industry, which has dominatedthe lucrative civil aviation market. The consortium hasacquired about 30% of the market for large aircraft, much ofthat gained at the expense of McDonnell Douglas Corp. BoeingCo., however, continues to have more than 50% of the market.</TEXT></DOC>
