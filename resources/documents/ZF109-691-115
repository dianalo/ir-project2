(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Ben MyersandM;Early users of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 3.0 may find its built-in printingcapabilities to be rather meager.andP;  Although it supports 167 printers, Windowsprovides only a starter set of standard printer fonts that leaves thepotential of any printer -- laser printer or dot-matrix -- largely untapped.andM;Printing under-Windows 3.0 is-also slow because Windows rasterizes imagesrather than using built-in fonts or downloading soft fonts to a printer.andM;For either a laser or dot-matrix printer, the rasterizing process convertsall print data to a graphical bit map, then sends the graphical data, araster (one horizontal row of dots) at a time, to the printer.andM;Rasterized bit maps print much more slowly than plain text characters.andO;Printer fonts, whether in cartridge format on the printer or downloadablesoft fonts on the PC, offer a kind of shorthand to speed printing.andM;Windows applications without printing software assistance do not offeron-screen WYSIWYG presentation, leading to time-consuming trial and error inprinting documents and charts.andM;In contrast with the Windows environment, software developers in theMacintosh environment have had an easier time providing printer and displayfont support.andP;  In the Mac environment, PostScript is THE standard forprinting, and Display PostScript matches the printed word with reasonableon-screen facsimile.andM;In the Macintosh world, printing sophisticated documents with typefaceschosen from a broad range requires a Macintosh, a PostScript printer, thebuilt-in Apple Macintosh operating system and a document-preparation package.andO;WYSIWYG presentation prevails for all Macintosh software.andM;In the PC universe, however, a PC, a printer, DOS, Windows anddocument-preparation software do not make a complete package.andP;  Just a fewbasic fonts and font sizes can be printed: Courier, Times and Helvetica, intypewriterlike sizes.andP;  The scalable Roman, modern and script fonts fall shortof document-production quality and quantity.andM;Microsoft has recognized that print and display fonts are not the strongsuits of Windows and released a specification for TrueType integratedfont-management software.andP;  Although Microsoft has not confirmed a productrelease date, industry analysts predict that Windows 3.1 with TrueType willbecome available in mid-1991.andP;  (See related story, Page 115).andM;Opportunities for third-party software houses abound, and there are manyutilities, primarily of the Windows add-in flavor, to assist in all aspectsof document preparation.andP;  With the addition of third-party programs, Windowscan rival the Macintosh printing environment.andM;A Windows utility can help printing in several ways.andP;  WYSIWYG or near-WYSIWYGpresentation of typefaces on-screen makes it easy to visualize what a printedpage looks like, a fundamental concept of graphical user interfaces.andO;Additional typefaces and type sizes, chosen and used carefully, relieve theboredom of oft-used Times Roman and Helvetica, and improve overall documentpresentation.andM;Speeding up printing by sending less data to the printer adds to personalproductivity.andP;  Software that transparently replaces rasterized print imagesthrough judicious use of soft fonts reduces the time taken to print to alaser printer.andM;A basic set of Times Roman and Helvetica soft fonts for a Hewlett-Packard Co.andO;(HP) LaserJet printer occupies more than 5M bytes of disk space, and othertypefaces eat up even more hard-disk space.andM;There are two methods to reduce the disk space used by soft fonts.andP;  Standardlaser-printer soft fonts can be compressed to about one-fifth theiruncompressed form to save disk space, then decompressed just beforedownloading to the printer.andM;A more elegant approach uses scalable fonts with one set of font data foreach typeface.andP;  The font data is expanded to the proper point size during thedownloading process.andP;  One example is Adobe Type Manager (ATM) from AdobeSystems Inc., in Mountain View, Calif., which adds impressive flexibility inchoosing and managing Windows typefaces, both on-screen and on the printedpage for all Windows-supported printers.andM;ATM provides 12 typefaces from the Times Roman, Helvetica and Courierfamilies, and a Symbol typeface to represent Greek letters and mathematicalsymbols.andM;The optional Adobe Plus Pack rounds out the 35 basic typefaces that come withPostScript printers, adding Zapf Chancery for script and Zapf Dingbats forspecial symbols, as well as several eye-pleasing serif and sans-serifalternatives to Times Roman and Helvetica.andP;  Together, ATM and Plus Packprovide an exact match for the 35 typefaces resident in most PostScriptprinters.andM;When printing, ATM generates and scales fonts from its font outlines.andP;  Forlaser printers, it also downloads fonts to reduce printing time.andM;ATM also will accept PostScript Type 1 font outlines from any publisher thatmeets the Adobe's Type 1 specification, opening up additional possibilities.andO;To date, Image Club Graphics Inc. of Calgary, Alberta, offers Type 1 (Adobe'sdefinition of PostScript fonts) outlines that are compatible with ATM.andO;Hundreds of Image Club typefaces cover a broad range of print suitable forpresentations, text and decorative use.andP;  Other publishers of PostScripttypefaces are also expected to have products compatible with Windows 3.0 ATMsoon.andM;Bitstream Facelift from Bitstream Inc., of Cambridge, Mass., is a secondpretender to the font crown abdicated by Microsoft.andP;  Facelift accepts eithersoft-font outlines or PostScript Type 1 typefaces published by Bitstreamitself, and works with all Windows printers.andM;Though there is only one supplier of fonts for Facelift, the Bitstreamcollection is vast.andP;  Presentation of typefaces on-screen is comparable toATM, as close as one can get to WYSIWYG.andP;  The Facelift package provides Dutchand Swiss fonts, the Bitstream equivalents of Times Roman and Helvetica, plusthree script faces, an ornamental face and a monospace version of Helveticauseful for lining up tables of numbers in neat rows and columns.andP;  TheBitstream Companion Typefaces package adds 24 more faces.andM;SuperPrint from Zenographics of Irvine, Calif., provides an assist forprinters in the HP family -- LaserJet, PaintJet or DeskJet.andP;  The SuperPrintprint manager accepts fonts from several publishers, clearly illustrated bythe set of 24 fonts provided with it: Charter from Bitstream Fontware,several of The Company's Nimbus Q fonts and Futura from Agfa CompugraphicDivision's Intellifonts.andP;  In addition, it accepts Adobe Type 1 PostScriptfonts.andP;  As with other Windows print managers, SuperPrint provides WYSIWYGscreen presentation.andM;Recently, MicroLogic Software Inc. of Emeryville, Calif., updated itsMoreFonts package to generate font information for Windows 3.0.andP;  (See PCWeek, Nov.andP;  19, Page 42.) For standard printing fare, Geneva, Tiempo andFinancial are the MoreFonts versions of Helvetica, Times Roman and LetterGothic.andM;Special EffectsandM;MoreFonts adds a dimension to fonts, enabling users to incorporate specialeffects such as patterns, outlines, shadows and backgrounds.andP;  It also createsfonts on the fly from scalable font data and supports the HP family ofprinters as well as dot-matrix printers.andM;Some non-Windows packages provide an assist to Windows, too.andP;  FontSpace,published by Isogon Corp. of New York, compresses soft fonts stored on harddisk and intervenes via a terminate-and-stay-resident program to decompressthe fonts while donwloading them to a laser printer.andM;FontSpace serves both Windows and non-Windows applications equally well whenbit-mapped fonts must be used.andP;  Becuase it reads fonts from hard disk incompressed format, FontSpace also reduces the time to download fonts to aprinter, a lengthy process for large point sizes.andM;----------Ben Myers is the owner of Spirit of Performance, a Harvard, Mass., consultingfirm specializing in benchmarking.andM;By Ben MyersandM;In any software environment, printers shared among several users present aset of logistic issues: Where is the printer?; Who is using it?; How longwill it be used?; How many others are waiting for printing?; What printersare available to meet various requirements?andM;Using a Windows 3.0 application to print to a network printer can beconfusing.andP;  At least one new software package, Windows Workstation fromAutomated Design Systems of Atlanta, provides some answers to networkedprinter handling with Windows 3.0.andM;Versions of Windows Workstation are currently available for Novell NetWareand OS/2 LAN Manager.andP;  Providing other capabilities for users on a network,Windows Workstation features Print Manager and Print Manager Editor.andM;The Print Manager permits viewing of all available printers, both networkedand personal.andP;  Information viewed includes the description (location inbuilding) and type of each printer accessible to a user.andP;  Print Manager hasmenus to select a default printer, override the default with another printerand view data about jobs queued for a given printer.andM;With Print Manager, a user can delete a job from a print queue and add newjobs to a queue.andP;  A person with administrative rights can also control thejobs of others in any of the print queues.andM;A network administrator uses the Print Manager Editor to maintain informationabout each printer available on the network, and to set up Windows printerdrivers.andM;Whether on the network or dedicated to a single PC, a printer that uses a DOSdevice driver requires some special treatment under Windows.andP;  High-resolutionand early PostScript are two kinds of printers in this category.andM;Under DOS, software can access a printer that has a device driver only by itsdevice name.andP;  By contrast, under Windows, the spooler is much faster, writingdirectly to the hardware registers used to access a device.andP;  But the spoolermust write directly to a specific hardware register through the serial orparallel ports.andP;  Microsoft, like other vendors, has sacrificed devicetransparency for speed.andM;With Windows, the solution is simple: Disable the Windows spooler whenprinting to a non-standard printer.andP;  Although the printer will workcorrectly, the consequences are that one must wait for printing to finishbefore continuing with other work.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
