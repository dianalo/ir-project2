The U.S. Supreme Court rules the federal government may test workers in sensitive or safety-related jobs. But a New Jersey court decides a private employee can sue for wrongful discharge if fired merely because of a random drug test, says Howard Lavin of Stroock andamp; Stroock andamp; Lavan, a New York law firm. A California court awards $480,000 to an office worker fired after refusing such a test, says David Bacon of Adams, Duque andamp; Hazeltine, Los Angeles. Both decisions are being appealed.    Alaska's supreme court, though, rejects a challenge to an airline's random drug tests, Mr. Bacon says. And Mr. Lavin notes a federal court in New York says a worker who tests positive can't claim he is a handicapped worker whose job is protected unless he has sought treatment. A New York court, however, rules that a worker testing positive is perceived to be disabled and can't be fired or refused work unless the company demonstrates he can't do the job.    A dozen states and cities have regulated testing, Mr. Lavin says. Utah limits employer exposure to suits.    CRY FOR HELP] Lifeguards are in short supply at some beaches and pools.    Swimming areas around metropolitan Boston are shy 100 guards this summer, forcing curtailed protection at some outlying beaches. A new state regulation requires candidates to pass a $90 course, and some students can't afford the fee. The Red Cross lifeguard course has been increased to 27 hours from 21, says Jim Kelsea, aquatics director in Corpus Christi, Texas. &quot;Students find it hard to work in the time,&quot; he says. Inner-city pools are especially hard to staff. &quot;We try to train kids who have grown up at the pool so everybody knows them,&quot; says Lonnie Walker, a Dallas parks official. But there's no problem at Oak Hills Country Club in San Antonio. Nor at Los Angeles County beaches, where the base pay is $12.06 an hour. &quot;We're more aquatic minded out here,&quot; an official explains.    SAFETY EMPHASIS grows -- in part under prodding -- at major employers.    Mounting accident claims and tightened federal regulation, plus the recognition that good safety is good business, prompt companies to devote more attention and money to worker safety. At LTV Corp.'s aircraft products division, spending jumps 25% this year, to $2.6 million, in large measure because of a 27% rise in workers' compensation payments, to $6.5 million last year. Allen Group's safety-related spending has soared 50% over five years.    Du Pont Co. says it re-emphasizes safety after a lapse a couple of years back, when the stress was on productivity and quality. &quot;We erroneously thought we would continue to do well without day-to-day attention,&quot; Bruce Karrh, a vice president, says. Now the accident rate is half of what it was in early 1987. Scott Paper Co. views a safe workplace as one precondition of being a &quot;pre-eminent company,&quot; its goal.    &quot;People ought to come to work and go home in the same condition,&quot; Coleman Co. says.    THE IRS signals it's OK to use tax-deductible Section 401(h) arrangements to prefund retiree health costs even when a company's pension fund is fully funded. Fred Rumack of Buck Consultants says the IRS tells employers they can get the necessary blessing from local IRS offices.    OVER 10 MILLION workers by year end will own a stake in their companies through employee stock ownership plans or similar stock bonus plans, the National Center for Employee Ownership estimates. Some 865,000 employees were added last year.    LEFT-HANDED MEN are one-third more likely to have accidents on the job than right-handers, finds Stanley Coren, a University of British Columbia psychologist. A principal suspect: the right-handed bias of the equipment they use.    POOR WORKER SKILLS force one in three banks to offer basic training in reading, writing and arithmetic, the American Bankers Association says. The programs cost the industry $32 million a year.    STOCK FOR DIRECTORS: As more firms use incentive, questions are raised.    Some 40% of the nation's 100 largest companies use stock or stock options to lure and hold on to outside directors, consultant Towers Perrin says. That's up from 7% in 1985. Consultant Sibson andamp; Co. finds stock packages at 13% of 275 companies studied, up from 3% in 1983. In most cases, the stock is thrown in as an added incentive atop annual cash retainers that can run to $25,000 and meeting fees of as much as $1,000.    Owning stock &quot;encourages directors to identify far more closely with the concerns of shareholders,&quot; declares Michael Halloran of Towers Perrin. Sibson's Jude Rich agrees. But Mr. Halloran sees a potential conflict if directors share in stock plans while judging management stock-based incentive programs. And Mr. Rich argues that stock should be paid instead of cash, not as extras beyond regularly rising fees.    At some companies, stock awards can add as much as 40% to a director's total compensation.    THE CHECKOFF: Prof. Henry Higgins would be shocked. A New York company, Communispond Inc., is opening an office in London to teach the English how to speak. . . . Thank goodness it's Tuesday. There never is a good day to fire anybody, human-resource managers say, but if they've got to make a choice, most pick Friday, with Monday second, Adia Personnel Services finds. </TEXT></DOC>
