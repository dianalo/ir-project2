 -- From Sept. 30 to Oct. 3 in the Santa Clara Convention Center(Santa Clara, Calif.), workshops, conferences, user group meetings, productrollouts, and vendor exhibitions will be just a few of the events featured atthe AIX Expo '91/RS/6000 Solutions Conference, of which MIDRANGE Systems is asponsor.andM;Expo attendees can look forward to meeting vendors eager to talk about thefeatures that have made the RS/6000 so popular as well as AIX's flexibleoperating system.andP;  Dickens Data (Norcross, GA.) is one such vendor.andP;  &quot;We areoffering peripherals with complete function combined with our ambition toeducate attendees about the RS/6000 with solutions they didn't know about,&quot;says Gordon Dickens, president.andP;  &quot;We want to help users find the software orhardware product that meets their goals.&quot;andM;For some vendors, this show gives them a chance to show off new products.andP;  Asampling of these vendors include ACS/Premenos (Concord, Calif.), Cambex(Waltham, Mass.), Ki Research (Hanover, Md.), and Universal Software (NewportBeach, Calif.).andM;ACS/Premenos is entering the UNIX marketplace with a new product.andP;  EDI/e is a4GL, EDI translation tool for the RS/6000.andP;  The company is hoping to meet alot of AIX users with RS/6000s needing EDI function.andM;Steve Botts, director of sales at ACS/Premenos, is looking to the show as alearning experience.andP;  &quot;We're going to see what this marketplace is like, whatother vendors are offering in hardware and software, and what's hot.&quot;andP;  Bottsnotes, however, that his company is in this market to stay.andP;  &quot;We arecommitted to open systems and development of our RS/6000 product will furtherthis commitment.&quot;andM;Barbara Robidoux, product marketing manager at Cambex, says the company isplanning to exhibit its newly released mirror disk subsystem for the RS/6000,which features two 3.5-inch disk drives in a single enclosure.andP;  Robidoux addsthat the product takes advantage of AIX's inherent disk mirroringcapabilities, and by using a script, makes it easier for users to utilizethese functions.andM;Cambex also with be exhibiting its popular Certi-Stream software.andP;  Robidouxnotes that the product was announced earlier this year and will be ready toship by show time.andP;  Robidoux syas customer interest in the software has beenhigh.andM;Ki Research plans to exhibit its new product, VMS-to-RS/6000 migrationsoftware.andP;  Jim Corrigan, managing partner at Ki Research, considers hiscompany's product better than DEC's offering.andP;  &quot;We think it is a strongentry,&quot; he says.andP;  KiNET ULTRIX is for companies that require a single userand program interface for DECnet and LAT across many platforms.andP;  The kiNETproduct allows users to use VMS-like command syntax for a more VMS-likeproduct.andP;  ULTRIX has no such VMS-like interface for its DECnet product.andM;Universal Software is planning a migration lab at the show where it will beusing its Open RS/36 product to port System/36 software to the RS/6000.andP;  AlSaavedra, VP at Universal Software, comments, &quot;We will be migrating software,quarter-inch tape, or 8-inch diskettes.andP;  Users will be able to see theirsoftware running on the RS/6000.&quot;andP;  Also, Universal Software will be featuringLoad and Go, a facility that backs up S/36 files and libraries and loads themon an RS/6000, using the same S/36 commands.andM;&quot;We offer the easiest migration without having to recompile code.andP;  We want toattract the smaller companies at the show, the mom or pop shops that haveS/36s and want to move but have no idea where to go.andP;  This is theiropportunity,&quot; concludes Saavedra.andM;The vendors expressed enthusiams over the show, feelings due to the successof the RS/6000.andP;  Dickens attributes his positive outlook of the show to thegood distribution of the RS/6000 in the last year, accompanied by importantplayers in the market embracing the machine.andP;  &quot;The RS/6000 is the mostsuccessful product for IBM in the last three years.&quot;andM;Another factor is the RS/6000's popularity in the commercial marketplace.andO;Saavedra says, &quot;The RS/6000 is being successfully positioned as a commercialmachine.&quot;andP;  Adds Botts, &quot;Before, UNIX was relegated to technical applications,now it is moving into business applications.andP;  The future for UNIX is brightfor business applications.andM;Although Corrigon notes the lack of software vendors committed to exhibiting,he comments, &quot;It's software that makes the RS/6000 run so well.andP;  There havebeen many ports to the RS/6000 in a little amount of time and vendors arent'sstopping there.&quot;andM;Vendors like Cambex and Dickens Data are looking forward to this show foradditional reasons.andP;  These companies normally look for AIX users among themany UNIX users at shows such as Uniforum or UNIX Expo.andP;  &quot;Usually, we wouldhave to shout a little louder to get the AIX users over to us,&quot; saysRobidoux, &quot;but this show is 100 percent AIX.&quot;andM;Dickens also says he is optimistic about this expo because it isAIX-specific.andP;  After attending other UNIX shows and looking for the AIX usersin the masses, Dickens comments, &quot;This is the first show where we won't haveto seek out the AIX users.&quot;andM;Another key factor in this show's projected success is that it is endorsed byIBM.andP;  The RS/6000 Solutions Conference schedule is heavy with IBMrepresentatives giving presentations, which include management seminars,technical seminars, general sessions, enterprise computing solutions,business application solutions, technical computing solutions, techniques andtools, technical workshops, solution workshops (GIS and CASE), hardwareworkshops, and application workshoos.andM;At the Ask IBM: Open Systems Forrum, members of IBM will be on hand to answerquestions.andP;  Fielding attendee questions will be Phil Hester, director ofengineering center systems development, Advanced Workstations division;Thomas Jarosh, VP of technical computing systems, Application Solutionsdivision; Jeff Mason, director of advanced workstations and AIX systems,United States; and Donna Van Fleet, director of personal systems programmingin Austin, Personal Systems.andM;Lou Finnegan, VP at Cambex, will be presenting a hardware workshop calledHigh-Capacity Storage for the RS/6000.andP;  Also scheduled to give presentationsamong the exhibiting vendors include Corrigan, who will be giving theVMS-to-RS/6000 Migration Workshop at a technical workshop, and Saavedra, whowill be presenting S/3X-to-RS/6000 Migration Considerations.andM;It is rumored that IBM will be making some relevant announcements a couple ofweeks before the show or at the show itself.andP;  Unfortunately, confirmation ofany announcements could not be made by press time.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
