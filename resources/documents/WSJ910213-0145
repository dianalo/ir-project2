That is how Beijing intellectuals and foreign diplomatsare interpreting the 13-year jail terms that were handed outyesterday to longtime political activists Wang Juntao andChen Ziming.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Wang, 33 years old, and Mr. Chen, 38, were convictedafter trials that placed the blame for the 1989 TiananmenSquare demonstrations primarily on their shoulders. Theofficial charges were &quot;conspiracy to overthrow thegovernment&quot; and &quot;spreading counterrevolutionary propogandaand agitation.&quot; The accusations stem from the two men'ssuccessful enterprises and their ability to pour millions ofdollars of profits into the creation of a politicalorganization.   The jail terms were the harshest announced so far. Thelongest previous sentence was seven years given to RenWanding, an accountant and dissident.   Most student leaders have been treated more leniently.Wang Dan, for example, the most prominent student leader notto escape from China, received a four-year jail term. Thatmoderate treatment is believed to be aimed at muting criticsin the West and mollifying intellectuals at home.   But analysts say that Messrs. Wang and Chen were excludedfrom lenient treatment because they threatened the monopolyof power held by the elderly Communist old guard who regainedcontrol in China following the bloody supression of thedemonstrations in June 1989.   Messrs. Wang and Chen aren't household names in the West.But a look at how they quietly built the beginnings of anindependent political party -- replete with a publishinghouse, a public opinion polling service, a computerdata-processing center and a school that generated millionsof dollars in income -- explains why China's leadership hasdecided to lock them away for so long, analysts say.   &quot;These two represent a new revolutionary class in China,and that is why the regime is so worried about them,&quot; saysMerle Goldman, a Boston University professor of Chinesehistory. &quot;They are a real pair of political operators: WangJuntao has real charisma, and Chen Ziming has the ability toearn money.&quot;   The U.S.-based human rights group Asia Watch published areport in January entitled &quot;Rough Justice in Beijing.&quot; Basedon interviews with dissidents who escaped from China, itprovides a detailed examination of Messrs. Wang and Chen andthe political organization they founded in 1986, the Socialand Economic Sciences Research Institute.   What emerges from that report and from independentinterviews with people familiar with the pair is a picture oftwo savvy, single-minded political activists who employedChina's economic reforms and relaxed political climate tobuild an organization aimed at ultimately bringing democracyto China.   &quot;Anything these guys did would be regarded in any Westerncountry as legitimate,&quot; says Robin Munro, a Hong Kong-basedAsia Watch researcher who wrote the report. &quot;But in China,the system is inflexible, and they were trying to promotechange in an organic way.&quot;   Analysts say the criminal verdicts provide a good gauge ofthe leadership's fears. Students who could be intimidatedinto apologizing and intellectuals who had a history ofworking within the system were considered a controllableannoyance and treated leniently.   However, the fear of a Solidarity-style labor movementdictated that dissident workers -- whose arrests, trials andsentences haven't been announced -- be treated severely. Andfinally, Messrs. Wang and Chen, who mixed free-marketearnings with independent politics, had to be put out ofcommission for a long time.</TEXT></DOC>
