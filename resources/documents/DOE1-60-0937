Additionally, the potential of reducing the generation of solidwaste at source is reviewed. When possible, British Columbia serves asa frame of reference. Mixed waste processing, while still in the developmentalstages as a technology, is found to be capable of eventually handlinghigh volumes solide waste. Negative features include high capital cost,limited potential for material reclamation, and emphasis on disposalrather than recovery. Source separation recycling, can divert at bestonly a fraction of municipal wastes. Recycling does recover materialof high quality, and industrial processes utilizing recovered materialsexperience significant purchased energy savings and reduction of pollutantoutlaw. Because it directly involves the waste generator, recycling hasan education value as well. Source reduction of municipal waste is themost effective means of achieving the conserver society goal of doingmore with less. However, it is also likely to be the most difficult toimplement. 31 refs., 1 fig., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
