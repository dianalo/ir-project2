<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-45-0932 </DOCNO><TEXT>This bibliography contains citations concerning the design, fabrication,analysis, performance evaluation, and applications of fiber-optic couplers.Topics include optical coupling for fiber-optic transmission lines, frequencyand wavelength division multiplexing, multiwavelength coupler-decouplers,single mode and multimode couplers, and fiber-optic gyroscope applications.Various types of couplers are examined including waveguide, star, access,duplex, data bus, passive, tee, and holographic. Patented fiber-opticdevices using couplers are included. Citations concerning fiber-opticconnectors are excluded and examined in a separate bibliography. (Contains218 citations fully indexed and including a title list.)</TEXT></DOC>
