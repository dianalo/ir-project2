KROPKO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A convicted Teamsters union ``ghost'' employeetestified Tuesday that Jackie Presser set up a $110,000 embezzlementscheme to pay people who did no work for the union.   Federal prosecutors have said Presser, who at the time of hisdeath July 9 faced embezzlement and labor racketeering charges,masterminded a scheme to issue $700,000 worth of union paychecks tosuch people, a form of embezzlement known as ghosting.   Two other Local 507 officials now are on trial in the allegedscheme.   John A. ``Jack'' Nardi Jr., a prison inmate and a federallyprotected witness, testified he received paychecks of at least $300a week from Local 507 in Cleveland from late 1971 through 1978,while never reporting for work.   Federal labor laws require union leaders to use dues from unionmembers for the benefit of those members.   Nardi, son of the late Cleveland Teamsters official John A.Nardi, last April struck a plea bargain and and entered a guiltyplea to embezzling Local 507 funds and also arranging to accept abribe from Presser to cover up the embezzlement. Sentencing wasdeferred until after the present trial.   He is in prison on a state grand theft conviction.   Presser was secretary-treasurer at Local 507 and president of theInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters from 1983 until his deathfrom cancer.   Nardi testified that his father told him in late 1971 that anarrangement had been made for him to work for Presser. Nardi saidthat in a meeting with Presser, his role was never clarified, butthat his starting pay was set at $300 a week, and his checksstarting coming every week in the mail.   Nardi said he never worked even one day for Local 507.   He said Presser and Harold Friedman, Local 507 president, signedhis checks.   John A. Nardi, who was secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 410and a reputed organized crime figure, was killed in a car bomb blastin 1977. Nardi Jr. testified that at his father's funeral, Presserreassurred him his pay would continue.   He said the paychecks stopped after 1978, when, he said, Pressertold him about concerns he had with a possible federal investigationinto the payments.   Friedman, 66, is still president of Local 507 and is one of thenation's most powerful Teamsters officials. He has been a Teamstersinternational vice president since 1983 and also is president ofTeamsters Joint Council 41 in northeast Ohio and the Ohio Conferenceof Teamsters.   He is charged with two counts of labor racketeering, two ofembezzlement of union funds and two of making false statements tothe Department of Labor.   Anthony Hughes, 52, recording secretary at Teamsters Local 507and a business agent at Bakery Workers Local 19, is charged with twocounts of labor racketeering and one count of embezzlement.   Pretrial documents indicated that Presser's defense in the``ghost employee'' allegation would have been that he was authorizedby the FBI to hire certain people onto the union's payroll in orderto preserve his secret status as an FBI informant. The so-called``ghosts'' were described as being able to provide informationlargely about organized crime activity.</TEXT></DOC>
