The Treasury's new benchmark 30-year bond, which lost a total of 2 7/8 points on Friday and Monday, or about $28.75 for each $1,000 face amount, gained 7/8 point yesterday. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, eased to 8.15% from 8.24% Monday.    Other bonds trailed the gains in Treasurys. Corporate bonds were about 1/2 point higher, while municipal bonds were unchanged to 1/4 point higher. Mortgage-backed securities rose about 1/4 point.    In the Treasury market, traders said much of the buying was triggered by perceptions that bond prices have become relatively inexpensive since the government's huge auction last week. Other investors were rushing to take positions ahead of the heavy slate of economic reports due out today.    &quot;We had an active day,&quot; said Richard M. Kelly, president of Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co. &quot;Investors and speculators can't resist the urge to buy after a sharp correction.&quot;    Today, the government will release data on July housing starts, industrial production and capacity utilization. Tomorrow, the Bureau of Economic Analysis will release the June merchandise trade report.    Economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report expect, on average, that new house construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.41 million units in July. That would be 0.7% above the June annual rate of 1.4 million units, which was up 7.0% from May. The economists who were surveyed forecast, on average, that production at U.S. factories rose 0.2% in July.    F. Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone andamp; McCarthy Research Associates Inc., a research firm based in Princeton, N.J., believes this week's economic data will add support to bond prices. The economist added, &quot;The numbers this week are going to show the economy is still on a deceleration trend, with inflation continuing to unwind.&quot;    In the mortgage market, the first public offering of time-share mortgage securities hit the Street. General Development Corp., a major developer of time-share vacation condominiums, recently made the first public offering of securitized time-share loans in a $111.6 million transaction underwritten by PaineWebber Inc. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.    There are about 17,000 loans, which have an average outstanding balance of $6,600, packaged into the securities. The issue was priced to yield about 9%, one percentage point above the rate on the three-year Treasury note at the time of pricing. The offering has a final maturity of 10 years and an estimated average life of nearly three years.    Treasury, Agency Securities    The new benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 99 18/32, compared with 98 22/32 late Monday. The new 10-year notes were quoted late at a price of 98 28/32 to yield 8.15%, compared with a price of 98 10/32 Monday when the yield was 8.23%.    Short-term interest rates were mixed. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was unchanged from Monday's auction at 8.01%, although the bond-equivalent yield slid slightly to 8.27%. The discount rate on six-month Treasury bills was 7.85%, up slightly from Monday's average auction rate of 7.83%, while the bond-equivalent yield rose slightly to 8.27% from 8.26%.    Meanwhile, the Federal Home Loan Banks sold $2.88 billion of bonds. The offering consisted of $725 million of one-year bonds priced to yield 8.55%; $1.19 billion of two-year bonds priced to yield 8.60%; $595 million of five-year bonds priced to yield 8.60%; and $375 million of 10-year bonds priced to yield 8.60%.    Corporate, Other Issues    The bonds of Integrated Resources Inc., which have languished at lows for two months, fell further yesterday.    The company's 10 3/4% senior notes due 1992 closed 8 5/8 points lower at 37 3/8, while the 10 3/4% senior notes due 1990 fell seven points to 40. Other Integrated issues closed two to more than five points lower.    The bonds tumbled on news that Integrated wouldn't be making the August interest payment on its 12 1/4% senior subordinated notes due Aug. 15, 1998, and that the company might sell some of its businesses. Integrated said if it succeeds in selling its assets, proceeds would be used to pay senior debtholders.    Integrated's bonds first plunged from highs in the 90s to the low 20s in June when the real-estate concern revealed its financial problems. Some of its issues, particularly the subordinated paper, currently trade at rock-bottom prices of about 13.    Among new issues yesterday, Israel offered $730 million of government trust certificates. The certificates are backed mostly by the U.S government and are offered under the Foreign Military Sales Credit Program, a U.S. program that allows foreign governments to repay military loans.    The proceeds will be used to refinance loans that the U.S. Department of Defense extended to Israel for acquisition of U.S.-made arms.    Foreign Bonds    Merrill Lynch International andamp; Co.'s government securities subsidiary said it would no longer make a market in British government bonds, known as gilts.    The report was one factor that pushed gilt prices moderately lower, but the declines were also attributed to weakness in the value of the pound.    Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 fell 9/32 to 115 23/32, to yield 9.62%, while the 11 3/4% notes due 1991 fell 2/32 to par to yield 11.69%.    In a statement, the firm cited the competitiveness of the gilts market, which has contracted this year in part because of the government's policy of using its budget surplus to repurchase gilts. Merrill Lynch said it will remain active in other areas of the British market, including Eurobonds and floating-rate notes.    In West Germany, prices of government bonds ended 0.15 to 0.20 point lower. Bonn's 6 3/4% issue due June 1999 ended 0.20 lower at 100.30 to yield 6.70%, while the 6 3/4% note due 1994 held steady at 100.10 to yield 6.73%. Among active Eurobonds, the World Bank's 6 3/4% issue due 1999 fell 0.20 point to 99.05 to yield 6.88%.    Japanese government bond prices rebounded on speculation that a supply shortage in the secondary market could help drive prices higher. Japan's benchmark No. 111 4.6% issue due 1998 closed at a price of 97.04 to yield 5.085%.    Municipals    Municipal bonds were unchanged to 1/4 point higher late yesterday, but dealings were subdued by high dealer inventories, sluggish investor demand for secondary market paper and a supply overhang.    The updraft in rates on Monday has forced underwriters to postpone some of the major bond offerings that had been tentatively scheduled for pricing this week, but the potential for future heavy issuance is keeping a lid on prices, traders said.    Underwriters say it's now unlikely that the two largest municipal issues that were pricing candidates will hit the market this week. That adds $650 million of revenue bonds from the Southern California Public Power Authority and $640 million of gas and electric revenue refunding bonds from San Antonio, Texas, to the supply overhang.    It's also doubtful that $150 million to $250 million of revenue bonds from the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority of New York in the wings will be priced this week, according to lead underwriter Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.    All three of the sales had been eagerly awaited by market participants as a gauge of investor interest.    New issuance was modest yesterday.    Underwriters led by San Francisco-based Grigsby Brandford Powell Inc. introduced a $71.4 million equipment revenue bond issue from the Philadelphia Municipal Authority.    Mortgage-Backed Securities    Mortgage securities rose 8/32 to 9/32.    Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for September delivery finished at 97 3/32, up 9/32. The yield was 9.54% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the 10-year Treasury note widened 0.03 percentage point to 1.39.    In the derivative market, activity in the real estate mortgage investment conduit sector has slowed from the record pace of the past two weeks as underwriters seek to lighten their heavy inventories. No new issues have been priced so far this week. </TEXT></DOC>
