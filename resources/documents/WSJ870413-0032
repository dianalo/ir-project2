StevensStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDAMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   The U.S. and its major economic allies are bracing for a market onslaught on the dollar early this week that could determine the fate of the Feb. 22 currency-stabilization accord they renewed Wednesday.    In response to repeated attacks on the dollar Thursday and Friday, finance ministers of seven major industrial nations warned in separate statements that they intended to defend their currency pact vigorously if such action continues. On both days, central banks intervened heavily to help stem the dollar's decline.    Foreign exchange traders, meanwhile, indicated that the selling pressure will continue.    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, in a speech Friday to the Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund, said, &quot;The U.S. and the six major industrial countries are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these agreements.&quot; The other nations are West Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.    The seven, Mr. Baker said, are committed to carrying out policy changes promised at their meetings last week and to intervening as needed to keep exchange rates near current levels.    At the same time, U.S. and foreign officials say they expect heavy pressure in the foreign exchange market this week to continue to push down the dollar's value, particularly against the Japanese yen.    Although the officials reinforced last week's accord with a pledge by Japan to propose a new economic stimulus package, the market apparently isn't convinced that Tokyo will carry out the promise. As a result, the accord appears fragile.    Many currency traders, in fact, insist that the Reagan administration still wants a weaker dollar -- and they say it will probably get its wish in the days ahead.    Friday's intervention in support of the dollar by five central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, failed to change the market's bearish sentiment on the dollar, as did the reaffirmation of the February Paris accord to stabilize exchange rates.    In the final two trading days of last week, the dollar lost 2.2% of its value against the yen. As for its future course, Joseph F. Teel, a foreign exchange trader at Fidelity Bank, Philadelphia, said, &quot;At one time I thought we were near the bottom, but we could be near the middle.&quot;    There are economic reasons for this view -- chiefly the U.S. trade and budget deficits -- but the major factor is political. Mr. Baker, who once avidly talked the dollar down but recently has abandoned that approach, hasn't convinced traders of his change of heart.    Last week, Mr. Baker said the dollar's decline had been &quot;orderly&quot; since September 1985, when he led a broad attack on the currency's high value; it has fallen 40% against the yen since then.    His comment was &quot;a green light for the market to continue selling the dollar,&quot; Alan Rose, senior vice president and head of foreign exchange at First Interstate Bank of California in Los Angeles, said. Mr. Baker &quot;has never said anything bullish&quot; for the dollar, Mr. Rose said.    Traders contend that his main objective is to trim the U.S. trade deficit, and to pressure the U.S.'s economic allies to help by adopting new policies. They see the dollar's fall as a spur to the allies to stimulate domestic consumption and open their markets to U.S. exports.    Nevertheless, U.S. and foreign officials indicated that they believe the market's onslaught will be temporary and that they are determined to try to keep the dollar from falling much farther.    &quot;We see a mixed feeling in the market,&quot; West Germany Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said Friday. &quot;There's a good chance that the market will settle at current levels.&quot;    Several finance ministers indicated that they expect the dollar to be bolstered in coming weeks by changes in relative interest-rate levels in the U.S., West Germany and Japan. They said further declines in interest rates abroad probably will be complemented by a slight rise in U.S. rates. They said they expect these changes to occur in the credit markets of each country, not necessarily by Federal Reserve Board or other central bank action.    They also indicated they are puzzled about why traders are driving down the dollar against the yen. One European finance minister said the group regarded the yen's continued rise as a &quot;special problem,&quot; meaning that it didn't appear justified by economic fundamentals.    In addition, the ministers expressed disappointment that traders apparently don't expect Japan to deliver on its promise to push through a major economic stimulus package by early May. They all appeared to believe that Japanese officials are convinced they must act soon to spur demand at home, both for the sake of Japan's domestic economy and to help reduce its trade surplus.    The U.S.'s $170 billion trade deficit and the correspondingly large trade surpluses in West Germany and Japan have been a major factor in the dollar's slide.    Japanese analysts in Washington tend to support that judgment. Several indicated that, if anything, the yen's continuing rise is likely to place more pressure on Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and the country's Diet, or Parliament, to approve the stimulus package quickly. The prime minister and Diet now are mired in a battle over Mr. Nakasone's earlier budget and tax proposals.    In Tokyo, some cabinet officers have said Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa may have been too timid in crafting the stimulus plan, which informally has been estimated at $34.5 billion. Trade Minister Hajime Tamura, for one, complained that the proposal wasn't proving sufficient to stop the yen's rise.    Separately, the Interim Committee, the policy making body of the 151-country International Monetary Fund, issued a communique warning that global trade imbalances have become &quot;unsustainably large.&quot; It called on the U.S. to trim its budget deficit more quickly and on West Germany to stimulate its economy.    The panel, whose session Friday ended a week-long meeting of IMF governors, also lambasted commercial banks for not stepping up lending to developing countries as promised. And it endorsed a suggestion by Mr. Baker that the banks explore debt-equity swaps and other new financing mechanisms.    It also endorsed a proposal being explored by the Paris Club, an organization of industrial countries that have made loans to poorer nations, on allowing some African countries more time to repay loans and possibly to reduce interest rates. The U.S. endorsed the Paris Club study but stopped short of backing any specific proposals.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar fell against other major currencies, posting a sharp drop against the yen. But the U.S. currency was up substantially from its intraday lows in late New York trading because of central bank action as well as position-squaring ahead of the weekend and tomorrow's release of U.S. trade data for February.    For the second consecutive day, the dollar set a post-World War II low against the Japanese currency, falling to 141.60 yen in intraday dealings. The previous day's low was 143.90 yen.    Traders said central banks from the U.S., West Germany, France, Britain and the Netherlands bought dollars in New York and European markets Friday. The intervention was viewed as support for the agreement to stabilize exchange rates that was affirmed at last week's meeting of central bankers and finance ministers.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 142.85 yen, down 0.9% from 144.20 Thursday. The dollar fell 0.5% to 1.8113 West German marks from 1.8205.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery climbed 20 cents to $433 an ounce in heavy trading estimated at seven million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $432.80 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.
