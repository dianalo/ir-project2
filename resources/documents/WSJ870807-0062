The packaging company said it purchased 1.4 million shares of common, 25,350 shares of preferred stock, and warrants to buy 190,000 shares each of common and preferred. Triangle currently has 22.8 million common shares outstanding and 3.9 million preferred shares outstanding.    Triangle shares closed yesterday at $40.875, up 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    The company said the purchase is the first one made since its board authorized repurchases of up to $200 million. In authorizing the purchases, Triangle said its stock is undervalued.    CJI said it disposed of its entire investment in Triangle as part of a restructuring of its investment portfolio to avoid being deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. CJI said that as a result of the sale it realized a pretax gain of about $22 million.    CJI, which makes vending machines and other coin-operated products, is 21%-owned by Triangle. Avery, whose principal business is Uniroyal Chemical Holding Co., is also 21%-owned by Triangle. </TEXT></DOC>
