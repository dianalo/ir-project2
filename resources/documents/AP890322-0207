Over the last five years, Saudi food imports averaged nearly $5billion annually, up from $1.5 billion in 1977.   John A. Williams, the department's agricultural trade officer inJeddah, Saudi Arabia, says the growth has been fueled by ``thepresence of thousands of European and U.S. expatriates and elaborateconsumer food subsidies'' financed by Saudi Arabia's oil wealth.   ``An influx of immigrant workers in the mid-1970s dramaticallychanged Saudi consumer spending patterns,'' Williams writes in theApril issue of AgExporter magazine.   In 1987, Saudi Arabia, which has a population of about 11million, imported about 70 percent of its food needs. Tops in valuewere barley, live sheep, tobacco, milk, poultry, meat, rice, spices,canned vegetables, fruit juices, fresh vegetables, sugar and corn.   More than 10 percent of the agricultural imports are from theUnited States, making Saudi Arabia the top cash customer in theMiddle East for U.S. farm products.   Consumer subsidies are used to distribute national income,derived almost entirely from petroleum, Williams said.   In 1987, oil comprised 92 percent of Saudi Arabia's total exportsof $25 billion. Total imports were put at $19 billion, including$4.5 billion worth of agricultural products. The U.S. share wasabout $486 million.</TEXT></DOC>
