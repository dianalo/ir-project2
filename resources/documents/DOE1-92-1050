The results from the activated lymphocyte profilesshowed deviations from the norm as follows: three welders had elevatedhelper/suppressor (H/S) ratios; all four had elevated percentages ofTal positive cells; two had decreases in B cells; and one had low totalwhite cell and lymphocyte counts. In contrast, the percentage and absolutenumbers of ILS receptor cells were normal in the four subjects. T cellblastogenesis to PHA, Con A and PWM resulted in the following: T-cellsfrom one subject responded normally; in another, a high response (212%of controls) to PHA occurred with normal mitogenesis to Con A and PWM.In the remaining two welders, the T cells responded abnormally low (50to 75% of controls) to the three mitogens. In conclusion, the existenceof IgG antibodies to HDI-SA and F-SA, the altered activated immune profiles,the elevated Tal cells, and the abnormal blastogenesis are interpretedas being linked with the episode of HDI and F exposure and the subsequentflu-like illness of the four welders.</TEXT></DOC>
