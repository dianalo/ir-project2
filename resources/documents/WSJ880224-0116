Moore (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> BTI FGRP </CO><IN> TNM INS </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Shareholders of B.A.T Industries PLC likely will remove the last obstacle to a higher bid for Farmers Group Inc. today, but some analysts think the U.S. insurer may elude the patient courtship.    Last month, the big British tobacco, retailing and financial-services concern proposed a $4.2 billion friendly takeover of Los Angeles-based Farmers Group. Farmers rejected the unsolicited offer and the two sides began preparing for a long and possibly hostile struggle.    Analysts expected B.A.T would intensify its quest for Farmers following today's special meeting here. B.A.T shareholders are virtually certain to give directors a free hand to proceed with their pursuit of Farmers. And despite the lack of visible progress in recent weeks, analysts had &quot;hoped the past month was spent in behind-the-scenes haggling (with Farmers) about a higher price,&quot; said Mark Duffy, an insurance analyst at London securities firm, S.G. Warburg andamp; Co.    Instead, further delay seems in store. On Monday, Farmers disclosed that at its May 20 annual meeting, B.A.T plans to propose a resolution forcing the insurer to enter into &quot;good faith&quot; negotiations about the pending offer. The surprise move could forestall any hostile action against Farmers for several months.    But a further delay also increases doubts about whether B.A.T will succeed, suggested Christopher Alexander, an insurance analyst at the London unit of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Farmers gains time to strengthen its defenses and search for a white knight, Mr. Alexander noted. &quot;It looks as if Farmers slowly but surely is slipping away from B.A.T,&quot; he added.    Analysts blamed prospects of further delay for the fall in Farmers shares, which slid $1.50 to close yesterday at $58.75 a share in national over-the-counter trading. B.A.T shares fell a penny to 430 pence ($7.57) in late trading on London's Stock Exchange Tuesday.    B.A.T officials insist it always expected the bid for Farmers to advance slowly and dispute claims that it has squandered momentum. &quot;Not a great deal is happening, but we are moving quite steadily, point by point,&quot; a B.A.T spokesman said yesterday. He added that the plan to take B.A.T's case directly to Farmers shareholders in May &quot;doesn't pre-empt anything.&quot; He declined to discuss future tactics.    Many analysts still believe B.A.T eventually will increase its $60-a-share bid to $65 to $70 a share. Because it lacks expertise in the U.S. insurance or financial-services sectors, analysts say B.A.T wants to retain Farmer's current management.    So the British company likely will persist -- at least for the time being -- with its efforts to placate Farmers' management, despite its stubborn refusals to even consider negotiations. &quot;B.A.T is desperately anxious not to open a hostile approach until they've exhausted every possibility of a friendly merger,&quot; said Jonathan Lawlor, an analyst at London stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson Securities.    The challenge planned for Farmers' annual meeting may pose the best opportunity for B.A.T to achieve a friendly combination. &quot;Trying to drive a wedge between shareholders and management will tighten the screws on Farmers' management to at least talk to B.A.T,&quot; said John H. Snyder, an insurance analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York.    Farmers' defense strategies don't seem strong enough to keep it independent, the analyst suggested. That will become increasingly clear in coming weeks, he said, adding pressure on Farmers management to obtain the highest possible offer. </TEXT></DOC>
