Dresser described the sale as a multimillion-dollar transaction, but didn't disclose exact terms. Dresser wouldn't say what effect proceeds of the sale would have on results for its first quarter ending Jan. 31.    In the 1986 quarter, the company had net income of $10.3 million, or 14 cents a share, on revenue of $924.4 million.    The sale to the partnership, which includes a local developer, James H. Coker, as general partner, covers a 33-story building, a 16-story structure and three associated parking facilities. Dresser said its headquarters will remain in the 33-story tower under a long-term lease with the partnership.    A spokesman for Dresser, which makes oil and natural gas-related equipment, said the sale was part of a restructuring program in which the company is concentrating on its main businesses.    Dallas commercial real estate brokers said the transaction's significance lies in the long-term lease that Dresser signed and not in the buildings themselves. Neither tower is considered an attractive investment because both are more than 10 years old, or Class B structures. &quot;There's no market in Dallas for Class B office space,&quot; said one broker, adding, &quot;If those two buildings were empty on today's market, I would have trouble selling them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
