Brezhnev delivered an addressin the city of Tula whose impact on Soviet doctrine and capabilitiescontinues to this day. By rejecting the possibility of a means of defenseagainst nuclear weapons, or a damage-limiting capacity in nuclear war,Brezhnev closed the door on a debate that had lasted for over a decadein Soviet military thought. Since Tula, the Soviet politico-militaryleadership has presented a consensus on the reality of Mutual AssuredDestruction in present-day conditions. The Soviet debate on the viabilityof nuclear war as an instrument of policy was likewise resolved by aconsensus: nuclear war is so unpromising and dangerous that it remainsan instrument of policy only in theory, an instrument of policy thatcannot be used. While the Soviet consensus on the diminishing militaryutility of nuclear weapons represents a ground-breaking shift in doctrinesince the heyday of Marshal Sokolovskiy, there is scant evidence of anydispute on the new correlation of war and policy in a nuclear age. MarshalN. V. Ogarkov and other hard-minded military figures have themselvesemerged as the architects of the Soviet shift away from a nuclear war-fightingand war-winning strategy, while General Secretary Gorbachev has fashioneda corresponding arms control agenda.</TEXT></DOC>
