The Toronto real estate developer is offering $17.50 apiece for as many as 14 million more shares in Santa Fe, which is the target of an impending proxy contest with Henley Group Inc.    The offer, which expires at midnight EST March 14, is contingent upon payment by Santa Fe of a previously announced special dividend of $25 in cash and $5 in subordinated debenture. The cash portion of the dividend is scheduled to be paid today, with the debenture payout set for March 1.    Marshall Cohen, executive vice president of Olympia, confirmed that the company was launching a tender offer, but wouldn't elaborate. A Santa Fe spokeswoman said she was unaware of the tender offer.    Michael D. Dingman, chairman and chief executive officer of Henley, which holds a 15.7% stake in Santa Fe, said he was &quot;pleased by the move&quot; but also declined to elaborate. Henley is a manufacturing, chemicals, engineering and financial services company based in La Jolla, Calif.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Santa Fe closed at $44.625 a share, up 25 cents. The company currently has about 156.2 million shares outstanding. However, a purchaser of Santa Fe stock tomorrow won't be entitled to the special dividend, which indicates the stock is likely to trade at a price far lower than Friday's close. A straight subtraction of the dividend suggests a price of $14.625 a share.    As previously reported, Olympia agreed to support Santa Fe's restructuring plan, which was viewed as a major blow to Henley's proxy contest. In exchange for the agreement, Olympia received two seats on Santa Fe's 17-member board. Olympia, however, said the peace pact didn't preclude it from accumulating additional Santa Fe shares.    Analysts have criticized Santa Fe, a Chicago-based railroad and energy concern, for pushing to pay the dividend as a takeover defense at a time when, because of anticipated profits from asset sales, the tax impact is greatest.    The payout, valued at $4.7 billion, is expected to be almost entirely taxable for many shareholders because of its timing and structure -- in contrast with most such dividends, which are set up as a non-taxable return of capital. Santa Fe officials have said that the special dividend isn't related to any hostile offer.    Meanwhile Henley has asked a Delaware court to void the agreement between Santa Fe and Olympia. The company's complaint alleges that the accord is a &quot;sweetheart deal&quot; designed in part to &quot;unfairly skew the approaching proxy contest.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
