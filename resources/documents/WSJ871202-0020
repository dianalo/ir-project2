The company declined to estimate its results. For the 1986 fourth quarter, the company earned $2 million, or 17 cents a share, after a $2.1 million tax credit. For the first nine months of 1987, Foxboro had a loss of $23.9 million.    Foxboro, which makes industrial automation equipment, said its restructuring program includes an enhanced early retirement program that is expected to trim annual costs more than $30 million. A combination of early retirements and terminations will trim the company's 7,500-member work force more than 10% by year end, a Foxboro spokesman said. He said the number of jobs to be cut by early retirements hasn't been determined.    Foxboro's cost-cutting measures follow sales declines in its oil and gas industry markets and in some other areas. Shipments this year have fallen 6% from year-earlier levels, the company said.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Foxboro closed at $21, up $1.50. </TEXT></DOC>
