The nation has been hit by a new wave of political violence inthe past month as the radicals have battled riot police and stagedfirebomb attacks to press for the fall of the government, expulsionof U.S. troops and unification of the Korean Peninsula.   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' ``Yankee go home!'' and``Unite our fatherland!'' protesters have chanted.   Radical leaders insist that President Roh Tae-woo's governmentis a front for military rule and domination by the United States,which has 42,000 troops stationed in South Korea.   The radicals reject recent democratic reforms and say they aredetermined to topple the government and the ruling elite throughviolence.   Analysts say the students have little chance of achieving theirgoals.   The radicals account for only about 10 percent of South Korea's1 million college students.   They have lost support and become isolated as most Koreans havewelcomed recent political reforms and rejected the extremism.   But some analysts say the students are nevertheless an explosiveand unpredictable factor in a nation with a history of violent anduncompromising political confrontation. They say the radicals aredominating South Korea's politics and derailing the politicalprocess.   ``This nation is now experiencing a most difficult period. Wehave the still very serious problem of college campus unrest,''said Rhee Chong-ik, a political analyst.   ``It is deplorable for the government to have become theprisoner of activist students,'' said political commentator ChongUn-bung.   The radicals come from all social and economic backgrounds.Children of senior officials and military officers join children ofworkers and poor farmers in campus groups that embrace a commonidealism and anger at government abuses over the years.   The movement is bolstered by anti-government dissidents andintellectuals who for years battled South Korea's authoritariangovernments. Some unemployed continue radical activity aftercollege, including many who are blacklisted because of theirrecords and are unable to get good jobs.   Observers worry about the long-term impact of radicalism, sincemany bright and talented students with potentially important rolesin the country's future are attracted to the radical ranks.   The radicals _ who are often vague about their goals _ say theyare fighting for the creation of an idealistic ``society of themasses,'' with students, workers and peasants uniting to endoppression, poverty and exploitation. Radical leaders stress thatthe solution to the nation's problems is to destroy the power ofthe military, government bureaucracy and major corporations thatdominate the economy.   ``We feel in our hearts that something must be done now. Peoplejust talk, and the government uses that to continue its rule. Wemust act to force change,'' said one leader, who refused to benamed.   The radicals' philosophy of forcing change was demonstrated June10 when they attempted to march to the border with communist NorthKorea to press for reunification of the Korean Peninsula, dividedsince 1945.   The government blocked the march and radicals fiercely battledpolice.   Many South Koreans, who fear the North is determined to conquerthe South, were stunned by the sight of the radicals embracing oneof the world's most oppressive regimes.   North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to spark the Korean War.   The radicals have also stressed anti-Americanism, accusing theUnited States of controlling South Korea's governments and dividingthe peninsula to rule the South.   Protesters have attacked U.S. diplomatic facilities.   Government officials and critics accuse the radicals of being``utopian romantics'' or ``communist dupes'' and say they areimmature and ignorant about politics and ideology.   Officials also worry the radicals will drift toward terrorism.They point to Japan's Red Army and other terrorist groups thatevolved out of similar radical movements.   But many South Koreans have mixed feelings about the studentsbecause of the country's long and honorable tradition of studentactivism.   Students helped lead the struggle against the Japanese colonialoccupation during the first half of the century. The students alsoplayed a key role in overthrowing the dictatorial regime of formerPresident Syngman Rhee in 1960 and headed opposition to more recentauthoritarian governments.</TEXT></DOC>
