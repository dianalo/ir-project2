JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Bush administration will send a delegationto a conference on global warming next month in the Netherlands,but is not prepared to commit itself to action against the problem,officials said Wednesday.   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly, who will head thedelegation, said the administration's policy on global warming hasyet to be worked out.   Reilly said it is premature to call for a commitment to freezeemissions by the year 2000 of the ``greenhouse'' gases. These aregases whose accumulation in the atmosphere is, according to mostscientists, warming the globe.   The Dutch government is expected to propose such a freeze ofcarbon dioxide emissions at the 68-nation conference Nov. 6-7 nearThe Hague. Carbon dioxide, a product of burning fossil fuels andcutting down forests, is the principal warming gas.   President Bush promised during his election campaign last yearto convene a similar international conference on global warming,but nothing has been done. Reilly, in a meeting with reporters, didnot discuss the president's campaign promise.   The administration reportedly has been divided on how aggressivea role the United States should assume in confronting globalwarming.   According to administration sources, it was not clear untilearlier this week that Reilly actually would go to the conferencewhich will be attended by environmental ministers from the aroundthe world.   Christopher Flavin, an expert on global warming issues forWorldwatch Institute, an environmentally oriented research group,said the flap over whether Reilly would attend the conference wasseen by many European officials as further indication that theUnited States is not prepared to lead the effort to deal withglobal warming.   ``This is a major meeting ... It's been in the planning stagefor better part of a year. The United States just doesn't have itsact together,'' said Flavin.   Flavin said that most European governments favor specificcommitments for reducing carbon dioxide emissions.   According to administration sources who have discussed thequestion on condition they not be identified, Reilly has championeda more aggressive response to the global warming concern and hasfavored taking specific proposals to the meeting in the Netherlands.   Others in the administration, including the president's scienceadviser, D. Allan Bromley, have cautioned against moving tooquickly. They argue there has yet to emerge a clear scientificconsensus on the impact of the so-called greenhouse effect, norhave the economic ramifications of a curb on the burning of fossilfuels been made clear.   Reilly refused to discuss the internal disagreements within theadministration.   He told reporters that ``a whole range of questions'' remainabout global warming and how to respond. These questions should beanswered before the administration decides on specific commitmentsfor curbing greenhouse pollutants, he suggested.</TEXT></DOC>
