Wall Street takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis and his firm, S.B. Lewis andamp; Co., pleaded innocent to charges of manipulating the price of Fireman's Fund Corp. stock in 1986, when American Express Co. was planning an offering of stock and warrants it owned in the insurance concern.    Separately, three people and two stock-trading firms were arraigned on securities fraud and insider trading-related charges stemming from the 1986 &quot;Yuppie Five&quot; case. Ronald Yagoda, a former top arbitrager at Marcus Schloss and Co.; Victor Teicher, a former arbitrager at Edward A. Viner andamp; Co. who now runs his own firm, Victor Teicher and Co.; Ross S. Frankel, who until last week was the head of arbitrage research for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.; Victor Teicher and Co.; and Marcus Schloss andamp; Co. all pleaded innocent.    All defendants in both cases appeared before federal Magistrate James C. Francis IV. Judge Mary Johnson Lowe was assigned to Mr. Lewis's case. Mr. Lewis was ordered to post a $100,000 bond and was released.    The three defendants in the other case also were ordered to post bond of $100,000 each and were released. That case will be presided over by Judge Charles S. Haight.    Last week, a federal grand jury handed up a 22-count indictment against Mr. Lewis and a four-count indictment against his firm alleging stock manipulation, conspiracy and related securities-law violations.    Mr. Lewis, 49 years old, faces a maximum possible sentence of five years on each count and a maximum fine of $39.5 million. The firm, if convicted on all counts, could be fined as much as $5.5 million.    Messrs. Yagoda, Teicher and Frankel and the two companies were indicted last week on charges of conspiring from October 1985 through April 1986 with the &quot;Yuppie Five&quot; -- four young Wall Street professionals and a client of one of them who have pleaded guilty to using information stolen from the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison to make illegal profits.    If convicted on all counts, the individuals could be imprisoned for as long as five years and fined $250,000 each. The stock-trading firms could be fined as much as $500,000 each.    The indictment also alleges that Mr. Frankel, 32, directed one of the Yuppie Five to tell Mr. Teicher, 37, the names of four companies on Drexel's confidential &quot;phantom&quot; list, which identified companies involved in takeovers or potential takeovers.    Mr. Frankel and Mr. Yagoda, 44, also were charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with their testimony before the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
