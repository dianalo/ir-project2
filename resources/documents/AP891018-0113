Among the 94 changes passed by the 380-member Parliament wereamendments eliminating all references to the leading role of thenewly dissolved Communist Party. Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsarsaid they effectively end one-party rule in the East bloc nation.   The country's formal name also was changed from People'sRepublic of Hungary to Republic of Hungary to reflect a break withthe Communist past.   Another change in the 1949 Constitution abolishes the 21-personcollective presidency and replaces it with the office of thepresident.   The powers of president, who also is commander-in-chief of thearmed forces and wields other authority, will be temporarilyassumed by Parliament Speaker Matyas Szueros until democraticelections are held next year.   One amendment states that ``political parties may be freelyestablished and may freely function providing that they respect theConstitution and the laws.''   Another declares that the ``leading role of the Marxist-Leninistparty of the working class ... has been outdated. Instead thenecessary legal framework of a multi-party system must be stated.''   The historic voting came on the heels of another landmarkdecision _ the dissolution last week of the Communist Party and itsreplacement by the Hungarian Socialist Party.   Unlike its monolithic, Marxist-Leninist predecessor, the newparty created last week professes commitment to multi-partydemocracy and market forces in the economy.   The moves are the latest in Hungary's dizzying moves in the pastyear to break with its socialist past by establishing democraticeconomic and social reforms and improve ties to the West. LikePoland, Hungary's rush to reform has created friction withhard-line Warsaw Pact allies.   One-party rule continues at least temporarily, despitetermination of the Communist Party. Its successor continues todominate politics pending the nation's first national multi-partyelections in 41 years.   Today's session also revealed differences on a key aspect of thecountry's democratic strivings _ when and how to choose thenation's president.   The government wants the election this year but oppositionparties seek a postponement, asserting they have no time orresources to organize against Socialist Party candidate ImrePozsgay.   The opposition League of Free Democrats called for a plebisciteon a postponement and they want Parliament to elect the presidentafter a new legislature is chosen.   Legislators today overwhelmingly approved a suggestion byPremier Miklos Nemeth that Parliament should not put the referendumissue to the vote, but that separate committees deal with the topiclater.   Parliamentary elections to be scheduled by June would be thefirst instance of free multi-party voting on the national levelsince the Communists consolidated power in 1948.</TEXT></DOC>
