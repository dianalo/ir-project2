But an American spokeswoman said the break in the talks thatbegan in April was only temporary and that the U.S. side expectsthe negotiations to resume ``shortly.''   ``As has happened several times in the past, there has been atemporary break in the talks,'' said U.S. Embassy spokeswoman MaryCarlin Yates in a telephone interview. Mrs. Yates is also the U.S.panel's spokeswoman.   ``We do not consider the talks suspended,'' she added. ``Suchtemporary break occur from time to time particularly when one sideneeds time to consider a proposal from the other.''   The current talks are held every five years to review terms ofthe 1947 agreement allowing the United States to keep Clark AirBase, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller installations.   The Manila government is pressing for an increase in the $180million it receives annually from Washington for use of the bases.Before the talks began, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said theamount of $1.2 billion annually would be ``more realistic.''   ``The amount offered (by the Americans) was far, far below whatwe were demanding,'' said Leonides Caday, a member of thePhilippine panel. He added that the suspension would lastindefinitely, declined to elaborate.   ``I don't see the point in continuing these talks,'' JuanitaAmatong, another Philippine panel member, quoted Manglapus astelling U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt before the talks broke off.   On Monday, Manglapus said that the two panels were nearingagreement but that they may not complete the negotiations by anend-of-the-month deadline.   Tuesday's statement said only that ``there was substantialdisagreement on the compensation issue, as a result of which the(Philippine) panel moved for the suspension of the talks.''   The talks do not directly affect the status of the bases after1991, when the agreement expires. But a successful review isexpected to influence the Manila government's decision on whetherto extend the agreement beyond 1991.   President Corazon Aquino says she will honor the currentagreement but refuses to say whether she will support an extensionafter 1991.   Under the new Philippine Constitution, any extension must be inthe form of a treaty ratified by the Philippine Senate, whereopposition to the bases is currently strong.</TEXT></DOC>
