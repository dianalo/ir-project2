Considering all the technological systems available the lightwater reactor will continue to dominate. The change to the breeder reactoris not yet under discussion because of the medium-term guaranteed uraniumsupply. The use of nuclear technology in the heating market will dependfor the moment on the availability and cost of oil and gas development.In principle nuclear energy can play an important role also in this sector.</TEXT></DOC>
