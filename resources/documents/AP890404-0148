WycheFowler, D-Ga., told Barry at a hearing on the crime problem held bythe Senate District of Columbia Appropriations subcommittee.   ``In all this testimony we have not had a single request saying,... `We have a war on our hands and we need your help','' Fowlersaid.   ``Mr. Mayor, I think you're hearing something fundamentalhere...ask us for the help, and specify what we are to do,'' saidsubcommittee chairman Brock Adams, D-Wash. ``We've got to take thestreets back.''   The hearing was held as Washington's drug-related murder spreecontinued to place the district in the international limelight.   Through Tuesday, 128 people had been killed in the district,compared with 83 at the same point last year. A record 372 werekilled in the district last year, and police blame 60 percent ofthose killings on drugs.   Adams said he would recommend that more federal money be used tohire additional city police officers, but only once Barry providedhim more details on current police anti-drug efforts, jail crowdingproblems, and anti-drug efforts.   ``We want to provide the funding, but we need a basis on whichto proceed,'' Adams said.   ``Give us a couple of says and we can give (you) a goodshort-term list,'' Barry told the Senate panel. ``This governmenthas no problem asking for help, and I hope I didn't give thatimpression.''   Barry repeatedly stressed that he held back on giving the Senatepanel details because he wanted to allow Bush administration drugpolicy coordinator William J. Bennett to review a $102 millionproposal Barry had sent him Monday.   During the hearing, the mayor agreed to make public his Bennettproposal, but that move did not satisfy all on the panel.   Sen. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., who described Barry's writtentestimony as ``a Chamber of Commerce document,'' accused the mayorof glossing over the city's problems.   ``If I were to judge you on the job you're doing with drugs, andI were given a vote, I wouldn't vote for you,'' Kerrey saidangrily. ``In the absence of a community committed to solving theproblem, no amount of money would help.''   Barry told Kerrey that his oral remarks, which Kerry missedbecause he was at another hearing, went to the heart of the city'sdrug crisis. Barry later acknowledged making a ``tactical error''by not sharing with the subcommittee the plan he sent to Bennett.   An aide to Bennett said the Bush administration probably willnot provide all of the $102 million aid package the mayor hasrequested. Most of the money would be used to house districtprisoners in federal jails and for the hiring of 700 additionalpolice officers.   ``It's hard to see how we could recommend an additional $100million a year for the district,'' said Bennett spokesman DonHamilton.   Bennett's office has not yet come up with its own total. ``Idon't have a ballpark dollar figure at all,'' Hamilton said.   Stressing that his office had had the Barry plan ``less than 24hours,'' Hamilton said it will be reviewed to see how it mightagree with plans being developed by Bennett's staff.   ``It's clear that we agree on some of the things'' such as theneed for more prison space, he said.   The comments of Adams, Fowler and others indicate growingcongressional concern about the district government's ability toslow the record murder rate in the nation's capital.   Two weeks ago, Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., raised thepossibility of a federal takeover of the police department. Rep.Stan Parris, R-Va., is drafting legislation in the House that woulddo just that.   An aide to Parris said his bill would be introduced by next week.</TEXT></DOC>
