There'sa mutual frustration with each other.''   Such comments are not surprising in the aftermath of the 380-48House vote, and the 94-6 Senate tally, to reject a raise thatbrought howls of protest on talk shows across the nation. As tiredas lawmakers may be of the painful affair, however, at least someissues linked to it won't go away.   Common Cause, the self-styled citizen's lobby, says it willmaintain pressure on Congress to eliminate the outside incomelawmakers receive from special interest groups.   ``This Congress cannot long ignore the increasing call forethical reform,'' said Fazio.   The Senate voted two weeks ago to bar members from pocketing feesfor speaking to various groups, including special interest lobbies.But it made the change contingent on approval of the pay raise.   The House had been planning to vote on the honoraria issue lastThursday, coupled with a plan by Wright to scale the raise back to30 percent. The issue went on the back burner Tuesday, when theHouse decided the public wouldn't stand for any raise.   ``It's a major setback for reform,'' said House Majority WhipTony Coelho, D-Calif., ``I thought what was needed was to increasesalary, do away with honoraria and start a reform movement here.''   While House members are still eligible to keep $26,850 inhonoraria, the question of outside fees has been bucked to a newbipartisan panel co-chaired by Fazio and Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill.Lawmakers say there's no chance the House or the Senate _ wheremembers can retain $35,800 in honoraria _ will give up the systemwithout a raise, since that would amount to a pay cut.   Still simmering is the issue of raises for judges and top federalexecutives.   Congress' rejection of its own increase prevented raises for:1,100 judges; 834 top executive branch appointed officials; 7,000career federal managers, 12,000 foreign service officers and 155generals and admirals.   Coelho told colleagues just before the rejection, ``We are votingto continue the exodus of judges, top-level managers, and yes,creative members of Congress from government service to the privatesector.''   Lawmakers have shown little interest in resurrecting these payraises without considering their own.   ``I don't think it's a sound idea, because of the branches beingequal,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., and chairman of theHouse Post Office civil service subcommittee. ``The forefathersdidn't say we should have a lower branch.''   A survey by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courtsconcluded 20 of the last 26 judges to leave the federal bench saidpay was a factor in their resignations.   From 1958-73, six federal judges resigned from the lifetimeposition, compared to 60 from 1974 to 1978. The loss in real salarydue to inflation has totaled 30 percent for U.S. judges since 1969,the office said.   Here are other unresolved issues from the pay raise dispute,which the bipartisan House ethics panel may consider:   _Expenses. Members of Congress invited to make a speech can windup with a stay in a posh resort, courtesy of special interests. Thepanel must decide whether to follow the lead of bipartisan Housenegotiators, whose ill-fated honoraria reform package would likelyhave placed time limits on trips for a single speech.   _Non-honoraria income. The House proposal would have: limited alloutside income to 15 percent of salary; prohibited affiliation withbusiness entities for compensation; prevented members frompracticing a profession, except part-time teaching; and bannedmembers from serving as an officer or board member on a publiclyheld regulated corporation. The prohibitions on business andprofessional affiliations are already in Senate rules.   A separate Wright-appointed panel on campaign finance reform willconsider whether to eliminate the ``grandfather clause'' loophole infederal law.   The provision allows House members, in office before 1980, toconvert leftover campaign cash to personal use. The House reformpackage would have ended this loophole in 1991, allowing any memberholding leftover cash to retire with the money after this term.   But anyone running again would have limited options, includinggiving to campaigns of others, donating the money to charity, orreturning it to those who made the contributions.</TEXT></DOC>
