(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A restaurant owner says he dropped alongstanding policy of refusing to serve black customers afterenjoying a visit from an attorney for soul singer James Brown.   Bruce Salter, operator of the Buffalo Room, said he wouldcontinue serving blacks ``as long as they don't come in and tear upthe place.''   Salter's policy against serving blacks has made the Buffalo Roomthe subject of investigations by the FBI, Justice Department civilrights division and the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission.   George Hill, a black lawyer whose client Brown is in prison inColumbia, said Salter let him into the restaurant and bar twiceTuesday.   Hill said he had read that Salter claimed to have once kickedBrown out of his establishment.   ``I wanted to check it out,'' Hill said.   Hill said when he knocked on the door early Tuesday afternoon,Salter slammed the door in his face. Hill waited at the door andSalter peeped his head out and asked what he wanted.   ``I told him, `I think you're a nice man,''' Hill said.   Salter again retreated. About five minutes later he walked outonto the covered porch and asked Hill what he had meant about beinga nice man.   ``He was breathing fire when I first came,'' Hill said.``Eventually he invited me in. We came into the bar first and thenhe said `come on in the dining room and sit down, I want to talk toyou some more.' It turned into a 2{ hour visit.''   Salter said he invited Hill back because Hill is an intelligentman and he enjoyed talking to him.   Hill said he believes Salter will continue serving blacks, anddid not invite him in just because the alcohol commission hasscheduled a license revocation hearing for the Buffalo Room on Oct.12.   Asked whether admitting Hill had anything to do with the hearing,Salter said: ``I ain't gong to say nothing. Let them think what theywant.''   The 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basisof race in such public places as restaurants. Conviction carries amaximum sentence of a $1,000 fine and a year in prison.</TEXT></DOC>
