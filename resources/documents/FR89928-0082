Inthe two requests, the licensee has requested temporary and permanent exemptionsfor Unit 1 to (1) conduct the third test of the first 10-year service periodduring the Unit 1 Cycle 4 refueling outage and (2) separate the third testof each 10-year service period from the 10-year ISI. The first requestis for a temporary exemption for only the upcoming test so that it maybe conducted during the Unit 1 Cycle 4 refueling outage instead of duringa special outage to conduct the test. The second request is for a permanentexemption so that the third test of each 10-year service period and the10-year ISI can be scheduled separately.For the temporary exemption, appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 requires thata set of three tests shall be performed at approximately equal intervalsduring each 10-year service period. The NRC staff has determined that the``approximately equal interval'' is 40 andplusmin; 10 months. The licenseeis requesting a temporary exemption to allow the third test for Unit 1in its first 10-year service period to be conducted at an interval greaterthan 50 months from the second test. The additional interval while theunit is operating until it shuts down for its Cycle 4 refueling outageis no more than three months.The measured overall leak rate for the first test for Unit 1 was 0.09429percent per day. Unit 1 entered its Cycle 3 refueling outage on August22, 1985, and the second test of the first 10-year service period was conductedon December 15, 1985. The measured overall leak rate for the second testwas 0.05388 percent per day. Both the first test and the second test weresignificantly less than the maximum allowable leak rate of 0.25 percentper day for Unit 1.Unit 1 was in an extended shutdown from August 22, 1985 until its restartin November 1988. In this shutdown, TVA stated that no modifications weremade on the containment boundary. In addition, the local leak tests onall penetration and valves requiring appendix J Type B and Type C testingwere acceptably completed. The surfaces of the containment liner and shieldbuilding were inspected for abnormal degradation before the restart ofUnit 1 and none was observed. The leak rate for the test in December 1985should not degrade beyond the maximum allowed leak rate in the not morethan three months of additional plant operation beyond the 50 months allowed,before the shut down of Unit 1 to conduct the third test.For the permanent exemption, appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 requires thatthe third test of each 10-year service period shall be conducted when theunit is shut down for the 10-year ISI. The licensee is requesting an exemptionto permanently decouple the third test from the 10-year ISI. The thirdtest for Unit 1 for the first 10-year service period is scheduled for theUnit 1 Cycle 4 refueling outage for the unit. The 10-year ISI is not relatedto the integrity of the containment pressure boundary and is currentlyscheduled in accordance with section XI of the American Society of MechanicalEngineers (ASME) Code and with 10 CFR 50.55a(g)(4) for 1994. The first10-year ISI for Unit 1 is, therefore, scheduled for a future refuelingoutage other than the Unit 1 Cycle 4 refueling outage. Each future 10-yearISI will, therefore, be scheduled for a different outage than the outagefor the third test of any 10-year service period.The Need for the Proposed ActionThe proposed temporary and permanent exemptions are required to permitthe licensee to (1) conduct the thrid test for Unit 1 during a scheduledUnit 1 refueling outage instead of during a forced outage and (2) uncouplethe third test during a 10-year service period from the 10-year ISI.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionWith respect to the requested temporary and permanent exemptions, the relieffrom the above requirements of Appendix J would permit the licensee toconduct the third test in the Unit 1 Cycle 4 refueling outage. With regardto potential radiological environmental impacts, the proposed temporaryand permanent exemptions would not allow the licensee to operate Unit 1longer than allowed by the operating license for the unit. Neither theprobability of accidents nor the radiological releases from accidents willbe increased. The proposed temporary and permanent exemptions do not increasethe radiological effluents from the facility and do not increase the occupationalexposure at the facility. Therefore, the Commission concludes that thereare no significant radiological impacts associated with the proposed temporaryand permanent exemptions.With regard to potential nonradiological environmental impacts, the proposedtemporary and permanent exemptions involve systems located within the restrictedareas as defined in 10 CFR part 20. They do not affect nonradiologicalplant effluents and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, theCommission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmentalimpacts associated with the proposed temporary and permanent exemptions.Therefore, the proposed temporary and permanent exemptions do not significantlychange the conclusions in the licensee's ``Final Environmental StatementRelated to the Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2,'' (FES)dated February 21, 1974. The Commission concluded that operation of theSequoyah units will not result in any environmental impacts other thanthose evaluated in the FES in its letter to the licensee dated September17, 1980 which granted the Facility Operating License DPR-77 for Unit 1.Alternative to the Proposed ActionBecause the staff has concluded that there is no measurable environmentalimpact associated with the proposed temporary and permanent exemptions,any alternative to these exemptions will have either no significantly differentenvironmental impact or greater environmental impact.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested temporary andpermanent exemptions. This would not reduce environmental impacts as aresult of Unit 1 operations.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of resources not previously consideredin connection with the ``Final Environmental Statement Related to the Operationof the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2,'' dated February 21, 1974.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's requests that support the proposedtemporary and permanent exemptions. The NRC staff did not consult otheragencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed temporary and permanent exemptions.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For details with respect to this action, see the licensee's request forthe two exemptions dated May 1 and 5, 1989, which is available for publicinspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the Chattanooga-Hamilton County BicentennialLibrary, 1001 Broad Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 22nd day of September 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Suzanne Black,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Assistant Director for Projects, TVA Projects Division, Office of NuclearReactor Regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-22929 Filed 9-27-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 7590-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
