Theoutcry that led to the Los Angeles County TransportationCommission canceling a contract with Sumitomo Corp. for ahigh-tech transit line reflects more than just a &quot;BuyAmerica&quot; issue, although it became an unseemly example ofthat revivalism. It's about &quot;Investing in L.A.&quot; as well.   The ruckus over an announced alliance betweenMcDonnell-Douglas Corp. and an aerospace creation from Taiwanhas similar elements. In both cases, the more seriousquestion is not where the financial headquarters of the endproducer is located. It is whether and how innovative,skilled-labor industries in which the U.S. arguably has acomparative advantage will be fostered.</LP><TEXT>   It's a matter of concern not only at the highly visible(and unionized) factories of final assembly, but also amongthe mass of smaller companies -- the &quot;job shops&quot; -- that sellto a major manufacturing concern. It's the talk of thesuddenly subdued Seattle area as Boeing steadily sends out toJapan for more of its jet components. And it was, of course,the crux of President Bush's ill-fated Japanese mission: tokeep Interstate 75 as the Auto Highway.   Building the guts of tomorrow's conveyances is one way tostake a claim on future wealth. Even in a world of incredibletelecommunications, people are going to want mobility and&quot;Beam me up, Scotty&quot; will still be just science fiction.   Transportation is only one set of industries, to be sure.Others too will be regional causes, into the new century. Butnow, in Southern California, where jobs are hard to come by(want ads in the Los Angeles Times fell 42% in 1991), wheelsand wings are what most move people.   Rail is especially big news in California because thestate is undertaking a huge campaign on top of that unleashedby the new federal transit appropriation. Tracks are goingevery which way, as penance for all those years of indulgingin the private automobile. Enter Sumitomo and its selectionto build the Green Line, which is to run 23 miles from nearthe International Airport alongside Watts to the smoggysuburb of Norwalk.   It's a commuter stretch. About the only reason a visitorwould have any interest is that it is (or was) to beautomated. This technology is in its infancy. Driverlesstrains seem to be working in Lille, France, and Vancouver,B.C., but in the U.S. they are confined to tiny operationssuch as those in Jacksonville, Fla., and Detroit (thedowntown People Mover). Cameras in the cars pipe signs oftrouble (like crime) back to a command post, where variousresponses can be triggered.   Transit visionaries say this technology is what allgrade-separated lines will someday be using, and skeptics ofpublic systems agree that the labor costs and work rules ofrail are the most intractable of any in government and thusare to avoided at nearly any cost. Sumitomo was judged betterable to bring off the engineering by 1994 than anAmerican-based competitor, Morrison-Knudsen.   That set off the local yahoos. An obscure Republicancongressman from the TVA porkland of Tennessee, John Duncan,got into the act from his perch on the House TransportationCommittee. Beneath the superficial jingoism, however, was thepotential for train-making in the area, with its burgeoningmarket and glut of unemployed talent in aerospace andmetalwork.   A &quot;global regionalist&quot; like Joel Kotkin,chronicler-promoter of L.A.'s formativeimmigrant-techno-entrepreneurial economy, is open to thatprospect. Although a free trader, he suspects the Japanese&quot;keiretsu&quot; structure of corporate interlocks and verticalintegration with suppliers poses a challenge in key sectorsthat U.S. business practices may not be up to.   Involving government in a counter-strategy is a delicatetask, as anyone who respects market efficiency recognizes.And Los Angeles politicians, like those elsewhere, walk witha heavy foot. As they shot down Sumitomo, and perhaps theautomated design as well, they took a step toward actuallybuilding and owning a public production facility for railcars for the county's overall transit network. By now, theundertaking is so ensnared in pork barreling and demagoguerythat Sumitomo might someday be glad to be rid of it.   The same might be said of the makeshift outfit calledTaiwan Aerospace that last fall agreed to invest $2 billionto revive McDonnell-Douglas's commercial aircraft division.Unionists from Southern California assembly plants cried thatthe deal meant shipping work to Asia, the job shops startedhollering and national politicians again joined in.   What became apparent to some, however, was that Douglaswas getting a life preserver and its partner the likelihoodof a cold splash. Taipei, flush with the world's largestforeign-exchange reserves and eager to lay groundwork forfurther prosperity at home, is betting on the third horse ina two-horse race-behind Boeing and Airbus Industrie in afield with high costs and a currently shrinking market.   Politics in Taiwan may end up squelching the deal, but inthe meantime, &quot;dirigistes&quot; in the Congress want to put thetaxpayers into this production, too. One sophisticatedapproach includes loan guarantees by Washington and an equityposition by banks, the sort of arrangement that approximatesthe way state capitalism works for U.S. tradingpartners-cum-rivals. The Taiwan-Douglas deal as it nowstands, if it includes a consortium of East Asian nationsgetting a beat on their common foe Japan, has geostrategicappeal but few new U.S. jobs (although it could save some.)   One is tempted to say: Forget all this subsidizedhardware, let the U.S. keep leading the world in designingthe brains of these durable goods. The silicon chip is fasterand more powerful than any moving object. But as one seniorconsultant notes, the high-value engineering in today'svehicles -- especially in aircraft and autos -- is in&quot;systems integration.&quot; Without final assembly, you're out ofthat game.   Even now that a capital crisis for Japanese banksthreatens to curtail Japan's economic might, the demonstratedsuccess abroad in some industries -- not all the prized ones,by any means, but not just the dinosaurs, either -- is causefor an open mind about policies to gain a foothold inessential technologies and build on it. If &quot;local content&quot;requirements are understood to entail alliances furtheringthat objective, they at least merit a good look.   It may turn out that simply relaxing state controls thatremain in the U.S., such as antitrust laws, restrictions onequity holdings by banks and punitive taxes on capital, wouldbe sufficient to even the odds in some &quot;targeted&quot; fields. Butno one can afford to assume smugly that Adam Smith wrote thebook on trade for all cultures and all times.   So much of U.S. manufacturing is now world-class thatreasons other than sloth and sloppiness must be sought forcompetitive lapses. If globalism has naturally diminished themarket shares held by American-based companies, it has alsoexposed the U.S. system to a world test, conducted underforeign rules. The simple response is to shut the Sumitomosout and bring the McDonnell-Douglases home, while keeping tothe American way of doing business. But insularity isn'tprofitable any longer, not for regions, not for nations.</TEXT></DOC>
