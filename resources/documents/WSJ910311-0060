To India's credit, it must be said that theseincreasingly frequent transitions are still running along therails of democratic process. Delhi's political circus, forall its freak moments, still outshines cases such as thewaxwork &quot;stability&quot; of the communist regime in neighboringChina, or the false promise of democratic transition from themilitary junta in Burma.   That noted, it's time India's leaders remembered that theywere elected to do grander things in New Delhi than playmusical chairs. India is a nation still trying to convalescefrom decades of Fabian socialism. India's inheritance ofsweeping state controls over the economy means that most ofits 835 million people -- some one-sixth of the world'spopulation -- live in horrifying poverty. That translatesinto diseases the developed world does not even remember,shorter lives and huge waste of human potential.</LP><TEXT>   For a short sweet time in the mid-1980s, it looked as ifall that misery might be left behind. Prime Minister RajivGandhi took office in 1984 promising to deregulate theeconomy, reduce taxes and generally allow the private sectorto grow strong enough to pull India into the 20th century.With the help of the then-finance minister, V.P. Singh, Mr.Gandhi began to deliver. And India began to respond, withhealthy growth rates and the flowering of a productive middleclass.   By 1987, however, Mr. Gandhi had somehow lost his visionand his resolve. His plans for reform trickled away into themud flats of Indian bureaucracy and petty politics. Votersdisliked this trend so much that they finally ditched Mr.Gandhi for Mr. Singh in the 1989 elections.   By last November, Mr. Singh had sputtered out in a cloudof statist maneuvers that helped neither his party nor hiscountry. Now Mr. Shekhar has demonstrated that for lack of alarger agenda, petty political horse-trading will prevail.   The problem for India's people is that they need at thevery least a political leader who will stop playing partygames and instead offer a genuine agenda for development.There are examples enough in the developing world of what'sneeded. From Asia's Tiger economies to the newly aspiringcapitalist states of Eastern Europe, it is by now commonwisdom that free markets create wealth. Because free marketsrequire low levels of regulation, they also offer lessopportunity for corruption. There is less reason to bribeofficials, and therefore less reason for popular disgust withgovernment. Wealth and government integrity, by the way, tendto strengthen democracy -- an institution increasinglyjeopardized in India as New Delhi's politicians speed uptheir game of musical chairs.   No doubt there will be plenty of party chatter in Delhithese next few weeks over which politician is aligned withwhom, and how many seats in Parliament might be bargained forwhat. This amounts to chucking more sand into India's enginesof progress. We expect it will impress Indian voters much thesame way. Their basic test of good government is whether ornot their lives are improving. By this test, the only kind ofprime minister likely to last will be one with a program forgrowth instead of gamesmanship.</TEXT></DOC>
