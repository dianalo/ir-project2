Thomas Bidwell, who was convicted of assault with a dangerousinstrument, claimed there was no proof he was wearing shoes at thetime of the Dec. 29, 1984, fight in Binghamton.   ``We disagree,'' said presiding Justice A. Franklin Mahoney ofthe Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court in Thursday'sunanimous decision. ``The incident occurred at the end of Decemberand there was testimony that the temperature was cold, therebyforeclosing the possibility that the attacker had bare feet.''
