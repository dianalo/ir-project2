However,it is generalized system that can serve for administration of other mailinglists as well. It allows for domestic and foreign address elements, andelectronic mail addresses which could be used by a SPIRES protocol tosend CMS mail or files automatically. It has a format to produce adhesivemailing labels, and employs phantom structures in the LISTS subfile togive an immmediate list of addressees on a particular mailing list. Thereis no practical limit to the number of mailing lists specifiable, norto the length of the name of a list. The Stanford Public InformationRetrieval System (SPIRES) is a product of Leland Stanford Junior Universityin Palo Alto, CA. The SPIRES database management system at LBL runs onthe UC Berkeley Campus IBM 3081-D32 under the VM/CMS operating system.VM SPIRES consists of three components: SPIRES itself (database managementsystem); CMS (the operating system that manages the computer); and SPIRES/CMSinterface (maps SPIRES activity onto the CMS environment). Normally,SPRIES users are not and need not be concerned with the subsystems betweenthemselves and SPIRES. The diagram is provided only to demonstrate context.Most of the icons are self-explantory. The purpose of the SERIES/1 isto make the user's ASCII terminal appear as an IBM 3270 terminal to theIBM 3081, and to make the IBM 3081 appear to communicate in ASCII tothe user. Section II describes the commands to move along the path fromterminal through the gateways into SPIRES. This generally requires lessthan 10 seconds and becomes routine.</TEXT></DOC>
