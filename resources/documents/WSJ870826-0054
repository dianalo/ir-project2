Anyone interested in the future of science in the United States will want to see whether an investigating panel at Montana State University actually decides to tear up plant pathologist Gary Strobel's 14 elm trees and burn them. And judging from recent statements by some members of MSU's Biosafety Committee, there is reason to wonder whether the investigators may be asked to throw Prof. Strobel himself onto the bonfire.    Prof. Strobel is currently the great heretic of American science. His heresy has nothing to do with breaking the rules of science, but with violating the way America regulates its science. Fortunately for mankind, the great biologist Gregor Mendel and the scientists who confirmed his work lived in a less fearful age. To move mankind forward in modern America, you need a permit.    Attempting to stimulate a chemical that would kill the destructive fungus known as Dutch elm disease, Prof. Strobel injected a genetically altered bacterium into a stand of elm trees -- without first getting a permit from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Yesterday, the EPA said it will decide soon, perhaps today, what action to take, but it probably will stop short of a fine.    At the Friday hearing, the role of the Red Queen -- &quot;Off with his head!&quot; -- will be played by the school's Biosafety Committee. It has already reported that Prof. Strobel ought to be formally reprimanded and face &quot;other punitive actions.&quot; It has sent off its report to the EPA. Speaking from the National Science Foundation in Washington, David Kingsbury announced: &quot;Montana State has a lot of questions to answer. A lot.&quot; The National Institutes of Health has dropped dark hints about withdrawing research grants.    With the science police in Washington rumbling, it is to some extent understandable that many of Prof. Strobel's colleagues are giving statements against him. &quot;It's hard enough to get money when you're MSU and not the University of California at Berkeley,&quot; said another of the school's plant pathologists.    Obsequiousness has become a way of life in the U.S. scientific community. Much of its research is funded by the federal government, and the results of that research usually can't reach the public until it is formally approved by some office in the federal government. When the regulators tell American scientists to sit on their hands while the agency determines if the innovation conforms with federal rules, most merely ask for how long.    By remarkable coincidence, the National Academy of Sciences just issued a report asserting the inherent safety of transferring genes between unrelated organisms. The NAS report pointedly notes that &quot;we must strike a wise balance between the thrust of innovation and the restraint of regulation and oversight.&quot; The Academy's statement of support for biologists is overdue. The safety of experiments such as Dr. Strobel's is hardly an issue any longer among serious scientists. Indeed both MSU's Biosafety Committee and the EPA have said the experiment almost certainly posed no threat.    We suspect the appearance of the Academy's report reflects a growing sense in the scientific community that it had better start defending itself against its scare-mongering critics more forthrightly. There is evidence this issue is understood in Montana. MSU's President William Tietz has said: &quot;We have a harmless bug that has the potential to solve a national and international problem, but it's bound up in red tape. It is an issue that has to be dealt with somewhere, and it may as well be dealt with here.&quot;    After another investigating body pronounced Galileo guilty in 1633, he was made to recant. He mouthed some words that &quot;abjured, cursed and detested&quot; his errors. Quite obviously a lot of people want Gary Strobel to similarly recant and admit the primacy of the people in Washington who approve what scientists may do. Two weeks ago, Prof. Strobel had theories about how to cure Dutch elm disease. Today he has a lawyer. Prof. Strobel says that if his trees are burned, as his colleagues who serve on the Biosafety Committee have recommended, he will abandon his work.    There are going to be more Gary Strobels so long as U.S. science is a compliant party to the premise that its work is so dangerous and intellectually untrustworthy that it requires regulation by the national government. It also looks like there are going to be a lot more dead elm trees. </TEXT></DOC>
