Buchanan,a ship capable of carrying nuclear weapons, to enter Auckland harborin February 1985, it put into effect a nuclear free policy that had beenevolving within the party for at least 12 years before the election thatbrought it to power in 1984. Endorsed by three of four major politicalparties in New Zealand, the proposal to ban nuclear-powered and nuclear-armedships was backed by an independent and broad-based domestic antinuclearmovement that mobilized significant public support during the three yearsleading to the election. When it entered office, Labour's mandate forbanning nuclear warships from New Zealand's ports was clear; polls showedthat about 70% of the public backed the ban. Now, however, both publicsupport for the antinuclear policy and to some extent Labour's relationswith the antinuclear movement are being strained by disagreements aboutthe importance of Wellington's alliance with the United States. A clearnon-nuclear defense policy has yet to be developed. 2 references.</TEXT></DOC>
