Inits design it is necessary to give a thorough-going study to a reductionof ranges affected by discharged warm water and minimizing the effectof discharged water on navigating ships, and in its functional aspectsas a structure for power generation, avoiding the recirculation of dischargedwarm water as well as to maintaining the operation of power stationsin case of abnormalities (concentration of dirts owing to typhoons andfloods, outbreak of a large amount of jellyfishes, etc.), and all theseaspects must be reflected in the design of cooling water channel systems.In this paper, the present situation relating to the design of coolingwater intake and outfall systems in Japan is discussed.
