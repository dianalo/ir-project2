L. Peterson; Sheep, Goat,Equine, and Poultry Diseases Staff; VS; APHIS; USDA; Room 848; FederalBuilding, 6505 Belcrest Rd., Hyattsville; MD 20782; 301-436-5140.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The National Poultry Improvement Plan (referred to below as the Plan) isa cooperative federal-state-industry mechanism for controlling poultrydiseases by identifying states, flocks, hatcheries, and dealers that meetcertain disease control standards. Customers then have the opportunityto purchase stock that are tested ``clean'' of certain diseases, or thatare produced under disease-prevention requirements.The Plan currently consists of a variety of programs to prevent and controlegg-transmitted, hatchery-disseminated poultry diseases. Participationin all Plan programs is voluntary. However, flocks, hatcheries, and dealersmust qualify as ``U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean'' before participating inany other Plan program.The regulations for this voluntary program are contained in 9 CFR Parts145 and 147 (referred to below as ``the regulations''). These provisionsare amended from time to time to incorporate new scientific informationand technologies within the Plan. The amendments that we are currentlyproposing include provisions to:1. Establish a new ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored, Turkeys'' program and emblemfor turkey flocks and products.2. Require annual examination, by State Inspectors, of all records pertainingto flocks maintained primarily for production of hatching eggs3. Lower the minimum age at which turkeys can be blood tested.4. Change certain procedures for blood testing flocks and individual birdsfor pullorum-typhoid.5. Expand and improve the sanitation and flock management requirementsof the ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored'' program for egg-type chicken breedingflocks.6. Authorize egg yolk testing as an alternative method of monitoring certainmultiplier breeding flocks classified as ``U.S. M. Gallisepticum Clean.''7. Expand procedures used to determine if a flock is infected with theMycoplasma organism for which it was tested.8. Disclaim liability for failure, on the part of users, to adhere to OccupationalSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards for formaldehyde fumigation.Our proposed amendments are consistent with recommendations approved bythe voting delegates to the June 1986 and 1988 meetings of the BiennialNational Plan Conferences. Participants at these meetings represented flockowners,breeders, hatcherymen, and Official State Agencies from all cooperatingstates.<ITAG tagnum="84">Definitions</ITAG>We propose to add definitions for the following terms to andSection; 145.1:Exposed, fluff sample, infected flock, medlay, reactor, program, and succeedingflock.Section 145.10Section 145.10 lists the terminology and illustrative designs used to designateflocks, products, and states that have qualified for certain official Planprograms under requirements specified in Subparts B through E. We proposeto add a new paragraph (k) to andSection; 145.10, containing an illustrativedesign and terminology for the proposed ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored, Turkeys''program (see the discussion under subhead <T3>Section 145.43(f) </T3>for details regarding the qualification proceduresand requirements for this proposed new Plan program).Section 145.12Section 145.12 contains criteria for the inspection of participating hatcheriesand flocks. As now written, this section's paragraph (b) requires thatat least 15 percent of the independent and affiliated flocks of each hatcherybe inspected annually. We have found, however, that many of the flocksthat are inspected are determined to be disease-free. These unnecessaryinspections waste state resources. Further, any unwarranted visit to aflock endangers the owner's biosecurity program.As a means of eliminating unnecessary inspections, we propose to requirethat State Inspectors conduct an annual examination of all records pertainingto all independent and affiliated flocks maintained primarily for productionof hatching eggs. An on-site inspection would be conducted only if a StateInspector found, during his/her examination of records, that a breach ofsanitation, blood testing, or other Plan requirements had occurred at apremises or within a flock.Section 145.14 Blood TestsMinimum ages for the taking of blood samples from various types of poultryare currently specified in andSection;andSection; 145.14(a)(4); 145.23(c)(1)(i),(c)(1)(ii), (e)(1)(i), and (3)(1)(ii); 145.33(c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), (e)(1)(i),and (e)(1)(ii); 145.43(c)(1), (d)(1)(i), (e)(1), and (e)(3); and 145.53(c)(1)(i)and (ii). For purposes of clarity, we propose to delete all of these referencesand, instead, place minimum age requirements for blood testing within theintroductory paragraph to andSection; 145.14.A minimum age limit is necessary because newly hatched poultry does nothave sufficient antibodies for reliable detection, through blood testing,of the diseases covered by the Plan. Chickens develop sufficient antibodieswhen they are more than 4 months of age; game birds develop them upon reachingsexual maturity or more than 4 months of age, whichever comes first.When the minimum age limit was established, it was thought that blood testingof turkeys would be more reliable if the birds were 4 months of age orolder. However, after consulting with turkey industry experts, we haveconcluded that turkeys that are more than 12 weeks old will have builtup sufficient antibodies for reliable blood testing. We propose, therefore,to change the minimum age for taking blood samples from turkeys, from thecurrent ``more than 4 months of age,'' to ``more than 12 weeks of age.''Section 145.14 Minimum Representative Testing SampleThe introductory paragraph to andSection; 145.14 currently closes with thesentence:<ITAG tagnum="21">For those programs where a sample of the poultry may be tested inlieu of the entire flock, the poultry tested shall be a representativesample drawn from all pens or units of the flock.</ITAG>The term ``representative sample'' is currently not defined in the regulations.Thus, a 60-bird representative sample could be two houses containing theflock and yielding 30 birds each, or ten houses yielding just 6 birds each.In the latter instance, a limited infection might easily be missed. A similarproblem exists with respect to the terms ``pens'' and ``units,'' whichare also vague and lack nationally recognized industry definitions.We propose to require a minimum representative sample of 30 birds per house,with at least 1 bird taken from all pens and units in the house. (The term``house,'' is used throughout the poultry industry to denote a structure,enclosed by walls and a roof, in which poultry are raised.) All the birdswould be tested in houses containing fewer than 30 birds.Experimental statistical survey studies have established that samples of30 birds per house will provide a high probability of detecting low levelsof infection in poultry flocks. For instance, probability studies reportedby Dr. V. Beal, Jr.\1\<NOTE/>, showed that sampling at this level will provide a 95-percentprobability of detecting a 10-percent infection (e.g. 100 infected birdsin a 1,000-bird flock).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Documernts concerning these probability studies may beobtained from Dr. V. Beal, Jr., Animal Health andamp; Depredation ManagementSystems; PPD; APHIS; USDA; Room 843; Federal Building; 6505 Belcrest Road;Hyattsville; MD 20782.Section 145.14 SalmonellaCurrent andSection; 145.1 defines the term ``Salmonella'' as ``any bacteriabelonging to the genus Salmonella, including the arizona group'' (whichcauses serious illness in turkeys and which was, until recently, consideredto be distinct from Salmonella). Thus, the current use of ``Salmonella''throughout most of andSection; 145.14(a) implies that blood testing is carriedout under the Plan for all diseases casued by all species of Salmonella.In actuality, however, the only Salmonella classification under the Planis pullorum-typhoid.We are, therefore, proposing to substitute the term ``pullorum-typhoid''for ``Salmonella''_in the current heading and in paragraphs (3), (7), and(9) of andSection; 145.14(a)_where the latter is used to refer to diseasescaused by Salmonella. The term ``pullorum-typhoid'' is used throughoutthe poultry industry since pullorum and typhoid diseases share common antigens(e.g.-any substance capable of including a specific immune response), whichare used for disease testing and identification. Current andSection; 147.5contains pullorum-typhoid testing procedures, while provisions of the ``U.S.Pullorum-Typhoid Clean'' classification are specified in current andSection;andSection;145.10(b), 145.23(b), 145.33(b), 145.43(b), and 145.53(b).We are not proposing to change ``Salmonella organisms'' in current paragraphs(9) and (10) of andSection; 145.14(a), because the use of the term in theseparagraphs is scientifically accurate.Section 145.14(a)(1)Official blood tests, approved for use in detecting pullorum-typhoid invarious classes of poultry, are listed in andSection; 145.14(a)(1). Thislist currently consists of the standard tube agglutination, microagglutination,rapid serum, and stained antigen, rapid whole-blood tests.Research conducted at the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service'sDiagnostic Bacteriology Laboratory at Ames, IA,\2\<NOTE/> demonstrated that the enzyme-labeled immunosorbent assay(ELISA) test also serves as an effective means of detecting pullorum-typhoiddiseases in poultry flocks. We propose, therefore, to add the ELISA testto the list of official blood tests for all classes of poultry. We alsopropose to reference current footnote 1 of this section (renumbered asfootnote 3 under our proposal), which provides information on publicationscontaining accepted ELISA test procedures.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Documents concerning the ELISA research at Ames may beobtained from Dr. I. L. Peterson; Sheep, Goat, Equine, and Poultry DiseasesStaff; VS; APHIS; USDA; Room 848; Federal Building; 6505 Belcrest Road;Hyattsville; MD 20782.Section 145.14(a)(5)  The last three sentences in current andSection; 145.14(a)(5) state:<ITAG tagnum="21">When reactors are found in any flock, or S. pullorum or S. gallinarumisolations are made from baby poultry or fluff samples, the flock may qualifyfor participation with two consecutive official negative tests. Qualificationof this flock, or any other flock on the same premises during the next12 months, shall be based on the testing of all birds. Such testing shallbe conducted by or directly supervised by a State Inspector.</ITAG>Under our proposal, these sentences would be deleted from andSection; 145.14(a)(5)and the requirements they contain transferred to a proposed new paragraphto be numbered andSection; 145.14(a)(6). Current paragraphs (6) through (10)of andSection; 145.14(a) would then be renumbered as (7) through (11), respectively.In addition to this restructuring our proposal would:  1. Replace the phrase ``any other flock on the same premises,'' as usedin the three sentences shown above, with ``succeeding flocks.'' The latteris defined in this proposal as flocks brought onto a premises during the12 months following the removal of an infected flock. This amendment isproposed for the purpose of clarity and does not change the meaning ofthe provision.  2. Replace vague references to required ``tests'' and ``testing'' in thethree sentences shown above, with a specific requirement for an officialblood test named in paragraph (a)(1) of andSection; 145.14. This amendmentis also proposed for the purpose of clarity and does not change the meaningof the provision.  3. Authorize qualification of a succeeding flock for participation in thePlan with a single negative result to an official blood test named in paragraph(a)(1) of andSection; 145.14. Current provisions require two consecutivenegative tests to qualify a flock in which a reactor has been found. Sincethe succeeding flock should not contain any reactors (if it does, the twotest rule would apply), we believe that a single negative test would besufficient.  4. Add a provision requiring Official State Agencies to test all birdson premises exposed to birds, equipment, supplies, or personnel from aprimary breeding flock during a period when the primary breeding flockwas exposed to <T3>S. pullorum </T3>or <T3>S. gallinarum. </T3>In determining exposure, Official State Agencieswould evaluate the probability of contacts between the primary breedingflock and (a) infected wild birds, (b) contaminated feed or waste, or (c)birds, equipment, supplies, or personnel from flocks infected with <T3>S. pullorum </T3>or <T3>Gallinarum.</T3>  We believe that this new provision is necessary because primary breedingflocks are the source of breeding stock for multiplier breeding flocks,which in turn supply replacements for meat and egg flocks. Thus, an infectionin a primary breeding flock has the capability to quickly spread into allfacets of the poultry industry.Section 145.14(a)(9)  All flocks participating in Plan programs are blood tested for pullorum-typhoid.Since false reactions are common, positive blood tests must be validated.Under current andSection; 145.14(a)(8), validation is by autopsy and bacteriologicalexamination of reactors at a laboratory ``designated by the Official StateAgency for bacteriological examination.'' This provision has been redesignatedas andSection; 145.14(a)(9) in our proposal. For purposes of simplicity,our proposal requires submission to an ``authorized laboratory'' (definedin andSection; 145.1 as ``a laboratory designated by an Official State Agency,subject to review by the Service, to perform the blood testing and bacteriologicalexaminations provided for in this part'').  Our proposal also establishes a maximum time limit_within 10 days fromthe date of reading an official blood test_for submission of these reactorsto the authorized laboratory. Pullorum-typhoid organisms may not remainviable and, therefore, not be detectable, if too much time passes betweenthe initial blood test and the subsequent bacteriological examination.We are not aware of any research that would establish a timeframe for bacteriologicalexamination or retesting. However, based on the experiences of U.S. Departmentof Agriculture laboratory scientists, we believe that the proposed 10-day-periodwould assure recovery of the pullorum-typhoid organisms.  We further proposed to provide two additional options for validating positivepullorum-typhoid blood tests: (1) Retesting the serum specimen that producedthe positive reaction, and (2) retesting reactors using an official supplementalblood test. These options will allow initial blood test results to be eithervalidated or identified as false reactions without necessitating the slaughterof reactors.  Serum testing would utilize a sample that has been diluted 40 or 50 timesfrom the original specimen. A false reaction to the full-strength specimenwill differ significantly from the result produced when the diluted specimenis tested. If the reaction to the retest is positive at the specified dilutions,the reactor and flock would be bacteriologically examined or retested usingan official blood test.  The most time consuming option would be to conduct new blood tests. Toprevent disease spread during the testing period, the flock would haveto be maintained under a security system specified or approved by the OfficialState Agency.\3\<NOTE/> If the retest is positive, the reactors and flock would bebacteriologically examined.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The security system would consist of procedures for: (a)Isolating the flock to prevent cross-contamination with other birds, equipment,or supplies on the premises; (b) sanitizing equipment and workers comingin contact with the flock; (c) restricting the movement of live birds,products, equipment, and supplies from the premises; and (d) restrictingaccess to the flock. Individual security systems will differ slightly dependingupon such factors as the proximity of other, disease-free flocks and thephysical layout of the premises.Under our proposal, the Official State Agency would select the option tobe used in each circumstance, based on a cost-benefits analysis involvingevaluation of such factors as: Ratio of reactors-to-total birds, the valueof the reactors and flocks at risk, the necessity for preserving birdsfrom scarce genetic lines, the frequency and ratio of false reactions duringrecent blood testing, the need for a quick determination of disease existence,and the cost for each retesting option versus the total availability offunds (when the state provides retesting subsidies).Paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of Sections 145.23, 145.33, 145.43, and 145.53Participants in the ``U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean'' program have flocksthat have tested negative, or that are derived from flocks that have testednegative, for pullorum-typhoid. The program's procedures for qualifyingmultiplier breeding flocks, composed of progeny of a primary breeding flockthat is intended solely for the production of multiplier breeding flocks,are contained in current paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of andSection;andSection; 145.23,145.33, 145.43, and 145.53. This paragraph requires that all flocks, forwhich qualification is sought, either be blood tested or bacteriologicallyexamined and monitored.The current bacteriological examination/monitoring program involves bacteriologicalexaminations of 10-day chick mortality and down shed by chicks in the hatcher.The current blood testing requirements are: (a) A sample comprised of atleast 25 percent of the birds in the flock has been officially blood testedwith no reactors; (b) the percentage of the flock included in the samplemay be reduced by 5 percentage points following each year in which thereis no evidence of infection on the premises until the required percentageis reduced to zero; and (c) the sample shall include at least 500 birdsthe first year, 400 the second year, 300 the third year, 200 the fourthyear, and 100 the fifth year.During the nearly two decades since these provisions were added to theregulations, conditions have changed significantly within the poultry industry.Today, virtually all new multiplier breeding flocks, and breeding flockscomposed of progeny of a primary breeding flock that is intended solelyfor the production of multiplier breeding flocks, originate from ``U.S.Pullorum-Typhoid Clean'' breeding flocks, or from flocks that meet equivalentrequirements under the supervision of an Official State Agency. Our experience,compiled during years of monitoring qualified and unqualified flocks, isthat flocks that originate from ``U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean'' or equivalentflocks can be safely qualified for participation in the ``U.S. Pullorum-TyphoidClean'' program, without blood testing or bacteriological examination/monitoring,provided no exposure to pullorum-typhoid has occurred.Under our proposal, the bacteriological monitoring requirement would bedeleted. Poultrymen seeking program qualification would not have to bloodtest a flock located on premises where either no poultry or a flock notclassified as ``U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean'' was located during the previous12 months, unless the Official State Agency determines that exposure topullorum-typhoid occurred. When a candidate flock has been exposed, anAuthorized Agent would blood test up to 300 birds. In making determinationsof exposure_and of how may birds would be blood tested_the Official StateAgency would evaluate: (a) The results of any blood tests, described inandSection; 145.14(a)(1), that were performed on an unclassified flock locatedon the premises during the previous year, (b) the origins of the unclassifiedflock, and (c) the probability of contacts between the flock for whichqualification is being sought and infected wild birds, contaminated feedor waste, or birds, equipment, supplies, or persons from or exposed toflocks infected with pullorum-typhoid.Section 145.23(d)Section 145.23 contains qualification procedures and requirements for variousofficial Plan programs for egg-type chicken breeding flocks and products.Paragraph (d) of this section contains provisions for the ``U.S. SanitationMonitored'' program, which is designed to prevent and control Salmonellosisin the egg-type chicken breeding-hatching industry. We are proposing toamend paragraph (d) as follows:1. Paragraph (d)(1)(i) currently requires that flocks originate from asource where ``sanitation and management practices, as outlined in andSection;145.23(d)(1)'' are conducted. In fact, a source flock that meets this requirementis a ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored'' flock. Therefore, for purposes of simplificationand clarity, we propose to replace the current language with a specificrequirement that the flock originate from a ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored''flock.Many flock owners, who are not Plan participants, utilize good sanitationand management practices. Under our proposal, a flock that did not originatefrom a ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored'' flock would be eligible to qualifyfor the program if:<ITAG tagnum="20">* * * the meconium from the chick boxes and a sample of the chicksthat died within 7 days after birth \4\</ITAG><NOTE/> are examined bacteriologically for Salmonella at an authorizedlaboratory. Cultures from positive samples shall be serotyped.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The number of dead chicks to be sampled would be determinedby the Official State Agency, based on the size of the flock, the rateof mortality within the flock, and the total number of dead chicks. Weare not aware of any research establishing timeframes for bacteriologicalexamination of dead chicks for Salmonella. To be effective, however, theexaminations must be performed while Salmonella organisms are viable. The7-day limitation is used by United States Department of Agriculture laboratoryscientists and had proved successful in this regard.``Meconium'' is the fecal matter collected by sexors or initially voidedby newly hatched poultry. Any Salmonella that were present in the egg shouldalso be in the meconium. ``Serotyping'' is the process of determining theexact antigenic identity of a specific organism from the roughly 2,000Salmonella known to exist.2. In the recent past, contaminated feed has been a significant sourceof Salmonella outbreaks. Current paragraph (d) recommends that flock ownersshould only use feed that has been produced by a certain manufacturingprocess, under temperatures that will destroy Salmonella. To further reducethe incidence of Salmonella organisms in feed, we propose to change thisrecommendation to a requirement, and to add additional provisions to furtherminimize post-manufacture recontamination.Current paragraph (d) recommends using only feed manufactured in pelletform, or in pellets that are then crumbled into smaller pieces. Our proposalspecifies that the pellets shall either be devoid of animal protein, orcontain animal protein products produced under the Animal Protein ProductsIndustry (APPI)/Education Salmonella Reduction Program. Salmonella organismsare much less prevalent in feed that does not contain animal protein, andthe APPI program includes manufacturing safeguards to prevent post-manufacturerecontamination.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Documents concerning the APPI/Education Salmonella ReductionProgram may be obtained from Dr. I. L. Peterson; Sheep, Goat, Equine, andPoulty Diseases Staff; VA; APHIS; USDA, Room 848, Federal Building; 6505Belcrest Road; Hyattsville, MD 20782.Current paragraph (d) recommends subjecting feed to temperatures of 190degrees F. or above during the pellet manufacturing process. However, eithertime or pressure can be factored in to destroy Salmonella at lower temperatures.Under our proposal, feed would be subjected to a temperature of 190 degreesF. or above, 165 degrees F. for at least 20 minutes, or 184 degrees F.and 70 lbs. of pressure during the pellet manufacturing process.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Documents concerning time, temperature, and pressure requirementsfor the pellet manufacturing process may be obtained by writing Dr. I.L. Peterson; Sheep, Goat, Equine, and Poultry Diseases Staff; VS; APHIS;USDA; Room 848; Federal Building; 6505 Belcrest Road; Hyattsville; MD 20782.Salmonella organisms are not destroyed during the manufacture of mash (acombination of grain and protein/vitamin supplements ground into smallparticles) feeds. But, although not as safe as pellet or crumbled feed,mash is substantially less expensive. Our proposal allows use of mash feedsbecause many flock owners could not afford to participate in the voluntary``U.S. Sanitation Monitored'' program if use of mash feeds were prohibited.This is because feed expenditures account for as much as 70 percent ofa flock owner's production costs. If a flock owner uses mash feed, we preferfor him/her to remain a participant in the ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored''program, since the program's other required sanitation and management practicesmay compensate for the failure to use only pellet feeds. We are, however,proposing to minimize the hazard from mash by restricting use of mash feedsto only mash that is either devoid of animal protein, or that containsonly animal protein products processed in a pelleting mill to destroy Salmonella.3. The illustrative ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored'' design (see current andSection;145.10(d), figure 5) is used by the breeding-hatching industry as proofthat hatching eggs and newly hatched chicks were produced by a flock maintainedunder certain sanitation and management practices to reduce the incidenceof Salmonella. We believe, however, that the current ``U.S. SanitationMonitored'' program is flawed in that it does not contain provisions fordetecting group D Salmonella in flocks that have qualified, or are qualifying,for this classification. At least one of the Salmonella organisms belongingto this group can be transmitted from an infected bird to its egg, andthen on to the resulting chick.Under our proposal, blood and environmental samples would be collectedfrom the flock and examined for group D salmonella at an authorized laboratory,using bacteriological and serological procedures described in current andSection;andSection;147.11 and 147.12 of this chapter. Cultures from positive samples wouldbe serotyped to determine the antigenic identity of the specific organisminvolved (roughly 2,000 different Salmonella are known to esist).Chickens are blood tested when the flock is more than 4 months of age (seethe discussion under subhead <T3>Section 145.14; Blood Tests</T3>). Environmental samples should becollected at the same time because blood tests will not reveal if a Salmonellaorganism, which has not yet infected any birds within the flock, is neverthelessin the flock's environment. Also, a bird may be infected, but not producingserologic reactions when a blood test is conducted.We are proposing that 300 of the birds in the flock would be blood sampledand that all birds with positive or inconclusive reactions, up to a maximumof 25 birds would be submitted to an authorized laboratory for examination.We are not aware of any research establishing a sample size for chickensblood tested, or reactors examined, for group D Salmonella. Our proposedlimits of 300 birds and 25 reactors have proven effective when used byUnited States Department of Agriculture scientists conducting similar testsfor other salmonellas. For this reason, we believe that this sampling patternwould also prove effective in testing for group D Salmonella.4. Paragraph (d) currently recommends that Official State Agencies applytwo monitoring procedures to determine the status and effectiveness ofeach flock's sanitation practices. We believe that monitoring is importantenough to be made a requirement, but also believe that the currently recommendedmonitoring procedures should be amended.The first of the current procedures involves culturing the surface of casedeggs for fecal contaminating organisms. This procedure is unnecessary,and we propose to delete it, because current regulations already providefor the sanitizing of hatching eggs.The second procedure involves periodic culturing of dead-in-shell eggs,a large category that includes: (a) Eggs in which a recognizable chickwas formed, but did not hatch; (b) eggs that were cracked, allowing entryof outside organisms; and (c) eggs, known as dead germ eggs, in which theyolk has not been completely brought into the embryo's body. We proposeto require a monthly bacteriological examination of a minimum of 30 deadgerm eggs,\7\<NOTE/> since these eggs are easier and more reliable to culturethan cracked eggs or those with more developed embryos.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Statistics demonstrating the effectiveness of testing30-egg cultures may be obtained from Dr. I. L. Peterson; Sheep, Goat, Equine,and Poultry Diseases Staff; VS; APHIS; USDA, Room 848; Federal Building;6505 Belcrest Road; Hyattsville; MD 20782.5. Several university and industry studies \8\<NOTE/> have revealed that at least one strain of <T3>Salmonella enteritidis</T3> can be transmitted from an infected birdto its egg, and then on to the resulting chick. To ensure that productssold under the ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored'' classification are free of<T3>Salmonella enteritidis</T3> safe and wholesome, we propose to amendparagraph (d) to prohibit classification of a flock if any <T3>Salmonella enteritidis</T3> organism is isolated from a bird in a breedingflock or dead-germ egg culture.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Documents concerning these research studies may be obtainedfrom Dr. I. L. Peterson; Sheep, Goat, Equine, and Poultry Diseases Staff;VS; APHIS; USDA, Room 848; Federal Building; 6505 Belcrest Road; Hyattsville;MD 20782.On the other hand, our proposal will permit classification when a <T3>Salmonella enteritidis</T3> organism is isolated from an environmentalsample collected from the flock_if certain egg and flock retesting proceduresare followed and no further positive results are found. This is becauseenvironmental contamination can result from sources other than the birdsin the flock, such as an infected mouse.Section 145.43(c)Section 145.43 contains qualification procedures and requirements for Planprograms for turkey flocks and products, including ``U.S. M. GallisepticumClean.'' Currently, flocks qualify for participation in this program onthe basis of negative blood tests, and no subsequent retesting is required.We believe that retesting is necessary to ensure the continued negativestatus of classified flocks.Under our proposal, a minimum of 30 samples from male flocks and 60 samplesfrom female flocks \9\<NOTE/> must be retested to retain a ``M. Gallisepticum Clean'' classification.Retesting would be conducted when the flock is 28-30 weeks of age in orderto reconfirm its disease-free status shortly before the start of its firstegg-laying cycle.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ This has proven to be an effective sample size when retestingfor retention of ``U.S. M. Meleagridis Clean'' classifications. The minimumsampling pattern of 30 samples from male flocks and 60 from female flockshas proven effective when used by United States Department of Agriculturelaboratory scientists conducting similar tests for similar diseases. Forthis reason, we believe that this sampling pattern would also prove effectivein testing for M. Gallisepticum.Section 145.43(f)Section 145.43 contains qualification procedures and requirements for theofficial Plan programs for turkey flocks and products. Under our proposal,a new paragraph (f) would be added to andSection; 145.43, containing proposedprovisions for a new ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored, Turkeys'' program.Our proposal is based on an actual program that has been in effect in Minnesotafor seven years. According to Minnesota poultry health officials, theirprogram has proven to be a practical and effective program for reducingthe Salmonella level in Minnesota turkeys.The proposed monitoring, testing, and management requirements for the newPlan program include:Hatchery debris (dead germ hatching eggs, fluff, and meconium collectedby sexors), a sample of the poults that died within 10 days after birth,or both would be: (a) Examined bacteriologically at an authorized laboratoryfor Salmonella as part of the qualification requirements for breeding flocksproduced by primary breeders, and (b) cultured from poults produced byhatching eggs from each flock as a means of evaluating the effectivenessof the proposed control procedures. The number of dead poults to be sampledwould be determined by the Official State Agency, based on the size ofthe flock, the rate of mortality within the flock, and the total numberof dead poults. We are not aware of any research establishing timeframesfor bacteriological examination of dead poults for Salmonella. To be effective,however, the examinations must be performed while Salmonella organismsare viable. The 10-day limitation used by United States Department of Agriculturelaboratory scientists has proven successful in this regard.<ITAG tagnum="21">Feed for turkeys in the candidate breeding flock shall meet the followingrequirements:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) All feed manufactured in pellet form must have been subjectedto temperatures of 190 degrees F. or above, 165 degrees F. for at least20 minutes, or 184 degrees F. and 70 lbs. of pressure during the manufacturingprocess.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Initial feed (for newborn poults to 2 weeks of age) shall bemanufactured in pellet form, either with no animal protein or with animalprotein products produced under the Animal Protein Products Industry/EducationSalmonella Reduction Program.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Succeeding feed (for turkeys 2 weeks or older) shall be as describedin (ii) above, mash that contains no animal protein products, or mash thatcontains an animal protein products supplement that has been manufacturedin pellet form and crumbled.</ITAG>During its initial 2 weeks of life, a young turkey is especially vulnerableto Salmonella infection and should only be fed pellets produced under theprescribed conditions, because Salmonella organisms are destroyed duringthe manufacture of this type of feed. By the third week of its life, theyoung turkey's natural immune system should be fully developed and capableof resisting colonization by the low levels of Salmonella that may be foundin a mash feed. (See paragraph No. 2, subhead <T3>Section 145.23(d) </T3>for a more detailed discussion of pellet andmash feeds.)<ITAG tagnum="21">Owners of flocks found infected with a paratyphoid Salmonella mayvaccinate these flocks with an autogenous bacterin with a potentiatingagent.</ITAG>This provision would permit use of a vaccine that contains a killed Salmonellaand an agent that produces a slow, sustained release to stimulate increasedimmunity. This type of vaccine is cultured from Salmonella already presentin the flock, with lab work and preparation often performed entirely intra-state.We propose, therefore, to footnote this provision to inform flock ownersthat preparation and use of this type of vaccine may be regulated by Stateand Federal statutes.<ITAG tagnum="21">Environmental samples shall be taken by an Authorized Agent, as describedin andSection; 147.12 * * * * and examined bacteriologically at an authorizedlaboratory for Salmonella.</ITAG>Flock owners participating in the ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored, Turkeys''program are required to comply with good sanitation and management practices.However, Salmonella organisms may be brought into a flock's environmentby wild birds, infected mice, unauthorized visitors, and other means thatare beyond the flock owner's control. Under our proposal, therefore, environmentalsampling would be conducted:1. At 12-20 weeks of age, when candidate flocks are blood tested for qualificationin the Plan's various voluntary programs.2. At 35-50 weeks of age and from each molted flock at midlay, to ensurethat the flock's environment continues to be Salmonella-free.3. After the flock is removed, to ensure that Salmonella-free birds willnot be placed in a contaminated laying house. This is necessary becausewe know that at least one Salmonella organism can be transmitted from aninfected bird through its egg to the new poult.Section 145.53(c)(1)(ii)(A)Current andSection; 145.53(c)(1)(ii)(A) describes one of two alternate testingprocedures used for retention of the ``U.S. M. Gallisepticum Clean'' classificationfor waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game bird multiplier breeding flocks.This requirement is for a random sample of serum from at least 2 percentof the birds in the flock to be tested.We propose to revise the paragraph to allow use of a random sample of eitherserum or egg yolk obtained from at least 2 percent of the birds. Egg yolktesting is currently listed_in andSection;andSection; 145.23(c)(1)(ii)(C) and145.33(c)(1)(ii)(C)_as an approved procedure for retention of the ``U.S.M. Gallisepticum Clean'' classification for egg-type and meat-type multiplierchicken breeding flocks. Egg yolk testing should have also been authorizedfor waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game birds, but was inadvertentlyoverlooked when the chicken flock uses were approved. We now propose tocorrect this lapse.This change should encourage greater participation from the gamebird segmentof the poultry industry, since it would provide another method for monitoringand testing game bird flocks, which are often difficult to test serologically.Greater participation should, in turn, lead to reduced levels of <T3>M. gallisepticum </T3>exposure, infection, and spread.Section 147.6Paragraph (b) to andSection; 147.6 contains supplemental procedures to beused when a flock tests ``suspicious'' for <T3>Mycoplasma gallisepticum, M. synoviae, </T3>and <T3>M. meleagridis. </T3>Current andSection; 147.6(b)(5) specifies that flocksshall be considered infected by the Official State Agency if HI (hemagglutinationinhibition) titers of 1:80 or SPD (serum plate dilution) titers of 1:10are found. A ``titer of 1:80'' is a positive reaction to a solution thatis 1 part serum and 80 parts saline.We believe, however, that culturing techniques should be used when a positivetest is not supported by clinical evidence. Thus, under our proposal, culturingwould be required if the supplemental tests are positive, but active airsac lesions, sinusitis, synovitis, or other clinical signs of a respiratorydisease are not evident.We also propose to add the enzyme-labeled immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testto andSection;147.6(b)(5) as an authorized supplemental test for mycoplasma.The manufacturer has included recommended titers for <T3>Mycoplasma gallisepticum, M. synoviae, </T3>and<T3> M. meleagridis</T3> in the instructions that accompany every test.We are not aware of any research establishing more effective titers forthese diseases, therefore we are proposing to adopt the manufacturer'srecommendations.Section 147.25Section 147.25 describes authorized methods of fumigating hatching eggsand hatchery equipment, including the use of formaldehyde as a fumigant.Due to concerns over possible health hazards, the Occupational Safety andHealth Administration (OSHA) has published safety standards for formaldehydeuse. Our proposed amendment to the introductory paragraph of andSection;147.25would:1. Inform readers of the regulations of the existence of the OSHA standardsand of their publication in the Dec. 4, 1987 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 46168, Docket Nos. H-225, 225A, and 225B).2. Disclaim any liability for failure on the part of the user to adhereto the OSHA standards.<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous</ITAG>We also propose to make certain nonsubstantive changes in the regulationsfor the purposes of clarity.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291,and we have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule would havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; would not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and would notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The Plan is a cooperative federal-state program. Participation is voluntary.Proposals to change provisions of this program are based on recommendationsof the Biennial National Plan Conference, which included representativesof member states, hatcheries, dealers, flock owners, and breeders. Planparticipants requested that we propose amendments to the regulations toincorporate new technology and information within the Plan.The amendments proposed in this document should not have a significanteconomic impact on the large number of small entities in the poultry industry,and should not cause significant changes in the cost of producing or buyingpoultry and poultry products, or in the amount of poultry and poultry productsmarketed because:1. The proposed annual examination of all records pertaining to flocksmaintained primarily for production of hatching eggs should enable officialState Agencies to identify more of the flocks that have incurred a possibledisease exposure. This should increase the effectiveness of the annualon-site inspection program, but will neither increase nor disease the numberof inspections conducted.2. Changing the minimum age of blood testing turkeys would permit testingone month earlier than under current rules, but will neither increase nordecrease the number of birds tested annually.3. Amendments to certain of the Plan's testing and monitoring proceduresare proposed to incorporate new technology and research findings. Thesechanges would increase effectiveness and permit use of alternative testsand montoring procedures for disease prevented and controlled by Plan programs.4. Proposed amendments to the provisions of the ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored''program would result in slight increase in producer costs for additionaltesting. However, these same amendments should result in a slight reductionin the egg and chick mortality for participating flocks. It is difficultto project the degree to which these new producer costs and savings wouldbe offset under our proposal, because the regulations would allow flockowners to choose among testing and feed alternatives. Nevertheless, weare certain that net costs or savings resulting from the changes we areproposing would be insignificant, in terms of overall productions costs,and would not affect the wholesale or retail cost of poultry or poultryproducts.5. Cost-benefits to producers who decide to participate in the proposednew ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored, Turkey'' program would also roughly balanceout. Producers would incur a small additional cost for required sanitationmeasures (although many producers are already engaging in some or all ofthese sanitation practices). The primary purpose of these measures is toreduce the incidence of Salmonella in the flock, but reduced Salmonellalevels would, in turn, result in a slight increase in the number of survivingeggs and poults. The experience of the turkey industry in Minnesota_wherea ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored, Turkeys'' program has been underway forseven years_is that profits from the sale of the additional eggs and poultsroughly equals the cost of the additional sanitation measures.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Services has determined that this proposed rule would not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 9 CFR Parts 145 and 147</ITAG>Animal diseases, National Poultry Improvement Plan, Poultry and poultryproducts.Accordingly, we propose to amend regulations contained in 9 CFR Parts 145and 147 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 145_NATIONAL POULTRY IMPROVEMENT PLAN</ITAG>1.
