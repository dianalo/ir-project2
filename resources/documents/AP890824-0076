Police headquarters reported unrest in nine black and mixed-racetownships near Cape Town and said four officers had been injured inrioting. Numerous clashes were reported between stone-throwingyouths and police units using tear gas and whips.   Anti-apartheid leaders coordinating the defiance campaign accusedthe government of distorting their intentions, and they challengedacting President F.W. de Klerk to face one of them in a nationallytelevised debate. There was no immediate response from de Klerk'soffice to the challenge, announced at a news conference inJohannesburg.   The white women, members of the Black Sash civil rightsorganization, stood in a market square in central Cape Town withbanners that read, ``One Person, One Vote,'' and ``Defiance is theRight To Peaceful Protest.''   Police declared the demonstration illegal understate-of-emergency regulations and ordered the women to disperse.When they refused to do so, they were led into a police bus.   Among those arrested was Mary Burton, president of the BlackSash. The nationwide group runs assistance centers for blacks andregularly stages anti-government demonstrations.   About 200 bystanders, both black and white, cheered in support ofthe Black Sash as the women were arrested.   At the University of Cape Town, about 1,000 students, black andwhite, marched across a highway bordering the campus before beingdispersed by police sing whips and tear gas. Many of the studentsregrouped and marched back to the campus behind a protester carryingthe black-green-and-gold flag of the outlawed African NationalCongress guerrilla movement.   Since anti-apartheid groups launched the mass defiance campaignAug. 2, there have been almost daily confrontations between policeand demonstrators in the Cape Town area.   Police have broken up many protests, often with tear gas, andarrested and detained dozens of activists. Anglican ArchbishopDesmond Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, was among thosetear-gassed at a demonstration Wednesday.   The protesters are attempting to end segregation of hospitals,schools, neighborhoods, beaches and other facilities.   Organizers have planned rallies to protest an international rugbyteam that is touring South Africa and scheduled to play the nationalsquad in Cape Town on Saturday. Anti-apartheid groups say the tourbreaks the international sports boycott imposed to protest apartheid.</TEXT></DOC>
