(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Black andamp; Decker Corp. says it may submitanother takeover bid for American Standard Inc., which isconsidering rival bids to the power tool maker's $2.27 billionoffer.   American Standard says it has at least one all-cash bid of morethan $75 per share. Black andamp; Decker's hostile tender offer is for$73 a share.   The plumbing and air conditioning maker has said it wasnegotiating with several potential buyers, including one willing topay at least $2.4 billion.   American Standard's board was meeting today to considerdefinitive bids arising out of talks with other suitors,spokeswoman Lois Stewart said.   The result of the meeting was considered pivotal to the outcomeof a six-week takeover battle that has pushed American Standard'sstock price from $38 to an all-time high above $75 a share.   In a related development today that might influence the fight, ajudge in Delaware, where American Standard is incorporated, granteda Black andamp; Decker request at least temporarily prohibiting AmericanStandard from making defensive changes in its retirement andseverence pay plan.   Black andamp; Decker had argued the changes would cost the companymore money only if it were acquired by a third party, whileproducing little effect under a recapitalization plan AmericanStandard is considering, said Black andamp; Decker attorney Robert Zimet.   On Tuesday, Black andamp; Decker spokeswoman Barbara Lucas said thecompany was reviewing internal financial information supplied byAmerican Standard and was expected to make a decision on whether tooffer a new bid.   If Black andamp; Decker doesn't submit a new bid, it would be takingthe chance that American Standard's management might strike a dealwith another bidder, she acknowledged.   Industry analysts said that American Standard's internalfive-year growth projections, made public by Black andamp; Decker Monday,appeared to back a bid in the $75-a-share range.   ``Taken at face value, these numbers seem to support a bidhigher than $73, but it's hard to say whether they support a bidhigher than $75,'' said Franklin Morton, of Alex. Brown andamp; Sons inBaltimore. ``There's a significant downside to these numbersbecause they're based on a pretty optimistic scenario.''   He said a $73 bid would enhance Black andamp; Decker's aim ofbroadening its earnings base but questioned whether that objectivewould be reached at a higher price.   Other analysts noted that American Standard's estimates arebased on a business climate similar to that of the past year.   Cornelius Sewell, an analyst at Argus Securities in New York,said the projections don't reflectthe cyclical downturn expected toaffect the building supplies industry, to which American Standardsells air-conditioning and plumbing products.   Katherine Stults, an analyst at Dean Witter, said a bid in the$75 range might be attractive to a company that specializes inbuying going concerns and selling them off in parts.   There has been little speculation over the identity of AmericanStandard's potential suitors. Wickes Cos. Inc., a majorhome-improvement and furnishings company based in Santa Monica,Calif., has been mentioned, as well as Textron Inc., a $7 billionaerospace, automotive products and financial services conglomeratebased in Providence, R.I. Hanson Trust PLC, a $10 billion Londonindustrial management conglomerate, has also been mentioned as apossible white knight.</TEXT></DOC>
