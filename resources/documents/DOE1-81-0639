A close scrutiny of latest statistics reveals greater US relianceon OPEC, Arab OPEC member countries, and lighter crude oils. These shiftsalso reflect greater US import reliance on the more-distant sources ofsupply -- producers with competitive production economics and increasinglycompetitive marketing operations. Would future higher crude oil pricesreverse these developments? This issue also contains the following: (1)ED refining netback data for the US Gulf and West Coasts, Rotterdam,and Singapore, for late Feb. 1988; and (2) ED fuel price/tax series forcountries of the Eastern Hemisphere, Feb. 1988 edition.
