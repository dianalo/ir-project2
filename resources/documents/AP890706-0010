The homeless were evicted because of a new city regulation tookeffect Wednesday banning residential structures, such as tents, fromcity parks.   Later, hundreds of East Villagerfs began surrounding the park aspolice wearing helmets with visors tried to keep the entrances tothe park blocked.   The mood was tense but there were no immediate reports ofwidespread clashes. There were some reports of bottle-throwing.   Earlier, about 100 people shouting ``It's our park!'' staged animpromptu march around the park as the raid got underway.   The homeless people apparently did not resist and police reportedno arrests.   Dozens of homeless people live in the park, which was the site ofa seven-hour riot last Aug. 7, when police tried to enforce a curfewthat was later revoked. Fifty-two police officers and 18 civiliansrequired hospital treatment after the clash; 115 complaints ofpolice brutality were filed.   The controversial regulation that went into effect Wednesday wasproposed by the Department of Parks and Recreation and had beenopposed by homeless people and advocates for the homeless.   Alan Moss, a Parks Department deputy commissioner, was at thepark while the eviction was carried out and said: ``This is notaimed at the homeless who have been using parks. It is aimed atgetting rid of permanent structures. When you see a big spike beingdriven into a tree and boards being nailed together, that doesn'tbelong in a park.''   He said the new rule would not stop a homeless person fromsleeping on a park bench or on the grass.   Human Resources Administration workers were on the scene withvans so that those who wanted could go to city shelters.   The raid began at about 8:30 p.m.</TEXT></DOC>
