Scott Black, the value-minded president of DelphiManagement, is jumping in with both feet. &quot;Usually the timeto buy is six months before the next product cycle,&quot; he says.That time is now.</LP><TEXT>   Amdahl expects to start shipping the first versions of itsnew, 5995 M mainframe in December. Assuming no seriousglitches arise, sales will start in earnest a few monthslater.   At that time, Mr. Black expects that the Street will,predictably, revalue Amdahl's shares to reflect its suddenlyimproved earnings. The company is expected to earn only about30 cents or so a share in 1991. But if the 5995 M succeeds,earnings could skyrocket to $1.50 a share in 1992 and to$2.50 a share in 1993, according to some analysts. And if oneaccepts such forecasts, shares of the Sunnyvale, Calif.,computer maker would seem cheap at yesterday's close of$14.25.   &quot;We think it's time to buy,&quot; says Prudential Securities'Rick Martin. &quot;We're at the bottom of a normal, predictableearnings cycle.&quot;   It is indeed certain that Amdahl is at the bottom. Itsthird-quarter earnings, recently announced, fell a cool 88%.It also seems a good bet that Amdahl's earnings are, someday, bound to improve. The company's bottom line is harnessedto its product cycle; like hemlines, it rarely stays up ordown for long. But the Street is by no means convinced thatnow is the time to buy. &quot;You have to get past two poorquarters,&quot; says Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch. &quot;I'd wait'til they get closer.&quot; Similarly, Don Young, of ShearsonLehman, recommends that investors &quot;wait until we get closerto deliveries of the 5995 M.&quot;   Investors have no way of knowing how early is &quot;too early;&quot;they are probably well advised not to try. If the stock, asPrudential's Mr. Martin figures, is on the way to 30, no onewill care whether they bought it six months too soon. Buyingtoo late, on the other hand, would guarantee an investor ahigh price and a reserved seat for the next cyclical plunge.   That points to a larger question. Is Amdahl merely gearingup for a short-term rise? Or can an investor buy, hold, andsleep soundly? Mr. Black insists that the current cycle couldlast four years, and that he isn't buying the stock to tradein-and-out. &quot;It's more than just a cyclical play,&quot; he says.&quot;Every four or five years they have doubled revenues.&quot; Thisis true, although Amdahl has an uneven record of translatingrevenue to the bottom line. For a long-term investor, thestock's price has done reasonably well, though not heroically-- almost doubling since the end of 1985. Shareholder valueas measured by Amdahl's book value has advanced at a creep.Book value was $9.63 a share at the end of 1985 and $12.36 atthe middle of 1991.   The chief attraction now, Mr. Black says, is that Amdahlhas &quot;built a better machine.&quot; Though it comes in many sizes,a spokesman says a typical, four-unit model of the 5995 Mwill be able to handle 204 million instructions a second.What, in laymen's terms, does that mean? &quot;It means it'sfaster than hell,&quot; the spokesman says.   He adds that it weighs 17,900 pounds, comes in a handsomeoff-white, and should sell for something less than a listprice of $19.4 million. Analysts say that 5995 M will delivermore brainpower for the dollar than the competition, chieflyInternational Business Machines. But the risks are many.   Most 5995 Ms will be sold to big companies that also buymainframes from IBM -- which overwhelmingly dominates themarket. IBM increasingly has been discounting, forcing Amdahlto spend heavily to adapt and stay compatible with Big Blue.And in the past, IBM has burned Amdahl by changing itsso-called architecture, forcing Amdahl to spend heavily toadapt.   &quot;It's an impressive machine,&quot; says Shearson's Mr. Young.&quot;But whether Amdahl can live in a world where IBM may berolling out radical changes in architecture is a seriousconcern.&quot; There is also the risk of technical glitches, andthe risk that the overall market for mainframes will besmaller than forecast.   On this point, the company is sanguine. Various expertshave been burying the mainframe for years. &quot;Its death, widelyreported in the press, is not expected by most mainframecustomers,&quot; Mr. Young says. Amdahl's earnings have slumpedwith the aging of its previous product cycle, but the companysays it doesn't see evidence that the on-again, off-againU.S. recession is crimping demand.   Whether Amdahl, founded 20 years ago by a former IBMmainframe designer, can gain market share is anotherquestion. In the '80s, it gained share in Europe, where itpreviously lagged, but future market share gains will betougher. And if it can't gain share, Amdahl is apt to to takeanother big ride-up and down.   ---   Amdahl Corp.
