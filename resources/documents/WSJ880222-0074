World Bank President Barber Conable urged member governments to ratify the plan quickly, so that the bank can step up its lending to Third World nations from about $14.2 billion annually to about $20 billion. The decision marks the third increase of the agency's capital resources since 1959.    Although formal ratification may take several months, the World Bank will ask the appropriate officials of member countries to approve the agreement by April 30.    The largest subscriptions will come from the major Western industrial nations, with the U.S. share amounting to 18.2%, or about $13.6 billion. However, only about 3% of that amount will actually be paid to the agency. Most of the World Bank's capital is in the form of &quot;callable&quot; funds, which are unlikely to be tapped but allow the agency to borrow in world markets through highly rated debt issues.    In his budget, released last week, President Reagan asked Congress to authorize the initial $70.9 million installment of paid-in capital for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. </TEXT></DOC>
