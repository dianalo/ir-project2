These periodic screeds will, accordingto the Democrats, &quot;profile George Bush and the RepublicanParty at work -- on issues ranging from BCCI and the OctoberSurprise to bank and pension fund mismanagement.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   It's the newest gambit in a long and blatantly partisangame. The rules are simple: Each party tries to pin the blamefor the latest Washington scandal on the other. In the caseof Bank of Credit andamp; Commerce International, as &quot;Mess Watch&quot;shows, Democrats are attempting to blame the Reagan and Bushadministrations for failing to stop the bank's allegedservice for drug dealers, gunrunners and terrorists.Republicans, meanwhile, have been busy publicizing thealleged ties between BCCI and top Democrats. The same goesfor the continuing savings-and-loan scandals.   With power split between the Republican White House andthe Democratic-controlled Congress, &quot;It's you-kick-us,we-kick-you,&quot; says Republican strategist Eddie Mahe. Butbecause members of both parties are caught in the same web ofpolitical fund raising and special-interest lobbying so oftenat the heart of any scandal, it's rare that either side comesto a mud fight with clean hands -- or that either one leavesundirtied.   &quot;Democrats' ability to exploit these kind of issues isvery limited because we are in so many cases complicitourselves,&quot; says party activist Susan Estrich. &quot;When thespecial interests are doling out money, they're doling out toboth sides.&quot;   And if the past is any guide, this game ofpin-the-scandal-on-the-other-party will only intensifyvoters' scorn for both. Last fall's election results showedvoters nationwide to be in a cynical, anti-incumbent moodwithout regard to party; nearly all incumbents werere-elected, but many by some of the lowest percentages oftheir careers.   &quot;The way money flows in Washington today, neither partywinds up in a position to draw lines for the public aboutmajor scandals,&quot; says Fred Wertheimer of Common Cause.   Still they try, if only because occasionally they succeedin toppling an officeholder here or there. Such partisanwarfare over ethics is nothing new. Especially in the late19th century, the national government was rocked repeatedlyby scandals involving land deals, stock speculation andrailroad schemes. But in the past several years, an unusuallylarge number of ethical imbroglios has left Congress roilingin partisan strife and GOP administrations on the defensive.   To a degree not always apparent to the public, seeminglyunrelated allegations are, indeed, linked -- by the fact thatthe party hurling a charge is only retaliating for an earlierattack from the opposition. In a sense, the currenttit-for-tat over the Sandamp;L and BCCI scandals continues thehigh-stakes ethical warfare that in 1989 claimed, in turn,former Republican Sen. John Tower and Democratic HouseSpeaker James Wright.   Senate Democrats killed President Bush's nomination of thelate Mr. Tower to be the defense secretary amid accusationsof the Texan's excessive drinking, womanizing and cozinesswith defense contractors. Vengeful Republicans turned to theHouse, where Mr. Wright already faced an internal probe ofhis financial links to political supporters -- a probesparked in part by GOP Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia. Thetempest they helped fan ultimately caused both the speakerand the third-ranking House Democrat, Tony Coelho ofCalifornia, to resign.   Mr. Wright, in his farewell address, implored both partiesto cease the &quot;mindless cannibalism.&quot; Yet Mr. Gingrichimmediately targeted other Democrats, while a House Democrat,in turn, pursued an ethics complaint against him. The Houseethics committee found no basis for punishing Mr. Gingrich,and his Republican colleagues elected him their No. 2 leader.But his suburban Atlanta constituents felt neglected. Mr.Gingrich, who aspired to lead a GOP takeover of a corruptCongress, instead nearly lost his own seat in last fall'selections.   The 1990 campaigns illustrated the unpredictable path thatpartisan arrows follow in a scandal. The Democrats sought tomake Neil Bush, the president's son, a partisan symbol of theSandamp;L debacle (the younger Mr. Bush was on the board of afailed Colorado thrift). But Democratic lawmakers soon feltthe issue's sting themselves, as Republicans aggressivelytried to blame the Democratic Congress. The result: Neitherparty gained or lost many seats on the issue.   Republicans are now crying foul over congressionalDemocrats' call for hearings on allegations that the 1980Reagan campaign secretly negotiated to delay the release ofU.S. hostages in Iran, thwarting an &quot;October surprise&quot; thatwould help Democrat Jimmy Carter win re-election. That hasonly fueled Republicans' determination to link Mr. Carter andother leading Democrats to BCCI; late last month, House GOPLeader Robert Michel requested an inquiry by the GeneralAccounting Office, an arm of Congress.   But in Congress, it is a Democrat who gets the most creditfor exposing the allegations against BCCI -- MassachusettsSen. John Kerry. And he lays blame at the White House, forignoring that evidence in recent years. In turn, he claims,Republicans are trying to smear him. GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch ofUtah released a report that, among other things, highlightedthe ties between Sen. Kerry and other Democrats to partymoney-man David Paul, whose failed Miami savings-and-loanassociation was in part owned by BCCI. Mr. Hatch denies anypartisan motives.   Earlier this year, Senate GOP Leader Robert Dole blastedDemocratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum for seeking &quot;partisanpolitical advantage&quot; in his investigations of Sandamp;Ls withpredominantly GOP ties. Sen. Dole and other Republicans wereparticularly outraged that, shortly before Arizona's runoffelection for governor last March, Sen. Metzenbaum heldhearings into an Sandamp;L that had ties to GOP candidate FifeSymington (Mr. Symington won anyway).   Last year, the Senate Ethics Committee rejected its ownspecial counsel's recommendation that the sole Republican,Arizona Sen. John McCain, be dropped from an investigation ofinfluence peddling by former thrift owner Charles Keating.Republicans charged that Democrats were holding Sen. McCainhostage so the scandal would not become an all-Democraticaffair. And when the panel this month dropped aninvestigation into New York GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato'sdealings with contributors and constituents, there wererumors of a partisan horse trade in return for soft treatmentof the Keating Democrats.   Reformers say all this energy should be directed intopassing campaign-finance-overhaul legislation that could helpslow the dizzying pace of Washington money scandals. But apartisan standoff has prevented passage of such a bill fornearly a decade. Predictably, Republicans and Democrats eachblame the other.</TEXT></DOC>
