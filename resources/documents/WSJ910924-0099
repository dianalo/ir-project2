The effect was preciselythe opposite. He said he'd spent the morning lobbying for theRepublican alternative to the Democratic proposals to extendunemployment benefits. If he had an agenda, he'd be talkingabout solving the problem of unemployment by creating jobs.   The domestic agenda was the price Mr. Bush paid for the1990 budget deal. It may be that the President had littlechoice but to propitiate Congress while trying to buildsupport for the Gulf War, but clearly the Democrats are nowsetting the terms of the domestic debate. With only agrudging recovery from recession, the Democrats have thePresident where they want him. Indeed, they can toy with him.</LP><TEXT>   First they pass a bill &quot;authorizing&quot; the President tospend more money on unemployment insurance, beyond thepresent 26 weeks of coverage and 13 weeks of extra coverage.He refuses to veto, accepting the principle, and refuses tospend the money, accepting the blame. Now the Democratspropose an outright 20-week extension of benefits;Republicans are left to propose 10 weeks at half the cost,and the President spends the morning manning the phones.   The House bill would cost an estimated $6.3 billion, andit passed by more than the votes needed to override a veto.The Senate bill would cost some $5.8 billion, while theRepublican alternative would cost $2.5 billion. TheRepublican version would be financed by selling unused radiofrequencies; the House bill simply ignores the purportedfinancing requirements of the budget deal. The Republicansare marginally more fiscally responsible than Democrats, andhalf as &quot;compassionate.&quot; This is, of course, their historicposture.   For a short time in the 1980s, under a President who oncewaited tables at Eureka College, Republicans not only managedto understand that the truly compassionate thing is to makesure there are jobs for the unemployed to find, but evenmanaged to make the issue a winning one. Today, Washington'sRemocrats and Depublicans are too busy forging consensus totalk about how to boost the economy.   About the closest they can come to economic policy isagreeing to blame the limp recovery on the Federal Reserve,which has been doing what it is supposed to, controllinginflation. We now have the spectacle of Senate BankingCommittee Chairman Don Riegle, fresh from the EthicsCommittee's rejection of its counsel's recommendation todiscipline him for his Keating Five involvement, agreeing toco-sponsor a bill attacking the Fed's district-bankpresidents. The district presidents shouldn't vote onmonetary policy, the notion runs, because they've neveraccepted a political contribution.   If anyone in Washington wanted to stimulate a morevigorous recovery, the formula is no mystery. First, you needa reasonable flow of credit. So get Congress out of thebank-regulatory process, either in its Keating Five mode orthe subsequent no-loans mode. Second, established companiesget more efficient by paring their work forces, so you needrising new companies to put people to work. So you cut thecapital-gains tax.   Even pessimistic estimates of the cost of this step, bythe way, are in the same range as the costs of thedole-extension bills. In 1988, the Congressional BudgetOffice estimated that cutting the capital-gains rate to 15%would cost between $3.9 billion and $7.8 billion, dependingon which methodology you believe. Even the CBO added thecaveat that none of its methodologies contemplated all of therevenue feedbacks from the tax cut: &quot;Other components of thetax base, or even the size of the economy, would change as aresult of changes in the capital gains tax rates.&quot; In otherwords, this measure could possibly end up costing nothing,and in the process give the unemployed jobs instead of abigger dole.   The Bush administration knows this, of course, andformally favors a lower capital-gains rate, though oneMickey-Moused up with timing restrictions. But theadministration puts a higher priority on defending thevirginity of the budget compromise. And we're asked tobelieve that the budget deal outlaws a capital-gains cut,though apparently not a bigger dole. This stance is defendedas necessary to curtail the deficit, which has of coursesoared since the stance was adopted, to about $280 billion infiscal 1991 and $340 billion-$380 billion in fiscal 1992.   President Bush is apparently headed for re-electionanyway; why should he pick a fight? Because whether or not heneeds a domestic agenda, the nation needs one. Because, aboveall, the unemployed need one.</TEXT></DOC>
