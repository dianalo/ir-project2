Forsht, Project Officer,Chemicals Industry Branch, Industrial Technology Division (WH-552), EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20406; (202) 382-7190.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On November 5, 1987, EPA promulgatedregulations for the organic chemicals, plastics, and synthetic fibers (OCPSF)manufacturing point source category (52 FR 42522).<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Correction of Technical Errors</ITAG>Today's amendments to the July 1, 1988 Code of Federal Regulations correcttypographical errors and delete misleading language regarding the applicabilityof the OCPSF regulations in Appendices A and B to Part 414.The effluent limitations listed in andSection; 414.91 include duplicate entriesfor two pollutants. The second entry for 1,2-dichloroethane is correctedto read 1,1-dichloroethane; the second entry for 1,1,1-trichloroethaneis corrected to read 1,1,2-trichloroethane.The final regulations apply to wastewater discharges from the manufactureof OCPSF product/processes. See 40 CFR 414.11(a). OCPSF manufacture consistsof chemical syntheses such as esterification, hydroacetylation, and oxidationand chemical engineering processes such as distillation and extraction.See Industry Description_Section III of the October 1987 ``DevelopmentDocument for Effluent Limitations and Standards for the Organic Chemicals,Plastics, and Synthetic Fibers Point Source Category,'' (EPA 440/1-87/009).In contrast, the regulations do not apply to the formulation of chemicalproducts through blending and mixing operations. See page 102478, Vol.I-30 of the 1987 OCPSF Public Record. Therefore, since the OCPSF regulationsdo not apply to production consisting exclusively of blending, mixing andformulation of purchased raw materials, several references purporting toinclude or exclude blending and mixing operations in Appendices A and Bwere erroneous and hence are being deleted.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Revocation of Bis (2-chloroisopropyl) ether Limitations</ITAG>In accordance with an order issued by the United States Court of Appealsfor the Fifth Circuit on June 27, 1988, the Environmental Protection Agencytoday revokes the bis (2-chloroisopropyl) ether limitations of 40 CFR Part414 promulgated on November 5, 1987 (52 FR 42522).As a result of the Agency's review of the data base occasioned by the petitionsfor review filed in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals (No. 87-4849, <T3>et al.</T3>), the Agency has determined that it has committed proceduralerrors in promulgating the effluent limitations guidelines and standardsfor bis (2-chloroisopropyl) ether. Upon consideration of these errors,EPA has concluded that reconsideration of the effluent limitations guidelinesand standards for this pollutant is warranted.EPA will either decide to re-promulgate effluent limitations guidelinesand standards for this pollutant (after notice and comment), or alternatively,determine that national regulation of this pollutant is unwarranted. Untilany new effluent limitations guidelines and standards are promulgated,any decision as to whether and how to regulate this pollutant at a particulardirect discharging plant would be made by a permit-issuing authority ona case-by-case basis, as provided by section 402 of the Clean Water Act,33 U.S.C. 1342.The order issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuitrequires EPA to revoke the bis (2-chloroisopropyl) ether limitations. Therefore,the Agency finds that public participation in this revocation is unnecessaryand contrary to the public interest. The amendment set forth below is tobe effective June 29, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Executive Order 12291</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires EPA and other agencies to perform regulatoryanalyses of major regulations. Major rules are those which impose a coston the economy of $100 million or more annually or have certain other economicimpacts. This action is not a major rule because it merely corrects errorsand revokes a portion of an existing regulation and imposes no new requirements;thus, it meets none of the criteria of a major rule as set forth in section1(b) of the Executive order. This rule was submitted to the Office of Managementand Budget for review.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>requires EPA and other agencies to prepare an initialregulatory flexibility analysis for all proposed regulations that havea significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. No regulatoryflexibility analysis is required, however, where the head of the Agencycertifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities. Based on the reasons discussedin the preceding paragraph, I hereby certify, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b),that this regulation will not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3500<T3>et seq., </T3>EPA must submit a copy of any rule that contains a collectionof information requirement to the Director of the Office of Managementand Budget for review and approval. This correction and revocation noticecontains no additional information collection requirements, and thereforethe Paperwork Reduction Act is not applicable.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI.
