Forlani replaces Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita as partysecretary, despite De Mita's statements that Forlani is tooconservative for his government.   In a speech earlier Wednesday, De Mita criticized Forlani's callfor closer links with conservative Roman Catholic groups and saidthe party could go into an electoral decline as it did in themid-1970s.   De Mita also said he would remain head of the government only ifhe receives backing for his policies aimed at cutting the hugepublic deficit.   Forlani's election marked a return to a more traditionalleadership of the party. De Mita is considered part of the party'sleft wing, and Forlani is a moderate.   The new party secretary promised not to bring down De Mita's10-month-old government, a coalition that includes the Socialists,Liberals, Social Democrats and Republicans.   Forlani, 63, the only candidate for the post, won about 85percent of the votes cast by more than 1,300 delegates, according toan announcement by the president of the party congress, AmintoreFanfani.   In a speech after his election, Forlani referred to thecontroversy over De Mita's being head of both the party and thegovernment. Some party members felt the arrangement concentrated toomuch power in one person's hands.   ``What then is (the debate about) this dichotomy?'' Forlani askeda cheering crowd of delegates. ``Is it ... for reasons of jealousy,a thing of personality, factions or ambition?''   Turning to De Mita, he said: ``I believe that in our relationsthere will never be room for elements of this kind.''   As secretary of the Christian Democrats, Forlani will directparty policy and preside over a vast patronage system that includestop jobs in state industry, banking and radio and television.   Forlani, 63, was secretary of the party from 1969-73 and laterserved eight months as premier, resigning in 1981 when Italyunderwent its worst postwar political scandal.   He stepped down as premier when two members of his Cabinet werelinked to the Propaganda Due (P-2) Masonic lodge, which was accusedof plotting to overthrow Italy's constitutional system. Forlani wasnever accused of membership.   The Christian Democrats have dominated every government for fourdecades.</TEXT></DOC>
