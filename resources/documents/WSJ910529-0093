Starting today, many U.S. government bond traders will beshouting buy and sell orders into a new computerized tradingsystem trained to recognize human voices. If the computerscan decipher the traders' rapid-fire speech, the machineswill match buy and sell orders electronically.</LP><TEXT>   The voice-recognition trading system, one of the first tobe used on Wall Street, is being launched by EJV BrokerageInc., whose parent is a joint venture of six of the nation'slargest securities dealers. EJV, which stands for ElectronicJoint Venture, has been working for several months to ironout the bugs. Its top officials think they now have a winner.   Dealers who like the voice-recognition technology hope itwill slash the amount of money they pay to the small group ofbond brokers who serve as intermediaries in trades betweendealers. By some estimates, bond brokers receive about $250million to $350 million a year in commissions from dealers.   &quot;We're never going to eliminate the need for peoplecompletely, but we're confident that we can gain asignificant market share&quot; in parts of the huge U.S.government securities market, said Richard K. MacWilliams,president of EJV Brokerage. He said EJV's commission rateswill be &quot;about 20% to 80% lower&quot; than existing bond brokers'rates, depending on the type of issue being traded.Initially, trading on EJV's system will be limited toTreasury bills and Treasury notes due in three years or less.Longer-term notes and bonds will be included later this year.   But some bond dealers fear that even the smartestcomputers will have trouble understanding commands ofhyperactive traders, whose voices have been known to risedramatically under tension.   Indeed, EJV officials say that the system's computerswould have trouble recognizing the voice of a trader strickenby a sudden bout of laryngitis. But they say the ailingtrader can fix that in a jiffy by teaching the computer torecognize his altered voice. Or the traders can type commandson a customized keypad.   What about imposters? EJV's Mr. MacWilliams acknowledgesthat he has learned to imitate a colleague's voice wellenough to use that person's computer. But he says the samepotential problem exists now when traders deal on thetelephone. And, perhaps more important, imposters would havean especially tough time using EJV's system because theywould have to know the exact commands to work the computer,he says.   James Rice, president of the government securities firmAubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., already has discovered that it isn'teasy to break into the system. When he recently tried, thecomputers refused to accept his commands. But, as he pointsout, &quot;Most of the people on the desk are from New Jersey andNew York, and I'm from Missouri. I have a bit of a southernaccent, and so, for me, the fail-safe system worked fine.&quot;   Voice-activated trading already has been used for severalyears at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a limited partner inEJV. For example, voice-activated trading technology has beenused &quot;very successfully&quot; on Shearson's government-bondtrading desk and in &quot;several back-office applications,&quot; saysa Shearson spokeswoman.   She says Shearson's computers are so smart that they &quot;canadapt to any person's speech patterns. People can talk asrapidly as they want, and the computer will adapt. Thecomputer also recognizes the trader's commands even duringthe busiest and noisiest trading hours on the floor.&quot;   EJV's voice-recognition system was developed with VerbexVoice Systems Inc., an Edison, N.J.-based company. EJV'scolor monitors have been installed at &quot;nearly all&quot; of thelargest bond dealers, said D. Bruce Peterson, chief executiveof EJV Partners, the parent firm.</TEXT></DOC>
