James Dickerson. ``Wespend money and time looking for people and then they're right backout.''   Frank Washington, 32, of Pittsburgh, had been sought by citypolice since January in a series of burglaries.   Detectives arrested him May 15 after tracking him to a bar, andhe was released from Allegheny County Jail two days later. Becauseof overcrowding, Washington did not have to post his $20,000 bond.   Police Cmdr. Ronald Freeman complained that the court order onjail population, issued by U.S. District Judge Maurice Cohill,allows criminals to return to the streets.   ``I certainly believe Judge Cohill has contributed greatly toour crime statistics,'' Freeman said.   The judge consistently refuses to comment on the issue.   Warden Charles Kozakiewicz said he had no choice but to freeWashington under the judge's order _ he was among the prisonerswith the lowest bonds and was not accused of any of 14 seriouscrimes that warrant keeping inmates in jail despite their bonds.   ``It's distasteful to me and certainly not to my liking torelease anybody from jail,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
