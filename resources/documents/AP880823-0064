Authorities earlier announced a curfew tonight on Jastrzebie,the city at the center of strikes that began a week ago and spreadto coal mines, factories, ports and transportation facilitiesemploying 100,000 people.   Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, saying at least 20 illegalstrikes have threatened anarchy in the country, announced Mondaythat law enforcement forces would secure major industrialfacilities and that he had empowered provinces to impose curfews inthe Katowice, Szczecin and Gdansk areas.   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban, who announced the date of theparliament meeting at a news conference today, said the sessionwould consider the entire economic situation and perhaps makeadjustments in national price and income policies.   Strikers have demanded higher pay and reinstatement ofSolidarity, the outlawed independent trade federation.   Urban said there have been 49 detentions by police nationwide inconnection with the strikes, most of them ``preventative.''   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa today again appealed for talksbetween authorities and his union.   ``Solidarity remains steadfast in its search for dialoguedespite the growing social tensions,'' he said on a tape broughtout of the strikebound Lenin shipyard in Gdansk where he spent thenight. ``The present situation in the country has become extremelyserious. The just protest of the workers must not be ignored.''   Urban told reporters talks with Walesa were impossible whilestrikes were going on.   New strikes began at two coal mines Monday night and there was abrief work stoppage today at the Nowa Huta steel mill near Krakow,authorities said.   The state-run news agency PAP reported that workers voluntarilyended a strike today at a railroad car factory in Wroclaw.Solidarity sources in Wroclaw said earlier that the strike wascontinuing.   Partial streetcar traffic resumed in the port city of Szczecintoday after police dislodged strikers from depots Monday night,according to PAP, but bus service still was affected by a strike.Army troops were operating buses.   The 11 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew was announced for Jastrzebie, site ofthe first coal mine strike Aug. 16 and headquarters of theInter-Mine Strike Committee, by Katowice provincial spokesmanRyszard Gil. The province is Poland's industrial and mining center.   In the first forcible action against strikers, riot policeevicted scores from two streetcar depots and a bus depot Mondaynight in Szczecin, and strike leaders said more than 150 peoplewere arrested.   On Monday night, Kiszczak said authorities were dutybound toprevent the return to ``the situation before 1981,'' when theyimposed martial law to crush Solidarity.   The speech came after workers at the Lenin shipyard launchedtheir second strike of the year. Dockworkers in the Baltic portalso began a sit-in strike Monday.   Solidarity leaders said they were joined by workers at severalof Poland's largest factories, including the Ursus tractor plantand the Huta Warszawa steel mill in Warsaw, the Cegielski turbineworks in Poznan and the Stalowa Wola heavy machinery plant insoutheastern Poland.   The government has refused to negotiate with Solidarity, theonly free trade union movement ever allowed in the Soviet bloc. Itwas outlawed in 1982.   Kiszczak said he authorized officials in the provinces ofSzczecin, Gdansk and Katowice to impose curfews to keep the peace.   He said he had also directed security forces ``to strengthenexternal protection'' around factories and prevent outsiders fromentering the plants.   The army was dispatched to ``assure the continuity of citytransport everywhere it has been immobilized,'' and courts wereadvised to send violators of the peace to jail in summaryproceedings rather than merely fining them.   He said the strikes were being carried out by only a minority ofworkers, but had dire consequences for the economy.   Strike leaders said they were girding for possible police raids.   ``We are prepared for these gentlemen's visit,'' a grim JozefKowalczyk, spokesman for striking dockworkers in Szczecin, saidearly today. ``The crew is so determined that they (police) hadbetter not do it. We have two priests here and they've heard ourconfessions.''   Kiszczak said 5,000 militant miners had prevented 65,000 minerswilling to work from entering coal mines and said Baltic docks werelosing valuable business to East and West Germany.   Coal exports are crucial to service Poland's $39 billion foreigndebt.   ``The law is being broken again and the specter of anarchy isrising again. People are asking fearful questions: `Where is allthis heading?''' said Kiszczak, a general who commands thecountry's police forces.   A less serious series of strikes occurred in Poland in lateApril and May after the government raised prices an average of 40percent, with strikers at the Gdansk shipyard quitting without asettlement and police breaking up the Nowa Huta stoppage.   Three times in post-war Communist Poland, labor unrest stemmingin part from price increases has toppled governments: in 1956, 1970and 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
