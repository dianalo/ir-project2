The anti-gas tax amendment, offered by Sen. Steve Symms,R-Idaho, passed by voice vote and expressed the ``sense of theSenate'' that motor fuel taxes should remain dedicated toimprovements in the highway and transportation system.   The vote was a shot across the bow to those eyeing a rise in thegas tax, now at 9.1 cents a gallon, as part of futuredeficit-reduction efforts. There is no call for such a tax in the$1.17 trillion fiscal 1990 spending plans now before Congress.   Sources have said the Bush administration has been considering agas tax increase, combined with a reduction in the capital gainstax, in the fiscal 1991 budget to be submitted next year.   The current spending plan, which the House and the Senate areconsidering in slightly different versions, claims about $28billion in deficit reductions and would meet the goal in theGramm-Rudman law of a deficit no larger than $100 billion in fiscal1990, which begins Oct. 1.   Critics contend much of the alleged savings is illusory _bookkeeping gimmicks, sales of federal assets and other devicesthat do little to alleviate the government's long-term deficitproblem.   The Senate's Democratic and Republican leaders withstood thefirst serious challenge to their budget plan Wednesday evening,defeating 64-31 a move by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., to shift $3billion from defense to education programs.   Simon argued that for the nation to remain economicallycompetitive, ``There are going to have to be some changes in ourpriorities.''   But he ran into the opposition of the Senate's leadership, whichhas defended Congress' budget deal with the White House and thespending levels that the pact calls for.   ``We made an agreement, and I believe it is a responsible andfair agreement,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine.   In the House, debate opened on that chamber's version of thebudget after passage of a resolution blocking all but a handful ofamendments _ those that House leaders believed would not pose athreat to the deal.   This budget is ``the best possible budget Congress can producefor 1990, given the many constraints under which it wasdeveloped,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., the chairman of theHouse Budget Committee. While not a ``bold approach, ... it is atbest a step in the right direction,'' he said.   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the chairman of theHouse Ways andMeans Committee, has openly suggested a gas tax increase. But hetold the House he would not offer such legislation without Bush'ssupport.   ``I will not encourage or support revenue increases that don'thave the support of the president and a majority of members of bothsides of the aisle on my committee,'' he said.   Much of the Senate action Wednesday amounted to tinkering aroundwith priorities in the domestic area and passing non-bindingamendments regarding ``truth in budgeting.''   The Senate approved amendments deploring the use of the SocialSecurity surplus to mask the size of the deficit. It also calledfor future use of budget projections compiled by the CongressionalBudget Office, which are less sanguine than White House figures.   It also voted to add $94 million for AIDS research, and about$100 million for law enforcement by slightly reducing otherdomestic agency budgets.   The House planned votes Thursday on several amendments,including a spending freeze plan and a proposal to impose a fee onimported oil.   Once the House and Senate complete their budgets, the twochambers must agree on a single resolution. That document serves asthe guide for annual spending and tax legislation.   To comply with the agreement reached last month with the WhiteHouse, the budgets follow totals already agreed to for military,foreign aid and domestic spending. They also call for $14.2 billionin new revenues from a variety of sources, including $5.3 billionin tax increases.   How the $5.3 billion will be raised remains uncertain. Theagreement with the White House allowed that decision to await morediscussions on what taxes Bush would agree do not violate his ``nonew taxes'' pledge.   The Senate Finance Committee chairman, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,D-Texas, indicated he would seek tax increases exceeding $5.3billion to pay for some tax breaks that would cost the governmentmoney.   Bentsen did not specify what new taxes he supports. But helisted several tax breaks he favors, including the tax credit forresearch and development, and a cut in the Medicare surtax forcatastrophic illness insurance.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he wasconfident something could be worked out. He reminded reporters thatformer President Reagan proposed and signed 13 tax hikes _ and yetwas seen as an enemy of higher taxes.</TEXT></DOC>
