AT ISSUE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  California News  </MEMO><TEXT>     The golf course, to be surrounded by a development of 750 high-pricedhomes, would be a showplace for the rubber putters, trick golf balls and othermemorabilia that Hope has collected over the years.;    But the plan isopposed by environmentalists seeking to preserve disappearing open land.;   One of the most prominent opponents is Maria VanderKolk, who at the age of 25was a surprise victor last summer in the race for Ventura County supervisorafter campaigning against the golf course.;    She asks: &quot;The man is 87 yearsold. What does he need another $25 million for?&quot;;    The environmentalistshave tried without success to tempt Hope with a promise of immortality bysuggesting that if he donated the land to the government it could become anational park bearing his name.;    Hope has countered by offering theenvironmentalists a stark choice. If no deal can be struck, he has said, hewould sell off other portions of his land for garbage dumps.;    Efforts atcompromise by both sides include a proposal for a land swap with the NationalPark Service that would allow Hope to proceed with his golf course and housingdevelopment atop the mountains.;    Under the proposal, Hope would sell thegovernment almost 5,900 acres, in various parcels, for about $20 million, aprice considered well below market value.;    In exchange, the park servicewould give the development company, Potomac Investment Associates ofGaithersburg, Md., 59 acres of parkland it already owns to build an accessroad from the course and housing development to a nearby highway. The parkservice owns thousands of acres in the area.;    But Mary Weisbrock, directorof a local environmental coalition, Save Our Space, opposes the land swap onprinciple.;    &quot;It will set a precedent,&quot; she said, &quot;and corners of the GreatSmoky Mountains and Yellowstone might be lopped off, too.&quot;;    She added, &quot;Itwill be like the Brazilian rain forest destruction in the Santa MonicaMountains.&quot;;    Federal laws permit land swaps by agencies charged with landmanagement.;    But in the past land swaps have tended to be on the less epicscale of the 4.7 acres acquired in 1981 by singer Barbra Streisand to enlargethe garden outside her house in Malibu Springs.;    The Santa Monica MountainsConservancy, a state agency created to acquire land for preservation, supportsthe deal with Hope.;    Julie Zeidner, a spokeswoman, called it &quot;the mostpractical alternative.&quot;;    As open land disappears and public agencies losefinancing, she argued, conservation agencies must seek means to preserve whatthey can.;    &quot;We've seen time and again that a developer with a certainproposal can eventually build on his property,&quot; she said. &quot;As land becomesmore rare in L.A., the price is being driven up, and the developers willalways be able to out-spend and out-lobby all of us.&quot;;    As for Hope, shesaid, &quot;Profit is clearly the bottom line.&quot;;    With each round of negotiationsover the past three years, the deal has become more complicated, with newparcels being added or subtracted, new financial arrangements proposed, newdecisions made at the local level to approve or disapprove portions of theagreement.;    The missing element, after all the lawyers andconservationists, local officials, celebrities and press agents have beenheard, is Hope himself.;    Apart from an uncomfortable moment on the JohnnyCarson show last year, when he asked: &quot;What do they want? I've given a lot ofland away,&quot; Hope has hardly been heard on the subject.;    &quot;Everything is inlimbo right now,&quot; said the comedian's publicist, Ward Grant. &quot;Mr. Hope willmeet with the conservancy and with all the powers sometime this month. Sothat's exactly what we're doing now: just waiting.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  SETH MYDANS, New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Agoura Hills  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910113  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  710  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, January 13, 199100013195,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
