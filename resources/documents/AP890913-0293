The Labor Department's Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration said many of the problems found at the Boise CascadeCorp. mill in Rumford, Maine, had been detected in company safetyaudits but left uncorrected.   A government inspection six months ago found ``a substantialdisregard by this major corporation for the safety and health of itsemployees,'' said Alan C. McMillan, acting OSHA chief.   The inspection of the mill, which has 1,600 workers, wasrequested by the United Paperworkers union, OSHA said.   Boise Cascade has 15 working days to contest the citations andthe $1,591,600 in proposed fines. Boise Cascade spokesman Eric A.Baxter said the OSHA complaint would be reviewed ``item by item''before any decision is made.   ``We welcome any effort that will help us improve the safety ofour mill,'' Baxter said. ``Safety is the utmost priority here atBoise Cascade.''   A nearly $1 billion modernization plan for the mill includedsignificant safety improvements, he said.   OSHA cited Boise Cascade for more than 300 alleged willfulviolations of safety standards, including sub-par recordsdocumenting illnesses and injuries, unsafe operation of industrialtrucks, failure to protect workers from exposed, high-voltageelectrical equipment, improper guarding of power equipment such asbelts and pulleys and failure to vent gases to safe locations.   Other alleged willful violations included failure to installguard rails to protect workers from falls, unsafe noise exposure,inadequate emergency response plans and inadequate respiratoryprotections.   Willful violations are those in which an employer knows aviolation or potential violation of safety standards exists but doesnothing to correct it.   Boise Cascade also was accused of 175 serious violations, 33``less serious'' violations and five repeat violations.   Serious violations are those in which an employer knew or shouldhave known about conditions that pose a substantial probability ofdeath or serious injury but doesn't correct the problems.   The company drew attention earlier this week because of a violentprotest at a Minnesota paper mill.   The protest by union workers and supporters was attributed to acompany decision to hire a non-union general contractor for a millexpansion project, who in turn has hired mostly non-union labor.   Twenty-nine people were arrested at the protest, which caused areported $1.3 million in damage to the International Falls, Minn.,mill near the Canadian border.</TEXT></DOC>
