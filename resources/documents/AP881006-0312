(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Interco Inc. asked a federal appealscourt Thursday to order a judge to hear its claim that an investorgroup was improperly pursuing a $2.66 billion takeover attempt.   Interco maintains the hostile buyout attempt by a group led bythe Washington, D.C.-based Rales brothers violates Security andExchange Commission regulations by being too highly leveraged.   U.S. Judge William Hungate has issued a stay barring litigationin the case, making it impossible for Interco to seek a judgment inthe matter. Interco asked a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals in an expedited appeal to order Hungate tohear its claim.   Interco, based in St. Louis, has rebuffed the group's overturessince it first offered $64 a share in July. On Sept. 20, Intercoannounced its board of directors had rejected a revised,conditional $72-a-share offer and had instead adopted a majorrestructuring and recapitalization program that might include thesale of some of its major businesses.   Interco chairman Harvey Saligman said the restructuring plan wasworth $76 a share.   The company is a a diversified manufacturer of furniture andapparel whose lines include Ethan Allen furniture, London Fogouterwear and Florsheim shoes.   Cardinal Acquisition, the group led by brothers Mitchell andStephen Rales, has acquired about 8 percent of Interco stock in atender offer that expires Oct. 11.   The group is pursuing a leveraged buyout of Interco. In such adeal, a company is acquired largely with borrowed funds that arerepaid with money raised through the company's cash flow or by thesale of its assets.   Interco contends the amount of money Cardinal Acquisition wouldhave to borrow is greater than limits set by SEC.   Cardinal Acquisition argued before the appeals court that thematter should be settled in Delaware courts _ Interco isincorporated in Delaware _ and noted a federal judge there hadrefused to block the takeover attempt.   Attorneys said every effort Interco has taken to block thetakeover until now had been taken in Delaware courts.   Interco attorneys said Hungate had refused to hear the questionbecause there were other avenues open, but contended none of thealternatives showed a likelihood for success in time and otherswere unfeasible.   Judge John Gibson said the appeals panel court would issue anorder ``as soon as we can.''   The hearing was held in Kansas City because all judges of the8th Circuit were here for to discuss internal court matters.</TEXT></DOC>
