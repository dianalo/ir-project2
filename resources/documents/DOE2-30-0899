B(a)P concentration was 3.2 {mu}g/1 andsolid concentration was 100 mg/1. A very rapid adsorption rate was observed.The adsorption extent found (0.023 mg/g) was higher or of the same ordermagnitude of as that reported for soils and sediments. It was much higherthan that reported for inorganic particulate matter, but lower than thatfor activated carbon. The adsorption heat value (5.7 Kcal/mole) indicatethe involvement of physical interactions (Van der Wals forces) whichcould give rise to the release of the carcinogenic compound previouslyadsorbed in the environment.</TEXT></DOC>
