They make a bad situation worse by contributing heat and pollution. Environmental Protection Agency regulations even force some utilities into &quot;brownouts&quot; (cut customer voltage) to restrict excessive emissions during these critical times.    So the current heat wave -- and its peak air-conditioning load -- may persuade the utilities to accept today's solar cells, rather than wait for the magic 15% versions referred to in your article.    The photovoltaic industry has steadily upgraded solar cell conversion efficiency -- without support from large utility orders -- from the 1960s figure of a few percent to in excess of 13%. Our industry can most assuredly continue this unaided progress down the learning curve. The normal course of product evolution is expected to yield volume quantities of 15% efficient -- or better -- cells in the next several years. (Researchers at Stanford University have already demonstrated solar cells exceeding 30% efficiency.)    But the issue is not so much a case of efficiency, but a case of the cost of producing a watt of electricity. Efficiency is a significant factor, but not the only factor in achieving cost reduction.    Utility orders now for photovoltaic electricity would expand photovoltaic research and development and fund production automation. Our industry would blossom into a junior Silicon Valley -- with fresh jobs and an expanded tax base -- and create the even more cost-effective cells sooner.    A government-backed tax incentive to encourage utility investments in solar electricity would bridge the chicken-egg barrier. Price reductions accelerated by a thriving photovoltaic industry would enable solar electricity to penetrate the enormous peak-demand market for grid power. Pump-primed efficiency improvements and economies of scale would spur eventual head-to-head parity with conventional grid generation.    John CORSI   President, Solarex Corp.
