President Bush ``did not intend to disrupt normal civiliancommercial relations'' when he barred military exports to Chinalast spring, and officials are reviewing the sanctions with that inmind, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday.   Bush today refused to reply during a photo session when asked ifhe was prepared to lift the ban on satellite transfers.   The news from the White House brought condemnation from Rep. SamGejdenson, D-Conn., chairman of House Foreign Policy subcommitteeon international economic policy and trade. He said the idea oflifting the sanction on satellites ``makes no sense whatsoever.''   ``In China, where the government has only tightened the screws,the Bush administration seems to see no limit on what they ought totry to do to help the Chinese government,'' Gejdenson said.   Last weekend, national security adviser Brent Scowcroft andDeputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger went to Beijing toexplore the possibility of resuming relations with China. The trip,an exception to the president's ban on high-level contacts withChina, also drew sharp criticism from congressional Democrats.   Asked about the trip today during a photo session with Bush,Scowcroft told a reporter only that it was ``long.''   A third administration official, White House personnel directorChase Untermeyer, joined the duo on the China trip to make personalcontacts for the president, the White House said.   Untermeyer confirmed that he went and said he also hadaccompanied Bush to China in 1977 and 1982. He said he spoke lastweekend with U.S. officials there regarding personnel matters butdid not elaborate.   White House spokesman Steve Hart said Untermeyer's main missionwas to speak to two Chinese friends of Bush, who served as liaisonofficer, then the highest-ranking U.S. representative in Beijing,in 1974-75.   Hart said Untermeyer purpose was ``simply to hear their thoughtsabout the changes going on in China'' since the Tiananmen Squaremassacre last spring. One of Bush's Chinese friends is a mid-levelgovernment official and the other is a former member of thegovernent, Hart said.   The Hughes Aircraft-manufactured communications satellites fallin the category of items on the government's sensitive munitionslist that were automatically included in the suspension, U.S.officials said.   ``No decision has been made ... but it is possible,'' thosesatellites will be freed for delivery, Fitzwater said.   Two of them are under Hughes contract to a jointAustralian-Chinese venture and the third are for a British-Chineseconsortium in Hong Kong, he said. China will launch the satellitesfor the Australian firm, AUSSAT, and the Hong Kong consortium,AsiaSat.   Australia has been pushing for a waiver and has receivedindications the administration will make a decision in its favor bythe end of the year, said Australian Embassy political counselorRoger Uren.   ``We have made it clear this is important to us. We have a sensethe Americans understand,'' he said Tuesday. ``We basically get apositive sense.''   One of Australia's satellites is to be launched in April and theothers in 1991 and 1992, while the British-Chinese one is to go upon a Chinese launch vehicle in April.   Licenses for export had been granted for all three satellitesbefore the sanctions were imposed. The State Department ``advisedHughes it would consider a request for an exemption from thesuspension,'' but there has been no decision, said Hughes spokesmanDon O'Neal.   Bush imposed sanctions on June 5 in the wake of Beijing's attackthat killed hundreds of Tiananmen Square protesters.   The order included a ban on export of weapons and militaryequipment, satellites and nuclear supplies, as well as suspensionof any loans to China from the World Bank and the Asia DevelopmentBank.   Since then, the administration has allowed export of five Boeingjetliners, whose guidance system was on the U.S. munitions controllist of sensitive technology. Boeing spokesman Randy Harrison saidthe government ultimately agreed that the planes' navigation devicewas for civilian use and could not be removed for military usewithout being obvious.   The administration also has permitted Chinese engineers toresume work in the United States on a $500 million program toupgrade Chinese F-8 fighter planes with sophisticated electronicsequipment. The White House said no planes were to be delivered, inaccordance with the ban on military exports.   The administration is looking for signs of change in Chineserepressive policies before normalizing relations, he said.   There has been no change in the deferral of $957 million inWorld Bank loans and $336 million in Asian development Bank loans,said Fitzwater.</TEXT></DOC>
