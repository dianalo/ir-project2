The printer of checks, computer forms and related products said the plan isn't in response to any known takeover efforts, but is designed to obtain fair and equal treatment for all shareholders in the event of any proposed takeover.    Under certain circumstances, the rights would allow shareholders to buy stock in Deluxe, or the surviving company in a takeover, at half price. The rights will be distributed Feb. 22 and expire 10 years later. </TEXT></DOC>
