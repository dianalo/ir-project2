Currently,each European nation has its own guidelines for computersecurity.   Now, four nations -- France, Germany, the United Kingdomand the Netherlands -- are pushing for a single Europeanstandard. In May, the four nations released their initialproposal, dubbed &quot;IT Sec&quot; for short. At a meeting scheduledfor Sept. 25 in Brussels, executives from InternationalBusiness Machines Co., Digital Equipment Corp. and other U.S.computer makers will receive their first chance to critiquethe plan. Officials from the Commerce Department also arepreparing a position paper on the subject.   The U.S. already has its own computer security standard,established by the National Security Agency and nicknamed the&quot;orange book.&quot; The standard officially covers only thosecomputer systems used by the government in classified work.But often government agencies doing sensitive butunclassified work and even commercial users such as banksrequest that their computer systems meet orange bookguidelines.   However, Europeans contend that the orange book is tiedtoo closely to military needs and that a security standardought to be crafted to satisfy civilian commercial users.   &quot;We want {a standard} to be equally applicable tomilitary-oriented systems and commercial systems,&quot; said ChrisJahl, a West German computer expert who coauthored theproposed IT Sec.   Mr. Jahl said it hasn't been decided whether the EuropeanCommission will adopt the proposed standard but acknowledgedthat it could apply to most computers sold in Europe. He saidthe European approach gives users more flexibility than theorange book, which he described as rigid.   Many large computer makers are alarmed by the Europeanplan. Digital will send two representatives to the Brusselsmeeting and already has urged the European group to embrace astandard that resembles the orange book. IBM, the world'slargest computer company, declined to comment but is said tobe unhappy with the development.   The fear is that the emergence of a second standard wouldforce computer makers to build two versions of the sameproduct, one for Europe and another for the U.S. market,executives say.   &quot;While we probably could sell the same hardware, we mighthave to do major surgery to the operating system,&quot; or thesoftware that controls a computer's basic functions, saidGeoffrey Baehr, director of data communication and networkingat Sun Microsystems Inc.   Experts in computer security are hoping to persuade theEuropeans to adopt security guidelines that closely resembleexisting U.S. guidelines. Mr. Jahl said he believes at leasthalf of the perceived differences between the two standardswill be smoothed over as a result of the Brussels meeting butthat some basic disagreements are likely to remain.   That prospect puts U.S. computer makers &quot;in a quandary,&quot;said one U.S. government official who asked not to be named.&quot;The worst case is that the U.S. posture and the Europeanposture {become} dramatically different,&quot; said Willis Rand, aconsultant at Rand Corp. &quot;What does our industry design tothen? Do they make two sets of designs? That's a terriblesituation to be in.&quot;   Some observers blame this unattractive situation on theNational Security Agency, the secretive branch of the DefenseDepartment that generally set federal policy on computersecurity in the 1980s.   Because of an NSA decision, for instance, computers madeby European concerns are effectively ineligible to receive astamp of approval from the NSA, which administers orange bookevaluations. &quot;In our eyes, that's a barrier to us,&quot; saidGermany's Mr. Jahl. While he wouldn't say that the snubinspired the European standards effort, he conceded that theIT Sec &quot;puts some pressure on the Department of Defense.&quot;   The pressure comes with the Pentagon already backpedalingfrom its traditional involvement in computer security policy.At a congressional hearing in July, members of the House ofRepresentatives urged the Commerce Department to speedefforts to begin crafting guidelines for a wide range ofcommercial computer uses.   The same month, President Bush reportedly issued adirective to the NSA removing its authority over security forcommercial systems and for government systems that handleunclassified information. The directive, NSD-42, isclassified, but a government official who asked not to benamed said it &quot;pretty clearly says {the NSA} should not beaddressing unclassified systems.&quot;   U.S. computer makers are generally satisfied with theorange book standard. &quot;A lot of vendors have viewed an NSAendorsement as help,&quot; said Mr. Walker of Trusted Information.But he said it takes too long to gain approval from the NSA'sevaluation unit and that demand for evaluations far outstripsthe NSA's resources. As a result, he said, he believesthere's a need for a civilian counterpart to the NSA's orangebook but sees little prospect of one coming along: A 1987 lawgave the Commerce Department authority in this area, but notthe budget to do the job.   ---                     A Secure Market?
