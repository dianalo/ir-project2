Previously, tests were conducted at the EUTF duringthe 1985/1986 summer and winter and the 1986/1987 summer and winter.This previous work at TVA, and work at the University of Mississippi,the FSEC, Texas A and M, and ORNL, have shown that in the summer: allRB installation locations provide large reductions in ceiling heat fluxwhen used with R11 and R19 fiberglass, cellulose, or rock wool; reductionsin ceiling heat flux from RBs when used with R30 are not nearly as largeas from RBs when used with R19; the RBR and RBT provide sizable reductionsin whole-house cooling loads; and the RBT provides the largest reductionin ceiling heat flux in most cases. Previous work has shown that in thewinter: the RBT provides moderate ceiling heat flux reductions and whole-househeating load saving with R11 and R19 fiberglass, cellulose, or rock wool;the RBR shows very little reduction in ceiling heat flux in most cases;and reductions in ceiling heat flux with R30 are usually much less thanwith R11 or R19 insulation. 12 refs., 14 figs., 11 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
