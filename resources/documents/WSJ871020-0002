The investor shift into money-market funds, for example, caused yields on three-month and six-month Treasury bills to tumble as much as two-thirds of a percentage point.    &quot;The battered stock and bond markets have just destroyed the confidence of many investors,&quot; says Ms. Cook. &quot;Money-fund assets likely will increase dramatically in the weeks ahead.&quot;    For foreign investors in U.S. debt and equity securities, there weren't any immediate havens after the stock market collapsed. Traders said the dollar weakened against most major currencies amid fears that the large U.S. trade and budget deficits will drive the dollar sharply lower in the months ahead.    &quot;Over here in Europe, there was only one move made by investors: Sell the dollar,&quot; says Hans-Joerg Rudloff, a general manager at Zurich-based Credit Suisse, Switzerland's third-largest bank. &quot;The seriousness of the U.S. problem as a debtor nation hasn't been seen yet,&quot; he says. &quot;The stock market decline is a symptom. The big bucks will get lost in the foreign-exchange market. Hundreds of billions of dollars could leave the U.S.&quot;    Perhaps surprisingly, the wave of stock-market funds spilling into traditionally safe havens has resulted so far in only a limited number of individual investors moving into gold, dealers say.    Yesterday's gold-price surge to 4 1/2-year highs of more than $480 an ounce was fueled largely by institutional investors, according to traders and dealers. They say many small investors and money managers haven't yet entered the gold market in force. Strong early gains in gold, for instance, were later pared by profit-taking.    &quot;Investors are probably still shellshocked&quot; from the sharp stock-market plunge and the gold rally of the past few days, Ian McDonald, vice president at Credit Suisse in New York, said yesterday. &quot;From my book, I haven't seen one manager buy today.&quot;    But there were some signs of a pickup in small-scale gold buying. At Deak International Inc.'s New York retail office, for instance, sales of gold coins and bullion bars yesterday rose 60% above typical volume, according to George Parola, vice president. Most of the purchases were American Eagle and Canadian Maple Leaf gold bullion coins.    And at least one corporate fund manager has decided to plunge into precious metals. Mark Braunstein, president of Marker Technologies of America, a Saugerties, N.Y., audio and video supply company, says he has invested 20% of the company's trading portfolio in gold and other precious metals after being fully invested in stocks in recent weeks.    &quot;As the stock market falls, I feel better and better about precious metals,&quot; Mr. Braunstein says.    Some precious-metals mutual-fund managers play down the individual investors' apparent reluctance to move into gold. The stock-market crash &quot;happened so quickly that it's caught most people off guard,&quot; says Douglas Westmoreland, portfolio trading manager for Dallas-based Strategic Silver Fund Inc. and other Strategic precious-metals funds. &quot;We've heard a lot of talking going on, but not too much action yet.&quot;    By contrast, the move into money funds already had a lot of steam before yesterday. Money-fund assets began swelling last spring, when the bond market deteriorated. As the rout continued the past two months and yields on 30-year Treasury bonds surged above 10% -- their highest level in two years -- &quot;fund assets were climbing to record levels practically every other week,&quot; says Donoghue's Ms. Cook.    The rise in short-term interest rates helped fuel the inflows as the average seven-day yield on money funds climbed to 6.56% as of last Tuesday from 5.99% on Aug. 25. &quot;We see most of the new money now coming from the stock market,&quot; says Ms. Cook.    Falling stock prices have touched off an investor flight into another traditional haven: top-grade bank certificates of deposit. Yesterday, rates on 90-day benchmark CDs fell nearly two-tenths of a percentage point.    &quot;We're seeing a tremendous amount of inquiry from people,&quot; says a spokesman at Chase Manhattan Bank. &quot;It seems apparent that CDs are in high demand again.&quot;    One leading Texas banker says he believes the deterioration on Wall Street may have a silver lining for the Southwest's economy. He reasons that the liquidity generated by the selling in the stock market will find a home in hard, tangible assets in Texas and surrounding states.    &quot;It doesn't hurt us. If anything it's on the plus side,&quot; the banker says. &quot;I'm sure of it. People are going to want property they can know, feel and touch.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Your Money Matters: Harried Mutual Funds Are Able to Meet Shareholders' Demand&quot; -- WSJ Oct. 20, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
