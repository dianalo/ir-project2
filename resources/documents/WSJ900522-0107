Mitchell's Position on Proposed Ban   On Assault Weapons Remains a Mystery   ----   By Timothy Noah   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/22/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A22</SO><IN>LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)</IN><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- As the Senate prepares to consider aproposed ban on domestic manufacture of military-styleassault weapons for civilian use, one senator isconspicuously silent amid the debate: Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell.   As is usually the case in gun-control debates, theproposed assault-gun ban generally is dividing Congress alongregional and partisan lines. Democrats from the Northeast andMidwest -- including Senate Judiciary Committee ChairmanJoseph Biden of Delaware and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio-- support a ban; they cite use of such weapons by drugtraffickers.</LP><TEXT>   Republicans from the West and South -- such as Sen. StromThurmond of South Carolina -- side with the National RifleAssociation and other gun-lobby groups in opposing the ban;they argue that the term &quot;assault weapon&quot; is poorly definedin the legislation.   But these dividing lines are far from absolute. Theassault-weapon legislation was drafted by Sen. DennisDeConcini (D., Ariz.), a longstanding NRA supporter from theSouthwest. Sen. DeConcini says he acted only after failing toget the NRA to draft language it could accept on the issue.   Then there's Sen. Mitchell. The assault-weapon issue putsthe Maine Democrat in an especially awkward bind. As majorityleader, he helped Sen. Biden move the larger crime bill,which includes the proposed assault-gun ban, through theslow-moving Senate. But as a legislator who represents aconsiderable number of Maine sportsmen, he once boasted toconstituents that he had a &quot;perfect voting record on issuesof concern to the NRA&quot; until he voted to ban plastic guns in1987.   Sen. Mitchell's position on the assault-gun ban issomething of a mystery. According to spokeswoman DianeDewhirst, the majority leader hasn't issued any statementseither on Sen. DeConcini's proposal or on a more restrictiveban proposed by Sen. Metzenbaum. (Despite repeated effortsyesterday to reach him, Sen. Mitchell himself wasn'tavailable for comment.)   Neither Sen. DeConcini nor Sen. Metzenbaum seems unhappyabout this apparent neglect. Indeed, both praise the majorityleader for assisting their efforts. Sen. DeConcini says he'sgrateful Sen. Mitchell got the crime bill to the floor; Sen.Metzenbaum says Sen. Mitchell will bring the Ohio senator'smore restrictive proposal to the Senate floor as anamendment.   But neither senator is able to guess how Sen. Mitchellwill vote on the gun issue. &quot;I don't know where he stands,&quot;says Sen. DeConcini. &quot;I'm not sure how he's going to vote,&quot;offers Sen. Metzenbaum. The gun lobby is similarly in thedark. &quot;I don't think the senator has made up his mind,&quot;offers NRA lobbyist James Baker. &quot;How Sen. Mitchell comesdown is not something that I can predict.&quot;   Mr. Baker said he hadn't personally lobbied Sen. Mitchellon the issue, but added: &quot;I can assure you that Sportsman'sAlliance of Maine has.&quot; According to Mr. Baker, that group is&quot;adamantly opposed&quot; to the assault-weapon ban. Spokesmen forthe group, based in Augusta, couldn't be reached for comment.   Gail Hoffman, legislative director for Handgun ControlInc., a group that lobbies for gun control, says she spoke toSen. Mitchell in January about the assault-weapons ban. &quot;Ithink he found things that we had to say interesting,&quot; shesays. &quot;But he was very noncommittal.&quot;   One reason for Sen. Mitchell's silence may be genuineambivalence. &quot;I don't believe in gun control,&quot; Sen. Mitchelltold the Calais, Maine, Advertiser during a 1988 campaignswing.   But after the senator failed to support the NRA on plasticguns in 1987, the NRA sent out a mailing to its members inMaine saying Mr. Mitchell had been fooled by a &quot;media lie&quot; onplastic guns. The charge angered Mr. Mitchell, who told theMaine newspaper that the NRA had made him a target of a&quot;campaign of misinformation.&quot;   Then again, Sen. Mitchell's silence may just be the latestdemonstration that discretion is the better part of valor.&quot;Mitchell is not buffaloed by them more than anyone else is,&quot;says Sen. DeConcini, &quot;but you don't just blow the NRA away assome kind of kooks or something.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
