In February, Fanuc announced that it couldn't proceed withits plans to acquire a 40% stake in Moore Special Tool Co.because of delays in &quot;the process of obtaining governmentapproval.&quot; But Fanuc's new plan to cooperate with thestruggling Bridgeport, Conn., company hasn't aroused similarconcerns, and U.S. officials said they have no objections toit.</LP><TEXT>   Fanuc is developing a computerized numerical controllerand associated software for a new plunge-type,electro-discharge machine that Moore plans to put on themarket next year. The machine uses a laser-like electriccharge to cut intricate metal parts. If the development issuccessful, Fanuc will supply parts for Moore products.   Fanuc's lawyers said the new venture doesn't need U.S.government approval because no equity purchase or transfer ofU.S. technology is involved. U.S. officials held up Fanuc'sinvestment bid because of mounting concerns in Congress aboutthe sale of defense-related U.S. technology to foreigncompetitors. Some U.S. lawmakers also expressed concern aboutthe security of certain sensitive work that Moore had donefor the Department of Energy's nuclear-weapons program.Although a federal interagency panel reviewing Fanuc'searlier offer didn't oppose it outright, Fanuc backed out.   A Moore statement said that having Moore and Fanucengineers working together on the project is in &quot;keeping witha longstanding business relationship.&quot; Machine-tool expertsregard the pairing as a natural match because Moorespecializes in high-precision machine tools while Fanuc isthe world's leading supplier of the electronics that operatessuch tools.   Seth Brody, an attorney for Moore, said the companies arestill discussing financial arrangements with other partiesunrelated to Fanuc.</TEXT></DOC>
