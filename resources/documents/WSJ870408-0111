It turns out the Soviets have embedded listening &quot;bugs&quot; in the building's poured-concrete columns, in its pre-cast floors and turned the building's girders into a vast antenna. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) says: Tear it down. Now consider the embassy our people actually have to work in.    The KGB has just employed one of its more sordid tricks, seducing two Marine guards, who allowed Soviet agents to run free through the embassy, compromising secure rooms, examining encryption machines, planting more bugs. Bugs beneath the keyboards of &quot;secure&quot; electric typewriters sent electronic signals out through the plugs and into Soviet listening posts. Both the U.S. Marine Corps and Foreign Service have been humiliated. (Yesterday the Associated Press reported that, according to U.S. officials, the Soviet Union over 17 months has pressed &quot;an unusually broad disinformation campaign aimed at convincing the world that the AIDS virus originated in an American military laboratory.&quot;)    And on Saturday Secretary of State George Shultz leaves for a trip to Moscow. The Reagan administration has decided to deal with these affronts by turning the other cheek.    Mr. Shultz says his visit is too &quot;important&quot; to cancel. He is going to discuss with Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze proposals to remove intermediate nuclear forces (INF) from Europe, a possible state visit to the U.S. by Mikhail Gorbachev and further emigration freedoms for Soviet Jews. When the president was asked about all this yesterday, he replied, &quot;They're still willing to talk&quot; about arms control. In other words, we don't care how crass or relentlessly deceitful the Soviets are on a daily basis; we're still going to put the gravest issues of national security on the table and bargain in good faith with these people.    It is quite a spectacle. Is the secretary of state really considering commuting between his airplane at an outlying airport and his talks at the Soviet Foreign Ministry, just to have secure communications with Washington? Or, as some at State have suggested, will he now do business in a communications trailer specially flown over for the occasion? Will the trailer be parked in Red Square, so the Russian proletariat can enjoy the amusing sight of a U.S. secretary of state who has been denied use of his own embassy? If Mr. Shevardnadze is pleased with the U.S. secretary of state, Mr. Shultz may be summoned to sit at the feet of Mr. Gorbachev himself Wednesday night.    This is not a new story. We pointed out last Oct. 22 that the metal beams and bars in the pre-fabricated concrete of the new Moscow embassy are equipped to pick up conversations throughout the building and can be listened to by Soviet receivers. We have described at length the Soviets' violations of treaties limiting or banning the production of biological weapons. The point is that the Soviets are willing to cheat on things that hardly matter, will cheat on midrange issues, and will most certainly cheat at the highest possible level -- on nuclear arms.    The whole recent embassy episode has begun to take on an Alice in Wonderland quality. Over six years the administration has documented Soviet violations of two SALT treaties. Now, with one U.S. Embassy in Moscow being ripped off and the other so compromised it may have to be torn down, George Shultz will still trundle to the Kremlin for &quot;talks.&quot; Save a little face. Don't go. </TEXT></DOC>
