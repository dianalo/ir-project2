Here's what four chief executives have to say:   James F. Bere   Borg-Warner Corp.    &quot;In the American system, we possibly have gone too far in compensating our CEOs,&quot; Mr. Bere says. &quot;The original intent was that if the shareholder does well, we should do well.&quot;    Measured by executive performance, the pay system &quot;is creaking,&quot; he says. Measured against the pay of ordinary employees, he adds, &quot;it's falling apart.&quot;    &quot;The shareholder isn't your only constituency,&quot; he says. &quot;You also have the employee to think of. The distance between what the CEO is paid and what the average worker is paid is too far apart.&quot;    But high pay isn't necessarily overpay, he adds, observing that little objection is raised to show-business or professional-sports salaries because the public &quot;vicariously lives through these people.&quot;    Mr. Bere himself earned $872,000 last year. When the company went private in a leveraged buy-out, he was paid for compensation accrued earlier; included were stock-appreciation rights worth $3.3 million, stock options worth $4.4 million and deferred compensation of $10.8 million.    Donald Frey   Bell andamp; Howell Co.    &quot;I won't spend the money I've made in this company in my lifetime,&quot; Mr. Frey says. In 1986, he earned a relatively modest amount -- $721,330 in salary, bonus and long-term compensation. Earlier, he says, &quot;I had one year of crossing the million-dollar mark because of my {stock} options. My options were handsome because I turned the company around.&quot; Bell andamp; Howell has agreed to be acquired by its senior managers and Texas investor Robert M. Bass, but Mr. Frey won't get a multimillion-dollar package as a result.    Huge pay packages disturb him. &quot;If the average salary of Mr. and Mrs. America is something like $24,000, and now you're reading about somebody making $24 million. . . . Is he worth it? Hell, no! Nobody's worth $24 million.&quot;    More in executive suites than elsewhere, he says, pay means status. &quot;A lot of CEOs rate themselves -- their sense of self-worth -- by how much money they're paid. Being on the list of the top 10 salaries is an ego trip. It has nothing to do with what they are going to spend that money on.&quot;    He says he doesn't spend lavishly on himself, adding, &quot;Boats, planes and extra women all cost lots of money.&quot; Would he work for less? &quot;Sure I would. But at some point, I would worry about my salary being so low that people would question my abilities. I have my scorecard limit, but it's a lot less than a million.&quot;    John J. Nevin   Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber Co.    Mr. Nevin got a $5.6 million bonus for 1986. Last year, his total compensation, which didn't include a long-term bonus, was $872,000. He thinks he's worth it.    The money, he told Firestone's 1987 annual meeting, &quot;is not . . . a payment that has caused me to have any feelings of embarrassment and is not . . . a payment for which I believe I owe anyone any apologies.&quot; To earn it, he said, Firestone's profit had to reach $10.41 a share in a six-year period ended in 1986. He exceeded that and got 193,814 shares as a bonus.    He concedes his pay is &quot;a matter of controversy.&quot; Firestone has shrunk to 53,500 employees from 110,000 in 1979. &quot;A lot of people had suffered serious disruptions in their lives and perceived {my bonus} as being inappropriate,&quot; he says.    Mr. Nevin told a management group that the progress he made in improving the company also made it more attractive to others. Therefore, he believes that he did a good job for shareholders. He also told the managers that the proposed merger with Bridgestone Corp. of Japan will help employees by increasing career opportunities for them.    &quot;If we hadn't taken that action, the jobs that are left wouldn't exist. We are living in a world of geometric change. I've never seen one press article in my business career about a CEO who took a company through restructuring who was described as easygoing and affable.&quot;    Ben Cohen   Ben andamp; Jerry's Homemade Inc.    Not every company believes in megacompensation. Small, entrepreneurial firms in particular keep executive pay low to foster esprit de corps. &quot;We believe the person who is working on the line, making our ice cream, filling the pints, is a very important person,&quot; Mr. Cohen says.    Ben andamp; Jerry's Homemade, the Waterbury, Vt., ice-cream company, keeps its top salary at no more than five times the lowest-paid worker's base pay. Last year, Mr. Cohen earned $60,961, plus a $10,000 bonus. Mr. Cohen, one of the company's founders, owns more than a quarter of it, but he doesn't get any additional stock options.    &quot;We believe just because some executive has some talent for selling on the phone or organizing or administering doesn't mean that his job is that much more valuable,&quot; Mr. Cohen says. &quot;It's our general feeling that executives in this country tend to be overpaid, especially the very upper level of management, because the upper level of management sets the salary and they tend to be self-serving.&quot;    But the company faces problems, says Fred Lager, its treasurer. &quot;The major problem comes from trying to attract executive and management people who have the skills and talents we need and whom we can afford in terms of fitting in.&quot;    The company doesn't have anything against higher pay. &quot;There's no cap on salary,&quot; Mr. Cohen says. &quot;If they want to increase their salary on top, they have to increase salaries on the bottom as well.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Top Dollar: Corporate Chiefs' Pay Far Outpaces Inflation and the Gains of Staffs --- Rises in Salaries and Bonuses, Called Excessive by Some, Offset Losses in the Crash --- Average Package: $595,000&quot; -- WSJ March 28, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
