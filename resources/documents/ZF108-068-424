theorizes that the NSA itself allowed theInternet infection to flourish in order to raise consciousness about computersecurity issues.andP;  If somewhat farfetched, this theory at least has themakings of a good movie script.andM;BOOKSandM;Even apart from the Morris case, Lundell's book may be the most imaginativevirus tome on the market.andP;  It includes a viral &quot;bestiary&quot; describing dozensof viruses, along with a unique chapter that compares software viruses totheir biological counterparts.andM;They're After UsandM;Computer consultant Pamela Kane shares Lundell's tabloid view of the Internetvirus incident.andP;  In V.I.R.U.S.andP;  Protection: Vital Information Resources UnderSiege, Kane also raises the Morris family connection:  &quot;The psychology ofchildren trying to 'outdo' a parent is well know,&quot; as is that of the parentliving through the child.andP;  But Kane comes to no firm conclusions about whodid what or why.andM;Kane doesn't dwell on the Morris incident.andP;  Her book--packaged with hercompany's &quot;antiviral&quot; Dr. Panda Utilities on disk--is a wide-ranging,shoot-from-the-hip undertaking that implicates everyone from housewives tothe computer trade press in the computer insecurity phenomenon.andM;Most peculiar is Kane's chapter on press coverage of computer viruses.andP;  Atthe beginning of the section she states, &quot;Computer viruses have been one ofthe 'hot' stories of the last year or so.&quot;andP;  Then she berates the trade pressfor not giving viruses enough coverage.andP;  Perhaps she wasn't quoted oftenenough?andM;Kane exposes the intense factional disputes that pervade the antivirusindustry by reviling John McAfee, chairman of the nonprofit Computer VirusIndustry Association (CVIA).andP;  Without using any of her own words, she relieson several excoriating quotes from the computer press and others in theantivirus industry.andP;  McAfee's crime?andP;  He's trying to make money from thevirus scare.andP;  Unlike Kane, who charges a mere $39.95 for her own book.andM;Vapor VirusandM;The CVIA's McAfee is a colorful character.andP;  Traveling around the country, hecollects virus &quot;specimens&quot; and, presumably, large consulting fees.andP;  Inaddition to his CVIA connection, he created the National Bulletin BoardSociety and is president of the computer supplier Interpath.andM;His book, Computer Viruses, Worms, Date Diddlers, Killer Programs, and OtherThreats to Your System, which is coauthored by Colin Haynes, makes grandioseand unfounded claims about the extent of viral &quot;hits,&quot; saying, for example,that the Internet virus cost nearly $100 million in computer time andservices, and that &quot;as of February, 1989, over 500,000 personal desktopsystems have been infected around the world .andP;  .  .&quot;  The sources for thesefigures (other than &quot;CVIA research&quot;) are entirely unattributed.andM;The book is also a treatise on the workings of viruses.andP;  McAfee applies greatdetail to the dissection of theoretical and actual viruses.andP;  He also providestheoretical treatment of these viruses under theoretical conditions.andP;  Thisshould prove quite useful to those suffering from a theoretical virus attack.andM;Pay and Pay AgainandM;In Computer Viruses: What They Are, How They Work, and How to Avoid Them,Jonathan L. Mayo forgoes the baroque and the theoretical in favor of thebanal.andP;  The book includes a diskette with the shareware program Flu Shot Plusand a few other &quot;antiviral&quot; programs.andP;  But bear in mind that the inclusion ofthe shareware does not mean you've paid for it.andP;  Mayo reminds readers of his$29.95 book that &quot;you are encouraged to register with the author of theprogram,&quot; meaning that you are morally obligated to pay for the softwareabove and beyond the cost of the book, in spite of the fact that nearly halfof Mayo's book is shareware documentation.andP;  Is he paying royalties?andM;Mayo neatly complements the software rip-off with an abundance ofuninformative filler.andP;  The rest of the text serves up a smattering ofdisjointed material about DOS commands, disk structure, and reviews of othervirus software.andP;  What little material there is about computer virusesconsists of such handy tips as &quot;determine the extent of the [virus] damage&quot;and &quot;try to pinpoint exactly when the virus entered your computer.&quot;andP;  Thanks,Jonathan.andM;If you need the Flu Shot Plus software, get it from a bulletin board; thebook is useless.andM;All four releases essentially hoe the same ground and report the samestories.andP;  Their hype stands on the shaky foundation of only a few incidents.andO;The emergence of these books suggests that the real threat may not be theviruses themselves, but the climate of hysterical fear doomsayers havecreated.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
