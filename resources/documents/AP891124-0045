(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With batting eyelashes and smudged mascara, anorth Georgia woman is a traffic-stopping look-alike of Tammy FayeBakker, and is cashing in on it on the party circuit.   Teresa Martens of Rome said she jokingly told her daughter'smodeling agent about the time she dressed up and was mistaken forthe televangelist.   Now, ``She's the hottest thing I've got,'' said Shirley Lowry,owner of Party People in Atlanta. Party People books celebritylook-alikes for special events in the Atlanta area.   ``When I tell people my list of celebrity look-alikes, peoplelaugh when I say Tammy Faye's name,'' Ms. Lowry said. ``Tammy FayeBakker is the most wanted look-alike.''   Last month, a federal judge sentenced televangelist Jim Bakker,Mrs. Bakker's husband, to a 45-year prison term for fraud andconspiracy.   At one recent appearance at a business meeting, Mrs. Martensburst crying into the room.   ``Look out or you'll be in jail yourself,'' she warned oneexecutive.   ``I've seen you down at the Cheetah,'' she said to another,referring to an Atlanta nude-dancing club.   Rates are $100 an hour or $500 a day.   Ms. Lowry said she sees potential to reach bigger markets.   ``Teresa impresses me because she has not been in the theater,''Ms. Lowry said. ``She is a natural comedian. She sings, she acts,and she can portray Tammy Faye Bakker so well.''   Mrs. Martens, 42, said she had been mistaken for Mrs. Bakkerbefore.   Once when her daughter was a baby, Mrs. Martens said two womenkept looking at her during a layover in a Detroit airport.   ``I thought, `Oh no, baby burpie, blouse undone, zippercheck,''' she said. ``I mean, these women were staring.''   The two have never met.   Because of the religious implications involved with herimpersonation, Mrs. Martens said she tries to be sensitive to thefact that many people were victims in the downfall of the Bakkerempire.   ``I want to be very careful not to offend anyone,'' Mrs. Martenssaid. ``I am having fun, and people come up to me and thank me formaking them laugh.   ``Tammy Faye Bakker does not seem to intimidate men or women,''she added. ``People want to talk to her. They feed me questions,and I answer them. A lot of people want to know how Jim is doing,so I answer how I think he is doing.''</TEXT></DOC>
