<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-83-0013 </DOCNO><TEXT>The plane-wave theory of a three-crystal Laue interferometer is presentedin terms of the amplitudes diffracted by a single slab in the Laue case,using Zachariasen's formalism. Successive applications of the single-slabexpressions for the amplitudes lead to the final intensities of the interferingbeams present on the back side of the third crystal slab. Numerical examplesfor X-ray and neutron diffraction show clearly the different contrastrelationships in the two cases.</TEXT></DOC>
