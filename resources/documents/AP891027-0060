(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pat Robertson's ChristianBroadcasting Network is among the bidders for the cable TV networkonce run by imprisoned evangelist Jim Bakker, a Robertsonspokeswoman said.   The Inspirational Network _ actually a cable distribution systemthat reaches 7 million to 8 million homes _ is up for sale becauseof the bankruptcy of the religious empire built by Bakker, who wasconvicted this week of defrauding his followers.   Three ``prominent'' bidders are to be considered today,including the Robertson network, said John McEntee, director ofHeritage Ministries, a spinoff of Bakker's old PTL organization inSouth Carolina. McEntee, who valued the network at $10 million,refused to identify the other potential buyers.   A sale would require the approval of the federal bankruptcyjudge overseeing the breakup of the PTL empire, McEntee said.   The Christian Broadcasting Network, which reaches 47 millionhouseholds with its for-profit The Family Channel, would add theold PTL to its operation if its bid were accepted, said CBNspokeswoman Frankie Abourjilie. She refused to disclose the amountof the bid.   ``We're going to make a bid on the cable delivery system andequipment,'' Ms. Abourjilie said Thursday night.   Bakker, whose ministry unraveled in a series of sex and moneyscandals, got his start on the airwaves when he and his wife, TammyFaye, appeared on Robertson's network in the early 1970s.   Baker has begun serving a 45-year sentence for conspiracy andfraud at the Talladega, Ala., Federal Correctional Institution. Heentered the prison Tuesday, hours after being being sentenced infederal court in Charlotte, N.C., and fined $500,000.   Numerous requests for prison interviews have been referred tothe evangelist's lawyers, said spokeswoman Dana Newell.   The bidding for Bakker's old TV network doesn't affect HeritageUSA, the Christian theme park and resort near Fort Mill, S.C.   PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton decline to comment onplans for sale of the rest of the ministry.   Stephen Mernick, a Toronto businessman who had agreed to buy thePTL's assets after it filed for bankruptcy in June 1987, let his$64 million purchase contract expire Sept. 30 because he was unableto obtain title insurance for Heritage USA.</TEXT></DOC>
