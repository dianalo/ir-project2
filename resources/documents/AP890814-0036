(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   If you have something ``awesome'' tosell to kids, forget it.   And don't say ``fresh,'' because that bit of kidspeak is rapidlygoing stale.   The dweebs at the ad agencies don't always know it, butappropriating teen-age slang for commercial purposes is liketotally risky. As sure as this year's stone-washed jeans becomenext year's bell bottoms, the odd-sounding usages of youth cantumble from the cutting edge to oblivion before they reach the earsof adults.   That's where Karen Forcade of Youth Research, a consultingcompany, comes in.   Companies such as Colgate-Palmolive, Johnson andamp; Johnson, Nabiscoand Campbell's Soup hire Forcade, 45, to tell them how tocommunicate with younger consumers.   ``Children are very sensitive to the language that is used,''Forcade said, adding that they regard ad writers who sling outmodedterms at them as dweebs _ the latest word for ``nerds'' or``geeks.'' A current toy commercial in which the child actorexclaims ``awesome,'' for instance, is regarded as just awful.   The lingo of youth is evanescent. A recent alternative to``cool'' cropped up some years ago in ``radical'' (later shortenedto ``rad''). That gave way to ``critical'' (shortened, naturally to``crit''). Now both terms are passe.   Maureen Leopold, a counselor at Danbury High School, warns thatadults would be wise to leave kidspeak to the kids _ lest theystumble, embarrass themselves and attain dweebhood.</TEXT><DATELINE>EDINBURG, Texas (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Twenty months have passed since a debateby six Democratic presidential candidates at Pan AmericanUniversity, but the judges who agreed to pay for the event stillowe $9,100.   The university turned to a collection agency last week after itsrepeated failure to get the Southwest Texas County JudgesAssociation to pay.   Zapata County Judge Angel A. Flores was the only one of the 29judges sponsoring the event who had paid his bill by then. A secondjudge, Hidalgo County Judge J. Edgar Ruiz, paid his share onThursday.   Ruiz, whose county hosted the Dec. 15, 1987, event, said thejudges always intended to pay the bill, but somehow ``put it asideand just never got to it.''   He said university officials ``have been more than patient withus.''   The candidates who took part in the debate were MassachusettsGov. Michael Dukakis, Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, Sen. Paul Simonof Illinois, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, former Arizona Gov. BruceBabbitt and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt.   Pan American spokesman Bruce Erickson said university policyprohibits the state-supported school from sponsoring partisanactivities, but that such activities are permitted when paid for byoff-campus groups.</TEXT></DOC>
