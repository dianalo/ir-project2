Alan Cranston accepted arebuke from the Senate Ethics Committee for his dealings withformer thrift executive Charles Keating, but he denied thathis conduct violated Senate norms.   In a packed and somber Senate chamber, Sens. Howell Heflin(D., Ala.) and Warren Rudman (R., N.H.) presented thecommittee's findings against Sen. Cranston, including aresolution severely reprimanding him for &quot;violating unwrittenbut commonly understood standards of Senate behavior&quot; bylinking his official actions with fund raising. Thecommittee's action ended the two-year investigation of theso-called Keating Five. Any punishment greater than the kindof rebuke given to Sen. Cranston, such as censure,denunciation or expulsion would have required a full Senatevote.</LP><TEXT>   In a defiant floor speech, Sen. Cranston staunchlydefended his actions as proper. &quot;Nothing I did violated anylaw or specific Senate rule,&quot; he asserted. But he didapologize to his colleagues for creating an appearance ofwrongdoing in soliciting more than $800,000 in charitablecontributions from Mr. Keating for voter groups affiliatedwith him. At the same time that Mr. Cranston soughtcontributions, he intervened with federal regulators onbehalf of Mr. Keating's thrift, Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan.   At a news conference following two hours of formal Senateproceedings, Sen. Cranston went even further, implicating hisSenate colleagues in the same kind of aggressive fund-raisingtactics he used. He and his lawyer, Harvard Law Prof. AlanDershowitz, said that in preparing to fight a possiblecensure vote, they had investigated the fund-raising tacticsand legislative actions of other senators. &quot;We could provethat many senators engaged in comparable linkage,&quot; said Mr.Dershowitz. Sen. Cranston and Mr. Dershowitz declined to namenames.   Sen. Rudman, who along with other Republicans on thebipartisan ethics panel favored stiffer, full Senate actionagainst Sen. Cranston, angrily denounced the CaliforniaDemocrat's comments as &quot;arrogant, unrepentant and a smear onthis institution.&quot; With his voice shaking with anger, hescolded Sen. Cranston, saying, &quot;Everybody doesn't do it.&quot;   Ethics Committee Chairman Heflin said the committee hadtaken into consideration Sen. Cranston's poor health -- hehas been undergoing cancer treatments -- and decision toretire when his term expires next year in deciding not to askthe full Senate to punish him. Sen. Cranston said he wouldhave fought &quot;tooth and nail&quot; against any move to censure him.   Mr. Dershowitz, a high-profile defense attorney who hasrepresented celebrated clients, including Claus von Bulow,hotel magnate Leona Helmsley and junk-bond impresario MichaelMilken, had donated his services to help Sen. Cranstonprepare for a possible floor battle. Instead, Sen. Cranstondecided to accept the committee's rebuke and end his longordeal.   Earlier this year, the Ethics Committee dropped itsinvestigation of four other senators who intervened withfederal regulators on behalf of Mr. Keating. It found thattwo senators, John McCain (R., Ariz.) and John Glenn (D.,Ohio), used poor judgment in their dealings with the formerthrift executive. The committee found that two others, Sens.Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.) and Donald Riegle (R., Mich.),engaged in conduct that gave the appearance of beingimproper.   In the case of Sen. Cranston, who solicited $1 million incontributions from Mr. Keating for his campaigns andaffiliated voter groups, the committee found &quot;substantialcredible evidence&quot; that he engaged in improper conduct inwhich &quot;fund raising and official duties were substantiallylinked.&quot;   From start to finish, the Keating Five case was anunprecedented and deeply troubling chapter in Senate history.In a departure from protocol, the Ethics Committee subjectedall five senators to weeks of public hearings before anyformal charges of wrongdoing were made. Yesterday's publicairing of ethics charges against Sen. Cranston, without anaccompanying censure vote, was also highly unusual. Becausethe case cut to the heart of Washington's scandal-riddencampaign-finance system, the entire Senate was on trial inthe Keating Five case.   Sen. Cranston somberly reminded his colleagues of thatfact yesterday, contending that all senators would bevulnerable to charges of ethical misconduct unless they passlegislation to overhaul campaign financing that removes allprivate money from the political system.</TEXT></DOC>
