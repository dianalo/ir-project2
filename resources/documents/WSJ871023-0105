His friends speak of his sense of humor as if reassuring the family of an ailing patient. &quot;Al can be very funny,&quot; they say.    The Tennessee Democrat is also a man in a hurry. &quot;Al was brought up on the work ethic and never got over it,&quot; his mother, Pauline, says at the family farm here in the Cumberland foothills. Donna Rankin, a pretty tomboy when she was Mr. Gore's teen-age flame in Carthage, remembers a &quot;serious-minded&quot; boy two years her junior. &quot;He always had goals,&quot; she says. &quot;He was always planning.&quot;    &quot;I try to lead a moral life,&quot; says the 39-year-old Sen. Gore. Part of that is work and character and purpose. &quot;I think that life has a purpose,&quot; he says. His today is becoming president.    The youngest of the candidates and the last to enter the field, he is the most destined to run. The consummate politician, Mr. Gore is fiercely competitive, but seemingly blind to the very ambition that drives him forward. Born into a political family, he bears the stamp of his populist father and brings to his campaign an intellect honed by the education of the ruling elite.    &quot;Old Man&quot; Gore, a congressman and senator for more than three decades, was a lion who liked the sound of his roar. He once championed using atomic weapons in Korea in the 1950s. A decade later, he was an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War. &quot;The only silent majority are the dead,&quot; he wrote.    The son is more guarded, a Clark Kent without the phone booth. In six months in Vietnam as an Army reporter, the closest he came to the dead was walking past body bags at Graves and Registration in the rear. He cut tobacco and fed pigs as a boy but is today less rural than suburban. &quot;He weighs moral issues,&quot; says his friend and backer, Martin Peretz, editor in chief of the New Republic magazine. &quot;I don't think he's intuitive.&quot;    Mr. Gore plays his politics much as he played basketball in the House gym -- shooting from the outside. A four-term congressman before his 1984 election to the Senate, he is better remembered by committee staff members than by his colleagues, who respect his hard work but often found him aloof from the rough and tumble of the legislative process. With the staff he could dig, and dig was what the young congressman did best, bringing sources to his parents' Capitol Hill apartment and attracting television cameras to hearings on subjects ranging from toxic waste to infant formula. &quot;His time horizon was longer term,&quot; says Ari Weiss, a former House leadership aide.    If Mr. Gore seems blue-suit proper -- he keeps four in stock -- it is also part of his armor. He can be distant, exacting; his sighs are most damning. But when a neighbor's son developed cancer last year, Mr. Gore lent his staff -- and himself -- to help. Medical advice was sought from the National Institutes of Health; the senator came alone to talk, his voice choking with emotion in describing the 1984 death from cancer of his sister, Nancy.    &quot;There was just the two of us and our parents were gone a lot,&quot; he says of her now. But even she, beautiful and outgoing, was 10 years his elder, and often absent.    The boy from St. Alban's prep had a sophisticated but divided existence, shuttling between his parents' Washington hotel suite and a tenant farmer with whom he stayed each summer in Carthage. &quot;He lived two different type lives,&quot; says Gordon Thompson, the farmer's son.    He hunted behind coon hounds at night, and driven by the orders of his disciplinarian father, worked in the fields in the day. The affection he commands here in Carthage is genuine; he once went to summer school to study Tennessee history, and few in Congress can match his compulsive record of returning to face rural constituents in hundreds of meetings.    That sense of community echoed in his decision to enlist in the Army after graduating from Harvard in 1969. Confronted by a low draft number, Mr. Gore considered evading the draft, but says he thought it wrong that someone else would have to take his place. Those who counseled him also feared that such a step could harm what they already saw to be a promising future in public life. &quot;It would have been very present in my mind,&quot; says Harvard Prof. Richard Neustadt, that &quot;he shouldn't cut himself off from his generation.&quot;    Now, Mr. Gore wants to be the candidate of that same generation. His vantage point, however, has changed. The 1968 chairman of &quot;Tennessee Youth for Eugene McCarthy&quot; today portrays himself as a &quot;raging moderate,&quot; and baits old allies on the left in a calculated gamble that a conservative South will make him a contender.    No other Democratic candidate knows as much about arms control, yet he strains his credibility in trying to paint his rivals as far to his left. While he opposes a ban on missile test flights, he backed nuclear-freeze proponents in repeated votes in 1983, and has voted against chemical weapons. He voted for a broad range of cuts, from moderate to deep, in President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative. He was one of only three Southern Democrats in the Senate to oppose the 1985 repeal of restrictions on U.S. covert aid to Angola insurgents, and he backed an unsuccessful motion seeking to lift a U.S. embargo against Nicaragua's Sandinista government in the same period.    He has repeatedly opposed military aid to the Contra guerrillas and has only supported nonlethal aid in the context of a peace process. Absent these conditions in 1985, he opposed the &quot;humanitarian&quot; assistance package approved by the Senate.    Mr. Gore's rhetoric has escalated since last summer. He derides &quot;the litmus tests&quot; of arms-control advocates in the Iowa caucuses and plays off events in the Persian Gulf to show he can't be &quot;frightened away by a medieval despot.&quot; He says he is a &quot;centrist&quot; bucking leftward pressures accepted by his rivals. But among his own liberal backers, the debate seems more silly than real -- a replay of a young John Kennedy acting tough about Quemoy and Matsu in 1960.    Mr. Gore campaigns as a person close to the common man -- as scholarship student, small-business man, farmer. It is a picture that leaves much unsaid. He did earn a scholarship at Harvard, but it wasn't based on need. He was buying land with his father's help before graduation, and a 20-acre, $40,000 purchase in 1969 was his principal contribution to the oft-cited home building business he later began in Carthage. His father helped facilitate the 1973 purchase of his farm, which earned valuable mineral royalties for years from Occidental Petroleum Corp., where the elder Gore is a director and whose chairman, Armand Hammer, is close to the family.    The senator unfailingly identifies himself as a &quot;Vietnam veteran,&quot; and campaign literature features him as an Army volunteer photographed with a rifle and rucksack. But his tour in Vietnam was half what most U.S. soldiers served in that war. He never saw a man being killed or wounded and never fired his rifle in combat.    Instead, he collected a handful of bylines as a reporter for the engineer command's newspaper, the Castle Courier. These ran from a detailed account of the clay-lime paving technique in the Mekong Delta -- &quot;the first step is the acquisition of rice paddies&quot; -- to a more ambitious reconstruction of the confusion in a fire-support base attacked by enemy guerrillas. &quot;I had no feeling these guys had gone through it and I didn't,&quot; he says of his role. &quot;Hell, I was right there when they were anticipating the VC coming right back.&quot; But the VC didn't, he acknowledges.    In the five years after coming home, Mr. Gore crowded a journalism career and three years of study -- but no degrees -- in religion and law at Vanderbilt. He learned to ask better questions and gave glimpses of a more vulnerable person under his exterior. For a period after Vietnam, his wife, Mary Elizabeth, would sometimes wake to find him out walking in the fields in the early morning.    Then, one day in 1976, he nervously threw up in his sister's bathroom in Carthage and went out to announce at the courthouse he was running for Congress. With his shaky debut in politics, the boy who had been so driven stepped into direct competition with his father's past.    Theirs is a jousting rivalry made easier perhaps since Mr. Gore won his Senate seat in 1984. More than ever in his son's races, the father has taken a place in the presidential campaign. Sen. Gore's mother is an attorney and force in her own right, but it is his late sister's husband, Frank Hunger, a dry Mississippi corporate lawyer, who is a best friend and frequent traveling companion for the candidate.    Most important is Mr. Gore's wife, &quot;Tipper.&quot; They were married in 1970 before he went to Vietnam and baptized together a decade later at a Baptist church blocks from the Virginia house where she grew up, and where they now live. &quot;Raising PG Kids in an X-Rated Society,&quot; her book attacking violent and explicit material in movies and music, came out last spring. With a master's degree in psychology, her image as the politically calculating temperance queen of rock lyrics is exaggerated. More telling may be a certain streak of naivete. After describing Vietnam as a &quot;moral quagmire,&quot; she seems surprised when asked whether Washington might be the same for a young senator. &quot;In Congress, you're captain of your own ship,&quot; she says.    Naivete is a trait some see in her husband as well. Even detractors admit he has great talent and potential; they say they would just feel better about him if he had some fear in him as well.    Instead, like his father, there are &quot;convictions&quot; and dreams. The senior Mr. Gore remembers election night 1970, when he bid a feisty farewell in the crowded ballroom of Nashville's Hermitage Hotel. &quot;The last thing I said on the night I conceded defeat was the causes for which I fought were not dead, the truth shall rise again,&quot; he says. &quot;I had him in mind. I just did.&quot;    ---   IN BRIEF   ALBERT GORE JR.   -- 39 YEARS OLD   --MARRIED 17 YEARS, FOUR CHILDREN    -- HARVARD, STUDIED RELIGION AND LAW AT VANDERBILT   -- DEMOCRAT OF TENNESSEE   U.S. Congressman 1977 to 1985; U.S. senator since 1985.
