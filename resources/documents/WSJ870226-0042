The downgrading is the third time Moody's has lowered ratings on ATandamp;T securities since the company in 1982 agreed to divest itself of its local phone operations. Moody's said that while the $3.2 billion write-off ATandamp;T took in the fourth quarter to shrink its employment, manufacturing and facility base was &quot;a positive step,&quot; it believes efficiencies will take time to develop.    In the fourth quarter, the company had a loss of $1.17 billion on revenue of $8.5 billion.    Profit will remain under pressure through the rest of the decade, even as the telecommunications concern reduces costs, Moody's said. &quot;There is the possibility of further write-offs if ATandamp;T's strategy to enter new high-technology markets continues to be unsuccessful,&quot; Moody's said. ATandamp;T has lost millions in its computer business and now is revamping that business into a &quot;data networking&quot; business.    The rating concern lowered ratings on debt and preferred issues to single-A-1 from double-A-3. Ratings on commercial paper remain at single-A-1, Moody's said. Included in the downgrading were ATandamp;T's 10 1/4% Euromarket notes due 1993 and 9% Eurobonds due 2016 as well as debt of two subsidiaries, ATandamp;T Credit Corp. and ATandamp;T Technologies Inc. Ratings were also lowered on two Pacific Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. issues assumed by ATandamp;T. Moody's said the downgrade completes its review of ATandamp;T's ratings, which it placed under review Dec. 18.    ATandamp;T said it was disappointed by Moody's action and that while last year's results were greatly reduced by the writeoff, it believes it has &quot;taken decisive actions to fundamentally strengthen our business for the future, and improve our earnings.&quot; It labeled Moody's statement that further write-offs could occur as &quot;speculation.&quot;    But ATandamp;T executives have also said that it will be next year at the earliest before cost-cutting helps profits much. In a recent interview, the company's chairman, James E. Olson, acknowledged that his three main strategies for growth probably won't show results for a few years. ATandamp;T faces obstacles in getting its long distance business deregulated, expanding internationally and selling computers as part of communications networks to big companies.    Moody's said it believes weak markets and intense competition will continue to squeeze profits from ATandamp;T's business of selling computers and phone equipment to consumers and businesses. In addition, Moody's said equipment sales to telephone companies face tough competition because demand is weakening. While the long distance business will continue as a &quot;star performer,&quot; Moody's said, its rate of growth is limited by a ceiling on profits mandated by the Federal Communications Commission.    &quot;Cash flows from nonregulated activities will remain thin&quot; through the rest of the decade, Moody's said. &quot;Additionally, the large proportion of earnings paid out in dividends penalizes ATandamp;T's cash flow.&quot; ATandamp;T's annual dividends of $1.20 a share are barely covered by operating earnings, which the company last year said amounted to $1.26 a share. But because about 83% of ATandamp;T's shares are held by individuals, it faces great resistance to cutting its dividend and has said it will instead reduce its payout ratio by increasing earnings. </TEXT></DOC>
