Police said six people were killed and 26 wounded.   The latest casualties, mostly civilians caught in the cross-fire,raised the toll to 380 killed and 1,497 wounded in the 15-weekconfrontation between Syrian troops and mainly Christian soldiers ofthe Lebanese army.   A police spokesman said victims included two civilians killed inMoslem west Beirut when a 155mm shell crashed on their car.   Another civilian was killed at west Beirut's Barbir Hospital,which took several direct hits from Christian gunners, said thespokesman, who cannot be identified under standing regulations.   He said the other three civilians were killed in Christian eastBeirut.   Barbir Hospital's two upper floors could be seen burning from adistance.   A hospital official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theman killed there took refuge at the hospital after shelling started.   None of the patients and medical staff were hurt, the officialsaid. They evacuated to the basement and an underground shelter.   Barbir, one of four major medical centers in the Moslem sector,is near the Green Line that divides Lebanon's capital into Christianand Moslem sectors.   The sound of exploding shells rocked Beirut around noon. Smokeand dust billowed from stricken targets and ambulance sirens wailed.Panicking motorists abandoned their cars and took refuge in buildingentrances. Shopkeepers lowered their shutters.   Parents rushed to the few open schools to bring children home.Some schools reopened last week when the security situation appearedto improve.   The latest fighting erupted March 8, two days after Christianleader Gen. Michel Aoun blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backedmilitias south of Beirut.   Retaliating Lebanese Druse militiamen started to besiege the310-square-mile Christian enclave north of Beirut that is home toabout 1 million people. That siege has been enforced by Syriantroops in Lebanon under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate.   ``This is the way the Syrians responded to the cease-fire calledby the tripartite Arab committee,'' the Christian Voice of Lebanonradio complained.   The Arab League has given its committee _ comprising AlgerianPresident Chadli Bendjedid, King Hassan II of Morocco and SaudiArabia's King Fahd _ until November to negotiate a settlement inLebanon.   On Tuesday, the committee repeated calls for a cease-fire and alifting of port blockades.   It said once the cease-fire is consolidated, it will inviteLebanon's parliament to meet outside the country to negotiate a newpower-sharing formula and end the 14-year conflict betweenChristians and Moslems.   Leaders of both sides welcomed the peace call, but the Christiansdo not want to meet abroad.   Christian legislators say that if Syria lifts the siege, theycould meet at Beirut's mid-city parliament building.   The leftist daily paper As-Safir quoted Moslem parliament speakerHussein Husseini as calling on deputies to ``carry out your duty andcooperate with the tripartite Arab committee.''</TEXT></DOC>
