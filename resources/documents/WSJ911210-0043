Butonly if you have a personal dietitian to keep a running tallyof your daily totals. How else could you make sure that ifyou ate a Big Mac, the rest of your diet wouldn't exceedrecommended levels of fat, cholesterol, sodium, etc.?   So most nutrition-conscious consumers take the simpleroute. They choose more good foods, and fewer of those thathave serious nutritional flaws. Eggs are high in cholesterol,so they eat very few eggs. Meat is high in saturated fat, sothey rarely eat meat. A Burger King Double Whopper withCheese contains a day's worth of saturated fat, so that'sonly an occasional indulgence.</LP><TEXT>   The food industry may not like that simple way ofselecting food, because it hurts sales of eggs, meat andother unhealthy foods. The American Dietetic Association maynot like it because, as you appropriately pointed out, thefood industry funds its National Center for Nutrition andDietetics.   People have known for decades that candy, soft drinks,cakes, cookies, etc. are not good for them and should beeaten only infrequently. How will people learn that wholemilk, hot dogs, hamburgers and other foods belong in the samecategory if dietitians offer nothing but platitudes like &quot;allfoods can be part of a healthy diet?&quot;   Bonnie Liebman   Director of Nutrition   Center for Science in the Public Interest   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
