The investment firm also confirmed it has been underinvestigation by a federal grand jury.   The information is contained in a preliminary prospectus for NewAmerica High Income Fund Inc., a new high-yield ``junk bond'' fundbeing Drexel is underwriting. Such information routinely isrequired in prospectuses to warn would-be investors of potentialrisk.   The document describing the fund was dated Feb. 16 and mailed toinvestors last week.   It stated Drexel had advised the fund about the SEC staffrecomendations for civil actions against the firm and against someemployees ``relating to transactions, some of which may haveinvolved `high yield' bonds.''   ``No assurance can be given that the results of any such SECaction or grand jury investigation will not have an adverse effecton Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and-or the market for `high yield'bonds, a market in which Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is animportant participant,'' the prospectus said.   Despite the caveat, sales of the fund apparently were unaffectedon Friday, its first trading day, when it closed unchanged at $10per share.   Steven S. Anreder, Drexel's chief spokesman, on Monday declinedto comment outside of the information contained in the prospectus.   In January, Drexel and several ranking employees _ includingjunk-bond chief Michael Milken _ reportedly were informed that theSEC staff had decided to recommend charges of violations ofsecurity laws.   On Jan. 27, the Wall Street Journal said the focus of the SEC'sinvestigation of Drexel involved possible violations of securitieslaws in corporate takeover situations, particularly ``stockparking'' _ the hiding of true ownership of stock in someone else'sname. The practice can be used to evade SEC reporting requirements.   Drexel and the employees have lodged their opposition to thedecision with the SEC, but the federal agency had not decidedwhether to proceed, according to the prospectus.   The firm previously has acknowledged that an investigation wasunder way, but it has maintained that no wrongdoing took place.   The prospectus says Drexel has furnished documents to a federalgrand jury in New York, and some employees have appeared before thepanel.   Drexel reportedly has been the object of government scrutinysince the breaking of the scandal surrounding former arbitragerIvan F. Boesky, because of the firm's extensive involvement infinancing of corporate takeovers involved in the scandal.</TEXT></DOC>
