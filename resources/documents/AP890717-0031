The guidelines released today are the first major step towardachieving ``high and rigorous standards for what teachers shouldknow and be able to do,'' said James A. Kelly, president of theNational Board for Professional Teaching Standards.   The certificates will be given to teachers who qualify throughessays, interviews, performance and other means, the group said.   ``No one has ever tried to do something like this in a professionthis size with so many built-in constraints,'' Kelly said.   The 63-member board, chaired by former North Carolina Gov. JamesHunt, is scheduled to start awarding the voluntary certificates in1993.   The nation's 2.5 million teachers may apply for certification ifthey have a bachelor of arts degree and at least three years ofexperience.   Teachers will be evaluated on their knowledge of their subject,their competence in teaching techniques and their understanding ofchild development, according to the guidelines released in Chicago.Copies also were made available in Washington.   The national board, proposed three years ago by the CarnegieForum on Education and the Economy, is made up of teachers,government officials, business leaders and representatives of highereducation.   Through the voluntary certificates, the board aims to increaseteacher professionalism, upgrade children's learning environmentsand spur improvements in teacher training.   The credential also is expected to make teaching a moreattractive career option and give teachers a chance to move into newroles requiring particular expertise.   Certified teachers may also command better salaries, but Kellysaid that will depend on local authorities.   ``The board has always said we want our certificates to berecognized,'' he said in an interview. ``But it's not the board'sbusiness to say how each school district and private school shouldrecognize certified teachers.''   Kelly said the board will not limit the number of teachers itcertifies and does not anticipate the credential being restricted toan elite group. But he noted that ``not everyone who tries willpass. This is not a matter of mailing a transcript to the statecapitol and getting a license back by return mail.''   Evaluation methods may include multiple choice tests, essays,interviews, simulated lesson plans and parent conferences andobservation of the teachers at work, the board report said.   A typical evaluation could involve asking a music teacher tobring a videotape of an orchestra rehearsal or asking a teacher tocome to an assessment center to defend his or her methods, Kellysaid.   The board plans to issue certificates in 29 fields, includingearly and middle childhood, music, art, foreign languages, physicaleducation, special education, vocational fields, and subject areassuch as math, science, social studies and English for different agegroups.   It is unclear whether the board will eventually offer more thanone level of certification, a concept opposed by the NationalEducation Association.   The 2-million-member NEA and its 700,000-member rival, theAmerican Federation of Teachers, each have seven seats on thenational board.   AFT President Albert Shanker, a longtime backer of nationalteacher certification, said the guidelines prove skeptics were wrongwhen they said the task was impossible. ``We can be proud that wehave come so far,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
