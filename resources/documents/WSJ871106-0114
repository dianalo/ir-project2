Under the program, called daily adjustable tax-exempt securities, or Dates, investors have the option of selling the securities back to the issuer as often as every day. Salomon, acting as remarketing agent, would then find other buyers so that the securities remained outstanding. Currently, about $4 billion of Dates are outstanding.    Under the agreement reached yesterday, Erlich Bober will take over as remarketing agent. Erlich Bober, with $20.2 million of capital as of Sept. 30, is already a leading underwriter of short-term tax-exempt securities for municipalities.    The firm expects its purchase of the Dates program to strengthen its investment banking role in municipal transactions, said Burtt R. Erlich, chairman. &quot;We think we'll get more issuers talking to us because we have this business.&quot;    However, issuers of outstanding Dates won't be required to use the firm. Many Wall Street firms, including Erlich Bober, offer programs similar to the Dates program, and a number of them have been soliciting business from Salomon clients since the firm announced it was pulling out of the tax-exempt securities market.    Mr. Erlich said it's too early to tell how many of Salomon's clients his firm will be able to keep. &quot;We're paying a sliding scale,&quot; he added, &quot;based on how many people stay&quot; in the program. Salomon is doing its best to simplify the changeover to Erlich Bober, says Thomas K. McCaughey, a Salomon managing director. For example, it's absorbing most of the legal costs for clients who make the switch.    Because Erlich Bober's capital is so much smaller than Salomon's, the firm said it has arranged for a standby line of credit covering the entire program from Republic National Bank, New York.    Mr. McCaughey said the firm picked Erlich Bober partly because its business is limited to tax-exempt securities. &quot;Multiline firms are questioning their commitment&quot; to peripheral lines of business, he noted. &quot;We've chosen a firm whose lifeblood is the municipal business.&quot;    In making that choice, Salomon also avoids potential competition for some corporate clients. The Dates program, which has corporate as well as municipal issuers, gave Salomon valuable access to companies such as Exxon Corp., AMR Corp., and Mead Corp., and there had been speculation on Wall Street that the firm would avoid selling the program to competitors in the corporate finance arena.    Mr. McCaughey says fear of competition wasn't a factor in Salomon's choice -- but Erlich Bober, at least, thought otherwise. The firm, which does no corporate finance, &quot;put that in our proposal&quot; as a marketing point, Mr. Erlich says. </TEXT></DOC>
