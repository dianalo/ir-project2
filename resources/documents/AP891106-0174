U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall dismissed the libellawsuit last week, said Humperdinck attorney Robert Rotstein.Rotstein said Humperdinck would appeal.   Humperdinck, 53, has tested negative for the virus that causesacquired immune deficiency syndrome, Rotstein said.   Mike Walker, a National Enquirer editor, said Monday that theLantana, Fla.-based newspaper stood behind the article, which hesaid was based on a court filing and was therefore not libelous.   ``In our Dec. 27, 1988, issue, we published a story describinghow the mother of Engelbert's illegitimate child charged in a legalproceeding that the singer had the AIDS virus,'' Walker said. ``Wereported the allegation in an accurate and truthful manner and nowwe feel vindicated by the judge's verdict.''   The headline, ``Mother of His Child Claims in Court ...Engelbert Has AIDS Virus,'' was totally accurate, the Enquirermaintained, published only after being closely reviewed by legalcounsel.   Kathy Jetter filed papers in New York City's Family Courtdemanding that Humperdinck provide for the financial future of her12-year-old daughter, already ruled by a court to be his daughter.   Humperdinck's lawsuit said the woman's claims about him werefalse and unsubstantiated and that they were ultimately dismissedby the New York court.   Humperdinck claimed the Enguirer's story was false and malicious.   The National Enquirer is a weekly supermarket tabloid thatboasts the largest circulation of any paper in America.</TEXT></DOC>
