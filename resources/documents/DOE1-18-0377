It is noted that implementation of the parallel inferencingarchitecture on a commercially-available production system compiler obviatesthe use of LISP software. The architecture presented is ideally suitedto application as a vehicle for any embedded, high-speed inferencingsystem that is responsible for the processing of information at or nearreal time. 9 references.</TEXT></DOC>
