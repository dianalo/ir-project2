The European consortium has found a new engine supplier for the A-340, clearing the way for European governments to decide next month on funding for the aircraft project, senior government officials said.    Three weeks ago, the engine consortium that had promised a high-technology propeller-jet hybrid to Airbus's A-340 customers reneged, saying it couldn't solve certain technical problems in time. International Aero Engines AG, a five-company group led by Rolls-Royce Ltd. of Britain and the Pratt andamp; Whitney unit of United Technologies Corp. of the U.S., said there were too many risks associated with developing the so-called SuperFan engine in the time frame demanded by Airbus.    But almost immediately, another engine maker stepped forward with a firm proposal for a regular jet engine that would nearly match the thrust, range and fuel-use specifications of the SuperFan. CFM International S.A., a joint venture between Snecma of France and General Electric Co. of the U.S., signed an agreement with Airbus promising an improved version of the engine that CFM earlier had offered for the A-340.    Airbus can now go back with amended offers to the handful of carriers that have committed to or expressed interest in the four-engine A-340. &quot;We're expecting these signatures quite soon,&quot; predicted a French government official involved with Airbus affairs. &quot;We will have the launch customers soon.&quot;    One key player is Lufthansa, which has pushed hard for the A-340 to be built and four months ago ordered as many as 30 of them with SuperFan engines. But the West German flag carrier appears to be satisfied with the switch, although it hasn't signed anything yet. The new CFM engine, called the CFM56-5-S3, &quot;proved to be very interesting for our engineers in Hamburg,&quot; a Lufthansa spokesman said. &quot;They think this is a sound alternative to the SuperFan.&quot;    A spokesman for Airbus said the switch in engines hasn't lost the company any customers that already committed to the aircraft. &quot;The reaction we're getting is fairly positive,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;It turns out that some airlines had doubts about SuperFan.&quot;    Airbus's major partners, Aerospatiale of France, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany and British Aerospace PLC, last year asked their governments for a total of some $3 billion to cover most of the costs of developing the A-340 and a sister aircraft, the medium-range, twin-engine A-330.    Last month, in hopes of loosening those purse-strings, Airbus announced it had received commitments from nine customers, including Lufthansa and Air France, for a total of 104 of the A-330s and A-340s. And a few weeks later, Northwest Airlines of the U.S. said it will buy as many as 20 A-340s and take options on 10 A-330s. A launch in mid-April was envisioned by Airbus until the SuperFan project was suspended.    Barring any new problems or widespread defections from the A-340 to the competing McDonnell Douglas Corp. MD-11 airliner, the European governments that subsidize Airbus now only have to finish dickering about the amounts they will provide for launch aid. Both the French official and a West German government source said the timetable now is pointing toward government funding decisions in late May.    &quot;We must decide soon or Airbus's chances in the market will diminish,&quot; said the German official, noting that McDonnell Douglas is continuing to win new orders for its MD-11.    Currently, Bonn civil servants are attempting to find a compromise between Messerschmitt, which wants near-total subsidization of its share of the Airbus work, and the West German Finance Ministry, which wants to lessen its own financial burden. The German official added that the government's previously announced plans to entice large industrial companies in West Germany to join Messerschmitt in staking Airbus are not a part of the basic agreement now under discussion.    The Messerschmitt request, once cleared by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, would then have to go to the budget committee of the Bundestag before going to the full cabinet for approval.    In Paris, meanwhile, the process seems to be a little further along, although full cabinet approval will be necessary. &quot;In principle, the amount and the terms are already agreed between Aerospatiale and the Finance Ministry,&quot; said the government official in Paris. &quot;The negotiations now are over administrative detail.&quot; He said that Aerospatiale's share of the project would be about $1.08 billion.    British Aerospace, which asked the United Kingdom Department of Trade and Industry for the equivalent of $1.24 billion for its work share, still is in negotiations over that amount. Sir Austin Pearce, British Aerospace chairman, said recently that the department had made a &quot;totally unacceptable&quot; offer, reported to be $662.6 million. It is understood that the department has since sweetened somewhat its offer.    &quot;We would like it agreed just as swiftly as possible,&quot; said a British Aerospace spokesman. &quot;From a marketing point of view, Airbus needs a real airplane to go up against the MD-11.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
