(SCO)and Interactive Systems Corp. offer users the ability to tap the strengths ofUnix, while not requiring them to sacrifice their investment in DOS.andM;&quot;Interactive Systems' VP/ix [DOS-emulation program] is wonderful.andP;  There havebeen very few [DOS] programs that we have not been able to run [underInteractive's Unix],&quot; said Norm Mathews, a partner at The Works Co., asystems-development firm located in Culver City, Calif.andP;  &quot;We are able toexecute these programs very rapidly,&quot; Mathews added, explaining that his firmis able to rapidly execute a variety of DOS programs under Unix, such asLotus 1-2-3 and Ashton-Tate's Applause.andM;Mathews is using Interactive's Architect Workstation Developer Platform 2.2for the development of custom accounting systems for a range of clients.andM;The ability to execute DOS programs under Unix using the Interactive VP/ixcomponent is a valuable feature because clients running under DOS are able toupgrade to Unix and not lose any DOS programs, according to Mathews.andM;With the recent flurry of support for Microsoft Windows 3.0, users anddevelopers are clamoring for Windows applications that can run under Unix.andM;According to Richard Pfeiffer, systems analyst at General Electric Co. inSchenectady, N.Y., one drawback of SCO Open Desktop 1.0 is its lack ofsupport for Windows 3.0.andM;&quot;It is impossible to bring up a Windows 3.0 application in X Windows.andP;  It'slike trying to run OS/2 in a DOS box -- the system tries to go into protectedmode,&quot; said Pfeiffer.andM;&quot;This causes a real problem because all of a sudden everyone is trying to runWindows applications.andP;  I don't expect to see Excel or Word for Windows showup in X [Windows] in the near future, and a lot of people aren't going towant to give up their spreadsheet or word processor and switch to Unix,&quot; headded.andM;Pfeiffer said that he is using Informix Software Inc.'s Wingz spreadsheetunder Open Desktop and is impressed with how the SCO product presents acommon graphical interface across diverse platforms such as X Windows and theMacintosh.andM;Keeping a standard user interface is important when running Unix, accordingto Pfeiffer, and that is a major reason why he is pleased with theintegration of X Windows into SCO's product.andM;&quot;It may not be the perfect answer, but it is a standard,&quot; said Pfeiffer.andO;&quot;The fact that you can count on it being the same [across diverse platforms]makes it a valuable tool.&quot;andM;Because of the complexity of Unix, DOS users may be reluctant to switch.andO;However, Mathews said that the structure of Unix allows developers to makethe transition easier for end users.andM;&quot;To make Unix less complicated for our end users, we try to isolate them fromthe operating system,&quot; said Mathews.andP;  &quot;We set the system up so when they login, a menu pops up with all the applications they need.&quot;andM;Unix's ability to configure shells allows developers to do a great deal ofsophisticated work in a short amount of time, said Mathews.andM;&quot;Unix is a very open environment.andP;  There are not a lot of restrictions,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;The file-redirection option allows [developers] to develop one set oftools and have them work in a number of different ways.andP;  This is extremelyhelpful for us because we get a lot of different situations with diverseclient needs.andP;  With Unix, we are able to customize to those needs.&quot;andM;Momentum appears to be building for the operating system, Mathews added,noting that certain products, such as Symantec Corp.'s Norton Utilities andWordPerfect Corp.'s WordPerfect, have been adapted to run directly underUnix.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
