Denison's fate now rests with its bankers, who haveextended a loan payment deadline until May 15 while theyconsider the company's plan to restructure 148 millionCanadian dollars (US$128.5 million) in debt.</LP><TEXT>   Denison said Ontario Hydro canceled its long-term supplycontract after the two sides couldn't agree on a new uraniumpricing formula. Analysts estimate the provincially ownedutility is paying as much as US$40 a pound for Denison'suranium, well above current market prices of about $10 apound.   Although the Ontario Hydro contract is now scheduled toexpire at the end of next year, Denison said it expects toclose the mine in the spring of 1992 by acceleratingdeliveries. The company is scheduled to deliver about 1.4million pounds of uranium to Ontario Hydro this year.   The Denison mine, in Elliot Lake, Ontario, has a highercost base than other uranium mines because of its relativelylow grade of ore. &quot;Over the past 10 years, buying Elliot Lakeuranium has already cost about C$1 billion more than if ithad been purchased from other sources,&quot; said Robert Franklin,Ontario Hydro's president and chief executive officer.   By canceling the contract, Ontario Hydro will forfeitabout C$160 million in advance payments made to Denison toexpand the mine in the late 1970s, the utility said.   A spokeswoman for Toronto-Dominion Bank, one of Denison'screditors, declined to say what effect the cancellation ofthe contract would have on the Denison debt-restructuringproposal. However, she said the bank wasn't surprised byOntario Hydro's move.   William James, Denison's president and chief executiveofficer, said he expects the company eventually will be ableto pay part of its bank debt by selling off assets, includingforeign oil and gas interests. Mr. James also said he hopesto recover from Ontario Hydro at least part of the investmentmade in expanding the mine on the assumption the OntarioHydro contract would run until 2012.</TEXT></DOC>
