The agency had proposed banning most uses of thepesticides. But it changed its position primarily as a resultof a $10 million, industry-funded survey of grocery productsthat showed the health risk to consumers from ethylenebisdithiocarbamate, a class of three pesticides, was lessthan had been indicated by field tests of crops.</LP><TEXT>   The EPA said that EBDC use will be allowed on 45 cropsranging from apples to wheat, subject to certain newconditions. But the agency decided to ban use of thepesticide on 11 other crops, an action with an estimatedannual cost of $21 million to $64 million.   At a news conference, EPA administrator William Reilly andother officials didn't rule out the possibility that similardata might show other pesticides to be less harmful thanfield tests indicate. But they said that it is up to thechemical manufacturers to conduct such studies and predictedthat companies wouldn't necessarily want to undertake suchexpensive efforts for other chemicals. They noted, amongother things, that EBDCs break down faster than otherpesticides, meaning there was a basis to expect that testresults would differ significantly between the fields andgrocery shelves.   Moreover, Mr. Reilly defended the agency's 1989 decisionto propose a ban on EBDCs as a result of the field-test data.&quot;We have an obligation to regulate conservatively -- in otherwords, to err on the side of safety when we're uncertainabout the extent of risk,&quot; he said.   Makers of the chemicals, however, anticipating therestrictions, had voluntarily halted most uses of thepesticide as of Jan. 1, 1990. The companies, as a result ofyesterday's action, will be able to resume EBDC use on mostof the crops.   The survey of grocery shelves, which consisted of almost6,000 food samples, was conducted by a task force formed bythe four makers of the chemical: Atochem North America Inc.;BASF Corp., a unit of BASF AG; Du Pont Co., and Rohm andamp; HaasCo. A task force spokeswoman called the EPA action &quot;good newsfor American farmers and consumers.&quot;   The EPA also based its decision on a more thoroughassessment of animal laboratory studies.   Environmental and consumer groups criticized the EPAaction. Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, aconsumer-advocacy group, accused the EPA of &quot;protecting theeconomic interest of industry over the health interest ofconsumers.&quot;   But the agency said that the cancer risk from eating fruitor vegetables from the EBDC-treated crops that will beallowed amounts to about one additional cancer for every onemillion people exposed for a lifetime. The largest remainingagricultural uses of EBDC pesticides include apples,cucumbers, lettuce, melons, onions, potatoes, squash, smallgrains, sweet corn and tomatoes.   Use of the pesticide will be banned on apricots, carrots,celery, collards, mustard greens, nectarines, peaches,rhubarb, spinach, succulent beans and turnips.   The EPA is requiring certain restrictions on the use ofEBDCs, including reducing the number of treatments allowed ona single crop and lengthening the time between treatment andharvest. Agriculture workers and home gardeners will have towear protective clothing. In addition, the EPA suggests thatpeople wash or peel fruits and vegetables before eating,because residues are mostly found on the surface.</TEXT></DOC>
