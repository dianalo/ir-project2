Both published literature andinformation obtained from Agency program office files were evaluatedas they pertained to potential human health, aquatic life, and environmentaleffects of hazardous-waste constituents. Diethylformamide has been determinedto be a systemic toxicant. An Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), definedas the amount of a chemical to which humans can be exposed on a dailybasis over an extended period of time (usually a lifetime) without sufferinga deleterious effect, for diethylformamide is 0.011 mg/kg/day for oralexposure. Existing data are insufficient to determine a (Reportable Quantity)value.</TEXT></DOC>
