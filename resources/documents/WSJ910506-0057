The alliance among the nation's largest cable company, thebiggest telecommunications equipment maker and the regionalBell phone company is the latest evidence of a thaw in icyrelations between the telephone and cable industries -- atleast outside of Washington. The two giant industries havebeen fighting bitterly for years, trying to enter eachother's business while lobbying to keep competitors out oftheir own. The experiment could pave the way for extensiveties between the two industries, and perhaps spur deploymentof optical fiber into residential neighborhoods.</LP><TEXT>   The consumer test of viewer-controlled cable television,which the companies plan to begin in the fourth quarter,involves two services. One would allow customers to selectprograms from a list of more than 1,000 movies and specialevents -- and watch them whenever they wanted. Prices wouldbe about the same as video-store rentals, if not lower,company officials said. The second service, a pay-per viewarrangement, would offer customers 15 movies and otherprograms a day.   &quot;This is as close as we can come to an electronic videostore,&quot; said John Malone, president and chief executiveofficer of TCI. If successful, a video-on-demand servicecould become available across the country by the mid-to-late1990s, he said.   The companies, looking for an accurate sampling ofconsumer reactions, plan to hook up 450 homes in suburbanDenver, testing each service in half of the homes. Midwaythrough the test, both services will be delivered to all 450homes.   TCI's United Artists Cable affiliate will offer theservices in addition to its regular cable programming. Thecompany plans to use a hybrid fiber optic and coaxial cablesystem to deliver the video signals. U S West's contributionis the optical fiber superhighway connecting the test center,essentially an electronic video library, with the cablecompany's head-end facilities. It will also examineconsumers' reactions to the services. ATandamp;T is supplyingequipment and software needed to deliver the services toconsumers' homes, as well as a device that sits on top of thetelevision set and a remote-control unit users need to orderand receive programs. Both TCI and U S West are based inDenver; ATandamp;T is based in New York.   The test, the largest of consumers' reaction to so-calledvideo-on-demand services, could usher in a new era ofcooperation between cable and telephone companies as they tryto tap new revenue streams. The potential market for the newhome-entertainment services is estimated in billions ofdollars.   Mr. Malone said that although the technologies -- opticalfiber, digital transmission and digital compression of videosignals -- aren't brand new, improvements in the last sixmonths have been dramatic. Without these advances, theservices wouldn't have been cost-effective, he said.   Nevertheless, to expand the services to an entire city orbeyond, a cable company would need advancedtelecommunications switching gear that could handle videosignals and a network designed more like a phone company'sthan a cable network. Robert Russell, vice president,marketing for ATandamp;T's Network Systems, said that building theso-called video switch is not a big hurdle. Perhaps moreimportant will be the equipment distributed to customers. &quot;Ithas to be very easy to use,&quot; he said.   As phone companies install more fiber in their networks,alliances with cable companies are certain to become moreattractive. &quot;We're looking forward to other areas where wecan cooperate in the future,&quot; said Richard McCormick, U SWest's president and chief executive.   Cooperation will be driven by economics, technology andconsumer demand for flexible home entertainment. Already,U.S. phone companies and cable companies have formedpartnerships to run cable operation throughout the U.K.   Despite the business arrangements, tensions in Washingtonaren't likely to dissipate anytime soon, especially as theseven regional Bell companies step up lobbying to liftconsent-decree restrictions, including the bar on owning astake in the information or video services carried on theirnetworks. &quot;TCI and U S West are the doves on both sides,&quot;said Mr. Malone. &quot;But there will be conflict in Washington solong as there is a legislative agenda.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
