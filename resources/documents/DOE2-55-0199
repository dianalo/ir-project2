As such, chemical heat pumps can be classified by drive (electricdrive, heat amplifier, or temperature amplifier), operating mode (periodicor continuous), coupling between the heat engine and heat pumps, thermodynamiccycle used in the heat engine and heat pump, and phases of the workingmaterial. This classification of chemical heat pumps suggests many newheat pump configurations that have not been considered previously. Thisdocument describes possible heat pump configurations and the justificationfor selecting certain heat pumps for further study. Four types of heat-of-reactionchemical heat pumps are considered worthy of further development; thecharacteristics of these pumps are discussed in this document. 18 refs.,19 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
