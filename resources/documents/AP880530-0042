(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cocaine led to the drowning death of a10-year-old boy, an autopsy found, but his grandmother won'tbelieve it.   ``I'll go to my grave and they'll never convince me that mygrandson used drugs,'' said Geraldine Baker, who raised AndrewBaker for the first nine years of his life.   But the Will County coroner's office said it found evidence ofcocaine in his bloodsteam, the Chicago Tribune reported Sunday.   ``You wouldn't even expect this in Chicago. Why it happenedhere, how it happened here, we don't know,'' said Charles Connor,mayor of this town of 77,000 people, 30 miles southwest of Chicago.   The county coroner's office determined the 4th-grader drowned ina YMCA swimming pool April 16 because cocaine in his blood causedhim to lose consciousness.   The pathologist who performed an autopsy found a cluster offungus in the boy's heart _ evidence the boy had been injectedpreviously with a dirty hypodermic needle or impure drugs, saidChief Deputy Coroner William Ferguson.   The fungus, combined with the cocaine in Andrew's blood, causedan inflammation of the heart, the autopsy showed. The heart beatirregularly while he was swimming, and the boy lost consciousnessand drowned.   ``The findings suggest that the deceased used cocaine on morethan one occasion, including shortly before death, and that bothrespiratory and intravenous routes of administration were used,''the report states.   Sheriff's deputies said they have few clues about who suppliedthe cocaine that killed Andrew.   Andrew moved in with his mother, Jolene Williams, about a yearago. She said she also does not believe the lab results.   ``Where did he get it? How did he afford it?'' said Ms.Williams, 30.   Ferguson said he initially had trouble believing the autopsyreport.   ``I sympathize with the family in thinking that we somehow madea mistake,'' Ferguson said. ``But the lab has run the sample manytimes at my request. They feel confident that their results wereaccurate.''</TEXT></DOC>
