Najib also confirmed on Sunday that guerrillas fighting hisSoviet-backed government had captured a garrison near the Pakistanborder after a four-month siege. The guerrillas said the victoryopened a new, direct supply route for weapons into Afghanistan.   In a speech to a visiting Soviet delegation and a group ofprivate American citizens, Najib said the United States must stopproviding military aid to Pakistan if it wants the Soviet Union tostop arming Afghanistan.   Najib's demand appeared more rhetorical than practical. Hisarmy's vulnerability to attacks by Pakistani-based Afghanguerrillas would become even more pronounced if Kabul lost Moscow'sbacking.   Expounding on a ``formula of symmetry,'' Najib suggested Sovietaid to his government continue at the same level as U.S. assistanceto Pakistan.   If ``there must be a cutoff of aid for the Afghan government,there must be a cutoff of all American aid to the Pakistanigovernment,'' Najib told the two groups at the end of a week-longconference on Afghanistan.   The Soviet Union has agreed to start withdrawing its estimated115,000 troops from Afghanistan on May 15 under a U.N.-mediatedagreement signed April 14 in Geneva by the United States, theSoviet Union, Afghanistan and Pakistan.   The United States, China and several other countries have beenaiding the Afghan guerrillas via Pakistan. The Soviet Union armsthe Afghan military forces. Each superpower has reseved the rightto continue its assistance as long as the other one does.   Throughout his address to the American and Soviet delegations,Najib stressed his government's friendship with the Soviet Union,which shares a 1,400-mile border with this central Asian nation.   But he said repeatedly that his government sought friendlierties _ and specifically private investment _ from the United States.   Talking later with reporters, he said: ``We would like goodrelations, politically, economically, culturally with the UnitedStates of America, even including military aid to our country todefend its sovereignty and its territorial integrity.''   Guerrilla leaders in Pakistan said Saturday their fighterscaptured Barikot, base of the Afghan army's 55th brigade, onFriday. The garrison is in Afghanistan's northeast Kunar province.   Najib confirmed that government troops evacuated the garrisonbut described the incident as ``a hange of position'' rather than adefeat.   Later Sunday, Najib attended a ceremony marking Afghanistan'sApril 27 communist revolution and reiterated his call forreconciliation with the rebels.   ``Now more than any other time, we are hopeful for peace andnational reconciliation,'' he was quoted as saying by Radio Kabul.   For the guerrillas, the capture of Barikot would open a majorweapons supply route from Pakistan's border town of Arando toAfghanistan's northeastern province of Nuristan and Kunar.   The guerrillas, who were not direct party to the Geneva accord,have vowed to continue fighting until Najib's government isoverthrown. The Soviets intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979.   The Afghan president, whose robust, fleshy build gives him theappearance of a football player gone slightly to seed, flashedbroad smiles and gestured expansively as he met the Soviet andAmerican groups for two hours at Arg Palace in the heart of Kabul.   Throughout his speech, Najib, who replaced another Soviet-backedAfghan leader in 1986, denounced the United States for supplyingthe guerrillas with high-powered Stinger missiles.   The Afghan government repeatedly has accused the rebels of usingStingers against civilian Afghan aircraft.   The head of the American delegation, former U.S. ambassador toEl Salvador Robert E. White, defended the United States.   ``It was not the United States that introduced high-tech weaponsinto Afghanistan,'' said White, who is now president of thenon-government International Center for Development Policy inWashington.   ``Stingers ... are terrible weapons, but their objectives are todestroy machines of war that have rained death and destruction onAfghanistan,'' White said.</TEXT></DOC>
