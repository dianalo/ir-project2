(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hold the anchovies, and the delivery man.   Tenants of a Lawrence trailer park have been told to head for arestaurant, not a telephone, if they want a pizza.   Wayne Lacy, manager of Brookwood Mobile Home Community, hasbanned pizza deliveries because he says pizza truck drivers go toofast through the park.   Residents were told this week that they would get a warning forthe first delivery and their leases would be terminated after thesecond.   Lacy said residents have been complaining about speeding pizzatrucks for two years.   ``I'm through with it,'' Lacy said. ``I've had too many cussingsfrom drivers, too many complaints from the tenants. There justwon't be any more pizza deliveries.''   Mark Pitner, a counselor with Consumer Affairs Association, saidsome Brookwood residents have complained about the ban. But the banappears to be legal because leases at the park carry a 30-day limit.   ``Because it's a month-to-month lease, and all he's doing isterminating the lease and not evicting residents. He can do that,''Pitner said. ``That's something we'd like to see changed in theKansas Landlord-Tenant Act, but it's legal.''   About 200 of Brookwood 265 units are occupied.</TEXT></DOC>
