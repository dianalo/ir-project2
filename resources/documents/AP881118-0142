(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Allegations that a Cornell Universitygraduate student created a ``virus'' that jammed a nationwidenetwork of computers are being investigated by a federal grand jury,a prosecutor said.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Baxter confirmed the investigationThursday but declined to say when the panel began hearing evidenceor if anyone had been subpoenaed to testify.   Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, is suspected of unleashing the virus ona computer communication network earlier this month, disrupting6,000 computers nationwide.   Morris' friends have quoted him as saying he didn't intend anyharm.   The virus program transmitted copies of itself from computer tocomputer along the InterNet computer network, crashing an estimated6,000 computers nationwide. It also instructed the infectedcomputers to make copies of the virus, filling memory space andkeeping the machines busy.   The virus caused at least $97 million in damage, because ofinterrupted work on computers that had to be shut down, and in thework need to resuscitate the computers, the director of the ComputerVirus Industry Association said Thursday.   ``Our calculations of the damage it caused are very conservative.The real cost is probably well over $100 million,'' said JohnMcAfee, computer virus consultant and director of a SantaClara-based group of 11 companies that markets computer programs tofight viral programs.   ``The analogy there is the cost of conducting a massive searchfor thousands of hidden bombs and then disabling them,'' McAfee said.   ``Just the time that the programmers spent conferring with eachother, either in meetings or over the telephone, as they tried toshare knowledge in combatting the infection was estimated ... atleast 12,000 (hours),'' McAfee said.   No charges have been filed.   The FBI is conducting a criminal investigation to determine ifstatutes on wire fraud, malicious mischief or unlawful access tostored communications may have been broken. The FBI has subpoenaedcomputer tapes and other records at Cornell's computer sciencedepartment.   Baxter declined to say if anyone other than Morris is the targetof the grand jury investigation in Syracuse.</TEXT></DOC>
