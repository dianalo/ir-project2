This paper presentsan efficient procedure for the generation of earthquake response spectrafor light equipment in a massive structure. It is assumed that the equipmentmay be modeled as a single-degree-of-freedom linear oscillator attachedat a single point to a multi-degree-of-freedom linear system. Modal propertiesof the combined equipment/structure may be determine from the known propertiesof the separate systems. The peak equipment response to a given ground-motiontime history is determined from a frequency domain analysis of the combinedsystem and the ground-motion response spectra. This procedure takes intoaccount equipment/structure interaction, correlation between modes, andresponse transience, some or all of which are typically ignored in currentpractice. Because most of the theoretical development for this procedurehas been done in the nuclear industry, the primary focus of this paperis on the application of the procedure to offshore platforms. Severalnumerical examples are included to demonstrate the excellent agreementbetween this procedure and time-history results.</TEXT></DOC>
