Therefore only within a long-term nuclear co-operation a meaningfultransfer of such a multifaceted technology can reasonably be achieved.A long-term nuclear co-operation anticipates a nuclear power plant programconsisting of a few nuclear power plants of a certain type and size inorder to achieve the indispensable effect ''learning by doing''. Theobjectives of nuclear technology transfer may be in general or in particular;absorption of a foreign nuclear technology and its adaptation to theconditions and needs of the receiver's country; built-up of industrialinfrastructure for planning, construction and operation of nuclear powerplants; raising of the general industrial level and achieve a spin-offeffect; creation of a basis for independent development of nuclear technology.The technology transfer on one side and the construction program of nuclearpower plants on the other side cannot be practiced by two parallel butseparated event, however, they form one unit. Contrary to the importof industrial equipment in terms of ''black box'', by means of a nucleartechnology transfer the introduction of new dependencies will be prevented.The technology transfer can remarkably be facilitated by forming a jointventure engineering company in the recipient country. The required know-howpotential within a certain time period determines the intensity of thetechnology transfer and consequently the man power to be involved. Therealization of such technology transfer is demonstrated by means of practicalexamples. (author). 12 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
