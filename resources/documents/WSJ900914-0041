In a meeting with securities analysts, the company saidrevenue isn't expected to rise as much as earnings, growingmoderately at a rate of about 3%. Nevertheless, the company,based in New York, said it is being aided by a lower tax ratebecause of its increased investments in tax advantagedmarketable securites. That will help push earnings to &quot;recordlevels,&quot; Mr. Weston said.   Mr. Weston said also that he expects double digit growthfor earnings in the current first quarter. In fiscal 1990fourth quarter, the company earned $59.7 million, or 81 centsa share, on revenue of $425.8 million.
