White quit football for investment banking seven years ago, an encounter with Travers J. Bell Jr., the forceful founder of Daniels andamp; Bell Inc., showed him that Wall Street was as rough as the gridiron.    &quot;He said he didn't think I was smart enough to pass the securities exam,&quot; recalls the former all-pro defensive end for the Pittsburgh Steelers. &quot;Obviously, I proved him wrong.&quot;    Indeed, not only did the 38-year-old Mr. White pass that exam but, last month, he became president and chief executive officer of the New York-based brokerage concern. He succeeds Mr. Bell, who died of a heart attack at the age of 46. Mr. Bell's father succeeds his son as chairman.    Now, Mr. White has to prove himself again, this time showing Wall Street he's smart enough to keep the nation's first black-owned investment bank on firm footing just as the industry is retrenching.    In that clubby field where charisma and connections sometimes count more than mere mettle, some industry people ask whether he will be able to carry out Mr. Bell's plans to diversify beyond municipal offerings. Rumors persist that Daniels andamp; Bell was severely shaken by the loss of its founder, and speculation lingers that its board is seeking a buyer or that Bell family members might liquidate the concern.    Mr. White denies changes in direction or ownership are imminent, and he traces the rumors to rivals. &quot;Less than 24 hours after Travers died, sharks were in the water after blood,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm not saying they're all vultures, but some companies will do anything to get our business.&quot; The firm services a roster of desirable public-finance clients, including agencies in Chicago and Washington, D.C.    The tax-exempt, public finance business has been hurt lately. Nearly every major firm has trimmed municipal operations and laid off thousands of workers. According to Securities Data Co., a New York research firm, new-issue volume fell 32% to $101.3 billion in 1987 from $147.2 billion in 1986. Moreover, a study found that average underwriting fees from municipal issues fell to less than 2% of the total issue last year from less than 3% in 1982.    Daniels andamp; Bell and the dozen or so other minority-owned investment banking firms get most of their business from municipal offerings, aided in recent years by the election of more black officials. Some of these officials -- who run large cities -- require minority participation on certain transactions. But lacking strong corporate ties, minority firms have been largely excluded from the more lucrative corporate financing business.    Daniels andamp; Bell began in 1971 when it underwrote $1 million of mortgage bonds for tiny Mount Bayou, Miss., a community founded after the Civil War by former slaves. The business grew slowly until 1982, when Connecticut included the firm as a participant in a $5.5 billion underwriting. Last year, Daniels andamp; Bell ranked 20th in the U.S. among municipal underwriting firms and managed municipal financing totaling more than $9 billion.    Mr. White left football in 1981 after 10 years with the four-time Super Bowl champion Steelers, where he helped anchor the legendary &quot;Steel Curtain&quot; defense. He joined Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in Pittsburgh, rejecting a job from Mr. Bell, who, despite apparent reservations, offered him a position in New York.    Three years ago, Mr. White joined Daniels andamp; Bell in Pittsburgh as a vice president in charge of regional public finance activities. Named senior vice president and a director a year later, he still works from his Pittsburgh office and commutes to the firm's Wall Street headquarters several times a week.    Associates say his football fame helped him when prospecting for clients, and they add that football's hard regimen instilled perseverance. &quot;He was a real plugger who threw himself into the job,&quot; says Robert Hutchison, vice president and manager of Prudential-Bache's Pittsburgh office.    Some think those qualities will enable him to keep Daniels andamp; Bell growing. &quot;Travers was certainly a strong individual, but what Dwight can do is build on that legacy,&quot; says David E. Ourlicht, vice president and manager of Marine Midland Bank's municipal finance group and a former Daniels andamp; Bell vice president.    Mr. White says he isn't worried, adding that the firm is poised to snatch a big chunk of tax-exempt business now up for grabs. &quot;Somebody's got to do it.&quot;    He also says he has dibs on some of the brightest black investment bankers who were among the first fired when Wall Street firms cut back.    Mr. White says Daniels andamp; Bell may consider acquiring other minority-owned investment banking firms to help build the capital needed to land bigger municipal and corporate finance deals and to develop a full-service retail brokerage division. </TEXT></DOC>
