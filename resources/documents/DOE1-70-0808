The most important results can be summarized as follows:- Tubes of the steel 254 SMO, which are seal welded to tube sheets ofaustenitic stainless steels, are resistant to localized corrosion evenat 45 degrees C. - The fully ferritic steel MONIT has to be seal weldedto austenitic tube sheets with an overalloyed austenitic filler (Inconel625 type) in order to avoid corrosion of the welds. - The steel 254 SMO,which was fully resistant to crevice corrosion in simulated flange jointsat 35 degrees C, exhibits at 45 degrees C a tendency to superficial creviceattack. - There is no important difference in the galvanic corrosionbehaviour of NiAl-bronz (UNC C95500) in contact with the steel 254 SMOat 35 and 45 degrees C. Decreasing the chlorine content from 2.0 to 0.5ppm, however, reduces the corrosion rate considerably.</TEXT></DOC>
