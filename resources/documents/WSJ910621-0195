The trawlers, giant floating fish catching and processingfactories that can stretch the length of a football field,are criticized by many fish advocates for the way their netssuck up anything in their path, including crabs and otherspecies they aren't fishing for.</LP><TEXT>   On Tuesday, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council,an arm of the Commerce Department, is to rule on severalproposals regarding the groundfish catch, America's biggestfishery. Scientists, fish processors and trawler operatorssay the agency is expected to recommend setting aside as muchas half of the catch for the so-called on-shore segment ofthe fishing industry, which is made up of much smaller boatsthat haul their fish to processing plants on land. On-shoreoperators say the factory trawlers, which now take about 80%of the annual 5 billion pound groundfish quota, are catchingso many fish so fast that on-shore interests won't be able tooperate for more than a few months a year if the trawlersaren't curbed.   Such a decision could be costly for factory trawleroperators, who predict 10,000 fisherman, trawler hands andshipyard workers would lose their jobs. &quot;There will be manybankruptcies,&quot; says Bert Larkins, executive director of theAmerican Factory Trawler Association. &quot;It'll sink us.&quot;Trawler industry representatives have already begun lobbyingin Congress for help.   Unlike the widely publicized spotted owl and salmon cases,there isn't any clear evidence yet that the trawlers' hugetakes of groundfish -- mainly pollock and Pacific cod -- arethreatening their survival. But many fish advocates note thatthe trawlers' nets scoop up and kill many members of lessabundant species, such as king crab and king salmon. Theyalso back trawler limits as a way to avert the disastrousoverfishing that has left New England and Gulf Coast stocksof certain species badly depleted.   The trawler dispute is full of ironies. The Americantrawler fleet didn't exist before 1977, when the Magnuson Actwent into effect. The bill reflected concern that Japaneseand other foreign countries that did have factory trawlers --usually built with big government subsidies -- wereplundering American fishing grounds; it essentially barredthem from fishing within 200 miles of the U.S. coast. Thatled to the creation of an American factory trawler fleet,which now totals some 60 giant ships, each costing about $75million to build. In fact, so many American trawlers werebuilt, incorporating American improvements in fish-snaringtechnology, that there is now more fishing capacity thanthere are legally catchable groundfish.   &quot;I'm afraid we've merely exchanged foreign overfishing forAmerican overfishing,&quot; says Harry Upton, fisheries programdirector for the Center for Marine Conservation, a fishadvocate group. Indeed, because of the factory trawlers, thisyear's groundfish quota is expected to be met in five months;until 1989, the quota almost always took a year to fill.   In another unanticipated twist, some of the very Japanesegroups flushed out of the factory trawler business by theMagnuson Act ended up buying into or building on-shoreprocessing companies in Alaska; trawler advocates howl thatany allocation that favors the on-shore segment of theindustry amounts to giving back business to the Japanese thatthe Magnuson Act intended for Americans.   &quot;We Americanized this fishery, and now they're going tograb it away from us and hand it back,&quot; says Mr. Larkins.</TEXT></DOC>
