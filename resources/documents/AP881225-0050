Flor Verdugo, a school teacher in Malalcahuello who owns the onlytelephone in the town, said the Lonquimay volcano began to eruptabout 4:15 p.m. (2:15 p.m. EST) after the area was rocked by threestrong earthquakes, according to state television in Santiago.   There were no reports of injuries from the eruption or thequakes. Temblors can often precede volcanic activity.   The government's National Emergency Office said the evacuation ofvirtually the entire population of Malalcahuello was only aprecaution and that the town, about 415 miles south of Santiago, wasnot considered in danger.   The government said three craters opened on the 8,400-footvolcano, two of them emitting only heavy smoke. However, the largestcrater, with a radius of about 100 feet, spewed a thick carpet oflava.   Ms. Verdugo said a number of quakes have been felt in the areafor several days. The seismic activity, which has affected an areaof about 30 square miles, became more intense Sunday morning, shesaid. There were no immediate Richter scale readings.   Pedro Riffo, a specialist of La Frontera University in Temuco,the largest city in the area, told local reporters the eruption didnot threaten any populated area. He said Malalcahuello, the closesttown, is surrounded by a chain of mountains that would serve as anatural defense.   Riffo said three other volcanoes exist in the area, but only oneof them, the Llaima, has shown some activity in recent years.   The last registered eruption of the Lonquimay volcano occurred in1889, Riffo said.</TEXT></DOC>
