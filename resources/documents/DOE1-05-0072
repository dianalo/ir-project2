The distribution behavior of thorium was apparentlyaffected by salt composition and temperature, but that of radium waslittle affected. The effect of salt composition on the distribution behaviorwas well explained by considering the formation of complex compoundsin the salt phase. The thermodynamical properties of the complex compoundswere also evaluated.</TEXT></DOC>
