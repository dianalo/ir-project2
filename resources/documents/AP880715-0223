FALLSTROM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Outgoing Attorney General Edwin Meese III tolda group of judges and lawyers Friday that he objects to the use ofindependent counsels to investigate the executive branch becausethey are ``for all intents and purposes unaccountable.''   Without elaborating, Meese said it is not inconceivable to himthat someday an independent counsel could be used by Congress tocontrol the presidency.   ``Taken to its logical conclusion, the American people could beeffectively deprived of their right to vote for the chief executiveof their own choosing if these fundamental rights are taken awaypiecemeal by Congress,'' said Meese. The attorney general himselfwas recently the target of an investigation by an independentcounsel.   ``The creation of such an independent office takes importantgovernment functions away from politically accountable officialsand transfers them to ad hoc officials who practically have nomechanism for control and who are for all intents and purposesunaccountable,'' Meese said.   The remarks came in a speech, focusing on the separation ofpowers, to lawyers and judges attending the 8th Circuit JudicialConference.   Enacted in the post-Watergate era, the 1978 Ethics In GovernmentAct set up a system of court-appointed special prosecutors,subsequently renamed independent counsels, to investigateallegations of wrongdoing by top officials in the Executive Branch.On June 29, in a defeat for the administration, the Supreme Courtvoted 7-1 to uphold the constitutionality of the 1978 law.   In reference to that opinion, Meese said: ``How do you determinewhere the line will be drawn? Since the court itself drew noconcrete lines, some may contend that it's possible that virtuallyany executive function could be relegated to an independent officeso long as it does not positively disable the president fromaccomplishing his constitutional role. And `positively disabling'is in itself a somewhat subjective standard.''   Meese said the president needs to ``stand up to Congress'' as itattempts to acquire more power over the White House.   Meese has said he will leave his post with the Reaganadministration by next month. He made the announcement after sayinghe was vindicated when independent counsel James McKay filed areport with a federal appeals court signifying he had decided notto seek criminal charges against the attorney general.   McKay spent 14 months looking into Meese's involvement with,among other things, the bankrupt military contractor Wedtech Corp.and a $1 billion Iraqi oil-pipeline project.   McKay has referred his report to the Justice Department, wherethe Office of Professional Responsibility could consider whetherMeese had done anything unethical.   Meese had refrained from commenting on the independent counselprocess while he was under investigation by McKay. Meese removedhimself from participation in the Justice Department's filing of acourt brief raising objections to the independent counsel statute.   Meese said if the trend continued, it would not be ``stretchingthe imagination'' to envision the appointment of an independent``arms procurement czar'' at the Pentagon or an independent Navycontroller as a response to the July 3 downing of the Iraniancivilian airliner.   In a brief news conference after his speech, Meese said heapproved of President Reagan's choice of former Pennsylvania Gov.Richard L. Thornburgh as his successor.   ``I think he's an excellent choice,'' Meese said. ``He's a manI've known for a long time, he's a good friend and I think he and Ithink alike on almost every aspect of law enforcement.''</TEXT></DOC>
