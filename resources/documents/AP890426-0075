Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and John Warner, R-Va., commented a dayafter Cheney outlined planned reductions, delays and cuts totaling$10 billion before the House Armed Services Committee. The savingswere required to meet the fiscal 1990 budget level of $295.6billion for the Defense Department agreed upon by the White Houseand Congress.   ``I think Defense Secretary Cheney and President Bush stepped upto the plate and made some tough decisions here under very roughcircumstances,'' Nunn said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''   But, he said, he is ``very concerned'' about the decision toscrap the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey, a battlefield aircraftdesigned to take off like a helicopter but fly like an airplane.   ``That has very strong implications for future commercialaviation as well as for the military,'' Nunn said.   The Pentagon had hoped to spend $25.9 billion on 663 Ospreys,including $1.3 billion in 1990. Cheney called the decision to dropit his most difficult.   Warner, interviewed with Nunn, gave Cheney ``very high marks''and added, ``I think we're going to follow the Bush-Cheney planvery closely.''   However, Warner, a former secretary of the Navy, said he isconcerned about heavy cuts falling on that service.   ``I'm concerned about our deployments beyond the United States,where our young men in many instances and now women aboard shiphave to be gone for six and seven months, and the stress that putson families,'' he said.   If the strategic assessment Bush has promised to send Congressthe first week in May ``tells us we can cut back on some of thosedeployments abroad and the time, then I think the impact issomewhat less severe,'' Warner said.   Navy cuts outlined by Cheney included retiring the Coral Sea,one of the last two World War II-era aircraft carriers;transferring to the reserves 10 frigates; retiring sevendestroyers; canceling production of the F-14D fighter, andscrubbing the purchase of the last Los Angeles-class nuclear attacksubmarine.   Cheney also got a generally approving reaction from the HouseArmed Services Committee during his day-long presentation Tuesday.   ``Now there's much in what you presented that I don't like, someof which I disagree with, but I'm willing to buy it as a package,''Rep. Bill Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on thecommittee, told Cheney.   Among Cheney's proposals were a reduction for the Army, Navy andAir Force in active-duty strength of more than 2.1 million by16,800 men and women. The defense secretary left intact a proposed3.6 percent pay hike for those in the military.   Cheney, who has been on the job just 39 days, said the process``for the ultimate Republican hawk,'' was extremely difficult, buthe knew of no other way to cut the budget.   Among the big-ticket items facing major changes were:   _``Star Wars,'' the program pushed by Ronald Reagan to developlasers and other exotic weapons to shoot down enemy nuclearmissiles, will lose $1 billion from its proposal 1990 budget,giving it a new total of $4.6 billion.   _The B-2 stealth bomber will have its production pushed back ayear to 1993. Almost $4.1 billion is being cut from the fiscal 1990and 1991 budgets for the radar-evading plane. Recent estimates of$500 million per plane make it the most expensive in history.   _The National Aerospace Plane, a joint project with NASA, willbe scaled back drastically. The high-speed transport could flyaround the world in just hours. Cheney decided to cut the project'sfiscal 1990 budget by two-thirds, from $300 million to $100 million.   _The Midgetman nuclear missile, a single-warhead missile thatwould be small enough to be carried and fired from a trucklauncher, will be held to $100 million despite President Bush'sdecision to develop the missile in addition to a rail-based versionof the MX nuclear missile.   Spending for the MX in fiscal 1990 would total $1.2 billion,with another $2.2 billion earmarked for fiscal 1991.   Democrats and Republicans expressed their opposition to theelimination of the V-22 Osprey, arguing that the technologyassociated with the program makes it an aircraft whose time hascome.   Rep. Solomon P. Ortiz, D-Texas, said he ``wouldn't be surprisedif 10 years from now we were buying the technology from someoneelse,'' and Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., asked Cheney to provide thedocumentation he used in deciding to kill the Osprey.   ``You're going to hear much more about it,'' Weldon said. ``Thisprogram has strong support in the Congress.''   But Cheney stood by his decision, reminding House members thatBush and Congress agreed on the total defense budget and in lightof the program's lack of affordability, he had no other choice.   ``I urge you to work your wiles and come out with another $27billion,'' Cheney told the panel after at least five lawmakers hadcriticized the decision.   Earlier, Dickinson had cautioned the defense secretary againstweakening his stand.   ``If you don't hang tough and if you let them start opening thepackage and the whole thing comes unglued, we're going to continueto have the fights in the Congress with the admininstration acrossthe whole myriad of weapons systems and we really haven'taccomplished much,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
