Barrett   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>01/07/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B4B</SO><IN>LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)</IN><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- This city is experimenting with a radicalapproach to deterring the manufacture and sale ofmilitary-style semiautomatic guns.   The Washington city council passed, and former MayorMarion Barry last month signed, a statute that would holdmakers and dealers of certain so-called assault weaponsliable to compensate shooting victims who bring privatelawsuits against them.</LP><TEXT>   Proponents of the statute concede that it stretchesexisting principles of personal injury law. But they assertthat those who profit from lethal weapons ought to pay forthe harm they cause. These proponents, including some localpoliticians, don't disguise their goal of halting productionof assault weapons altogether.   Gun advocates, led by the National Rifle Association,argue that the statute is unfair to people who legallytraffic in guns and that it violates the constitutionalguarantee of &quot;due process.&quot; The statute &quot;would probably bestruck down by a court,&quot; asserts Richard Gardiner, an NRAofficial.   But the measure faces a more immediate threat than achallenge in court. Under the charter giving the District ofColumbia limited &quot;home rule,&quot; Congress retains the power tocancel any local statute within 30 legislative days of itspassage. Republicans on the House committee that oversees thedistrict already are planning to launch the nullificationprocess.   The gun-control statute &quot;definitely will be challenged,&quot;perhaps as early as this week, predicts a GOP committee staffmember. A resolution of nullification requires the approvalof the House, the Senate and the president. (If Congressdoesn't meet the 30-day deadline, it can pass a conventionalpiece of legislation to cancel a Washington statute.)   The Washington law applies to the nine types of assaultweapons that would have been restricted by a bill the Senatepassed last year. &quot;The Senate has spoken already . . . andthat is to our advantage,&quot; says Susan Whitmore, spokeswomanfor Handgun Control Inc. The Senate bill died in negotiationswith the House.   The district's statute states that assault weapons meetestablished requirements defining products for which amanufacturer can be held legally responsible, even when themanufacturer isn't negligent. These requirements, accordingto the city council, include that a product be &quot;abnormallyand unreasonably dangerous&quot; and that manufacturers canforesee &quot;that the criminal or accidental use of assaultweapons will cause injury and death.&quot;   Asked to defend the law, Joshua Horowitz, general counselto the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, suggests an analogy:Either by statute or court precedent, many states allowvictims in drunk-driving accidents to sue the bartender orhost who served the alcohol. That &quot;legal duty to anticipatedangers&quot; is &quot;well established,&quot; agrees Richard Daynard, a lawprofessor at Northeastern University who has helped lead theeffort to hold cigarette makers liable for harm to smokers.   Mr. Horowitz acknowledges that the Washington gun lawwould be the equivalent of holding alcohol manufacturers, notjust bartenders, legally responsible for the results of drunkdriving. &quot;We would go one step further&quot; than existing injurylaw principles, he says. &quot;That is the step we are takingbecause we can't deal with the problem any other way.&quot;   The NRA's Mr. Gardiner says &quot;the object of strictliability isn't to destroy manufacturers.&quot; In the case ofassault weapons, &quot;there is nothing wrong with the firearms .. . They are being used in crimes the manufacturers can'tprevent.&quot;   In the end, the legal debate will be eclipsed by thepolitical confrontation on Capitol Hill. The NRA and itscongressional allies will use their power to try to end thisgun-control experiment.</TEXT></DOC>
