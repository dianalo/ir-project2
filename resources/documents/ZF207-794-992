Sitting on the sidelines as usual,observing the action.andM;Now that the cat is out of the bag, both Adobe and Apple/Microsoft should puttheir political differences aside.andP;  Don't make it an either/or situation, butone in which the two formats can peacefully coexist without making users'current and future investments in PostScript or Royal incompatible with eachother.andP;  n</TEXT></DOC>
