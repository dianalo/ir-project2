The crimson poppy began infecting the area about two years ago,accompanied by high-powered guns and huge wads of cash. It hasspread like blood down guerrilla-infested slopes and through hiddenvalleys, stirring visions of another Colombia.   U.S. officials say one harvest of 16 metric tons _ and thefertile region can produce three or four harvests a year _ nowyields enough heroin to supply the needs of U.S. addicts for a year.   The fight to dethrone the opium poppy, from which heroin isderived, has become a top U.S. priority here, and worriedGuatemalan officials have agreed to aerial spraying despite thecontroversy over the threat to legitimate crops.   ``I've detected a real sense of panic in some people,'' a U.S.official said. ``In a small country like this, it wouldn't take thedopers long to take over.''   They almost have in the no-man's land where more than 4,000acres of opium poppies now flourish.   The U.S. spraying operation was halted in November after onlytwo months because the low-flying planes were taking so much groundfire.   The flights are resuming, but this time with air cover from apair of helicopter gunships supplied by the U.S. government andflown by U.S. pilots under contract, according to U.S. andGuatemalan officials.   ``These people live by the poppy. They aren't afraid to killanyone,'' said Lt. Col. Eduardo Santis, a Treasury Police spokesman.   In January, armed growers in the Cuilco Valley region killed sixmembers of a Treasury Police patrol.   The 2,100-man Treasury Police force is responsible for drugenforcement, but Santis said it is undermanned, poorly equipped andoutgunned.   U.S. officials say the military, which governed Guatemala until1986 when a shaky civilian government under President VinicioCerezo took over, is staying out of the opium war.   Officials say the only hope is to make the cost of doingbusiness too high for the traffickers.   The United States has doubled its budget for the drug war inGuatemala this year to $900,000. The spraying program is a key partof the battle.   Officials say each of the two planes can spray about 100 acres aday under ideal conditions. The poppy has a 90-day growing cycleand officials say only continuous spraying can discourage thegrowers.   Small-scale opium cultivation has always existed in the area,but officials blame the boom on an influx of Mexican traffickersand the persuasive power of hard cash in a primitive, isolated areabeyond the reach of central authority.   U.S. officials say they have detected some signs ofmoney-laundering but the drug trade does not appear to haveaffected the national economy yet.   U.S. officials also believe that a few of the traffickers haveemployed leftist rebels eager to raise cash for arms.   The Guatemalan National Revolutionary Movement, a Marxistcoalition of rebel bands believed to number fewer than 2,000,controls a small zone in northwestern Guatemala but has lost groundin recent years.   U.S. officials said some captured guerrillas have admittedworking with the traffickers, chiefly as providers of muscle forstrongarm tactics.   There is no stong evidence, however, any extensive involvementby the guerrillas in the opium trade.   The Mexican traffickers take the opium gum north to theirrefining laboratories in Mexico. They also arm the growers andteach them how to avoid detection.   Some growers have begun using raised earthern walls and rolls ofcanvas or plastic that can be unfurled to protect the brilliantopium blossoms from herbicides. Others are growing opium poppieswith in crops like corn.   Guatemala also has also been invaded from the east by marijuanagrowers driven from neighboring Belize and from the south by SouthAmerican cocaine traffickers who have begun to find usual Caribbeansmuggling routes too dangerous for them nowadays, officials say.   Officials estimate the amount of marijuana cultivation inGuatemala's Peten province has doubled in a year to about 1500acres.   As for cocaine, Guatemala, which is halfway between the SouthAmerican producers and North American consumers, is a ``goldenbridge,'' said Santis of the Treasury Police.   It is full of remote private airstrips and it lacks radarequipment to detect suspicious traffic. Santis said traffickers'planes can fly into Guatemala virtually undetected.   Radar is high on the list of things the Treasury Police needs tofight drug trafficking, but the list is long and basic: watercanteens, machetes, shoes, weapons to replace World War II-vintageM-1 carbines, and communications equipment.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, July 31</NOTE></DOC>
