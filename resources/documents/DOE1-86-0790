<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-86-0790 </DOCNO><TEXT>Native and foreign literature about sol-gel methods for inorganic sorbentsynthesis is reviewed, classification of these methods is given. Basicstages of sol-gel process: synthesis of aqueous sols of metal hydroxides,preparation of gel-spheres by the method of liquid forming and formationof porous sorbent structure, are considered. Methods for synthesis ofspherical sorbents on the basis of difficultly soluble titanium, zirconiumand tin salts ferrocianides are described. 70 refs.; 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
