The 4-month-old legislative session during the spring and summerreacted to Kremlin proposals, but this time a group of 345 reformdeputies spent Saturday discussing an alternative platform. Oneconcept they considered was the freedom for anyone to start anewspaper.   The Inter-Regional Group, which includes such figures as humanrights activist Andrei D. Sakharov and maverick Communist Boris N.Yeltsin, also proposes the open sale of paper, printing presses andcopy machines. Under the continuing system of censorship,distribution of these items is strictly limited.   Gavriil Popov, an economist, said the group plans to vote on itsplatform Sunday.   The legislature, or Supreme Soviet, has a formidable agenda. Itplans to act on 80 bills in 45 working days. Items include humanrights, ethnic strife and salvaging the economy.   ``All are very important,'' deputy Sergei S. Alekseyev told agovernment-sponsored news conference Friday. ``All should beadopted.''   But the Supreme Soviet, once a rubber-stamp body that met a fewdays a year to approve the Kremlin's actions, has changed underPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of restructuring andglasnost, or openess.   Alekseyev said there are no fewer than four versions of a newlaw on the press and glasnost. One calls for a complete ban oncensorship, state-run Radio Moscow reported Friday.   The draft platform of the Inter-Regional Group calls for theelimination of internal passports, freedom to move in and out ofthe country, access for defense lawyers to investigative reports,public financing of parliamentary factions, the creation ofnon-government television and unemployment insurance.   But even the Inter-Regional Group does not suggest ending theban on private ownership of land _ a vital concept of Sovietcommunism.   Legislators also will consider bills on the right to strike, onraising pensions, private cooperatives and taxation, said Rafik N.Nishanov, a legislative leader and one-time Communist Party leaderof Uzbekistan.</TEXT></DOC>
