She repeated her call for South Africa to free Nelson Mandela,the African National Congress leader who has been imprisoned sincethe early 1960s.   Also, however, Mrs. Thatcher emphasized her view that economicsanctions are not effective against apartheid, the policy withwhich South Africa's 5 million whites retain privilege and deny avoice in national affairs to the 28 million blacks.   President Robert Mugabe greeted her at the airport when shearrived from Lagos, Nigeria.   On the flight to Harare, the prime minister said she had toldSouth Africa she would meet with any ministers who happened to bein Europe, according to Press Association, Britian's domestic newsagency.   Mrs. Thatcher, whose visit to Africa began Monday in Morocco, isto be in Zimbabwe until Thursday, then go to Malawi and return toLondon on Saturday.   South Africa could learn from the negotiations that produced anindependent Zimbabwe, which as the British colony of Rhodesia wasonce ruled by a white minority, Mrs. Thatcher said at the airport.   ``There is a sea change in the region,'' she declared. ``Thereis an atmosphere about these problems now that they can be solvedby patient negotiation.''   Earlier, she told journalists: ``It is better to have aconstructive policy than one of hitting out with sanctions. I donot think it makes sense to isolate South Africa as she approachesthese very difficult decisions. The need for tact and persuasion isgreater than ever.''   The visit is Mrs. Thatcher's first to Zimbabwe, which hergovernment steered to independence nine years ago. She will conferwith Mugabe and President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique onWednesday in a border area called Nyanga.   Mrs. Thatcher was received warmly in Lagos, where she had beenthe target 14 months earlier of what appeared to be officiallysanctioned anti-apartheid demonstrations.   Gen.
