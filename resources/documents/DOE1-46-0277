The firstpart is devoted to the traditional top-down approach, and particularly,to an important subproblem thereof called the Channel Routing Problem(CRP). The complexity of CRP in three different layout modes - the reservedmode, the knock-knee mode, and the restricted-overlap mode - is studied.Besides the conventional square grid, two new grids - the alternate gridand the 45{sup 0} grid - are considered, and their respective versatilityis assessed. In the second part, a novel bottom-up technique for solvingthe layout problem is proposed. The strategy is to recursively interconnecta set of modules, in conformity with the design rules. The basic stepconsists of merging a pair of strongly-connected modules. This techniqueis elaborated on and the fundamental problems of this approach are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
