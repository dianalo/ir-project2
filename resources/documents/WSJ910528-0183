Butthe plan to ease export controls is leaving some Westernbusinesses unsatisfied.   The new export policy, to take effect by September, is thefruit of more than a year's negotiation among 17 Westernindustrial countries. It cuts by 50% the number of controlledexport items on the group's so-called Core List of civiliantechnologies with military uses. That follows a 33% cut lastJune.</LP><TEXT>   But U.S. telecommunications equipment makers sharplycriticized the decision to ease optical-fiber controls onlyslightly, a decision that stemmed from Persian Gulf Warexperience. That issue is to be re-examined in about a year.And U.S. computer makers worry that the new agreement couldgive European and Japanese makers an advantage.   The new export policy, agreed to Thursday, was announcedFriday by U.S. negotiator Allan Wendt, a senior StateDepartment official. The 17-nation group, known as Cocom --short for Coordinating Committee for Multilateral ExportControls -- includes all North Atlantic Treaty Organizationmembers except Iceland, plus Australia and Japan.   Member countries had complained that the outdated Cocomlist complicated controls, making violations easier. Theobjective, Mr. Wendt explained, is to build &quot;higher fencesaround fewer items.&quot;   Under the new list, for example, most civilian airliners,including Boeing Co. 747s and 767s and presumably includingmost Airbus Industrie planes, no longer will be controlled.Neither will most small computers or most lasers forsemiconductor manufacturing equipment and scientificinstruments. But optical fiber remains closely controlled, asdoes night vision and thermal imaging equipment, &quot;keyelements in our recent military success in Operation DesertStorm&quot; in Iraq, a U.S. statement said.   The war caused the U.S. to harden its position in severalareas where it had been expected to reduce controls, and thatis what is provoking the criticism. Mr. Wendt said SaddamHussein had an optical-fiber communications system that theU.S. found impossible to knock out, and the U.S. thereforeopposes passing that kind of technology to the Soviets.   U.S. officials said the main companies that will sufferare those that wanted to sell advanced communicationsequipment within the Soviet Union, and Mr. Wendt said theSoviets don't need that equipment. &quot;What the Soviet Unionneeds is simply telephones that work,&quot; he said, adding thatthe new rules won't prevent the sale of such basic equipment.   The new computer rules permit the sale of mostworkstations, minicomputers and personal computers. ControlData Corp.'s Cyber 960 and Digital Equipment Corp.'s VAX 8420now can be sold without export licenses, for example. So canmost 32-bit microprocessors.   But the new rules allow what they call &quot;nationaldiscretion,&quot; permitting individual governments to decidewhether to allow sales of certain advanced equipment.   One odd result of the new rules is that they will preventthe Soviets from buying an overland fiber-optic cable systemsuch as one proposed by U S West Corp., while possiblypermitting an undersea system.   Cable andamp; Wireless PLC of Britain and Simplex Wire andamp; CableCo. of the U.S. have proposed the undersea system, whichwould link the Soviet Union to Western Europe and Asia. Theundersea system apparently is less resistant to U.S.eavesdropping.</TEXT></DOC>
