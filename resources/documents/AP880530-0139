Air-Space America Inc., the non-profit group that organized thecombination exposition and trade show, bounced checks last weekmeant to pay companies for goods and services provided during the10-day show earlier this month at Brown Field. The group'spresident, Bill Walsh, acknowledged that a mistake had been madebut said the financial problems should be resolved soon.   Meanwhile, a chemical company that treated about 10 acres at thefield for the exposition filed suit last week, charging Air-SpaceAmerica with breach of contract. Evergreen Chemical Products isseeking $1 million, plus other damages and legal costs.   Air-Space America is contesting Evergreen's allegations that itfailed to meet the payment schedule.   Walsh told The Tribune of San Diego that checks ranging fromabout $700 to several thousand dollars have bounced in recent days.He said he can't specify the value or number of bounced checksbecause the organization's records weren't immediately available.   The organization wrote the checks knowing Air-Space Americaaccounts lacked the necessary funds, he said, but had hoped that anestimated $400,000 from ticket-selling outlets would arrive in timeto cover them.   ``Unfortunately, we didn't quite make it. ... We screwed up,''Walsh said.   He said the ticket agencies have been urged to hurry and sendthe money in.   Air-Space America has released no exact attendance figures.Promoters projected a total attendance of 500,000, but estimatesindicate that about 250,000 attended the exposition.</TEXT></DOC>
