The communist state in May dropped its demand that it andSouth Korea be represented by a joint U.N. seat. Seoul saidit would probably file its application early next month.   The U.N. Security Council is expected to approve bothapplications in a package without dissent, allowing theGeneral Assembly to vote on making the two states theorganization's 160th and 161st members when it convenes inSeptember.   Both Korean states, which have been bitterly divided andtechnically at war since the 1950-53 conflict, hold nonvotingobserver status at the U.N. They have expressed hope thatholding separate U.N. seats will improve their relations andpromote reunification.                                                                                                          BULGARIA TO TURN REACTORS OFF                                                                                                          Bulgaria agreed to shut two unsafe Soviet-built nuclearreactors in about six weeks, in return for Western promisesto help find alternative power sources. The Kozloduy plant onthe Danube River, similar to the Soviets' Chernobyl plantthat exploded in 1986, supplies 40% of Bulgaria's rationedelectricity. Two other reactors, closed for several months,will resume operating when safety standards reach Westernlevels. International nuclear inspectors have said the plant,124 miles north of Sofia, is dangerous.                                                                                                          SHANGHAI WOOS SINGAPORE CASH                                                                                                          Shanghai has set aside a 3.1-square-mile site forhigh-value and export-oriented manufacturing investments fromSingapore. Singapore's Economic Development Board isoverseeing the island state's interests in Pudong, aneconomic zone of about 186 square miles for industrial andcommercial development. Singapore companies have invested $80million in 30 projects in Shanghai.                                                                                                          POLES' PATH TO CAPITALISM                                                                                                          Entrepreneurs in Poland's booming used-car business havelearned they can increase profits by importing the cars inpieces to avoid high taxes. At a crossing on the border withGermany on two recent days, about one-fourth of the vehicleswere imported dismantled, then reassembled for sale. Autoparts, including those from dismantled used cars, are subjectto an import duty of 3.5% -- one-third to one-tenth that onassembled vehicles. Once largely limited to Eastern Europeanmodels, Poles can choose from a range of imported cars at newroadside markets.   PHILIPPINE DEAL BLOCKED                                                                                                          A Philippine court blocked a stock swap between San MiguelCorp. and United Coconut Planters Bank involving nearly 31%of the San Miguel shares outstanding. The ruling was thelatest development in a five-year struggle for control of thecountry's largest food and beverage conglomerate. SanMiguel's former chairman, Eduardo Cojuangco Jr., and thePhilippine Coconut Producers Federation each had challengedthe deal, arguing neither Cocobank nor San Miguel has theauthority to swap the San Miguel shares, technically owned bynearly one million Philippine coconut farmers.                                                                                                          SEA TURTLES IN INDONESIA                                                                                                          Indonesia, criticized for allowing the slaughter of marineturtles in its tropical waters, said it was committed toprotecting them. Six species, some protected by internationalaccords, live in Indonesian waters. Tourists spend millionsof dollars annually on turtle products such as shells andjewelry. &quot;We will farm protected and unprotected turtles,&quot;Jakarta's environment minister said. &quot;The protected turtleswill be left in the sea and unprotected ones will bedeveloped for consumption by the Balinese {for religiousceremonies and food} and for handicrafts.&quot;                                                                                                          JAPAN'S ROLE IN GLOBAL WARMING                                                                                                          Japan should do more to stop global warming by using itstechnology, capital and human resources, an Economic PlanningAgency advisory panel said, and made these recommendations:   Improvements in energy efficiency and a world-wideforestation program are needed to curb the so-calledgreenhouse effect, caused mainly by carbon dioxide emissions.Japan should transfer energy conservation techniques andenvironmental protection technology to developing nations. Ifthe 24 developed nations of the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development were as energy-efficient asJapan, their annual carbon dioxide emissions would drop about20% from the current 1.66 billion tons.   If former communist bloc countries and developing nationsimproved energy efficiency to Japanese levels, their annualcarbon dioxide emissions of 1.1 billion tons would be halvedin 20 years. This could cost $720 billion to $2.15 trillion.   If former rain forests were replanted at a rate of 22million acres a year, or 10 times faster than the currentpace, they would absorb 1.2 billion tons of carbon dioxideproduced annually. This program could cost $80 billion.
