The information minister, Col. Acedius St. Louis, confirmed overthe independent Radio Antilles that an unspecified number ofprisoners have been held since Sunday, when the military deposedManigat's 4-month-old civilian government and restored Lt. Gen.Henry Namphy to power.   St. Louis gave no names nor details but said the prisoners werebeing treated well.   He also said the private home of Roger Savain, Minister ofInformation under Manigat, was being guarded for protection againstvandalism. Another independent radio station, Radio Metropole,reported today the pillaging of the private home of LionelDesgranges, Manigat's chief of staff.   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, lateTuesday identified former Manigat aides under arrest as Savain, hisson Roger Savain Jr., Desgranges, and former Information Ministryofficials Rodney Marcellus and Jean Narces Lescouflair.   Opposition leaders, meanwhile, called on the army to set a datefor new, independently run elections.   ``It is now possible for the army to redeem itself,'' SylvioClaude, leader of the Haitian Christian Democratic Party, toldRadio Lumiere today. ``For the present, we neither condemn norcongratulate the army.''   Louis Dejoie II, another opposition leader, said Tuesday inPuerto Rico that he wanted to talk with Namphy about holdingelections. Claude, Dejoie, economist Marc Bazin and human rightsactivist Gerard Gourge were considered the leading candidates inthe Nov. 29 elections but boycotted the army-run voting on Jan. 17.   The deposed president, meanwhile, called Tuesday for theinternational isolation of Namphy's restored military government.But he virtually conceded he has joined the long list of Haiti'sex-leaders.   In Washington, the State Department said it would maintaindiplomatic relations with Haiti and keep up humanitarian aid.   A government communique Monday afternoon announced a reshufflingof the military, returning officers involved in the coup to theircommands and giving most promotions. Manigat had sided with Col.Jean-Claude Paul, commander of the Dessalines Battalion, last weekin an apparent rift with Namphy.   Manigat had rescinded Namphy's order transferring Paul, thenretired or transferred other officers and placed Namphy under housearrest. But after Namphy was freed by loyal troops Sunday night,Paul was at Namphy's side Monday when the military government wasannounced.   Paul wasn't mentioned in the government communique on the armypromotions, but he was back at his Dessalines command after thecoup as the 7,000-man military united behind Namphy. Paul'sbattalion was linked to violence that scuttled attempted electionslast Nov. 29, and he is under federal drug indictment in Miami.   Among the promotions was Gen. Carl Michel Nicolas to majorgeneral and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Namphy's formertitle. Col. Wilthan Lherisson was promoted to major general and asNicolas' assistant commander. Both had been retired by Manigat.   Col. Prosper Avril, reputed a leader of the effort to freeNamphy and put him in power, was promoted to brigadier general andadjutant general of the armed forces. Brig. Gen. William Regala,Manigat's Defense Minister, was returned to active militaryservice. He also served in the military-civilian junta headed byNamphy before Manigat's election.   Port-au-Prince Police Chief Gregoire Figaro, removed by Manigat,was returned to his post, named military commander for thePort-au-Prince region, and promoted from colonel to brigadiergeneral.   Manigat told reporters Tuesday in the Dominican Republic, towhich he was expelled after the coup, that he would not ``fall intothe classic trap of deposed political men who see the return topower from one moment to the other and pass all their time waitingfor that imminent return.   ``I don't have any bitterness, nor personal rancor. I am sad formy country, for my people and for Haitian democracy,'' the57-year-old former university professor added.   There were no signs of protest Tuesday in the 184-year-oldrepublic, the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation, which has knowndozens of leaders, some of whom lasted only days.   The new government's Cabinet ministers were unceremoniouslyinstalled.   The United States has withheld about $60 million innon-humanitarian aid from Haiti since independently run electionslast Nov. 29 were thwarted by attacks on voters that killed morethan 30 people.   Namphy led a military-civilian junta that ran the country afterPresident Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Feb. 7, 1986, ending the29-year dictatorship founded by his father, Francois ``Papa Doc''Duvalier.</TEXT></DOC>
