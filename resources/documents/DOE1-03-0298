<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-03-0298 </DOCNO><TEXT>US Nuclear Regulatory Commission Guide 1.45 recommends the use of at leastthree different detection methods in reactors to detect leakage. Monitoringof both sump-flow and airborne particulate radioactivity is mandatory.A third method can involve either monitoring of condensate flow ratefrom air coolers or monitoring of airborne gaseous radioactivity. Althoughthe methods currently used for leak detection reflect the state of theart, other techniques may be developed and used. Since the recommendationsof Regulatory Guide 1.45 are not mandatory, Licensee Event Report Compilationshave been reviewed to help establish actual capabilities for leak detection.The review of reports which had previously covered the period June 1985to August 1986, has been extended. The total number of events of significanceis now 83. These reports have provided documented, sometimes detailedsummaries of reactor leaks.</TEXT></DOC>
