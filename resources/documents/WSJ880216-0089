Not us, executives aver.    Black Monday's stock-market collapse and subsequent worries about a recession haven't produced any changes in work attitudes, a spot check of managers suggests. &quot;Executives have to look further into the future or they won't be executives very long,&quot; insists Phillip Vitali, a senior vice president of MGI Properties.    But some executive recruiters have a different view. Jeffrey Christian of Christian andamp; Timbers sees &quot;paranoia&quot; in management suites. &quot;People are afraid for their jobs and working harder,&quot; he says. Joni Lampl of Management Recruiters of Pittsburgh/ North Inc. says concerned managers now &quot;are more open to change.&quot; And companies, she adds, &quot;are showing a more human side,&quot; offering more pats on the back to calm nervous employees.    One manager notes a change: Non-financial executives now know how the market affects the bottom line.    SENIORITY, not performance, seems to determine pay, at least in baseball.    At a time when many companies pushing to link pay with performance find it tough to come up with objective measures of a job well done, a look at baseball suggests that corporations needn't bother pondering ways to assess a worker's worth. The major leagues have statistics aplenty to establish a player's merit. Yet an analysis by a Harvard doctoral candidate in economics concludes that a player's salary is based more on seniority than how well he performs.    Baseball's &quot;labor market is characterized by explicit and implicit contracts in which regulars with seniority receive payoffs,&quot; says Asher Blass, who's writing his dissertation on baseball economics. Only when management and player can't agree on terms, and an arbitrator is called in to rule on salaries, does performance become more important than tenure, he says.    LAME-DUCK CEOs can hobble firms, not just the White House, experts say.    While changes in corporate command often proceed smoothly, the expected departure of a boss can cause considerable stress in an executive suite, says Anthony Miles of Boston Consulting Group. Managers who aren't sure who's taking over, or are uncertain about policy, erect a lot of &quot;posterior armor plating,&quot; he says. The turnover can be especially jolting when the old boss pushes through changes that the new CEO isn't expected to want; &quot;people beneath feel manipulated and scared,&quot; he says.    Jewell Westerman of Temple, Barker andamp; Sloane, another consultant, says a change in CEOs can be most disruptive when an outsider is called in to run a troubled company. Some old hands &quot;don't know what to do,&quot; he says. Others, eager to impress the newcomer, will &quot;hear what they want to hear&quot; and plunge ahead down paths that the new boss really doesn't want to tread.    Companies can take up to two years to adjust to a chief executive from outside, Mr. Westerman says.    UNIONIZATION IS DOWN in the private sector because companies are fighting harder against organizing drives, concludes Richard Freeman in a National Bureau of Economic Research report. &quot;About half of the decline can be accounted for by increases in management opposition, as indicated by a quadrupling of unfair-labor-practice charges&quot; against management since 1960, he declares.    HEALTH-CARE COSTS climbed 7.9% last year, to a record average of $1,985 per employee, consultant A. Foster Higgins andamp; Co. says. The year-before increase at private and governmental employers was 7.7%. Bigger companies paid out more and had a bigger increase than smaller concerns.    JOBS AREN'T where you think, says David Birch of consultant Cognetics Inc. Companies with fewer than 20 workers created a net 2.5 million jobs from 1981 to 1985. Firms with 100 to 499 employees lost 569,600 workers. Those with more than 5,000 added only 137,700.    CORPORATE-OWNED life insurance, sometimes used to fund retiree health benefits, loses some allure because of a new accounting standard, consultant Towers Perrin says. Under FAS 96, companies now will have to set aside reserves for taxes due if the policies are terminated.    POINTING WORKERS to a common goal is what managers have most to learn.    It's &quot;easier said than done&quot; to &quot;get everyone moving in the same direction,&quot; says Morrie Abramson, chairman of Kent Electronics Corp. E. Linn Draper, chairman of Gulf States Utilities Co., concurs. &quot;Even when managers agree on the big picture, it requires constant communication to implement policies,&quot; he says.    Charles Shipley, a vice president of SL Industries, sounds a similar theme. Executives, he says, have to learn more about &quot;motivating our workers and guiding them; this is an area where the Japanese have had excellence for many years and where we are lacking.&quot; William Tremayne, a senior vice president of Prudential Insurance Co., suggests the need to get the message across should also propel executives into the political process.    &quot;It's not enough for us to know we are right, we have to convince everybody else,&quot; he contends.    THE CHECKOFF: Youngstown State University offers an undergraduate major in mall management. . . . Some Aandamp;P food stores in the worker-tight Northeast try offering $50 in free groceries to shoppers who coax their children to work for the chain. </TEXT></DOC>
