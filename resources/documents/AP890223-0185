Laroche died Feb. 17 at age 67 after a 2{-year bout with cancer.He personally designated Tarlazzi as his successor. Alreadywell-known in the fashion world, Tarlazzi heads his own Paris designfirm.   ``This is the first time a couturier chose a designer to carry onhis work before he died,'' said Philippe Serre, president of theTarlazzi company. He noted that the contract was drawn up inDecember according to Laroche's wishes.   Tarlazzi, 45, was in Italy when the appointment was announced andwas not available for comment.   Tarlazzi will continue to design his own ready-to-wear andmenswear under his own name. With exclusive shops in Paris, NewYork, Tokyo and Osaka, his company does $40 million in businessannually, according to Serre.   Tarlazzi is planning to launch a less expensive line, TarlazziII, to be distributed by Laroche.   The Italian started his career at the house of Carosa in Romewhen he was l9 and later worked for the house of Patou and otherfashion houses before launching his own luxury ready-to-wear line in1977.   Tarlazzi became known for chic knitwear as well as sexy, femininecocktail clothes.   Tarlazzi's style is not expected to veer into the eccentric atLaroche, which is known for classic sophistication rather than zanyinnovation.   Laroche always chose the practical path of elegance overexperimental designs. His couture and luxury ready-to-wear aretremendously popular, helping to make the fashion house one of themost financially successful in Paris.   ``But don't expect any imitation of Guy Laroche clothes fromTarlazzi,'' said Serre. ``He will leave his own imprint on thecollections.''   Tarlazzi's own luxury ready-to-wear collection for next winter isslated to be unveiled on March 17 during the ready-to-wear showingsfor next winter.   The Laroche ready-to-wear, to be shown March 21, is beingdesigned by Guy Douvier, who will stay on as ready-to-wear designer,a job he has filled for the past 15 years.</TEXT></DOC>
