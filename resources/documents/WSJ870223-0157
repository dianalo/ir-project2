The proposal calls for Norstar Bancorp., an Albany, N.Y.-based bank holding company, to establish a new state-chartered, stock-owned savings bank that would purchase the assets and assume the name and deposits of Syracuse Savings Bank, Syracuse, N.Y.    Meanwhile, two banks in the South and Southwest were closed, bringing the number of bank failures this year to 30. One of the institutions, Hub City Bank andamp; Trust Co., Lafayette, La., is to reopen today as part of another institution. The FDIC today is to begin paying off the insured deposits of the other, First National Bank of Weslaco, Texas, because the agency didn't receive any bids for its purchase.    Under the Syracuse Savings Bank plan, Norstar would invest $100 million in the new Syracuse Savings and would own all of the institution's stock. Norstar would have to operate the new institution as a savings bank for at least 18 months.    The FDIC's aid would be limited to indemnification against certain of Syracuse Savings' contingent liabilities and would involve no cash. The agency generally limits its assistance to the purchaser of a failed bank but will approve transactions involving institutions that haven't closed if officials believe it would be less costly.    The FDIC acted after New York state banking authorities informed the agency that Syracuse Savings was in danger of failing. Syracuse Savings has assets totaling $1.2 billion and holds $1.1 billion in 258,000 deposit accounts.    The assistance plan is subject to the final approval of the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and New York banking authorities. Norstar has $11.1 billion in assets, and operates banks throughout New York state and in Maine.    First National of Weslaco, closed by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, had assets totaling $69.5 million and held deposits of $69.2 million in 13,000 accounts. The deposits included a total of $366,000 among 19 accounts that each exceeded the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor.    Holders of those funds will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the sale of the failed bank's assets. First National was the eighth Texas bank to fail this year.    The four offices of Hub City, closed by state banking authorities, are to reopen as branches of Hibernia National Bank, New Orleans. Hub City had assets of $36.4 million and held $37.5 million in 8,400 deposit accounts. It was the first bank to fail in Louisiana this year. </TEXT></DOC>
