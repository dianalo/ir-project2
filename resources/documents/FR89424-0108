Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization includedstatements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changeand discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. Thetext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in ItemIV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, setforth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspectsof such statements.A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statements of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis for the Proposed Rule ChangeCurrently the language in supplementary material .01 to Rule 515 providesthat an equity specialist unit that ranks in the bottom 15% of the ratingsover certain periods of time ``will be deemed to have performed below minimumstandards.'' This same specialist unit, however, would not automaticallybe subject to a reallocation proceeding. Rather, the supplementary materialto the rule provides that, under these circumstances, the Committee ``mayinstitute proceedings to determine whether to remove and reallocate oneor more securities.'' The Exchange in reviewing this rule, determined tocorrect this apparent inconsistency. The Exchange believes that a specialistunit's performance should not automatically be labelled below minimum standardsbased only on the fact that the unit received a ranking in the bottom 15%during a specific time period. In this regard, the Exchange notes thatits procedures do not automatically treat such ranking as establishingthat a unit's performance is deficient. Instead, as noted above, the ruleprovides that such a ranking ``may'' trigger a reallocation proceeding.To make the language of the rule better reflect the actual procedure, thisamendment has been proposed.The proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Actin that it will promote just and equitable principles of trade.B. Self-Regulatory Organizations Statement on Burden on CompetitionThe Phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose anyburden on competition.C.
