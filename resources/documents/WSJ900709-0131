Secretary of State James Baker reiterated over the weekendthat economic aid would be wasted unless certain conditions-- such as a full commitment to free-market principles -- arein place.</LP><TEXT>   Furthermore, in meetings before this week's economicsummit in Houston, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu toldPresident Bush that Japan will oppose any aid until itresolves a dispute with the Soviet Union over ownership offour islands in the Kuril chain.   At the end of their summit here last Friday, Mr. Bush andother leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationendorsed a package of historic changes in the alliance'smilitary structure. They agreed, among other things, to usenuclear arms only as a &quot;last resort,&quot; to soon withdrawAmerican nuclear-tipped artillery shells from Europe and toshrink the army in a newly united Germany.   Those steps are designed to make NATO look lessthreatening so that the Soviets will accept a united Germanyinside the Western alliance. They are intended also to allowMr. Gorbachev to tell his domestic critics that the West isresponding to his reform program.   &quot;I would think he could say, `We've been right to reachout as we have tried to do to the United States and indeed toimprove relations with countries in Western Europe,'&quot; Mr.Bush told reporters after the NATO meeting.   But Mr. Bush reiterated that the helping hand he isoffering Mr. Gorbachev won't hold any direct U.S. economicaid, setting up a debate between the president and otherleaders of the seven industrialized countries who gather thisweek in Houston for an economic summit.   West Germany, in particular, is prepared to make animpassioned argument that the West should give Mr. Gorbachevimmediate and direct economic help to ensure his politicalsurvival.   Mr. Bush said at the close of the NATO session that if theGermans want to go ahead with aid, &quot;that's their business.&quot;   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bushhad received a letter from Mr. Gorbachev, dated July 4, thatoutlines steps Mr. Gorbachev has taken in the Soviet Unionand &quot;asks the summit countries to consider providingtechnical assistance and credits&quot; to help his reform efforts.   In his comments Friday Mr. Bush hinted that there could bea crack in the door for aid to the Soviets. &quot;Perhaps thereare ways that we can assist them as we go forward,&quot; he said,&quot;with credit or other matters, before we go to directgovernment loans.&quot;   Secretary Baker, appearing on ABC News' &quot;This Week&quot;program yesterday, said that credits are &quot;not right now inthe cards.&quot; But officials said the administration isconsidering trying to dismantle longstanding legal barriersto direct U.S. bank loans for the Soviet Union.   But Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said on thesame television program, &quot;We will provide credits . . . . Wewant to send out a signal that this leadership in the SovietUnion is valid and valuable.&quot;   The remarks were later clarified by Derek Burney, who isCanada's ambassador to the U.S. and Mr. Mulroney's specialassistant for the summit. He said the prime minister wasreferring to two existing Canadian programs for the SovietUnion -- one by the Canadian Wheat Board and the other byCanada's Export-Import Bank. The Soviets aren't making fulluse of either program, indicating that Canada could extendcredits to the Soviet Union without any new measures.   The U.S. and its NATO allies did succeed in settlingdisagreements over how to begin revamping the militaryalliance. They agreed to thin out its forces on thealliance's front line and begin putting them under newmultinational commands.   In addition, the U.S. worked out an agreement declaringthat nuclear arms are weapons of &quot;last resort&quot; but endorsedin the summit's final communique a statement that nucleararms will continue to &quot;fulfill an essential role in theoverall strategy of the alliance.&quot; Britain and France wantedsuch a statement to make clear that the alliance wasn'tsuggesting that nuclear weapons could be discarded.   The allies also agreed on pulling nuclear-tipped artilleryshells out of Europe. The U.S. originally had proposed takingout the shells -- whose short range makes them nearly uselessas East European countries leave the Soviet military orbit --only when the last Soviet soldier is withdrawn from Europe.West Germany wanted to move more quickly.   So NATO agreed that the weapons will be taken out as soonas talks begin next year on a treaty cutting short-rangenuclear arms in Europe and the Soviets take the &quot;reciprocalaction&quot; of withdrawing their own nuclear artillery.   The U.S. and West Germany agreed to make a general pledgeto shrink the army in the united Germany when aconventional-arms agreement with the Soviets is signed latethis year, while putting off a formal agreement on the army'ssize until a follow-on conventional-arms deal with theSoviets.   The allies, as expected, also agreed to invite Mr.Gorbachev to address a future NATO meeting and to invitecountries of the Warsaw Pact to establish a &quot;diplomaticliaison&quot; with NATO.   ---   Michel McQueen in Houston contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
