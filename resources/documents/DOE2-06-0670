However, their spectra suggest the possibilities of complexcombinations of (a) essentially static fractions of facial and meridionalhigh spin Fe(II) isomers; (b) only one structural isomer (facial or meridional)but a static fraction of orbital singlet (/sup 5/A or /sup 5/B) groundstate high spin form along with a single /sup 5/E high spin fractionthat in turn undergoes a reversible transformation of two high spin /sup5/E ground term forms on decreasing the temperature below {approx_equal}250 K. The latter behavior is probably the consequence of order-disorderinvolving the counter-anion. Depending on the nature of the solvent andspecific type of the counter-anion, the 3-CH/sub 3//sup -/ derivativesexhibit varying degrees of resolution of: multiple high spin forms atambient temperature and conversion to the low spin /sup 1/A ground state.For the 2- and 3-CH/sub 3//sup -/ substituted ligands there is the possibilityof N-1 as well as N-4 triazole coordination, to further complicate matters.(orig./BHO).</TEXT></DOC>
