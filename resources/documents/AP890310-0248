Then picture it piled500 feet high.   That's 22.5 million cubic feet of low-level nuclear waste, all ofit generated since 1980 when Congress essentially got out of theradioactive rubbish business and told the states: You make it, youtake it.   ``Waste is something that's undesirable or else they would callit gold. It's an intruder,'' said Marvin Resnikoff of theRadioactive Waste Campaign, which opposes the new sites. ``Peopledon't want waste in their backyard.''   Low-level waste is everything that isn't spent fuel or theleftovers from the making of nuclear bombs.   About 90 percent of the volume and 97 percent of theradioactivity comes from power plants and industrial sources. Otherstuff comes from research labs, hospitals and medical centers thatuse radiation as treatment.   Most of the slop becomes innocuous in a short time, but iodine129 has a half-life of 16 million years, and technetium 99 will losehalf its potency in 212,000 years. Other potent elements includecesium 137, strontium 90, cobalt 60 and carbon 14.   The key date in the new national policy is Jan. 1, 1993, whenstates must take title to their own garbage and the only threecommercial repositories will close their gates to states outsidetheir regions.   Congress encouraged states to save money and headaches by bandingtogether in regional compacts. To date, nine compacts including 41states have been formed. Five states are going it alone and the restremain unaligned.   Experts say 14 new sites are more than are necessary. The cost ofbuilding and operating 14 sites for 30 years would be $2.2 billionto $5.4 billion, according to a U.S. Department of Energy report tothe Congress last year.   Three or four sites could do the same job, according to theElectric Power Research Institute.   ``It's three times more than enough,'' said Ed Helminski,publisher of the Radioactive Exchange, a Washington, D.C.,periodical that focuses on nuclear issues.   ``It's politics. Nobody wants nuclear waste,'' said U.S. Rep.Butler Derrick, D-S.C., who co-authored the low-level waste laws.``It's a matter of the states not wanting to act and wanting to dumpon someone else.''   Congress got involved in 1980 after the governors of SouthCarolina, Nevada and Washington said they would close sites in theirstates. Concerned about poorly packed containers and truckingaccidents, they balked at being the nation's dumping ground.   Three other sites closed by 1978 and have since leaked radiation.They are at Maxey Flats, Ky., Sheffield, Ill., and West Valley,N.Y., which environmentalists called ``kick and roll'' dumps becausedrums were kicked off a truck, rolled into a ditch and covered withdirt.   In the past, all wastes were buried. But because of leaks, 11 ofthe 14 new repositories will limit or ban burial. They will shieldwastes in concrete burial vaults or above ground clusters that willbe mounded with layers of dirt.   ``There were some problems with past practice,'' said SteveRomano of US Ecology, Inc., which buried wastes in Illinois andKentucky. ``Cardboard boxes and crates were thrown haphazardly intoa trench. Let's move on from that and prevent it from happeningagain.''   Annual waste generation hit a peak of 3.77 million cubic feet in1980, fell to 2.7 million cubic feet in 1985 and dipped to 1.43million cubic feet last year, according to the U.S. Department ofEnergy.   ``It has to go somewhere. We can't drown in our own waste,'' saidDouglas Eldridge, general counsel of the New York Low-LevelRadioactive Waste Disposal Facility Siting Commission.   Not counting transportation, states pay about $50 per cubic footof waste. The compact price will rise to $100-$300 per cubic foot,according to Brian Farrell, program manager on low-level wastes forthe Edison Electric Institute.   Some fear high costs could encourage illegal dumping.   ``It's desirable to keep generating costs low enough to providesignificant incentive against midnight dumping,'' said Malcolm Knappof the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   Even if the high-tech graveyards improve safety, danger won't bealtogether eliminated, according to the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, which projects an additional 4.4 fatal cancersover 10,000 years for each low-level waste site of 250,000 cubicmeters. There are 500,000 annual cancer deaths from normal causes.   To keep exposures low, sites limit the amount of the hottestmaterial they take in.   A fence to keep out intruders for 100 years is required at eachsite, and the most-contaminated wastes must either be buried deeperor shielded with concrete for 500 years. By then, the radioactivityshould pose no health risk, although no one is sure if concrete willkeep its integrity that long.   ``There are parts that can kill you if you're exposed to them,''said Diane D'Arrigo of Nuclear Information and Resource Service.``If we're going to produce waste, we should be responsible tofuture generations who are going to suffer the consequences.''   Opponents of nuclear dumps are so upset they've brought bucketsof tar and feathers to town meetings and created uproars.   ``Michigan is like a sponge sitting in a bathtub. We'resurrounded by 95 percent of the fresh surface water supply in thecountry,'' said Ellen Beal of Don't Waste Michigan. ``Who wouldthink of something so stupid as to put a nuclear dump here?''   Jeff Dewan, a guitarist and carpenter in Hays, Kan., wrote``Talkin' Rad Waste Blues'' that's a hit song among nuclear foes inKansas and Nebraska. Some lyrics:   ``I said, say, mister, where you from?   ``You must think I'm pretty dumb.   ``That stuff you're peddlin's nuclear trash.   ``And we don't want your cold, hard cash.''   To make a repository more acceptable, Nebraska and Illinois willoffer $1 million a year to the town that takes it. Pennsylvania alsoplans payments so the host town can attract other industries, whichcritics say amounts to a bribe.   ``It's not a bribe,'' said James Neal of US Ecology, the companyhired to select a site in Nebraska. ``It's an incentive like a taxbreak, free land or free services.''   The state making the most headway is California, where arepository may be open in 1991 in the Mojave Desert.   The area gets 6 inches of rain a year and the groundwater is 700feet below the surface. It's so dry, tracks remain from Gen. GeorgePatton's armor drilling for World War II battles.   Fences are needed to keep out the desert tortoise, but for themost part, the repository is accepted because it will bring 15 to 20jobs.   ``It's going to be worth several million dollars worth of goods,services and wages,'' said Larry DeAtley, former president of theChamber of Commerce in Needles, 23 miles from the site. ``It's not asmokestack. It's not coal dust. It's a safe, non-polluting industrythat will pay good wages and be an asset to our community.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday PMs, March 20</NOTE></DOC>
