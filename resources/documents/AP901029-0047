Instead, the medical team could be useful in helping refugees inthe region, according to a recent assessment given to thegovernment by a 17-member advance team sent to the gulf region inmid-September.   ``U.S.-led forces have their own medical services and will treattheir own soldiers,'' Dr. Shigemi Teramoto, head of the team, saidin an interview.   Teramoto said the Japanese team, originally set to be expandedto 100 members, will be stationed 210 miles from the Kuwaiti borderand consult with the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health on how it canserve.   Sending a medical corps to assist the multinational forcesarrayed against Iraq in the region is part of thegovernment-sponsored U.N. Peace Cooperation bill now being debatedin Parliament.   The bill, which calls for the deployment of Self-Defense Forcesabroad, has encountered widespread opposition because of Japan'sconstitutional ban on using force overseas. Its passage is indoubt, lawmakers have said.   A member of the advance medical team said U.S. and Saudihospitals were so well staffed and equipped that Japan'scontribution ``might just result in confusing the alreadyestablished medical system of the forces,'' the newspaper AsahiShimbun reported.</TEXT></DOC>
