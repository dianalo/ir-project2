Southmark and one of its units own about 62.5% of National Heritage, and the executives of the two companies are locked in a battle over who will control the health-care management concern. Southmark has asked National Heritage for a majority of the seats on National Heritage's board, but the health-care concern has refused and said it will &quot;pursue all available means&quot; to keep control of the company from changing.    Southmark said that through a majority of shareholder consents, it changed National Heritage's bylaws to force the company to seek shareholder approval for its planned spinoff of a National Heritage unit that holds about 77% of National Heritage's assets. National Heritage had said the restructuring didn't require holder approval.    Southmark also amended bylaws to keep National Heritage from further diluting its stake. A few weeks ago, National Heritage issued about 800,000 stock options to about three dozen employees and provided loans to allow the options to be exercised. The move reduced Southmark's total stake to about 62.5% from 66%.    National Heritage couldn't be reached to comment on Southmark's move. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, National Heritage fell 12.5 cents to $3.    Separately both companies said that a state judge in Dallas dissolved a temporary restraining order prohibiting a Southmark unit from moving to replace National Heritage's board. Southmark is expected to try to eliminate National Heritage's staggered board and nominate a slate of directors for National Heritage's annual meeting, scheduled for Aug. 31. </TEXT></DOC>
