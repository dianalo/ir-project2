Panamanian Defense Force chief Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, stung by recent street protests demanding his ouster, has failed in an attempt to stir up &quot;anti-Yankee&quot; sentiments in Panama. For years it's been suggested that Gen. Noriega ran the country the way Lee J. Cobb ran the longshoremen's union in &quot;On the Waterfront.&quot; But after the Panamanian army's second-in-command repeated accusations against Gen. Noriega -- including drug smuggling, the rigging of elections and the murder of political opponents -- Panamanians of all political leanings have started calling for his removal.    Gen. Noriega countered that the protests were inspired by Yankee imperialists who wanted to rescind the Panama Canal treaty. He directed goon squads to trash the U.S. Embassy and other U.S. installations while Panama's police force stood by passively. The general's tactics backfired. Anti-Noriega protests continue and Panamanians have displayed an unprecedented show of support for the U.S. Even normally left-wing student groups are voluntarily cleaning up damaged U.S. offices.    Times have changed since Gen. Noriega's predecessor, the late Omar Torrijos, capitalized on anti-Yankee resentment to pull off his 1968 military coup. After the 1977 Canal treaty, Panamanians realized that if the Yankees were willing to give up their canal, the military's mandate for power was thin indeed. It also was incongruous with a rapidly developing nation.    Unlike most Latin countries, Panama is an active, healthy participant in the world financial-services market. This is one of the few positive legacies of dictator Torrijos: He kept the U.S. dollar as the national currency and loosened banking controls. As most Third World nations struggle to keep up with traditional exports, Panama's service-led economy has produced one of the most sophisticated business sectors in Latin America. Panama's business sector is ready to head into the 21st century, making the country's 19th century Latin political structure all the more anomalous.    The titular president, Eric Arturo Delvalle, is a generally well-liked businessman, but Panamanians see him as a puppet of Gen. Noriega. The man President Delvalle replaced, Nicolas Arditas Barletta, now has admitted that he was forced out of office by Gen. Noriega for requesting an investigation into the murder of one of the general's vocal opponents. This puts President Delvalle in a rather pivotal position, despite his apparent lack of power. If he were to stand up to Gen. Noriega as his predecesssor did, and if he also were fired, any legitimacy that the current regime now holds would crumble.    The opposition also has changed significantly in the past few months. Last year businessmen and academics were timid about voicing any objection to Gen. Noriega. Now they protest openly. Last Friday's Americas column featured an article by Panamanian businessman Eduardo Vallarino, who took a large risk to describe the depth of the opposition to Gen. Noriega and the way he has run Panama. Today Mr. Vallarino is in hiding, apparently avoiding a police roundup of opposition leaders.    The dynamism of Panamanian society is making Gen. Noriega and his rhetoric obsolete. The desire for democratic freedom and economic freedom is leading the way across Latin America and even its Noriegas will have to give way. </TEXT></DOC>
