The Dell System 400 and System 500 are expected to be availablefor sale in the final three months of 1988 and should cost about 30percent less than comparable IBM models, Michael Dell, thecompany's 23-year-old founder and chief executive, announced Monday.   Dell said it expects to complete a patent licensing agreementwith IBM ``in the very near future.''   IBM spokesman John Mihalec said the company could not confirmtalks with particular companies, but reaffirmed that the company iswilling to provide licenses on its patents under reasonable termsand conditions.   However, Mihalec said a patent license does not protect acompany if it happens to infringe on features of the PersonalSystem-2 and its Micro Channel Architecture that are protected inother ways, such as by copyrights.   IBM's Micro Channel Architecture has been touted by IBM as a wayto improve the performance of personal computers when they arelinked together in networks. It also allows the machine to performmore than one major task at a time.   But industry analysts say the new Personal System-2 computersstill lack the software and additional features to take fulladvantage of the new design. They say machines with conventionaldesigns offer higher performance for less cost.   Dell reported sales of $159 million and earnings of $9.4 millionfor its last fiscal year ended Jan. 31. It has grown to thecountry's seventh largest maker of personal computers since beingfounded in 1984 with a $1,000 investment.</TEXT></DOC>
