He would say no more and members of the Israelidelegation declined comment.   Among the Israelis were Labor Party legislator Chaim Ramon; ChaimTzadok, a former Labor justice minister; legislator Yair Tzaban ofthe socialist party Mapam, and Mapam's general secretary, ElazarGranot.   Government policy prohibits contacts with the PalestineLiberation Organization, but leftist legislators want that changedon grounds the PLO is Israel's inevitable partner in peacenegotiations. The government considers the PLO a terroristorganization.   Husseini, who has spent 18 of the past 22 months in Israeliprisons under ``administrative detention'' without trial, hasexpressed willingness to meet with Israelis of all politicalviewpoints.   ``I would like to spend more and more time ... talking withdifferent groups of Israelis, not only groups that support my aimsbut those who are not supporting our aims,'' he said in an interviewearlier Tuesday.   Asked about talking with Israeli leaders, Husseini said: ``Ifit's the right place, the right timing, the right person, I will notsay no. If it's the wrong time, the wrong place, the wrong person, Iwill say no.''   While in prison, Husseini met with Shmuel Goren, coordinator ofIsraeli policy in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, whichIsrael captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.Goren arranged the meeting.   Soldiers shot and wounded four Palestinians in the occupied landsTuesday, ranging in age from 9 to 16, Arab hospital officialsreported. An army official confirmed a 9-year-old was wounded in theWest Bank city of Nablus.   At least 380 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed sincethe uprising began, and more than 7,000 Palestinians have beenwounded.   Merchants closed their shops in Bethlehem, a Christian town inthe West Bank, to protest raids by Israeli tax authorities, an Arabreporter said. Tax boycotts have been a regular feature of theuprising.   In the Golan Heights, captured from Syrian in 1967, Druse Arabsheld a general strike to protest Israeli annexation of the areaseven years ago. Hundreds of extra riot police were deployed toprevent violence.   ``The Druse don't accept it (the annexation) because this isSyrian territory,'' a villager identified as Arab Zafadi said onIsraeli army radio.   About 150 Syrians, some shouting anti-Israeli slogans throughloudspeakers, approached the border to support the Druse, Israelradio said.   Israel extended its law to the Golan Heights on Dec. 14, 1981.The Druse began a campaign against it two months later but have notheld regular protests in solidarity with the Palestinian uprising.The Druse sect is an offshoot of Islam.</TEXT></DOC>
