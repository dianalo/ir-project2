(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The ballot is so bewildering inCalifornia this year that some officials have borrowed an idea fromthe supermarket for the Nov. 8 election _ express lanes for thosewho know how they are going to vote.   Even by California standards this year's ballot is crowded,complex and confusing.   There are 29 statewide propositions, and some communities haveadded dozens of measures and campaigns. And of course, voters alsomust contend with the presidential election, a senatorial contestand congressional races.   In San Francisco, which this year has the longest ballot inCalifornia and possibly the nation, the registrar of voters threw upher hands and quit three weeks before Election Day, warning of``electoral gridlock'' at the polls.   In Sacramento, 41-year-old computer technician Jim Stoeckel sayshe feels guilty that he's shirking his duties as a voter becausehe's spent only two hours so far ``skimming'' his 160-pageCalifornia voter's ballot pamphlet.   But Stoeckel is lucky he's a voter in Sacramento, where there areonly eight local propositions on the ballot in addition to thenear-record statewide propositions.   If he lived in San Francisco, he'd have a second, 192-pageofficial voter's pamphlet with arguments and analyses on 24 localpropositions, plus a regional advisory proposition on bridge tollsto consider _ a total of 54 ballot propositions.   San Francisco's long ballot prompted election officials tointroduce for the first time an ``express booth'' at each pollingplace for voters who have pre-marked their sample ballots. Somesmall counties also are using the ``express booth.''   Statewide, authorities have also dusted off, just in case it'sneeded, a never-enforced 78-year-old state law that limits eachvoter to 10 minutes in the booth.   But officials don't want to try to enforce that, because theydon't believe that even those who know how they intend to vote onevery item can vote that quickly this year.   ``It will still take you 10 to 15 minutes just to punch theholes,'' said Germaine Wong, acting registrar of voters in SanFrancisco.   The statewide initiatives confronting California's 13.5 millionvoters include five conflicting plans to curb skyrocketing autoinsurance rates, two AIDS measures, a proposal to raise cigarettetaxes 25 cents per pack and a measure that in effect would overridethe governor's veto of a worker safety program.   At the local level, there are hundreds more ballot propositionscovering subjects as diverse as growth control, selections of newdump sites, rent controls and proposed new library, law enforcementand transit taxes.   Wong said her city's ballot is so long that for the first timeever, it requires two computer punch cards, ``and it's complicatedbecause you vote differently on the two cards.''   She said one of the cards has the names of candidates withinstructions to punch holes next to your choices, while the othercard just has numbered holes keyed to a separate voter pamphlet.   ``San Francisco voters have seen both kinds of cards before, butnever in the same election,'' she said.   Asked why the two cards were different, Wong replied that shedidn't know because she had just been on the job a week, replacingMichelle Corwin, who without warning submitted a letter ofresignation Oct. 17.   ``Her letter indicated that since she was planning to leave inJanuary, and because there was a lot of unpleasant work to be donebetween now and then, she would just leave now and save herself thetrouble,'' said the city's astonished chief administrative officer,Rudy Nothenberg.   Wong said her office has received 65,000 applications forabsentee ballots, more than double the normal number among thecity's 436,000 registered voters, while registrars in other countiesreported requests for absentee ballots up by 10 percent to 75percent.   In nearby Alameda County, there are 27 local propositions amongits communities, but some apply to one town and not to another. SanDiego County has 37, but again, unlike San Francisco where thecounty and city lines coincide, not all the propositions are on allthe ballots.   The statewide propositions have numbers and the local ones haveletters, and Ingred Gonzalez, a San Diego County elections officer,said this election is the first time she ever ran out of letters forpropositions.   ``We went through the alphabet once and a second time with doubleletters through up to Proposition NN,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
