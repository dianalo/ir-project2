The Bank Board directed the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp. to pay Liberty's depositors for their insured deposits. Liberty, a federally chartered stock association with $138.2 million in assets, is the 10th thrift to close this year.    The board said that Liberty had solicited high-cost deposits in order to pursue a strategy of rapid growth, had made &quot;numerous unsafe and unsound&quot; commercial real estate loans, and had &quot;substantially dissipated&quot; its assets. The thrift also violated various regulations, including those governing property appraisals and conflicts of interest, according to the board. </TEXT></DOC>
