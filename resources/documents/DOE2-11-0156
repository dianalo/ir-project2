<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-11-0156 </DOCNO><TEXT>Model experiments have shown that, by a slot in the floor, convergencescan be considerably reduced, in particular in case of a soft floor. Thiswas to be proven in the field, and equipment therefore had to be developedwhich later on could also be used for roadheading sites. Together withMaschinenfabrik Korfmann GmbH, a floor slotting machine was designed,however, not constructed because the results of the drilling method hadto be waited for. Furthermore, there were technical risks. The drillingmethod means that, instead of a slot, 300 mm boreholes are drilled inline in short intervals. Demag Mannesmann constructed, for this method,a percussive drilling system with dry debris clearance on crawler mounting.The unit was good enough for tests, however, its performance had beeninsufficient for regular field use. In 6 different gates in the seamsN and EG, 8 lengths totalling 1116 meters was drilled into. Only over4 said lengths, this line of boreholes resulted in a max. 20% gain interms of convergence. The reasons for this lack of success, viz. waterand too large borehole centres could neither be foreseen nor avoided.As to the costs, the drilling method comes quite close to dinting. Thisfinding meant stop of the project. (orig.) With 1 ref., 24 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
