An official at the Tourism Secretariat said the nationaltourism organization Turespana &quot;isn't going to put any moremoney into advertising at the moment, due to the currentdoubtful atmosphere.&quot; Tourism promotion amounts to 8.52billion pesetas ($90.9 million) in Spain's 1991 budget,virtually the same total as the 1990 budget, the secretariatsaid.   Spain's national carrier Iberia Air Lines yesterdayannounced cancellations of several trans-Atlantic andinter-European flights. Last week, the airline cut a numberof domestic and European flights following an 8% drop inpassenger bookings. The company said demand has plunged dueto fears of a terrorism.   The Bank of Spain reported this week that net income fromtourism in 1990 fell 10.8% to 1.39 trillion pesetas.                                                                                                          TRANS-ATLANTIC CABLES                                                                                                          France Telecom said it and 10 other telecommunicationsoperators from Europe and North America have signed aprotocol agreement to lay two new optic-fiber trans-Atlantictelecommunications cables. One cable will link Germany andthe Netherlands to the U.S., while the second will provideservices between the U.S. and the United Kingdom and France.Each cable will be capable of carrying 80,000 simultaneousconversations.

CONFLAGRATION FOR CONSERVATION                                                                                                          Taiwan officials publicly burned more than 660 pounds ofsmuggled ivory, rhinoceros horn, leopard skins and otherexotic-animal parts to enforce conservation laws. Thecontraband, which included 560 pounds of elephant tusks,would have been worth about $3.7 million on the black market,said an official at the Council of Agriculture. Many itemswere organs and horns from various animals that, when groundinto a powder, are used to make purported aphrodisiacs andtraditional medicines.
