There was a time when the Washington establishment could not wait to be rid of supply-side economics, but no one today expects it to depart town with Ronald Reagan next January. A record peacetime economic expansion, 16 million new jobs, and a low unemployment rate without rising inflation constitute undeniable success.    But the reason for supply-side's permanence is more important than mere result. It takes a policy to dislodge a policy, and no one has an alternative policy. Indeed, no serious politician wants one.    As Donald T. Regan notes in his recent memoir, to be identified with a policy is to become a target. It paints a bull's-eye for the opposition, the media, and for colleagues in power. It is certain to guarantee a steady stream of &quot;leaks&quot; from rivals eager to undermine. In short, to have a policy is to risk failure and an unceremonious exit from the stage.    The successful &quot;policy maker&quot; searches for pragmatic compromises for problems identified by the media. He keeps before his eyes Machiavelli's warning: &quot;There is nothing more difficult, more perilous or more uncertain of success, than to take the lead in introducing a new order of things.&quot;    In a time of political adversity, that will be the saving grace for supply-side economics. Careerists find sound advice in the old saying, &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot; Supply-side economics is far from broke, despite the now-flat yammering over the budget deficit. The policy is spreading around the world, and demand-side modeling is disappearing even in academia.    Ironically, the approaching end of Mr. Reagan's last term of office is also contributing to his policy's permanence. There is simply no longer any incentive to attack President Reagan by attacking the policy. Even Jesse Jackson's proposal to &quot;repeal Reaganomics&quot; stops at a top tax rate of 38%.    Few any longer deny the role of monetary policy in causing the &quot;twin deficits.&quot; With U.S. manufacturing productivity growing at twice its postwar rate and with U.S. exports booming, who can speak of &quot;the de-industrialization of America&quot; or an inability to compete? The dollar has displaced the national currencies of several continents and is readily acceptable in any store in the world, making the specter of a &quot;flight from the dollar&quot; too fanciful to be useful.    Moreover, the picture of America as a permanent &quot;debtor nation&quot; isn't looking so clear. Hastily drawn, it underaccounted for the impact of population trends on the U.S. saving rate, among other things. In the 1980s the large &quot;babyboom&quot; generation became young adults and went into debt in order to acquire housing and its accouterments. This depressed the savings rate. In the 1990s, when this demographic trend reverses, the savings rate will rise. The claim that America is not saving enough to pay off its debts without a drop in its living standards is based on projecting a temporary demographic trend permanently into the future.    Similarly, pundits who stressed a growing consumer debt burden ignored the rise in people's net worth caused by the recovery of stock and bond prices from the depressed levels of the 1970s. As for the U.S. government's debt, it is shrinking as a share of gross national product, and the ratio is one of the lowest in the world.    When the supply-side policy was launched in 1981, critics predicted it would be inflationary, and this prospect has been raised at various times since. The record instead has been one of relatively stable prices, a result of a number of actions in the public and private sectors.    All of these facts will percolate in the minds of the next crop of policy makers and reinforce their own opinions that the value of a presidential appointment is the opportunity to make connections. Once in office they will be looking out their windows for a high-paying job with a top law firm or on Wall Street, and they will not take risks that would foreclose the opportunity to re-enter government whenever a subsequent career-boost is needed. Come Michael Dukakis or George Bush, the self-interest of official Washington is in institutionalizing supply-side policy and making it part of the establishment.    ---   Mr. Roberts was assistant Treasury secretary for economic policy during 1981-82 and is Simon professor of political economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. </TEXT></DOC>
