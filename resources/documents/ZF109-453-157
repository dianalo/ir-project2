(Technology)(column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Fisher, Lawrence M.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Small satellites are becoming favored over large satellitesmethods because there is increased demand from thetelecommunications industry, the military and meteorologists.andO;Such satellites, known as 'lightsats,' are inexpensive and can bequickly produced.andP;  Typically, they weigh less than 500 pounds,compared with 5,000 pounds for a large satellite; and costs,typically, are an order of magnitude less - $20 million comparedwith $200 million.andP;  The tradeoff is in performance: lightsatscannot do all the things that larger satellites can do.andP;  This,however, is changing as technologies evolve.andP;  One reason for aresurgence of interest in small sats and lightsats is Pegasus, awinged rocket that is launched from an airplane.andP;  Satellitelaunches can be accomplished at $7 million to $8 million usingPegasus, compared with $60 to $70 million using a Delta rocket.andO;The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is aproponent of small satellites, and a particularly significantfactor in the development and usage of small satellites couldinvolve the 'Brilliant Pebbles' concept, a proposal that is partof the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI).andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     MiniaturizationSatellite CommunicationsUnited States.
