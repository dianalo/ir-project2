It whirs and hums and spits volatile chemical vapors into the air,vapors stripped by jets of air from a fine-droplet shower of pollutedgroundwater.;    The tower is the only thing that whirs here, in the middle ofan empty parking lot, near a low-slung building where Fairchild SemiconductorCorp.'s Hybrid Division once made electronic auto ignitions.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MTN. VIEW AQUIFER CLEANUP IS A COMPLEX MESS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Such strange, lonely contraptions may whir a long time yet -- a fewdecades, at least -- in this Mountain View industrial park at Whisman andMiddlefield roads. On the nearly abandoned 43-acre Fairchild campus, three ofthem treat water laced with a cancer-causing stew of industrial solvents at arate of 40 gallons a minute.;    But they are only the beginnings of cleanupfor what may be the South Bay's most complex toxic mess -- a huge spill fromseveral companies and Moffett Field Naval Air Station that creeps slowly eachday toward the bay, sullying shallow water and soil and, to a lesser extent,deep-water pools.;    The eight-square-mile site has several parts at itscenter, an area of about one or two square miles, that are either on orproposed for the federal Superfund list. And the site is notable for anotherreason: It has mixed pollution from a federal agency with pollution fromprivate companies, which will mean untangling a host of competing regulationsand liabilities.;    &quot;There aren't any sites in the country like this,&quot; saidprogram manager Patti Collins of the Environmental Protection Agency.;    Nodrinking-water wells tap the polluted pool. The nearest one, a few hundredyards to the southwest, is run by Mountain View and is said by city officialsto be safe.;    If wells ever were drilled here, and if the water was consumedin great quantities over a lifetime, contaminants like trichloroethylene (TCE)could cause, at most, an extra one or more cancer cases per 1,000 people, theEPA estimates. That is roughly 100 to 1,000 times greater than the EPA willallow.;    This month, EPA officials are hammering out orders and agreementsfor several companies to clean the spill at an estimated cost to the companiesof $60 million. The Navy has already spent $25 million on cleanup at MoffettField, and its final tab is still unknown. The companies have already spenttens of millions of dollars.;    Could take 300 years;    The EPA says itcould take anywhere from 46 years to, incredibly, three centuries to do thejob. While EPA officials won't say categorically that they'll be around towatch over the cleanup in the year 2291, they're not saying they won't bethere, either.;    The time span brings reactions from chuckles toincredulity.;    &quot;That's a pretty wide range,&quot; said George Gullage,environmental program manager for Raytheon Co., one firm involved in thecleanup. &quot;But you know, you get in there and pump and see what you can do.&quot;;   &quot;It's sort of a sensational thing,&quot; said Capt. Tim Quigley, Moffettcommander. &quot;It has little meaning. No one knows yet how clean is clean.&quot;;   &quot;I think you could be talking a 15- or 20-year thing,&quot; said Bob Bostic,director of environmental programs for Schlumberger Technology Corp., whichowns the Mountain View Fairchild campus. &quot;Provided some new technology doesn'tcome in.&quot;;    Agreed to terms;  Some companies, like Raytheon and Intel Corp.,have agreed more or less amicably to EPA's terms. Those two firms will designand build regional groundwater extraction wells and chemical strippingsystems, said the EPA's Collins. Nine other companies -- led by Fairchild andSchlumberger -- will then operate and maintain them.;    But Fairchild andSchlumberger have been less than friendly. They have agreed to begin cleanup,to be sure, but under protest.;    Fairchild and Schlumberger charge that theEPA has fragmented the job needlessly by creating three separate plans: onewith the Navy; one with Raytheon and Intel; and one with the other companies.;   &quot;To clean this site up, it needs to be a totally coordinated system,&quot;Bostic said. &quot;Things would go a lot smoother.&quot;;    Complications denied;  TheEPA denies that it has complicated the cleanup. &quot;The coordination of thecleanup will continue,&quot; Collins said. &quot;The EPA is unwilling ever to settleunder terms that impede its ability to safeguard the environment.&quot;;    In acomplicated and obscure legal question that may have to be settled in federalcourt, the two companies also argue that the EPA ought to give a federal judgediscretion to arbitrate future disputes over the cleanup process that mayarise because of its complexity.;    However, no one is saying that legalquestions will delay the cleanup -- which is fortunate, because the pollutionwas discovered nearly 10 years ago and it is spreading slowly in aquifers thattravel a foot or more each day.;    &quot;We're perfectly willing to startimplementing what the EPA has asked us to do,&quot; said Kimberly Mitchell, anattorney for Schlumberger.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  NICK ANDERSON, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910128  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  890  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday January 28, 199100028063,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
