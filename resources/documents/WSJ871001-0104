Brown IIIStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TEX AMR U AEG PIE BAIRAIRLINES (AIR) </IN><DATELINE> HOUSTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Continental Airlines, a unit of Texas Air Corp., said it cut unrestricted fares between its Newark, N.J., hub and seven cities by as much as 65% starting today.    Continental said the fare cuts are an effort to build market share in the New York area and to woo business travelers. It lowered some unrestricted fares even below its highly restricted MaxSaver levels.    Continental and other carriers generally have increased fares in recent months, and analysts predicted the fare cuts probably won't spread to other markets.    At least four other carriers announced similar action.    Continental is offering two unrestricted fare levels: peak and off-peak. The lower off-peak fares are available on certain midday flights during the week, all Saturday flights, and Sunday flights until noon. In the Newark-Chicago market, the offpeak fare also is available on the last flight of the day.    In the Newark-Chicago market, a heavily traveled business route, Continental said it lowered its one-way unrestricted fare to $95 peak/$75 off-peak, compared with its current lowest unrestricted fare of $199 and its lowest MaxSaver of $79.    American Airlines, a unit of Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp., said it followed Continental's cuts in the Newark-Chicago market only, offering slightly higher one-way unrestricted fares of $105 peak/$85 off-peak.    USAir Group Inc., based in Washington, said it would match the fare cuts on competing routes to and from the three New York City-area airports. And the carrier said that for those already holding tickets that are nonrefundable, USAir would waive the penalty and issue cheaper tickets.    Also, United Airlines, a unit of Allegis Corp., said it would roughly match Continental's fare cuts on flights between Newark and Chicago. Flights to and from other airports aren't affected.    And Piedmont Airlines, a Piedmont Aviation Inc. unit, said it would match Continental's fare cuts in and out of Newark, where the two carriers compete.    Piedmont, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., also cut round-trip fares more than 50% on short-haul flights linking 36 airports in the Carolinas, Georgia and the Midwest with its Charlotte and Dayton hubs &quot;to get people out of their cars,&quot; a spokesman said.    Analysts said Continental isn't cutting fares because of weak industry traffic, but rather because it wants to attract business travelers who have shunned the airline during the past year because of the airline's well-publicized service troubles at Newark; Continental says it has corrected most of those problems.    But if the fare cuts spill over to other New York airports, analysts said they might cut into airline profits, especially in the lucrative New York-Chicago market. For now, only USAir is offering the discount out of the New York airports.    Continental also lowered unrestricted fares between Newark and six other less-traveled markets: Rochester and Syracuse, N.Y., $60 peak/$40 off-peak from $99 currently; Norfolk, Va., $60 peak/ $40 off-peak from $110; Pittsburgh, $70 peak/$50 off-peak from $110; Charlotte, N.C., $80 peak/$60 off-peak from $170; and Indianapolis, $95 peak/$75 off-peak from $159.    In a separate action, Dallas-based Braniff Inc., one of the only big airlines without a frequent flyer program, said it would add one in about a month. The carrier hopes the program will allow it to compete more effectively at its Dallas/Fort Worth and Kansas City, Mo., hubs, where Braniff competitors all have such programs. As previously reported, Braniff is also offering one free round-trip ticket for every two round trips flown between today and Dec. 15. in an effort to lure business travelers. </TEXT></DOC>
