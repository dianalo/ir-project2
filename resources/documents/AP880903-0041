National Transportation Safety Board teams also have beenwrestling with a lack of physical evidence that would indicate theBoeing 727 was having engine problems, as the cockpit recording andwitness accounts have suggested.   Flight engineer Steven Judd, the first crew member interviewedsince Wednesday's crash, told investigators Friday that everythingaboard the jet seemed normal before takeoff.   Thirteen people died when the jet crashed at the end of aDallas-Fort Worth International Airport runway and burst intoflames after what investigators said was an usually long takeoffapproach.   Judd said the jet's right wing ``dropped severely'' as the planeleft the ground and that Capt. Larry Davis tried to take correctiveaction. There were no abnormal engine sounds, Judd said, althoughhe recalled hearing the words ``engine failure.''   That statement was picked up on cockpit voice recordings, as wasthe preflight checklist of the wing flaps, NTSB member LeeDickinson said at a briefing Friday night.   ``15, 15. Green light,'' Dickinson quoted a voice on the tape assaying. That would seem to indicate both wing flaps were in theproper 15-degree downward angle for takeoff, he said.   Dickinson said Judd had the same recollection of the flaps'position, which help provide the lift a plane needs to becomeairborne.   Investigators, however, said the flaps in the wreckage appearedto be in the up position and the plane's slats, which are on theforward edge of the wings, were found to be partially extended _the opposite of the correct takeoff position.   NTSB officials said locking devices on the slats likely wouldhave prevented them from being knocked out of position during thecrash.   Investigators have also said the handle controlling the flapsinside the cockpit was in the wrong position, but cautioned that itcould have been jarred out of place during the crash or theevacuation of the crew.   Federal investigators determined that the flaps and slats of aNorthwest Airlines MD-80 were not properly set for takeoff whenthat plane crashed Aug. 16, 1987, at Detroit Metropolitan airport,killing 156 people.   Evidence also has not yet confirmed witness accounts that theDelta jet's engines flared during takeoff, a phenomenon that couldindicate ``compressor stall'' within the engines, said BernardLoeb, the NTSB's deputy director of investigations.   The plane left the gate at its scheduled departure time of 8:31a.m., but did not take off for almost 30 minutes.   Judd ``said he remembers that there were normal engineindications'' and that other aspects of the takeoff were normal upto and including the time the nose wheel left the ground, Dickinsonsaid.   No signs of damage have been found on any of the plane's threeengines, which Dickinson said will be dismantled at the Hartford,Conn., plant of their manufacturer, Pratt andamp; Whitney.   The engines were removed Friday and NTSB investigators were ableto get a better view, Dickinson said. ``They reiterated that therewas no visible evidence of any engine failure or any engineproblem,'' he said.   Ninety-five of the 108 people on board survived, most byscrambling out of emergency doors over the left wing and through acrack between the cabin and cockpit.   Nine victims found piled up at a rear door may have had troubleopening the emergency exit, Loeb said. He said the problem may havebeen the angle of the fuselage and the weight of the door, ratherthan the design of the door.   After the crash, it took more than one person to open the door,Loeb said.   Investigators hope the survival of the flight's cockpit crewwill make it easier to reconstruct the accident.   They said they would wait until the pilot, Capt. Larry Davis,and the first officer, Carey Wilson Kirkland Jr., were more fullyrecovered before talking to them.   Davis, 48, was in fair condition Friday at a Dallas hospital andKirkland, 37, was in stable condition at a suburban hospital.   Services were held for three of the victims Friday. Three moreservices were scheduled for today. All 13 victims were from Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
