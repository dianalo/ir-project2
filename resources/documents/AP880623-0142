The Commerce Department said profits dipped to a seasonallyadjusted annual rate of $144.2 billion, down $1.4 billion from thelast three months of 1987.   It was sharpest drop since the first quarter of 1987, whenprofits fell 3.7 percent. In the second and third quarters of lastyear, after-tax earnings rose 4.3 percent and 5.5 percent,respectively.   Thursday's report on the January-March period represents adownward revision from an estimate last month, when the departmentsaid profits after taxes rose 0.5 percent.   Many analysts believe lagging profits are a sign of inflationbecause they expect companies to raise prices to make up for lostground.   However, Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist of Merrill Lynch,said he believed most companies, remembering the painful cutbacksthey had to make when imports flooded the country in the early1980s, will be very cautious about boosting prices.   ``I think companies are going to take a bit of a longer-termview and say, `Wait a minute, if we raise prices too quickly, wemay give some of that market share back to our foreigncompetitors,''' he said.   In other details of the report, the government said:   _Corporate cash flows, a measurement intended to show the fundscorporations have for investment, rose 0.6 percent to an annualrate of $378.8 billion after a 0.5 percent increase in the fourthquarter.   _Dividend payments to stockholders rose 2.1 percent to an annualrate of $99.3 billion in the first quarter following a 2.2 percentincrease in the fourth quarter.   _Corporate profits before taxes were down 1.4 percent to $281.5billion annual level in the first quarter following a 0.2 percentincrease in the fourth quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
