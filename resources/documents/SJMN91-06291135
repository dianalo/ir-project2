And when their sonswere born, the Sanchezes knew they, too, would be gauchos.;   These days, Luisand Inocencia live between two worlds -- the world of their father and theworld of their sons. One is the world of lone horseback rides that last fordays; the other is the world of jet travel that spans continents in a fewhours.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GAUCHOS AREN'T OUT OF STYLE YET  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     All the men in the Sanchez family are gauchos, Argentine cowboys. Nothinghas deterred them -- not creeping cities or shrinking farms, not shoppingcenters or diesel-powered combines that do the work a gaucho and his horseused to do.;   But the Sanchez men are gauchos with a twist -- they teachpolo, they play polo, and they care for polo ponies.;   Luis' 20-year-old sonworks for polo players in England -- a remarkable change for a family where a200-mile car trip to the city used to be considered a once-in-a-lifetimeadventure.;   &quot;Gauchos have always worked with horses, so now they're workingwith horses that play polo,&quot; Inocencia said. &quot;It goes to show the gaucho willnever die. He always adapts to circumstances.&quot;;   The Sanchez family has donejust that. Luis still spends rainy days in his workshop, hand-stitchingleather belts. But he drives a 1990 Renault, something his father never couldhave imagined. When he relaxes, he watches John Wayne movies on the VCR in hishouse by the barn. His sons and nephews are Rambo fans.;   The pampas, vastand fertile flatlands, are to Argentina what the prairie is to Texas. They aremore than a natural resource. They are a source of legends. And none is moreenduring than that of the gaucho, a character that has always fluctuated inthe public mind between hero and villain.;   These days, Argentina seems tohave little use for gauchos, those atavistic characters who speak with hickaccents and know more about alfalfa-growing than leading market indicators.;   BILLOWY gaucho pants, embroidered vests, long leather boots, black sombreros-- all have become symbols of the past, not the present.;   The country isobsessed with being a First World power. More than one-third of Argentineslive in the capital, Buenos Aires. The nation reveres stock traders, businesswhiz-kids and the occasional tennis star.;   Some say gauchos are little morethan museum pieces, a folksy remnant of the days when agriculture wasArgentina's one and only industry.;   &quot;The gaucho is being done in by taxes,cars, tractors and progress,&quot; said Osvaldo Gasparini, a 75-year-old artist whohas devoted much of his life to painting gauchos. Gasparini runs a museum ofgaucho memorabilia in San Antonio de Areca, near Buenos Aires.;   La Escondida(Spanish for &quot;Hidden&quot;) Ranch has changed with the times. Meticulously keptjournals by the British immigrants who started the ranch at the turn of thecentury detail its origins as a small producer of beef.;   Caroline Avendano,whose British-immigrant ancestors started the ranch, still remembers going toHouston and Dallas with her husband for two weeks in the 1970s to buy 70Brahman heifers and bulls.;   &quot;We saw hard-working farms, but I was struck byhow small they were,&quot; she said.;   Today, La Escondida has nearly 1,000 headof cattle -- and hundreds of polo ponies. The Sanchezes, fathers and sons,train the horses to play polo -- a process that takes several years, workingsix days a week. The horses are sold to polo enthusiasts in Palm Beach, Fla.,Saudi Arabia, India and a score of other countries. Avendano won't talk aboutprices, but a polo-playing horse is worth hundreds of times the $230 a youngbull fetches.;    ARGENTINA is the world's leading exporter of polo ponies.Although known as a game of the landed British gentry, polo is an idealpastime for Argentina's flat fields and brawny horses.;   Luis and InocenciaSanchez learned to play polo as teen-agers. Their boys grew up more familiarwith polo chukkers than with soccer game periods. Most of the teen-agechildren have never been to Buenos Aires.;   When the family talks about &quot;thecity,&quot; they are referring to the nearby town of General Pinto, which has onemovie theater and four bars.;   &quot;I'd like to see the city, but you could getrobbed there,&quot; said 17-year-old Julio Maria.;   Julio's father has watched onegaucho family after another move to the city to look for jobs and the goodlife. He doesn't understand Argentina's fascination with all things urban --with malls, with stockbrokers and lawyers, with men who don't know how to workwith their hands.;   It doesn't upset him. It mystifies him.;   &quot;The gauchocan do anything. He can break a horse, fix a car, lasso cattle, drive atractor or a thousand other things,&quot; he said. &quot;A lawyer can't do any of that.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID L.
