Also left out of the will were Davis' two grandsons.   The 10-page will was filed Monday for probate in Manhattan.   ``I declare that I have intentionally and with full knowledgeomitted to provide herein for my daughter, Margot, and my daughter,Barbara, and-or my grandsons, Ashley Hyman and Justin Hyman,''Davis said in the will dated Sept. 2, 1987.   Davis, who died of cancer at age 81 on Oct. 6, had beenestranged from her daughter, Barbara Davis Hyman ofCharlottesville, Va., since Hyman's 1985 book, ``My Mother'sKeeper.''   Hyman wrote that Davis had been ``an abusive, domineering andhateful mother,'' and ``a grotesque alcoholic'' largely responsiblefor her own mistreatment by some of her three husbands.   Davis replied in a 1987 book, ``This 'n' That,'' that she hadbeen victimized by a ``lying and ungrateful child.'' She alsoadmitted she was ``pained'' by the estrangement.   Hyman's two sons, Ashley and Justin, also received no bequest.The actress' lawyer, Harold Schiff, explained: ``Unfortunately,their mother chose to have them follow her rather than theirhearts.''   ``Down the road they'll be sorry,'' Schiff said. ``Twenty yearsfrom now they'll say, `That was our grandmother; why didn't we knowher.'''   Manhattan Surrogate Court Judge Renee Roth directed Hyman tonotify the court by Dec. 5 if she plans to contest the will.   Davis' adopted daughter, Margot Mosher Merrill of Geneva, N.Y.,was diagnosed as mentally retarded at age 3 and has been in specialschools and institutions since.   The will did not specify how Margot Merrill would be providedfor, or how she has been supported in the past.   Davis' adopted son, Michael Woodman Merrill of Chestnut Hill,Mass., receives about half the $600,000 to $1 million estate. Hiswife, Shu Shu, was left clothing.   Michael and Margot Merrill were adopted when Davis was marriedto actor Gary Merrill.   Kathryn Sermack, a friend and secretary who lived with Davis inher Los Angeles-area apartment, also gets about half the estate.Sermack also was left cookbooks and recipes, a gold charm bracelet,other jewelry, a desk, furiture and silverware with the initials``BD.''   Robin Brown of Westport, Conn., described by Schiff as ``an old,old, old, friend'' of Davis' from their childhood in Massachusetts,was bequeathed a painting entitled, ``A Red Barn,'' a photoportrait of Davis, and a pearl and sapphire watch.   Faye Forbes of Peoria, Ariz., daughter of Davis' sister, BarbaraDavis Berry, was left six silver condiment holders.   Davis died of cancer at Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, where she wasbeing treated for cancer. Schiff said she had undergone amastectomy in 1983 and had a stroke a few years later.   Davis was buried at her family's plot at Forest Lawn inGlendale, Calif.   Schiff asked in an affidavit that the court accept the will forprobate here because he was her lawyer, business manager and friendfor 27 years and his offices are here. He noted, too, that all ofher tax returns and those of her production company were preparedby accountants here. He said the only asset in California is acondominium apartment.</TEXT></DOC>
