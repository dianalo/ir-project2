You have quit your well paying job -- in sales, perhaps, as in Peter Curd's case, or in real estate, as in Isabel Atkinson's case. You have plunked down $22,000 for a Kwik Kopy franchise. And now, you are crammed into the Kwik Kopy bus, riding from Houston Intercontinental Airport to an isolated campus in the woods near Cyprus, Texas.    The group falls silent as the bus turns into Kwik Kopy Lane. &quot;Earn the Right to be Proud,&quot; says a sign along the entrance. &quot;Tomorrow Belongs to Kwik Kopy,&quot; reads the next.    The company calls this &quot;Kwik Kopy University,&quot; but the place feels more like boot camp. For despite the bucolic landscaping, the tennis courts and the swimming pool, coming here is no vacation. Over the next three weeks, Kwik Kopy will own your mind, heart and soul.    In dozens of classes from dawn till dark, new franchisees receive a crash course in avoiding small-business failure. Very little of the training involves plate making, paper jams and the other challenges of printing and duplicating. Mostly the training involves managing and selling -- and above all confidence building, to the point of brainwashing.    &quot;My job is to have them leave here with the attitude they can lick the world,&quot; says Nathan Winfield, the training director.    But only to a degree. Franchise owners, according to several studies on the subject, are followers as much as leaders -- people intent on proving themselves by following a success formula that someone else has already proven. Just as McDonald's Corp. teaches burger-cooking down to the exact second, Kwik Kopy training involves indoctrination in a system, one that currently generates $225 million a year in revenue at some 1,200 franchises around the world.    And for the most part, Mr. Winfield and his fellow trainers have willing subjects. &quot;My mind is a blank piece of paper,&quot; says Geoff Loughborough, a former heavy-equipment trader from Surrey, England, one of five incoming members of Kwik Kopy Klass No. 329.    Despite her enthusiasm for the training, Mrs. Atkinson, the former real-estate agent, initially is put off by the atmosphere imbuing Kwik Kopy U. Patriotic meditations and tacky self-help slogans are plastered everywhere. The class schedules are printed in red, white and blue, and the fruit baskets are trimmed in the same colors. Bald eagles in various open-claw poses are etched into the windows. The 23-acre campus is studiously pastoral, with its gaggles of geese and its little walking bridges and man-made islands.    &quot;When I first got here, I thought it was the phoniest thing I'd ever seen,&quot; Mrs. Atkinson would later say.    But like nearly everyone who passes through, Mrs. Atkinson will become a true believer. The process begins almost immediately after her arrival, when she is given a sheriff's badge: It has become her job to get everyone to class on time. This creates leadership in the class -- and saves the instructors from having to act like pushy school marms.    By 7:30 a.m. Monday the students find a pile of loose-leaf training notebooks and two paperback books on their desks: &quot;In Search of Excellence&quot; and Dale Carnegie's &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People.&quot; Such scintillating reading, alas, must wait, because in the first moment of training everyone has been plunked down before a personal computer, on which they will receive a total of 18 hours of instruction.    &quot;Here's how you plug that sucker into the wall,&quot; Mr. Winfield begins.    The driving force behind this corn-pone company is its 64-year-old founder, chairman and part owner, Bud Hadfield, who got thrown out of high school, joined the merchant marines and later sold eggs, ran a gas station, sold ice cream, ran a convenience store and raised hogs. &quot;All failures.&quot; he says.    Mr. Hadfield eventually found he had a knack for printing, though not for customer relations. After fist-fighting with one unhappy customer (and getting thrown through a window and badly cut), Mr. Hadfield enrolled in a Dale Carnegie class, and eventually became an instructor. Today, a modified, Carnegie-style course in public speaking and self-esteem is taught here almost every afternoon.    Class No. 329 survives its first &quot;personal development workshop&quot; uneventfully, with students giving 60-second speeches on what they expect from their training. The instructors, however, are accustomed to excusing nauseated first-time participants for emergency trips to the bathroom.    Mr. Hadfield has no pretensions about Kwik Kopy U. &quot;We take someone who's been wearing a green eyeshade for 20 years and train them to run a business in three weeks,&quot; he says. &quot;It's enough to make the gods laugh.&quot; After 20 years, Mr. Hadfield and his associates still continually adjust the training program, practically on a weekly basis.    &quot;At one time it was four weeks,&quot; he says. &quot;But we found that at the end of three weeks, they want to kill you.&quot; The company used to lodge students at a hotel, but that only exposed them to taverns and other local distractions. Now, &quot;we isolate them.&quot;    Every instructor is home-grown and plucked from the corporate staff of 112, where the loyalty of the survivors is astonishing. They police the grounds without pay. They work weekends without pay. They fill the parking lot before 7:30 a.m. for jobs that begin at 8 a.m.    Some of the teaching is rote how-to: pricing, job scheduling, inventorying. But much involves role-playing, such as managing the service counter. Mr. Winfield also makes a point of instructing the new franschisees in the limitations of their shops. &quot;If you can't do it,&quot; he says, &quot;job it out and add 50%.&quot;    But the biggest, most-repeated lesson involves marketing -- cold sales calls, or &quot;public-relations calls,&quot; in the Kwik Kopy vernacular. In classrooms and on videotapes the message is beaten in daily: &quot;Go out there with a mission . . . Do it by the book . . . At least 50 calls a day . . . Go sic 'em. . . .&quot; Students practice getting past secretaries by going door-to-door in the headquarters office. Then, they practice cold calls in the local business community.    Mr. Hadfield tells his students about a franchisee in Phoenix whose shop nearly failed because he waited for the business to come in. The owner called Mr. Hadfield one day for a loan to save his family from eating dog food. &quot;Being a very compassionate man,&quot; Mr. Hadfield tells the students, &quot;I said, 'Okay, eat dog food.'&quot;    Mr. Hadfield makes the students sign a certificate. &quot;I will make my PR calls,&quot; the oath reads. &quot;Dog food is for the dogs.&quot;    Despite all the confrontation and indoctrination, something happens to nervous strangers thrown together for three weeks: They become friends, not just with each other, but with their instructors. &quot;We want them to feel like family,&quot; Mr. Winfield says. This, too, is by design. Kwik Kopy wants franchisees to call the headquarters regularly -- constantly, if necessary, to avoid making mistakes that could cost the company royalties.    The end of the course is like a summercamp scene: Kwik Kopy T-shirts, the exchange of addresses, Instamatic photos, hugs and tearful goodbyes. At the commencement ceremony, Mr. Winfield gives a stirring address about the history of printing from Gutenberg to Linotype to desk-top publishing. &quot;Welcome to the Kwik Kopy family,&quot; he concludes.    Mr. Loughborough, the Englishman, arrived here a demurring, softly spoken man, but he has won the Bald Eagle Award for achievement in personal development. &quot;I came three weeks ago to learn about printing,&quot; he says during commencement, &quot;but I'm going away knowing a little bit more about people.&quot;    ---   Mr. Petzinger is chief of The Wall Street Journal's Houston bureau and is guest editor of this issue of The Wall Street Journal reports. </TEXT></DOC>
