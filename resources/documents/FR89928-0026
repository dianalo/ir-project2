There will be no significant increase in cost or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State or local government agencies, orgeographic regions. Furthermore, there will be no adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of UnitedStates based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domesticor export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background/Information</ITAG>Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) was mandated by Congress under the 1987Amendment to the Housing Act of 1949 to provide escrow services to paytaxes and insurance for SFH borrowers. In an effort to implement escrowservices, FmHA initiated a pilot project for the State of Wisconsin. Aprivate sector contractor was selected to develop the billing, escrow,and accounting services for Wisconsin's SFH loan portfolio. The term ``escrowservicer'' will be used when referring to the party who will be providingthe escrow. The pilot project in Wisconsin will allow the Agency to evaluatethe escrow system which has been established, with consideration beinggiven to implementation nationwide.The following are the proposed major revisions, pertaining to escrow, incorporatedin this rulemaking action:1. Section 1806.6 will allow the escrow servicer to obtain property insurancefor borrowers required to escrow, if the borrower fails to provide acceptableinsurance. Existing borrowers required to escrow will be notified by letterat least 90 days prior to initiating escrowing for insurance. Borrowersbeing phased into escrow will be given 30 days to obtain coverage.2. Section 1806.25(c)(4) is revised to state existing borrowers requiredto escrow will be notified by letter 90 days prior to initiating escrowingfor flood insurance.3. Section 1806.28 is revised to state that for borrowers required to escrowfor flood insurance, the premium will be paid through an advance if theescrow account contains insufficient funds.4. Section 1807.2(f)(3) is revised to provide that escrow funds will beprorated between buyer and seller at the time of closing. Also, when anassumption is closed, an amount equal to the transferor's share of theprorated taxes will be transferred to the transferee's escrow account,if the transferee is required to escrow.5. Section 1951.313(f)(3) is revised to provide that FmHA will pay theproperty taxes and insurance, if they become due, and charge it to theloan account for a borrower on a moratorium, who is required to escrow.FmHA can pay the property taxes and insurance of borrowers on a moratoriumwho are not required to escrow, if the borrower is unable to pay the taxesand insurance premium. At the end of the moratorium period, not to exceed2 years, the account (including taxes and insurance costs which were paidby FmHA), can be reamortized for the remainder of the term of the loan.This provides the borrower with the maximum opportunity to become successful.6. Section 1951.314(a)(6) is revised to allow the account to be reamortizedwhen real estate taxes for one or more years and/or an insurance premiumfor one year is vouchered and the borrower is not able to repay the advancewithin the number of years represented by the taxes of insurance, as applicable,when initially establishing a borrower on escrow. Nonprogram (NP) accountswill only be reamortized in this instance if the borrower is an owner/occupant.FmHA will pay the taxes and/or insurance of an NP borrower who is an investor/nonoccupantonly if the borrower is unwilling or unable to pay the taxes and/or insurance.If paid by FmHA, it will be charged to the loan account as an unamortizedcost.7. Section 1955.5(e) is revised to provide that any funds in a borrower'sescrow account will not be refunded if the account is liquidated by voluntaryconveyance or foreclosure.8. Section 1965.105 is revised to provide that if a borrower becomes delinquenton his/her real estate taxes, FmHA will notify the borrower using FmHAGuide Letter 1965-C-1. If the taxes are not paid within 30 days FmHA willvoucher for the taxes and charge the expense to the borrower's account.Because the guide letter is not published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, anyone desiring a copy should contact FmHA atthe address and phone number shown under the heading ``For Further InformationContact''. Existing borrowers required to escrow will be notified by letter90 days prior to initiating escrowing for taxes.Other major issues which are incorporated in this rulemaking are as follows:1. Section 1951.301 is revised to clarify that the requirements of subpartG of part 1951 do not apply if the decision has been made to liquidatethe farmer program loan(s) of a borrower who also has an RH loan(s), ifthe dwelling was used as security for the farm loan(s). Except that, theRH loan account will be considered for interest credit and/or moratoriumat the time servicing options are being considered for the FP loan(s) priorto acceleration.2. Section 1951.312 is revised to provide that when foreclosure is recommendedon borrowers with a monthly payment plan, including annual payment borrowersconverted to monthly, for failure to make scheduled FmHA payments, theaccount will not be accelerated unless at least 3 payments are past due;except that, if during the past 24 months an account was accelerated forbeing at least 3 payments past due and after reinstatement the borrowerremains unable or unwilling to bring and keep the account current foreclosurecan be recommended when the account becomes 2 payments past due. For annualpayment borrowers, the account will not be accelerated until at least oneannual payment is 90 days past due and arrangements have not been madeto bring the account current. Forced liquidation of a 504 loan should beavoided, if possible. If liquidation action must be taken considerationshould be given to releasing it as a valueless lien in accordance withandSection; 1965.118 of subpart C of part 1965 of this chapter. This sectionis also revised to provide that when a borrower becomes 30 days or morepast due, under the terms or conditions of an additional payment agreement(APA), the agreement becomes null and void. A borrower who misses a scheduledpayment and has made payments as agreed for less than 3 months will beadvised that if the account is not brought current, action may be takento liquidate the account without further servicing actions. A borrowerwho misses a scheduled payment and has made payments as agreed for morethan 3 months will be serviced as though it is an initial delinquency.3. Section 1951.314(a)(8) is clarified so that the account of an RH borrowermay be reamortized in connection with a farmer program servicing optionif the borrower is indebted for an RH and farmer program loan.4. Section 1951.314(a)(9) is added to allow the reamortization of an accountwhich has been reinstated after being accelerated.5. Section 1951.314(a)(10) is added to provide for reamortization of anunsatisfied account balance which is rescheduled after the sale of securityproperty.6. Exhibit A to part 1951, subpart S, attachments 3, 5, 7 and 9 are revisedto clarify that the housing loan could also be accelerated even if thehousing account is current, if the dwelling was used to secure the farmloan(s).7. Exhibit A to part 1951, subpart S, attachments 2 and 3 are revised toadd that if the borrower is indebted for an SFH loan, in some cases, interestcredits may be granted to reduce the house payment or the payments maybe suspended for a period of time (moratorium) and made up later.8. Section 1955.15(d)(2)(iv) is revised to provide that if the borroweris in default on his farm loan(s), the SFH account must have been consideredfor interest credit and/or moratorium at the time servicing options arebeing considered for the FP loan(s) prior to acceleration.9. Section 1956.58(a)(2)(i) permits County Supervisors to approve the cancellationand charge off of SFH debts regardless of the amount. Approval authorityfor any type of debt settlement action has not previously been given tostaff below the level of State Director. County Supervisors have, however,for many years been authorized to make determinations on whether SingleFamily Housing (SFH) borrowers who conveyed their property to FmHA or soldit for less than their FmHA debt are to be released from liability; andif so, to execute the release from liability. Until passage of the Housingand Community Development Act of 1987, the Housing Act of 1949, as amended,required that borrowers be released from liability for any difference betweensecurity value and indebtedness upon liquidation if they had cooperatedin good faith, satisfactorily maintained the security, and fulfilled theloan covenants to the best of their ability. Since the 1987 amendment,section 510(c) of the Housing Act permits the Secretary to ``compromise,adjust, reduce or charge-off claims * * * as circumstances may require* * *'', which allows FmHA to exact greater financial accountability fromthe borrower toward their loan obligation, and where a financial statementshows the borrower has sufficient assets, to pursue collection of any deficiencyresulting from the difference in security value and indebtedness.Since there may be more situations where borrowers will not be releasedfrom liability and potentially more cases involving chargeoffs, the Agencyis electing to give County Supervisors authority to approve SFH chargeoffsand cancellations to avoid increasing State Office workload. Settlementsthrough compromise or adjustment must still be approved by the State Director.10. Section 1965.26(c)(2) is clarified to state how SFH loans on nonfarmtracts should be handled if the farmer program loan(s) are being liquidatedand the nonfarm property secures only the SFH loan.11. Section 1965.125(a)(2) is revised to restrict the payment of a broker'scommission on a sale when the FmHA debt and authorized expenses exceedmarket value and the sale is to the broker, broker's salesperson(s), personsliving in his/her or salesperson(s) immediate household or to legal entitiesin which the broker or salesperson(s) have an interest if the sale involvesFmHA credit. If credit is not being extended in these instances (a cashsale), a commission will be allowed or paid.12. Section 1965.26(c)(2) has been revised to clarify that if the nonfarmproperty secures only an SFH loan(s) it will not be liquidated unless theappropriate provisions of subpart G of part 1951 of this chapter have beenmet, including the offering of interest credit assistance and/or moratorium,if eligible.<ITAG tagnum="84">Programs Affected</ITAG>The programs are listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA)under:<ITAG tagnum="16">10.404 Emergency Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">10.406 Farm Operating Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">10.407 Farm Ownership Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">10.410 Low-Income Housing Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">10.411 Rural Housing Site Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">10.417 Very Low-Income Housing Repair Loans and Grants</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Consultation</ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the final rule related Notice(s) to 7 CFRpart 3015, subpart V, the programs contained in 10.404 Emergency Loans,10.406 Farm Operating Loans, 10.407 Farm Ownership Loans, 10.410 Low IncomeHousing Loans and 10.417 Very Low-Income Housing Repair Loans and Grantsare excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmentalconsultation with State and local officials.

All direct payments are considered regularpayments. Regular payments will be applied by FmHA in the following orderof priority:(i) Escrow for taxes and/or insurance, if applicable. (ii) Any fees or charges such as late fees, administrative fees, uncollectiblecheck charges, etc., if applicable.(iii) Advances for recoverable costs in the amount necessary to keep theadvance accounts current, (applied first to amortized, then unamortizedadvances).

Extra payments and refunds do not relieve borrowers from makingtheir next scheduled payment.(c) [Reserved]<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1951.310 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Amortization of recoverable cost.</ITAG>When an advance is made by FmHA to pay recoverable costs, the paymentswill automatically increase during the amortization period by the amountnecessary to repay the advance. The advance will bear interest at the ratewhich is in effect for the loan to which the advance is charged.(a) <T3>Monthly payment borrowers.</T3> If there are unpaid amortized costitems already on the account, the charges will be combined and reamortized.The amortization period for the combined advances will be based upon theterm of the advance which permits the longer repayment period. If the newinstallment would be less than the previous installment, the larger installmentwill be used, thus causing the balance to be paid over a shorter period.Advances for payment of real estate taxes are amortized for the numberof months for which the taxes are being paid. For example, an advance for2 years' taxes is amortized over 2 years. Advances for purposes other thanreal estate taxes are amortized for 12 months unless FmHA determines, basedon the borrower's repayment ability, a longer period is needed. An amortizationperiod of more than 12 months will be used only when the cost is of a nonrecurringtype. In no case will the amortization period exceed 8 years.(b) <T3>Annual payment borrowers. </T3>Recoverable costs will be automaticallydue and payable for annual payment borrowers on the next payment due date,unless FmHA determines, based on the borrower's repayment ability, thata longer period is needed. In such cases, real estate taxes can be amortizedover the number of years the taxes are being paid. Advances for purposesother than real estate taxes can be amortized for a period not to exceed8 years. (c) [Reserved] <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1951.311 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Reporting responsibilities. </ITAG>(a) [Reserved] (b) <T3>Annual statement. </T3>At the end of each calendar year, FmHA willprovide each borrower with a statement showing the unpaid loan balanceand the amount of principal and interest paid during the year. If the borrowerreceived subsidy that is subject to recapture, the cumulative interestcredit granted will be shown. For those borrowers required to escrow, thestatus and disbursements shall be shown. The interest paid and, if appropriate,the escrow disbursements will be reported to IRS. (c) [Reserved] <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1951.312 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Servicing monthly and annual payment borrowers. </ITAG>FmHA will use all authorities available to give borrowers an opportunityto become successful homeowners. Collection of a delinquency from an InternalRevenue Service (IRS) refund will be considered to the extent permittedby law. When foreclosure is recommended on borrowers with a monthly paymentplan, including annual payment borrowers converted to monthly, for failureto make scheduled FmHA payments, the account will not be accelerated unlessat least 3 payments are past due; except that, if during the past 24 monthsan account was accelerated for being at least 3 payments past due and afterreinstatement the borrower remains unable or unwilling to bring and keepthe account current FmHA may recommend foreclosure when the account becomes2 payments past due. For annual payment borrowers, the account will notbe accelerated until at least one annual payment is 90 days past due andarrangements have not been made to bring the account current. Forced liquidationof a 504 loan should be avoided, if possible. If liquidation action mustbe taken consideration should be given to releasing it as a valueless lienin accordance with andSection; 1965.118 of subpart C of part 1965 of thischapter. Delinquent annual payment borrowers should be requested to convertto monthly payments any time a servicing benefit is provided such as interestcredit assistance and moratorium, if the borrower has monthly income. Allactions taken, agreements reached and recommendations made in the servicingof a borrower's account are to be documented. Account servicing includesthe following: (a) <T3>Interest credit. </T3>When servicing loan accounts, FmHA will makesure borrowers are receiving all of the interest credit assistance forwhich they are eligible. (b) <T3>Moratorium. </T3>When it is known (or if it appears) that circumstancesexist which may entitle a borrower to a moratorium, FmHA will inform theborrower this assistance may be available and provide the borrower a formon which to apply for a moratorium. (c) <T3>Reschedules payment agreement. </T3>Delinquent borrowers are expectedto bring their accounts current as soon as possible, based on their abilityto repay as determined by completing a budget. Borrowers who are able willpay all or a substantial portion of the delinquent amount in a single payment.Monthly payment borrowers unable to do so will pay their regularly scheduledpayment plus an additional amount until the account is current. Annualpayment borrowers should pay the delinquent amount during the year in orderthat they are current prior to their next scheduled payment. The remainingpast due balance should usually be paid within 2 years, but in no casewill the repayment period exceed the remaining term of the loan. The delinquentborrower's circumstances will be reviewed annually to determine if theremaining past due balance can be paid in full or if the additional paymentamount should be increased. For monthly payment borrowers, payments inaddition to the regularly scheduled amount to repay a delinquency mustbe at least $10 per month. (d) <T3>Systematic method to service accounts of delinquent monthly and annualpayment borrowers. </T3>FmHA will promptly and systematically service delinquentaccounts to attempt to have the problems resolved so the borrower's homeownershipis not jeopardized. Although a sufficient number of servicing letters areneeded to document that borrowers have been notified of benefits whichmay be available to them, FmHA may contact the borrower through personalcontact, either by telephone or in person. During a telephone or personalcontact, an attempt will be made to reach a firm agreement with the borrowerto resolve the delinquency. All contacts and attempted contacts shouldbe documented in the borrower's servicing record. If the borrower doesnot qualify for additional benefits (moratorium or subsidy) and the borroweris unable or unwilling to reach a satisfactory agreement to repay the delinquency,FmHA will discuss voluntary liquidation of the account. When a borrowerbecomes 30 days or more past due, under the terms or conditions of an additionalpayment agreement (APA), the agreement becomes null and void. A borrowerwho misses a scheduled payment and has made payments as agreed for lessthan 3 months will be advised that if the account is not brought current,action may be taken to liquidate the account without further servicingactions. A borrower who misses a scheduled payment and has made paymentsas agreed for more than 3 months will be serviced as though it is an initialdelinquency. If a borrower has not resolved a delinquency and FmHA determinesliquidation is necessary, FmHA will attempt to have the borrower meet his/herloan obligation by selling the property to repay the loan account. Voluntarysale by borrowers allows them to realize any equity they have in the property(as adjusted by recapture of subsidy, if applicable). To ensure consistency,a series of Guide Letters (available in any FmHA office) are provided FmHAfield staffs for discretionary use in servicing delinquent accounts. Atappropriate times during servicing contacts borrowers will be advised aboutinterest credit and moratoriums. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1951.313 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Moratoriums. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Definitions. </T3>As used in this section: (1) <T3>Moratorium. </T3>A period of up to 2 years during which scheduled paymentsare deferred for payment at a later date. (2) <T3>Scheduled payments. </T3>The amount of the monthly or annual installmenton a promissory note as modified by an interest credit agreement, additionalpayment agreement, amortization of an advance by FmHA, or other agreementsbetween FmHA and the borrower. (3) <T3>Temporary. </T3>A period of time not to exceed 2 years. For example,it would be appropriate to grant a moratorium during each period of unemploymentto a borrower with an unstable employment history. In such a case, unemploymentcould not be considered temporary. (4) <T3>Unduly impaired standard of living. </T3>An adverse condition, basedon circumstances beyond the borrower's control, exceeding a normal or reasonablefinancial setback, that temporarily prevents a borrower from meeting necessaryliving expenses and scheduled payments on the FmHA loan. (b) <T3>Eligibility requirements. </T3>The borrower will be provided a formto complete when FmHA becomes aware of existing circumstances which mayentitle a borrower to a moratorium or if the borrower requests a moratoriumwithout filing the form. All of the following conditions must exist beforea moratorium can be granted: (1) The borrower is temporarily unable for one of the following reasonsto continue making scheduled payments without unduly impairing his/herstandard of living:(i) Income reduction of at least 30 percent. If the borrower is currentlyreceiving interest credit, the 30 percent reduction will be from the incomeon which the current interest credit agreement is based. If the borroweris not receiving interest credit, the 30 percent reduction will be fromverified income for the past year. A 30 percent reduction by itself, however,does not make a borrower eligible for a moratorium. A budget must be preparedand must indicate that the borrower's standard of living will be undulyimpaired if payments with the maximum authorized interest credit are required.FmHA will determine if the borrower qualifies for interest credit or additionalinterest credit before granting a moratorium. (ii) The need to pay unexpected and unreimbursed expenses resulting froman accident, illness, injury or death of a family member or damage to thesecurity property if adequate hazard insurance coverage was unavailable.(2) The borrower must occupy the dwelling unless the dwelling is determinedby FmHA to be uninhabitable. (3) The borrower's account is not currently accelerated. (4) The borrower agrees to notify FmHA if the circumstances on which themoratorium was based change. (c) <T3>Granting a moratorium</T3>. A moratorium on scheduled payments willbe granted when: (1) The borrower has made written request on a form provided by FmHA. (2) FmHA has verified the accuracy of the information provided and determinesthat the borrower is receiving all authorized interest credit and meetsall the moratorium eligibility requirements. (d) <T3>Approval authority</T3>. FmHA will notify the borrower in writing ofthe action taken on a moratorium application within 15 days after receiptof the completed written application by FmHA. (e) <T3>Moratorium period</T3>. A moratorium will be in effect for a periodnot to exceed 2 years unless earlier cancelled. The borrower's circumstanceswill be reviewed annually but the moratorium will be cancelled any timethe reason for the moratorium no longer exists. A moratorium may be retroactivefor up to 90 days prior to the date the request for a moratorium was receivedby FmHA if the circumstances for which the moratorium is to be grantedexisted during that time. In situations under andSection;1944.5(d)(11) ofpart 1944 of this chapter where the income of a spouse living apart fromthe borrower family is included, the moratorium may be retroactive forup to 90 days prior to either the date the moratorium request was receivedor the end of the 6 month period, whichever is later. (f) <T3>Annual review</T3>. For borrowers receiving interest credit, the borrower'scircumstances will be evaluated during the annual interest credit reviewto determine if a moratorium is still justified. For borrowers not receivinginterest credit the borrower's circumstances will be reviewed annuallyon the anniversary date of the moratorium. If circumstances warrant, themoratorium will continue in effect; otherwise it will be cancelled. Ifthe borrower does not respond to the annual request, the moratorium willbe cancelled. There will be no appeal of a cancellation because a borrowerfailed to respond to the annual request. A moratorium will never continuefor a period of more than 2 years. If the moratorium was granted to payunexpected and unreimbursed expenses, the borrower must show that an amountat least equal to the deferred payments has been applied toward the expensesor the moratorium will be cancelled. Although the borrower is expectedto pay the taxes and insurance, if possible, during the moratorium periodthe real estate taxes and hazard insurance premium can be paid by FmHAand charged to the loan account, if the borrower is unable to pay the premium,as authorized in, andSection;1806.6 of subpart A of part 1806 of this chapter(paragraph VI of FmHA Instruction 426.1). Borrowers on escrow will be senta billing statement each month for the taxes and insurance. If unable topay the taxes when they become due and payable from the taxing authorityor insurance, when the premium must be paid, FmHA will pay these expensesby voucher. (g) <T3>Action at the end of the moratorium period</T3>. At the end of themoratorium period, FmHA will verify the borrower's annual income and obtaina current budget to determine the borrower's repayment ability. The borrowerwill be advised by letter of the action taken, the reasons for the actionand the new payment schedule. (1) Borrowers on a monthly payment plan who can bring the account currentwithin 2 years by paying the payments which were deferred, in additionto regularly scheduled payments, will execute an additional payment agreementto establish a new repayment schedule. (2) When a borrower cannot bring the account current within 2 years throughuse of an additional payment agreement, the loan will be reamortized withinthe remaining term of the loan. (3) When a borrower does not have repayment ability if the loan were reamortizedwithin the remaining term of the loan, the loan may be reamortized forthe remaining term plus a period not to exceed the time a moratorium wasin effect. If the loan was not originally scheduled for maximum legal term,the loan can be reamortized for the maximum legal term of the loan plusa period not to exceed the time the moratorium was in effect, less thenumber of years the loan has been outstanding. Fees for title clearanceand legal services needed to assure that the Government's lien priorityis retained must be paid by the borrower or may be advanced by the Governmentto be charged to the borrower's account. (4) Cancellation of interest accrued during the moratorium will be consideredfor borrowers whose payments with maximum interest credit after the moratoriumperiod exceed 20 percent of their adjusted income. Part or all of the accruedinterest will be cancelled when reamortization over the maximum authorizedperiod will not result in payments which are within the borrower's repaymentability. If the determination is made the borrower cannot make scheduledpayments without cancellation of part or all of the interest which accruedduring the moratorium, FmHA will determine how much interest must be cancelledto enable the borrower to repay the loan during the maximum authorizedperiod. The amount of interest to be cancelled will be deducted from theaccount balance before reamortizing, in determining the new repayment schedule.(5) If after 2 consecutive years of being on a moratorium a borrower isstill unable to resume making scheduled payments, even if the account werereamortized, all authorized interest credit were granted, and interestaccrued during the moratorium were cancelled, the account must be liquidated.(h) <T3>Cancellation</T3>. A moratorium may be cancelled at any time duringthe moratorium period if FmHA determines that the reason for the moratoriumno longer exists or the borrower is no longer living in the property (unlessthe property is uninhabitable). (i) <T3>Interest accrual</T3>. Interest will accrue during the moratorium atthe rate shown on the promissory note as modified by any interest creditagreement in effect. Interest credit will be granted and renewed throughoutthe period a moratorium is in effect for borrowers eligible for interestcredit. (j) [Reserved] (k) <T3>Appeal rights</T3>. The borrowers will be advised in writing of theright to appeal when a moratorium request is denied, a moratorium is cancelled,or the interest accrued during the moratorium is not cancelled unless oneof more of the following applies: (1) The request of cancellation was based on loss of income and the reductiondid not equal at least 30 percent of the borrower's confirmed income. (2) The moratorium terminated because it was in effect for a total of 2years.(3) The accrued interest was not cancelled because the borrower's paymentsafter the moratorium did not exceed 20 percent of income.(4) The borrower failed to provide information requested during the annualreview period.(l) <T3>Waiting period. </T3>There is no waiting period between moratoriumsprovided the condition on which the later moratorium is granted differsfrom the first one.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1951.314</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Reamortizations.</ITAG>Reamortizing section 502 and 504 RH loans extends loan payments to themaximum authorized repayment period, or rearranges the payments withinthe remaining years of the original repayment period.(a) <T3>Conditions. </T3>RH loan accounts may be reamortized under any of thefollowing circumstances:(1) When the borrower has made extra payments or refunded loan funds totalingat least 10 percent of the loan balance and the borrower concurs with thedecision to reamortize the account balance.(2) At the end of the moratorium period.(3) When an individual farmer program loan for real estate purposes ora section 502 or 504 RH loan is being made to a presently indebted section502 or 504 RH borrower, and FmHA determines the borrower cannot reasonablybe expected to meet installments due unless the account is reamortized.(4) When the loan was not scheduled for the maximum legal term at the timethe loan was made (e.g., a housing loan is scheduled for a 26 year term,although, the maximum legal term is 33 years) and the security life ofthe property is such that the term can be extended, the loan may be reamortizedfor the maximum legal term less the number of years the loan has been outstandingprovided FmHA determines the borrower's financial condition has changedand the borrower cannot reasonably be expected to meet the obligation unlessthe account is reamortized. Existing loans scheduled for a 33 year termcannot be extended for 38 years. Fees for title clearance and legal servicesneeded to assure the Government's lien priority is retained will be paidby the borrower or advanced by FmHA to be charged to the borrower's account.(5) When an unauthorized loan or unauthorized interest credit has beenserviced according to subpart M of part 1951 of this chapter, and the reversaland reapplication of payments have resulted in a delinquency which requiresmore than 2 years for the borrower to repay under an additional paymentagreement.(6) To initially establish a borrower on an escrow system when real estatetaxes for one or more years and/or an insurance premium for one year isadvanced by FmHA and the borrower is not able to repay the advance withinthe number of years represented by the taxes or insurance, as applicable.Nonprogram (NP) accounts will only be reamortized in this instance if theborrower is an owner/occupant. FmHA will pay the taxes and/or insuranceof an NP borrower who is an investor/nonoccupant only if the borrower isunwilling or unable to pay the taxes and/or insurance. If paid by FmHA,it will be charged to the loan account as an unamortized cost.(7) To bring a delinquent account current in cases where same-terms assumptionis authorized.(8) When a decision has been made under applicable farmer program regulationsto provide servicing benefits on the farmer program loan(s) of a borrowerwho also has an RH loan.(9) When reinstating an account which has been accelerated.(10) When an unsatisfied account balance is rescheduled after sale of securityproperty, as provided in andSection; 1965.127 of subpart C of part 1965 ofthis chapter.(b) <T3>Required actions. </T3>The borrower must sign a reamortization agreementform provided by FmHA to effect the reamortization.

Borrowers are required to pay the taxeson FmHA security property when they become due. Security instruments forFmHA loans provide that the borrower will escrow funds for the paymentof taxes if requested by FmHA. Existing borrowers required to escrow willbe notified by letter at least 90 days prior to initiating escrowing fortaxes. Only monthly payment borrowers or those annual borrowers convertedto monthly payment will be required to escrow. Failure to pay the taxesis a default of the loan covenants. In credit counseling or assisting programborrowers in budgeting or other financial planning, payment of taxes mustbe included. Borrowers who have not paid their taxes will be notified byFmHA. FmHA will not allow delinquent taxes to accumulate on the securityfor SFH Loans. Except as noted in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of thissection, FmHA will advance funds for the taxes as follows:(a) <T3>Foreclosure-pending cases_</T3>(1) <T3>Borrowers not required to escrow. </T3>Where State law permits, propertywill be sold at foreclosure sale subject to outstanding taxes. Where taxesmust be paid up to the foreclosure sale date, payment should be deferreduntil the date of the foreclosure sale is set unless the taxing authorityschedules a tax sale sooner. This permits a single advance to be processedand allows flexibility for a management decision if it is later determined,due to such considerations as high tax rate, length of time required toforeclose, and possible vandalism or other loss, there is no recovery tobe made. If a tax sale is scheduled while foreclosure is pending, FmHAwill either pay the taxes by voucher in accordance with paragraph (d) ofthis section or allow the property to be sold at the tax sale, as determinedto be in the Government's best interest.(2) <T3>Borrowers required to escrow for taxes. </T3>Taxes will continue tobe paid as outlined in paragraph (b) of this section until the propertyis acquired by FmHA.(b) <T3>Borrowers required to escrow for taxes. </T3>Taxes will be paid asthey become due from the borrower's escrow account. If a borrower's escrowaccount contains sufficient funds, all discounts will be taken advantageof when it is determined by FmHA to be in the financial interest of theborrower and the Government. If a borrower has insufficient funds in his/herescrow account to pay the taxes when due, the escrow servicer will requestthe borrower to pay an amount equal to the difference between the taxesdue and the escrow balance in a lump sum within 30 days after notification.If the borrower fails to remit the amount requested, the amount will beadvanced and charged to the borrower's account as a recoverable cost. Theamortization period for tax advances processed because of a shortage inescrow funds will be 1 year.(c) <T3>Nonprogram (NP) cases. </T3>As used in this subpart, NP refers onlyto NP loans for single family residential property. NP loans include creditsales from inventory on NP terms and assumptions of loans on NP terms.FmHA will not voucher for taxes on NP loans except to protect the Government'ssecurity interest. If a tax sale is scheduled, FmHA will pay the taxesand charge to the borrower's account.(d) <T3>Processing tax advances. </T3>When a borrower's taxes are to be paidby an escrow servicer, and advance will be drawn from FmHA to cover theescrow shortage. When a borrower's taxes are to be paid by FmHA, the advancewill be charged to the borrower's account. A tax advance will bear interestat the rate which is in effect on the initial loan or the lowest loan numberwithin the funds code still outstanding, and the amortization period ofthe tax advance will be the number of months for which the taxes are beingvouchered.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1965.106 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Subordination of FmHA lien.</ITAG>A borrower may request FmHA to subordinate its lien by written applicationon a form provided by FmHA.(a) <T3>Subordination of lien for purposes other than graduation/refinancing.</T3>Subordination of FmHA's lien to another lender may be granted subjectto the following provisions:(1) The funds obtained from the other lender will be used only for purposesfor which an RH loan could be made and subject to the same limitationsapplicable to RH loan funds.(2) The prior lien debt plus the FmHA debt will not exceed the market valueof the security. (For this purpose, the FmHA debt is the unpaid balanceon the loan exclusive of recapture of subsidy.)(3) The prior lien debt must be on terms and conditions which the borrowercan reasonably be expected to meet without jeopardizing repayment of theFmHA indebtedness.(4) Proposed development, if any, will be planned and performed in accordancewith subpart A of part 1924 of this chapter or directed by the other lenderin a manner which is consistent with that subpart.(5) The funds obtained from the other lender for development will be handledthrough a supervised bank account or under other arrangements approvedby FmHA which will assure the funds are used for the planned purposes.(6) An agreement must be obtained in writing from the prior lienholderproviding that at least 30 days advance notice will be given to FmHA beforeaction to foreclose on their prior lien is initiated.(b) <T3>Subordination of lien for recapture to enable a borrower to graduateor refinance. </T3>When a borrower can graduate to other credit pursuantto subpart F of part 1951 of this chapter, or is refinancing the FmHA debt(s),and elects not to pay recapture at that time, the FmHA lien may be subordinatedto secure the recapture receivable only.

However, FmHA consent is not required, and the existence of ajunior lien may not be treated as a default or used as justification forforced liquidation action. When junior liens exist, the FmHA loan willbe serviced in the usual manner as long as the borrower makes paymentsas scheduled, properly maintains the security, and meets other loan conditions.The existence of a junior lien will not prevent liquidation action if theborrower is in default. Should FmHA be approached by an existing or potentialjunior lienholder as to the amount of FmHA's debt, the unpaid balance onthe FmHA loan for this purpose will be stated as the sum of unpaid principaland interest and, if the loan is subject to recapture of subsidy, totalsubsidy granted and principal reduction attributed to subsidy. FmHA mayconsent to a junior lien and enter into an agreement to notify the juniorlienholder in the event FmHA initiates foreclosure only when:(a) The proposed loan is for purposes for which FmHA RH loan funds couldbe used or for business purposes to enhance earning capacity; and(b) Repayment of the FmHA loan will not be jeopardized.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1965.112</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Lease of security property.</ITAG>(a) When FmHA is aware a borrower has leased or proposed to lease securityproperty, the borrower will be informed in writing of the limitations onleasing outlined in this subsection.

FmHA will advise the borrower if there appears to be any equityin the property. The borrower will be encouraged to sell the property,paying FmHA in full and realizing the equity, if any.

After reaching agreement for voluntary liquidation,FmHA may allow the borrower 120 days to sell the property or otherwisearrange to pay FmHA in full, after which voluntary conveyance should beconsidered unless a transaction is pending which will likely result inpaying the loan in full.

Assumptionsunder paragraphs (b)(12) and (c)(2) of this section only are authorizedon existing terms without considering the assuming party's eligibilityfor program assistance. When security property is sold (or title is otherwiseconveyed), whether by full conveyance or by land contract-for-deed, orother similar instrument, and the FmHA account is not assumed by the purchaser(or new owner), the loan must be liquidated except as provided in paragraph(b)(12) of this section or andSection; 1965.116 of this subpart.(a) [Reserved](b) <T3>General.</T3> The following policies apply to all transfers and assumptionsunder this subpart:(1) <T3>Loan classification and/or changes.</T3> A loan may be assumed as outlinedin this subparagraph, after which the loan will be classified accordingto the terms on which it was assumed. Assumption on program terms is authorizedONLY when both the assuming party meets eligibility requirements AND theproperty is suited for the housing program.(2) [Reserved](3) <T3>Dwelling situated on more than a minumum-adequate site.</T3> If theproperty to be transferred with assumption consists of a dwelling on morethan a minimum-adequate site as defined in subpart A of part 1944 of thischapter, a determination must be made by FmHA as to whether the excessland can serve as a minimum-adequate site for another dwelling. It is notintended to exclude a property currently in the program from being transferredto a program applicant simply because it is situated on more than a minimum-adequatesite. If it is determined the excess property cannot be sold separatelyas a minimum-adequate site for another dwelling, the property may be retainedin the SFH program provided the entire property is modest in cost comparedto a similar house on a minimum-adequate site in the area. When all ofthe security property is not being transferred to the party assuming theFmHA debt and the balance of the FmHA debt is not paid in full when theassumption is closed, the remaining debt of the transferor will be reamortizedover a period not to exceed 10 years at the interest rate of the transferor'sloan(s) which remains outstanding. FmHA will retain its security positionon the portion of property retained by the transferor until the balancenot assumed is repaid.(4) <T3>Suitability of property for retention in program.</T3> (i) A singlefamily dwelling presently financed by FmHA may be transferred to a programapplicant on program terms provided it meets FmHA program requirementsand policies. These properties are not being brought into the RH programin the same sense as existing properties not already financed by FmHA.They are properties in which FmHA already has a long-term lending commitmentand security interest. Therefore, such properties may be retained in theprogram although they contain more square feet of living area and/or designfeatures which would not be permitted when making an initial loan for anexisting dwelling according to Subpart A of Part 1944 of this chapter.It must, however, be typical of modest homes in the area.(ii) In some instances, a property presently financed under the section502 RH program may not be suited for retention in the program. In thoseinstances, assumption may be on NP terms only, according to paragraph (d)of this section. Situations of this type include, but are not limited to,a dwelling which has been enlarged or improved to the point it is clearlyabove modest in size, design and/or cost; a dwelling which should not havebeen financed originally (as determined by FmHA); a dwelling brought intothe program as an existing dwelling which met program standards at thetime it was originally financed by FmHA, but which does not conform tocurrent policies. This includes older and/or larger houses of a type thathave been proven to create excessive energy and/or maintenance costs tovery-low and low-income borrowers; a dwelling which is obsolete due tolocation, design, construction or age.(5) <T3>Amount of assumption.</T3> Except for transfers covered in paragraphs(b)(12) and (c)(2) of this section, the transferee will assume the entireFmHA indebtedness unless the indebtedness plus prior liens exceeds the``as is'' market value of the property, in which case the transferee willassume an amount equal to the ``as is'' market value of the property, lessthe amount of prior liens, if any. In the situations outlined in paragraph(b)(12) or (c)(2) of this section, the amount of the debt will not be changed.When the buyer and seller have agreed upon transfer for ``amount of debt,''recapture of subsidy due based on ``as-is'' market value of the securityproperty must be calculated and included as part of the total indebtedness.(6) <T3>Recapture of subsidy.</T3> Recapture of subsidy in connection withassumptions will be as provided in subpart I of part 1951 of this chapter.(7) <T3>Consent of prior lienholder.</T3> If there is a prior lien and if requiredby security instruments or other agreement, written consent of the priorlienholder will be obtained before approval of a transfer with assumption.(8) <T3>Junior liens.</T3> When the full amount of the FmHA debt is assumed,there must be no liens, judgments, or other claims against the securitywhich are junior to the FmHA lien(s) being assumed unless FmHA has determinedthose liens will not adversely affect the Government's security interestand that the transferee's ability to repay the FmHA debt will not be impaired.When less than the full indebtedness is being assumed, there must be noliens against the security which are junior to the FmHA lien(s).(9) <T3>Loan in connection with assumption.</T3> A loan for which the assumingparty is eligible may be made according to subpart A of part 1944 of thischapter in connection with the assumption.(10) <T3>Withdrawal of jointly liable borrower.</T3> When a jointly liable borrowerwithdraws, such as in a divorce case, the remaining borrower will not executean assumption agreement. FmHA's accounting records will be changed to reflectthe name of the person with whom the account will be continued if the accountis not already in the name of that person.(11) <T3>Change in rural area designation. </T3>Where security property is locatedin an area which has been redesignated from rural to nonrural, a loan maybe assumed without considering the nonrural designation.(12) <T3>Conveyance of security property by borrower to spouse or child. </T3>Whena borrower conveys security property to his/her spouse or child (children),assumption of the indebtedness is not required and FmHA may not take actionto liquidate the loan as long as payments are made as scheduled and otherloan conditions are met. Interest credit may be granted only to a qualifiedborrower; therefore, if the house if not occupied by the borrower, interestcredit may not be granted. In the event the transferee(s) wishes to assumethe indebtedness, it may be assumed on the terms outlined in paragraph(c)(2)(i) of this section as applicable to the circumstances. The loanremains subject to the graduation requirements set forth in subpart F ofpart 1951 of this chapter.(13) <T3>Repairs. </T3>When a loan is to be assumed on program terms, repairsnecessary to bring the property to program standards will be accomplishedwith a subsequent loan in accordance with subpart A of part 1944 of thischapter, unless the transferee has sufficient funds to make the repairswith his/her own resources. In no case will FmHA suggest, encourage, orrequire that the transferor (seller) make necessary repairs as a conditionfor approving a transfer with assumption.(c) <T3>Assumption on program terms. </T3>A loan may be assumed on programterms when the transferee meets eligibility requirements in the loan makingregulation for the type loan involved, except that a Section 504 transfereemay have only an ownership interest in the property and must occupy thedwelling as his/her residence after the assumption is closed. Interestrates and amortization periods are as follows:(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(12) and (c)(2) of this section,the applicant may request the interest rate charged by FmHA to be the lowerof the rate in effect at either the time the assumption is approved orclosed. If the applicant does not indicate a choice, the assumption willbe closed at the rate in effect at the time of approval. Interest rateschange from time to time, and the current rate of interest will be quotedupon request by any FmHA office. The repayment period may be up to themaximum legal limit for the type loan involved. If the assuming party isto receive interest credit, the term must be at least 25 years and shouldbe the maximum legal limit.(2) In the situations outlined in paragraphs (b)(12) and (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii),and (c)(2)(iii) of this section only, the assuming party will execute anassumption agreement to assume the indebtedness on the existing terms;unless, due to more favorable terms available at the time, the assumingparty desires to assume the loan on new terms. If the assuming party desiresto assume the loan on new terms, all eligibility requirements of subpartA of part 1944 of this chapter must be met. If a same-terms assumptionis consummated, FmHA's accounting records will be changed to reflect thename and case number of the assuming party. Same-terms assumptions underthis paragraph are authorized without considering the assuming party'seligibility for program assistance. The interest rate, final due date,payment date, account status (current, delinquent, ahead of schedule) willnot be changed by virtue of the assumption. After assumption, compliancewith loan conditions is required. If a same-terms transfer is consummatedand the account is delinquent, it may be reamortized in accordance withsubpart G of part 1951 of this chapter. Eligibility for interest creditwill be considered or re-evaluated at the time of assumption. Situationswhere these terms are authorized are:(i) An individual who acquires title to or an interest in the securityproperty by virtue of death, divorce, or deed from a spouse or parent butis not liable for the debt and who wishes to assume the loan may do so.Any subsequent transfer of title, except between inheritors to consolidatetitle, will be treated as a sale and is not covered by these provisions.Individuals in this category are: A deceased borrower's surviving spouse,a divorced borrower's ex-spouse; a joint tenant with right of survivorshipor relative of a deceased borrower; or the spouse or child of a livingborrower to whom title to the security property has been conveyed by spouseor parent.(ii) A person other than the deceased borrower's spouse who wishes to continuewith the loan under conditions outlined in andSection; 1965.116(b) or (d)of this subpart may do so. In the type situation outlined in andSection;1965.116(d) of this subpart, interest credit may be considered based onthe income of only the occupants of the security property, whether or notthe assuming party is one of the occupants, if the loan is otherwise eligiblefor interest credit.(iii) A borrower's spouse, other relative or joint tenant who is not liablefor the debt and wishes to assume the debt with an existing borrower maydo so.(d) <T3>Assumption on NP terms. </T3>When a borrower sells or proposes to sellsecurity property and the purchaser does not meet the eligibility requirementsfor an RH loan, or the property is not suited for retention in the housingprogram, the debt may be assumed or NP terms if the assuming party hasrepayment ability, is creditworthy, and it is advantageous to the Governmentto allow the assumption. If the purchaser does not assume the debt, theloan must be liquidated. After assumption on NP terms, the loan will beclassified as a NP loan. The assumption agreement will bear interest atthe SFH-NP rate in effect on the date the assumption is approved. The termof the assumption may not exceed the period for which the property willserve as adequate security for the debt. A payment based on a percentageof the debt (including any subsidy due) or the current ``as is'' marketvalue of the property, whichever is lower, must be made at closing to reducethe amount assumed. This percentage and the interest rate change from timeto time, and the current percentage, based on whether or not the buyerintends the occupy the dwelling, and the current interest rate will bequoted upon request by any FmHA office. Other terms are as follows:(1) When the purchaser does not own an adequate home and intends to occupythe house, the term may be for a period not to exceed 30 years. The downpaymentrequired in such a case is lower than for a purchaser who does not intendto occupy the house.(2) When the purchaser does not meet the criteria in paragraph (d)(1) ofthis section, the amortization period will not be for more than 10 yearsunless FmHA determines more favorable terms are necessary to facilitatethe sale. The downpayment required in such a case is higher than for apurchaser who intends to occupy the house. (e) <T3>Processing and closing transfer with assumption. </T3>(1) [Reserved](2) [Reserved] (3) <T3>Title clearance and loan closing. </T3>Title clearance and closingof the assumption (and subsequent loan, if any) will be under part 1807of this chapter (FmHA Instruction 427.1) and subpart A of part 1944 ofthis chapter for a section 502 loan or subpart J of part 1944 of this chapterfor a section 504 loan. (4) <T3>Insurance. </T3>Fire/hazard insurance is required in accordance withsubpart A of part 1806 of this chapter (FmHA Instruction 426.1). Floodinsurance is required on any house located in an identified flood or mudslidehazard area where flood insurance is available. If the house was builtprior to implementation of the flood insurance program and flood insurancehas never been available or is no longer available, assumption on programor NP terms may be approved without flood insurance provided the houseis determined by FmHA to be safe (that is, any hazard that exists wouldnot likely endanger the safety of dwelling occupants). If not safe, orif water rises inside the living space of the house frequently, the propertywill be classified as NP and therefore subject to assumption on NP termsonly. If the house is located in an identified flood or mudslide hazardarea and flood insurance is not available when the assumption is approved,FmHA may approve the transaction subject to the requirement for havingflood insurance if it becomes available in the future. (5) <T3>Escrow Funds. </T3>Taxes will be prorated at the time the assumptionis closed. If the escrow account contains sufficient funds, the transferor'sprorated share will be paid or transferred to the transferee's escrow account.Any remaining escrow funds not needed at closing will be refunded to thetransferor. If there are insufficient funds escrowed to pay the transferor'sshare of the taxes, the shortage will be deducted from any proceeds payableto the transferor at closing; or if no funds are due the transferor, theamount needed may be vouchered and charged to the transferor's account.(f) <T3>Release from liability. </T3>Release from liability will be under andSection;1965.127 of this subpart when authorized. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1965.127 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Release from liability and servicing unsatisfied account balances.</ITAG>The policy on release or nonrelease from liability is as follows: (a) When the borrower's account is satisfied by assumption of the accountin full, the borrower (and co-signer, if any) will be released from liability.(b) A person who is jointly liable for a loan will be released from liabilityprovided: (1) A divorce decree of property settlement document did not make the withdrawingparty responsible for loan payments; (2) The withdrawing party's interest in the security is conveyed to theperson with whom the loan will be continued; and (3) The person with whom the loan will be continued has adequate repaymentability. (c) When the account is not satisfied by sale proceeds or assumption infull, the borrower (and co-signer, if any) will NOT be released from liability.If the financial statement of the borrower (or co-signer) indicate incomeor other assets from which collection could be made, one of the followingactions, as applicable, will be taken: (1) The borrower (and co-signer, if any) will be requested to establisha repayment schedule for the account balance by executing a reamortizationagreement bearing the same interest rate as the unsatisfied loan and scheduledfor repayment over a period determined by FmHA to be reasonable based uponthe income available, but not to exceed 5 years. (2) If the borrower (and/or co-signer, if any) is unable or unwilling tomake installment payments from income, the borrower's (and co-signer's)assets will be assessed to determine if collection could likely be madethrough a judgment.
