(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Leaders of the Assemblies of God saidtoday they have asked church officials in Louisiana to reconsider arecommended three-month suspension for fallen TV evangelist JimmySwaggart that hundreds of callers criticized as too lenient.   Twelve members of the church's highest governing board met for12 hours at the church's international headquarters in Springfieldtoday and Thursday to discuss the Louisiana District's proposedsanctions against Swaggart, who allegedly engaged in voyeurism witha prostitute.   Officials of Swaggart's home district recommended earlier thisweek that the fiery television evangelist, who confessed toundisclosed moral misconduct, be prohibited from preaching forthree months and undergo two years of rehabilitation and counseling.   The state recommendation was criticized by many church membersas too lenient, and the Executive Presbytery's move today was anindication the board disagreed with the state district'srecommendation.   Meanwhile, the companion of a prostitute who claims sheperformed pornographic acts for Swaggart for about a year said hewas negotiating to sell her story to the mass media.   ``This is a shot for me and a shot for her,'' said JohnMartinez, a carpet cleaner who said he met Debra Murphree, 28, inWest Palm Beach, Fla., about four months ago. ``It's the Americanway _ see an opportunity and jump on it.''   Martinez said he discussed a $100,000 contract to tell Ms.Murphree' story with the National Enquirer and also contactedPeople magazine, ABC-TV's Nightline and other media worldwide, ThePalm Beach Post reported Thursday.   Enquirer President and Editor Iain Calder confirmed the tabloidwas talking with Martinez, but would say nothing more.   At the end of the Assemblies of God meeting here, GeneralSuperintendent G. Raymond Carlson said, ``We will not discuss thecontent of our meeting.'' He said no final decision had beenreached on Swaggart's punishment and it could be several weeksuntil one is made.   The church constitution provides for the Louisiana District toreconsider the case and submit new recommendations to the churchheadquarters in Springfield, where the final decision will be made.   Carlson made the announcement with seven board members at hisside.   Juleen Turnage, a church spokeswoman, said the board metThursday with two representatives of the church's LouisianaDistrict _ Cecil Janway, general superintendent of the statedistrict and a member of the Swaggart Ministries Board, and ForrestHall, treasurer of the Louisiana District.   Swaggart, who was not at Thursday's meeting, has not made apublic appearance since Sunday, when he tearfully told hiscongregation in Baton Rouge, La., that he had committed anunspecified sin.   The evangelist, whose Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries gives $12million a year to the Assemblies of God, has been known for hisharsh denunciation of sexual lapses by other preachers, includingPTL ministry founder Jim Bakker.   The church's 13-member governing body was considering arecommendation by the Louisiana district that Swaggart be barredfrom preaching for three months and undergo counseling during asupervised two-year rehabilitation.   Mrs. Turnage said the international headquarters here has beenswamped with up to 300 calls an hour since Swaggart's televisedconfession Sunday. About half of the callers complained that theLouisiana recommendation was too lenient, she said, while otherswere generally supportive.   Mrs. Turnage said the two-year rehabilitation is standard, butin cases of moral misconduct on the part of ministers, ``theprecedent has always been that for that first year, the minister isbarred from preaching.''   Under the church constitution, if the Executive Presbyterydecides to toughen up the state district's recommendation, theywould send the case back to Louisiana for reconsideration.   The group had no statement after the meeting Thursday, but Mrs.Turnage said they may release a progress report after morediscussion today.   ``We cannot put time and expediency ahead of our constitutionalprocess,'' she said. ``I know that they are really carefullyconsidering everything.''   The church, the nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, hasbeen shaken by the Swaggart revelations and a sex-and-money scandalthat last year cost Bakker, another prominent Assemblies minister,his ministerial credentials. He had rejected the option ofundergoing rehabilitation.   Evangelist Marvin Gorman, who claimed Swaggart falsely accusedhim of adultery, for which he was defrocked by the denomination,reportedly gave the church photographs of Swaggart entering andleaving a motel room with a prostitute.   Ms. Murphree told WVUE-TV of New Orleans Wednesday that she metwith Swaggart for about a year at various motels between NewOrleans and Baton Rouge to perform pornographic acts, but did nothave sexual intercourse with him.   Ms. Murphree has an arrest record in Louisiana and Florida forprostitution-related offenses. She also is wanted on a drug chargein Nashville, Tenn., according to police records.</TEXT></DOC>
