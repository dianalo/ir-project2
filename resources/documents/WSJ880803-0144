The system is peculiar indeed. Where else can increases masquerade as &quot;cuts&quot;?    As used in Washington, the word &quot;cut&quot; does not mean a reduction from last year's level; instead, it means a reduction from spending as projected under a &quot;baseline.&quot; This baseline includes future spending and receipts under current laws, even though the amounts may be far above the preceding year's. The baseline increases all programs above the previous year's level by varying inflation indexes -- even though many programs do not automatically include increases for inflation.    Thus, over the past several years federal civilian workers have received an average annual pay increase of about 3%. Yet, billions of dollars in deficit reductions have been claimed from &quot;cutting&quot; federal pay. The reason is the rate of increase was smaller than that projected in the baseline. Thus, giving employees a 4% pay increase can be said to &quot;cut&quot; spending by $9 billion over three years, as Congress claimed in its budget resolution for fiscal 1983.    Or, Congress can plan to spend $8 billion more on defense than it spent in 1985 and claim in its 1986 budget resolution that it has &quot;cut&quot; $22 billion, since the projected increase was $30 billion. Further, as it did last year, Congress can claim nearly $2 billion in savings over two years from limiting the increase in reimbursements to hospitals, even though it gave hospitals on average a higher increase than in past years.    If taxes are enacted, to be implemented five years hence, when the year of the increase arrives the new taxes do not count as tax increases -- because they are already in the baseline. In last year's budget summit, for example, the tax increase was said to be modest, amounting to $17 billion for fiscal 1989 and growing to $19 billion by 1991. The actual tax increase, however, including taxes that were enacted several years before implementation, will total $32 billion in 1989 and $54 billion (about 1% of projected gross national product) in 1991.    Such already-legislated increases are one of the reasons receipts are approaching the record levels as a percentage of GNP that they hit before the Reagan tax package of 1981. From 1950 to 1975, federal government receipts as a percentage of GNP averaged about 18% a year. By 1981, they reached a record 20.1%. By 1991, the additional $54 billion in receipts will cause projected receipts to climb to 19.5%. Since World War II, only in fiscal years 1969, 1981 and 1982 have receipts exceeded 19.5% of GNP.    The baseline also counts a program as &quot;cut&quot; if a policy designed to hold down costs expires and then is extended. This device has been used with increasing frequency, and will be important for next year's budget deliberations. Any budget-cutting program will almost certainly include Medicare. For fiscal 1990 and 1991, Medicare can claim about $6 billion in reductions simply by extending current policies. Although some of these policies are controversial, and would not be easy to extend in Congress, the point remains that a very large amount of budget &quot;savings&quot; can be achieved just by forcing Medicare policies to stay the same. (Other areas of the budget have been treated similarly, including expiring taxes.)    According to the baseline's peculiar logic, increases in programs not implemented until years after passage escape from counting as increases because, by the time the increases actually occur, they are already in the baseline. Last year, for example, Medicaid and income support programs were expanded by $3.6 billion over five years, according to estimates of the Department of Health and Human Services. These expansions were not prohibited by the budget summit agreement, in part because they did not significantly affect 1988 and 1989 spending, nor were specific offsetting reductions required elsewhere.    The potential size of such expansions is usually not revealed in budget estimates of the expansions' initial years. For example, two-thirds of the Medicaid and income support increase will occur in 1991 and 1992. Two reasons explain such a pattern. First, expansions take time to be implemented. Second, they often are written so that full implementation is delayed for several years.    Each year Congress funds new spending initiatives, which can dramatically increase outlays above previous levels, paying for them, if at all, by &quot;cuts&quot; from the baseline. In this way, soft savings offset hard increases.    Savings estimates often are unreliable. Consider physicians' expenditures under Medicare. During the 1983 budget deliberations, physician baseline outlays were projected to double from 1982 to 1987, even though inflation over the period was projected to be only 27%. From 1982 to 1987, numerous &quot;cuts&quot; were enacted. Estimates of savings at the time of enactment exceeded $6 billion, with more than $2 billion in 1987 alone. Although inflation over the period was less than expected and billions had been &quot;cut,&quot; physician spending for 1987 exceeded the projection made at the beginning of fiscal 1982. Thus, despite the large amount of claimed savings, and despite inflation only about 60% as high as projected, actual spending was higher than the baseline assumed.    Moreover, there is another problem -- pure gimmickry. One frequent example is pushing outlays into the year preceding or following the budget year. For example, more than $1 billion of the reduction for Medicare claimed in the budget summit was simply a payment shift, caused by delaying hospital payments from the last few days of one fiscal year into the first few days of the next. Further, $1.4 billion of the claimed receipt increase was accomplished merely by speeding up tax collections, and $400 million was &quot;cut&quot; from postal spending by placing money in escrow for a year.    What can be done? We should scrap the baseline system. The budget debate should be over the levels of receipts, outlays and deficits proposed in various alternatives, not over the magnitude of manipulated cuts from inflated projections. By making it easier to understand the impact of spending and tax decisions on the deficit, abolition of the baseline system would undermine the ability of politicians to claim victories in numerous deficit battles while losing the war.    ---   Mr. Muris is a professor of law at George Mason University. </TEXT></DOC>
