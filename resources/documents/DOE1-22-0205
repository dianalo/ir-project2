A computationalmodel is developed to represent adequately the neutron yield from JETplasmas heated by neutral beam injection. This neutral beam model, augmentedby a simple plasma model, is then used to determine the neutron yieldsand fusion Q-values anticipated for different heating schemes in futureoperation of JET with tritium. The relative importance of beam-thermaland thermal-thermal reactions is pointed out and the dependence of theresults on, for example, plasma density, temperature, energy confinementand purity is shown. Full 1 1/2-D transport code calculations, basedon models developed for ohmic, ICRF and NBI heated JET discharges, areused also to provide a power scan for JET operation in tritium in thelow density, high ion temperature regime. The results are shown to bein good agreement with the estimates made using the simple plasma modeland indicate that, based on present knowledge, a fusion Q-value in theplasma centre above unity should be achieved in JET.</TEXT></DOC>
