But questions from the bench during two hours of arguments incases from Missouri and Kentucky suggested the justices doubt thatany clear consensus exists.   The high court is to decide by July whether imposing the deathpenalty on murderers who committed their crimes before reaching theage of 18 represents the ``cruel and unusual punishment'' banned bythe Constitution's Eighth Amendment.   In the Missouri case, Heath Wilkins was condemned for a murderhe committed when he was 16. In the Kentucky case, Kevin Stanfordwas sentenced to death for a killing he committed when he was 17.   The court's decision will affect only 31 of the more than 2,200death row inmates nationwide. Anti-capital punishment forcesnevertheless are attaching enormous importance to the issue.   The justices were told that of the 36 states with capitalpunishment laws, only 12 ban the death penalty for killers who wereunder 18 when they committed their crimes.   Noting the lack of unanimity among state legislatures, ChiefJustice William H. Rehnquist asked, ``Why should we set the brightline at 18?''   Ms. McKerrow, a lawyer from Columbia, Mo., answered that 18 ``isthe age most commonly chosen for demarking the separation betweenchildhood and adulthood.''   She noted that 80 Missouri laws treat individuals under 18differently from those over 18 _ including a law that barsjuveniles from witnessing executions.   Ms. McKerrow also noted that the American Bar Association andthe National Council of Juvenile Court Judges have supportedbanning capital punishment for juvenile killers.   Frank Heft Jr., a Louisville lawyer, argued for Stanford thatpeople under 18 are ``children who have not evolved into adults''and who ``have a tremendous capacity for change.''   The issue is not whether a line should be drawn but where todraw the line,'' Heft contended.   Lawyers for Missouri and Kentucky urged the justices to leaveany line-drawing to state legislatures.   ``What is a national consensus?'' asked Missouri AssistantAttorney General John Morris III.   He said the fact that Wilkins, the convicted Missouri killer,could have been condemned in 22 states despite his age``demonstrates an absence of a national consensus'' regarding aminimum age for executions.   Morris did not explain the apparent conflict between his use ofthe 22-state figure and the fact that 24 of the 36 states withdeath penalty laws do not exempt those under 18.   Kentucky Attorney General Frederic Cowan said state legislaturesmay choose to exempt juveniles from the death penalty as a matterof mercy, but argued, ``The Constitution is an instrument ofjustice, not an instrument of mercy.''   He added, ``Common sense dictates that youths mature atdifferent rates.''   The high court effectively drew the allowable capital-punishmentline at age 16 last year when it voted 5-3 to throw out the deathpenalty of an Oklahoma killer who committed his crime when he was15.   Four members of the court _ Justices William J. Brennan,Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens _ saidin that decision that the death penalty is unconstitutional forthose younger than 16.   Three _ Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia_ said that the Constitution does not set such age limits.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who asked only two neutralquestions Monday, provided a fifth vote last year but stopped shortof calling for the abolition of capital punishment for killersunder 16.   She will provide a key vote in the Missouri and Kentucky cases.So, too, will Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court inFebruary 1988, too late to participate in the Oklahoma case.   Kennedy asked numerous questions Monday, some of which focusedon a jury's ability to take a defendant's youth into account evenif the death penalty is a possibility.   The cases are Wilkins vs. Missouri, 87-6026, and Heft vs. Cowan,87-5765.</TEXT></DOC>
