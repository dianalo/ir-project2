<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-41-1124 </DOCNO><TEXT>Shale oil from the upper and lower units of the Duaringa deposit at Duaringa,Queensland, was chemically separated into 23 fractions and analysed byg.c-m.s. Over 700 compounds were identified, including homologous seriesof linear alkanes, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-methylalkanes, isoprenoid hydrocarbons,alkylcyclopentanes, alkylcyclohexanes, 1-,2-,3- and 4-alkenes, alkylcyclohexenes,alkylcyclopentenes, linear dienes, alkylbenzenes, alkylmethylbenzenes,alkyldimethylbenzenes, alkyltrimethylbenzenes, alkylindans, alkylnaphthalenes,nitriles, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-alkanones. Substituted cyclopentanes, cyclohexanes,benzenes, naphthalenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, carboxylicacids, pyridines, dihydroindoles, quinolines and tetrahydroquinolineswere also identified. The oils were highly aliphatic (H/C-1.67-1.75),with alkanes (24-29%), alkenes (13-14%), aromatic hydrocarbons (23-25%),alkadienes (2.5%), nitriles(1-1.5%) and alkanones (0.6%) being the mostabundant volatile components of the neutral fraction of the oils. Thetwo oils were very similar, but some differences suggested that the mineralmatrix of the upper unit was more active in promoting secondary pyrolyticreactions. As measured by retort oil composition, the lower unit (depthandgt;1000 m) was no more mature than the upper unit. A simple experimentalprocedure based on solution density was used for rapid quantitation ofthe neutral oil fraction without loss of volatiles. 22 refs., 4 figs.,2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
