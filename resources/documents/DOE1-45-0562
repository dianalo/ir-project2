Testswere conducted on OEM 4-cylinder engine running at different conditionsof equivalence ratio and spark timing. Fuel blends with different percentagesof alcohol content and different ratios of methanol to ethanol in thealcohol mixture were tested. Results of this investigation indicatedthat the presence of either or both of the alcohols in fuel blends significantlyreduced the concentration of carbon monoxide in the exhaust emissions(up to 40-50% compared to pure gasoline only) with methanol slightlymore effective than ethanol. Hydrocarbon emissions were also decreasedby increasing the alcohol content of the fuel with minimum hydrocarbonproduction occurring at 10% alcohol-gasoline blends in conjunction withnear stoichiometric air-fuel ratios. However, aldehyde emissions werefound to be markedly higher with alcohol-gasoline blends. The ten percentalcohol-gasoline blends were found to produce about 50% more aldehydeemissions than pure gasoline.</TEXT></DOC>
