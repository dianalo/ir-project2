The two radio-isotope thermo-electric generators, or RTGs, willpower the Galileo probe on its trip across the solar system. Someanti-nuclear groups claim the nuclear material could pose a healthhazard if released during a shuttle accident.   ``The chances are so remote it's not worth worrying about,''Atlantis commander Don Williams said Wednesday.   Williams and Atlantis' four other astronauts discussed themission during individual interviews and at a final preflight pressconference. The crew will spend the next month training for themission, scheduled to begin Oct. 12.   ``There's a certain amount of risk involved in anything you dothese days,'' Williams said. ``(But) I'm satisfied in my mind ...that we've done the best possible job we can to make these things assafe as we possibly can.''   Atlantis' other astronauts agreed.   ``I don't see how it can hurt anyone unless it hits him on thehead, and that's pretty remote,'' said pilot Mike McCulley.   The other crew members are Franklin Chang-Diaz, Ellen Baker andShannon Lucid _ all mission specialists. Baker and McCulley arespace rookies.   Each of the 122-pound RTGs contain about 24 pounds of highlytoxic plutonium-238 dioxide. The heat released by the plutonium'sdecay is converted into electricity by instruments calledthermocouples.   The astronauts noted that the nuclear generators are the onlyknown devices that can power a spacecraft going deep into the solarsystem far from the sun.   Voyager 2, which last month relayed stunning photos from Neptune,is powered by similar RTGs.   ``If we want to explore the outer parts of the solar system, wedon't have a choice right now,'' Mrs. Baker said. ``Voyager wouldn'tbe where it is today and we wouldn't have gotten those beautifulpictures of Neptune back had it not been for the three RTGs thathave powered Voyager so well for the last 12 years.''   The United States has launched 22 nuclear-powered spacecraftsince 1961, with all the plutonium packages encased in superhardened material designed to survive the worst possible fire orexplosive conditions. None resulted in the release of radioactiverelease, even though one package was aboard a rocket that explodedand two survived flaming re-entries through Earth's atmosphere afteraccidents.   But some anti-nuclear and environmental groups have protested theuse of plutonium aboard Atlantis, citing the 1986 Challengerexplosion as an example of how things can go wrong. They contend asimilar explosion could result in radioactive contamination of theCape Canaveral, Fla., area.   The White House has to approve the mission because of the nuclearmaterial aboard, and an announcement is expected soon. If themission is approved, opposition groups said they would seek a courtorder to block the liftoff.   NASA said an exhaustive post-Challenger safety review indicatesthat the chances of a launch accident in which substantialquantities of plutonium, pulverized to breathable form, could bereleased is about 1-in-2,700. And even then, NASA said, anycontamination would be minor.   Once deployed, Galileo will embark on a six-year journey toJupiter where it will fire a scientific probe into the Jovianatmosphere and orbit the planet for 22 months of extensiveexploration.   ``It's just very exciting,'' Lucid said. ``It's important for usto learn. It's important for us to know about our solar system. It'simportant to learn about the universe we're in.''</TEXT></DOC>
