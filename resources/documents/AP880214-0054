The new atmosphere is due in large part to what one U.S.official called the ``excellent personal working relationship''between the two leaders, who have met six times over the past fiveyears.   ``On the basis of personal friendship ... we have reviewedmatters of interest ... overcoming delicate matters,'' de la Madridsaid in welcoming Reagan to this Pacific coastal resort Saturday.   The two chief executives, accompanied by high-ranking officialsof their administrations, met for four hours Saturday to discussissues of common concern, including trade, narcotics traffickingand Central American policy.   It was the last officially scheduled meeting between the twopresidents. De la Madrid ends his six-year term on Nov. 30, andReagan leaves his post in January.   Unlike some of his predecessors, de la Madrid has avoided openconfrontations with the U.S. government over foreign policy.Instead, he tends to stress the positive.   De la Madrid has been a tempering influence among Latin Americanleaders under domestic pressure to declare moratoriums on theirenormous foreign debts, much of which is owed to American banks.   In turn, the U.S. government has been instrumental in gettingU.S. banks to agree to refinance portions of Mexico's enormousforeign debt of $105 billion, and to lend this country the money itbadly needs for development.   Mexico has drawn praise from the United States for drasticallylowering its trade barriers and the United States has responded byopening up the U.S. market to Mexican textiles, leather goods andother products.   De la Madrid has strongly pushed the market-opening moves as away to help modernize the sickly Mexican economy and pull it out ofits lengthy economic crisis.   A perennial source of irritation had been the U.S. attitude thatMexico was not doing its best in the fight against illegal drugtrafficking because of official corruption.   But the Mexicans now have practically forced the United Statesto admit that there is corruption on both sides of the Rio Grandeand that the drug fight must be a joint effort.   Mexico is a large producer of marijuana and heroin for the U.S.market and a relay point for South American cocaine.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz stressed the importance ofthe anti-narcotics campaign, saying Colombia was an example of asituation where drug traffickers can become a powerful anddisruptive factor in a society.   Colombia's attorney general was assassinated recently by drugdealers, responsible for the deaths of numerous judges and othergovernment officials.   High-ranking Mexican officials have privately expressed the fearthat Mexico could become another Colombia.   But Shultz and Attorney General Edwin Meese avoided anyreferences to official Mexican corruption, a charge often made inthe past by U.S. officials at lower levels.   Mexico is waiting for the U.S. Congress to ratify the new MutualLegal Assistance Pact that would enable police agencies in bothcountries to exchange information to track down drug criminals onboth sides of the border.   Problems remain between the countries, but it is an indicationof the new relationship that the two neighbors can talk about themwithout sounding like a debate.   Reagan openly spoke of his support for the Nicaraguan Contrarebels, who are funded by the United States. That is a sore topicfor Mexico, which backs a political, not a military, solution tothe conflict in Nicaragua.   De la Madrid also urged the United States to eliminate anyfurther barriers to exports from Mexico and said U.S. immigrationlaws must take into account the rights of Mexican migrant workers.   ``In the past five years, we have demonstrated that we cancooperate to achieve creative, mutually beneficial solutions,''Reagan told de la Madrid. ``This is a valuable legacy that we leaveto our successors.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Eloy O.
