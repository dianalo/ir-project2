Bob Dole fought his GOP presidential rivals in the SouthDakota primary and Minnesota caucuses Tuesday as Vice PresidentGeorge Bush all but conceded defeat in advance. Massachusetts Gov.Michael Dukakis dueled Richard Gephardt and the rest of the packfor fresh momentum in the Democratic race.   The two states were billed as the gateway to Super Tuesday _ aMidwestern opportunity to demonstrate electoral strength before theMarch 8 festival of delegate-rich primaries and caucuses, mostly inSouthern and border states.   Dole was rated the heavy favorite in the South Dakota Republicanprimary as he bid to rebound from last week's drubbing in NewHampshire.   As the polls were closing, CBS News and ABC News projected thatDole would win the Republican primary in South Dakota. CBS saidBush and former television evangelist Pat Robertson in a tight racefor second place in the GOP race.   ABC also projected Gephardt as the winner in South Dakota. .   The Kansas senator also campaigned hard in Minnesota, butRobertson dreamed of an upset and Rep. Jack Kemp made an all-outeffort as well.   Bush, who finished third in the Iowa caucuses earlier thismonth, made little effort in the two neighboring Midwestern states.He spent little money in Minnesota and withdrew televisionadvertisements from South Dakota stations.   Democrat Dukakis, fresh from a triumph in the New Hampshireprimary, aimed for a convincing win in Minnesota as he bid todemonstrate that his candidacy has appeal outside New England. Iowacaucus winner Gephardt, Sen. Paul Simon and Jesse Jackson also viedfor support as they sought standing in the race before the primaryand caucus calendar turned South.   Dukakis and Gephardt each hoped for a win in a heated SouthDakota race. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. invested heavily in televisionadvertising, as well, hoping for a strong showing outside hisnative South in advance of Super Tuesday.   Simon, who once said he would quit the race if he failed toscore a victory in either state, stepped back from that standardlate last week and vowed to stay in the race no matter where hefinished.   Gary Hart, his comeback candidacy in tatters after poor finishesin Iowa and New Hampshire, campaigned hard in South Dakota.   For Hart, Gore, Jackson and Robertson, South Dakota posed afinancial test, as well. Each man finished with less than 10percent of the vote in New Hampshire, and a similar result in SouthDakota would deprive them of federal matching funds beginning in 30days. A candidate can requalify by gaining 20 percent of the votein a future primary.   The states offered a bewildering array of delegate selectionprovisions.   South Dakota's Democratic vote was a preferential poll designedto serve as an advisory opinion to a statewide caucus on March 12that will allocate 15 of the state's 19 delegates.   But Minnesota's Democrats began the selection of 78 of thestate's 87 delegates to the party's nominating convention inAtlanta in July.   South Dakota's Republican primary voters picked all 18 of thestate's delegates to the GOP nominating convention in New Orleansin August.   Minnesota's Republicans expressed their presidential preferencesthrough a straw vote and selected delegates to begin the process ofpicking 31 national convention delegates.
