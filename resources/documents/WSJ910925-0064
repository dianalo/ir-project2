The report, to be delivered this morning to the EPA, islikely to draw public criticism from unions and groups actingon behalf of asbestos victims for underplaying the danger ofasbestos in buildings.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;My overriding concern is that this report will convey thesense that asbestos in public buildings is not a bigproblem,&quot; says Philip Landrigan, chairman of the New Yorkstate task force on asbestos in buildings. Dr. Landrigancalled the report a &quot;whitewash&quot; when told of the executivesummary of its contents.   The report, however, is expected to please the real estateand asbestos industries, which have opposed attempts by twounions to compel the EPA to adopt stringent asbestosinspection and removal regulations such as the ones in placefor public schools.   The report was prepared by the Health EffectsInstitute-Asbestos Research, a nonprofit organization formedin 1990 to collect data on asbestos in commercial and publicbuildings. Half of its $4 million annual budget comes fromthe EPA and the other half is from asbestos manufacturers andthe insurance and real estate industries. A copy of theexecutive summary was made available by a person working withthe group.   It concludes that undisturbed asbestos-containingmaterials in buildings in good repair are unlikely to produceairborne asbestos concentrations any higher than the levelsfound outside. Moreover, removal of the material frombuildings, if done improperly, can increase airborneconcentrations to dangerous levels, it says.   The committee pointed out that asbestos-containingconstruction material, when damaged, could result in a healthhazard, but said that there was insufficient data todetermine its effect on building custodial and maintenanceworkers. More research was needed on this, it said.   Exposure to asbestos fibers, once used in many insulationand fire-resistant building products, has been linked to lungcancer and mesothelioma, a fatal malady of the lining of thechest and abdominal cavity.   The EPA, which declined to comment on the report prior toits release, has said that it would decide within 45 days ofreceiving the report whether it will consider adopting rulesfor all public and commercial buildings.   One member of the group issuing the report, WilliamNicholson of Manhattan's Sinai Medical Center, plans to issuea dissenting statement.   He is concerned &quot;that the report can be interpreted toimply that there is virtually no asbestos in buildings in theUnited States, and no reason to be concerned about it.&quot;   Most of the data on airborne asbestos levels used for thereport, he said, were collected in buildings that were not inuse when the testing occurred. But asbestos levels, he said,can be elevated by such routine daytime work as buildingmaintenance workers temporarily removing a section of ceilingtile.   The Service Employees International, which representsbuilding service and maintenance workers, and the AmericanFederation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, whichrepresents office workers, sued the EPA in 1988 after theagency denied a petition calling for it to consider issuingrules on commercial and public buildings. Since 1986, publicschools have been required to inspect for asbestos, notifyworkers of its existence, and develop a plan to manage therisk.   &quot;I think the real estate industry will get theacknowledgment from the EPA that there is no danger to thegeneral occupants of buildings,&quot; says Roger Morris, presidentof Entek Environmental andamp; Technical Services Inc., Troy, N.Y.,and one of the 17 members of the panel that issued thereport.   The unions have criticized the makeup of the panel, whichit says included eight members who have either acted asexpert witnesses, or been listed as such, in asbestos-relatedlitigation on behalf of manufacturers.</TEXT></DOC>
