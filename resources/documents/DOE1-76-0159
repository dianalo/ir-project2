In theFederal Republic of Germany a medium-sized highly industrialized nationwith a high population density, natural gas is sold on an energy marketof a size not surpassed in any other West European country. In fact,conditions in West Germany have a certain model character, as naturalgas is offered on a relatively liberal energy market. If subsidies tothe West German hard coal industry are disregarded, energy supply anddemand are controlled by the forces of the market. As domestic oil reservesare very small, West Geremany is highly dependent upon imported energy.Natural gas, which covers some l5% of primary energy demand, is alsolargely imported, mainly from West European sources. On the other hand,any comparison between the West German gas industry and the gas industriesin the Nordic countries will be of limited validity, because the marketfor gas in West Germany has advanced to a certain maturity. If the experiencemade during the development of the gas industry in West Germany is tobe helpful for the development of gas in the Nordic countries, the marketprice principle is the concept that should be transferred. It is essential,though, that project decisions are not exclusively taken in the lightof the price conditions at the time of the decision, but must accountfor likely developments during the life of the project. 11 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
