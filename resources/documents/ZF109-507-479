Lawrence Garrett III to answera 19-point memo outlining questionable actions the committee had uncovered.andO;Conyers suggested then that the Navy might consider debarring IBM.andM;The Navy has declined to take Conyers up on this suggestion.andP;  The reportacknowledged that IBM officials gave Navy acquisition officials advice onpreparing solicitations.andM;It said they did so at the request of the Navy.andP;  The report denied chargesmade at last year's hearings that IBM officials wrote specification language.andM;&quot;The DOD inspector general's office agreed with our analysis that suchassistance, however ill-advised, is not illegal,&quot; the report said.andO;&quot;Therefore, it does not furnish a basis to question IBM's presentresponsibility.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
