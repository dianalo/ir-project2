Friction escalated over the weekend, when Iraq refused toallow U.N. specialists to begin destroying equipment used inmanufacturing Scud missiles, a step the specialists werepreparing to take under terms of U.N. resolutions that endedlast year's war against Iraq.</LP><TEXT>   But U.S. officials said the mission to destroymissile-making equipment is just one of a series of U.N.missions to inspect and destroy military-related equipmentplanned this month that are likely to displease SaddamHussein and could produce more disputes. &quot;I think we're goingto go ahead and turn up the heat on inspections regardless oftheir reaction,&quot; said one U.S. official.   President Bush may have strong domestic as well asforeign-policy incentives for confronting Iraq in comingweeks. If Mr. Bush's political problems at home persist, hewill find it increasingly tempting to focus attention onIraq, if not through military action then at least by turningup the heat in the international debate over Saddam Hussein'sactions.   The situation may come to a head next week, when the U.N.Security Council is to meet with a high-level Iraqidelegation to explain its complaints about Iraq's behavior.If Iraq doesn't offer more cooperation then, the U.S. andother members of the Security Council are likely to takesteps to increase the pressure on Baghdad, perhaps byisolating it economically beyond existing sanctions.   And while one U.S. official insists the U.S. and itsallies don't have any &quot;appetite&quot; for military moves now, theyalso might begin considering steps for creating militarypressure.   There are moves short of direct military action that theU.S. and its allies could take to turn up the heat on SaddamHussein. For instance, they could again begin focusingattention on Iraq's treatment of its Kurds in the north, whohave been suffering under a months-long economic blockadeimposed by Baghdad in an effort to squelch unrest andinsurrection. Under one proposal being discussed informallyat the U.N., the Security Council would create a specialenvoy to investigate Saddam Hussein's treatment of Kurds inthe north and Shiite Muslims in the south of Iraq.   That, in turn, might lay the groundwork for a bigger andmore long-lasting U.N. presence in northern Iraq to aid theKurds, who are demanding autonomy from the Sunni Muslimgovernment of Saddam Hussein. And a bigger presence of U.N.relief workers might require an international militarypresence to protect them.   By further isolating Saddam Hussein and increasing theinternational humiliation of his regime, the administrationalso might hope to increase the odds that elements withinSaddam Hussein's own government will decide to end theircountry's predicament by rising up and overthrowing him. Suchan internal coup is what the administration would most liketo see develop in Iraq, and the administration already hasmade contingency plans to come to the aid of coup leaders ifthey get an insurrection rolling.   Tensions between Iraq and the U.N. began rising last week,when the U.N. team assigned to destroy Scud-making machinerywas forced to put off its plans because Iraq refused tocooperate. Iraq, which doesn't dispute that U.N. resolutionsrequire it to destroy Scud missiles themselves, argued thatthe equipment the U.N. targeted had uses other than Scudmissile production and could easily be converted to strictlycivilian use. As a result, Iraq argued that the equipmentshouldn't be destroyed.   Iraq sent a letter Friday to the Security Council. But bylate Friday, the 15-member council had rejected Baghdad'sarguments and warned of &quot;serious consequences&quot; if Iraqdoesn't cooperate.</TEXT></DOC>
