 Carol St. Denis all is well in the world of DefenseDepartment information systems development.andM;&quot;I've seen systems mismanaged, I've heard too many horror stories, I'vetalked to too many people,&quot; she will tell you in reply.andM;On the other hand, don't tell her changes are impossible.andM;&quot;The program manager and his staff can feel a pride of ownership in thesystem they're developing even though they end up giving it to someone else.andO;Once you have that pride of ownership established -- &quot;This is my system andI'm damned if it's gonna break on the person who ends up using it'--thenyou'll have a good system.&quot;andM;St.andP;  Denis is one of about 40 teachers at the Department of Defense ComputerInstitute (DODCI) in Washington, where Staff members are designing new waysto educate program managers of automated Information systems, DODCI, whereuntil recently lower level computer literacy courses were emphasized, hasbeen reorganized by DOD to serve a purpose similar to the Defense SystemsManagement College, where future weapons systems program managers areschooled in acquisitions issues.andM;St.andP;  Denis, an Air Force officer assigned as an instructor of life cyclemanagement, program planning and control at DODCI, said the management-levelcourses she and others now are designing represent a new awareness in DODthat computer systems cannot be treated like weapons systems.andP;  The newcourses will be targeted for program managers of systems costing $100 millionor more.andM;A Strategy of DetailsandM;Prototype weapons systems are developed by several vendors during acompetitive demonstration phase.andP;  Once DOD officials choose the bestprototype, the winning bidder manufactures the weapon.andP;  But AIS developmentis different, St. Dennis said.andM;&quot;Software development requires a broad strategy with a great deal of detailwhich is entirely unlike the production management process,&quot; she said.andO;&quot;You're not going to have the luxury of three different demonstration systemsto choose from.&quot;andM;Managers who understand this and other distinctions are in short supply, shesaid.andM;&quot;One of the biggest problems we have in developing information systems isthat you've got people in charge of the programs who are from a weaponsbackground and have no idea what an AIS is,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;In the past, there'sbeen no place for these people to get any formal education.&quot;andM;St.andP;  Denis' own education in life cycle management and other components ofinformation system development is both formal and practical.andP;  She holdsmasters degrees in computer science and computer resource management from theUniversity of Colorado and Webster University.andP;  From 1983 to 1985 shemonitored software requirements and database development on a $400 millionAir Force Space Command system.andM;In her life cycle class, she presents simulated information systems and thekey factors against which plans must be drawn for budget, the developmentschedule and quality standards.andM;St.andP;  Denis is a proponent of total quality management procudures in whichwork is broken into carefully segmented fractions which never drift beyondview of the entire system.andP;  Her students face a variety of &quot;consequences&quot; forthose matters they fail to take into account while planning their system.andM;'Waterfall Approach'andM;St.andP;  Denis said she advocates the General Accounting Office-endorsed&quot;waterfall development approach,&quot; which proposes that information systems bedeveloped a piece at a time.andP;  She believes the flaws that can hurt a programthe most are faulty functional requirements or technical solutions that are&quot;dreamed up&quot; without taking user needs into account.andP;  She said mission needsstatements ought to be user-generated.andM;&quot;I think the user has got to be involved from the very beginning to the veryend,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;I mean, he's not going to be the one doing the actualcoding, but he should be involved in looking at the result of each littlesection of code.andP;  We really need to have a prototyping phase in which theuser comes in and looks at a piece of the system on the screen and has achance to say, 'Yes, that's what I wanted' or 'No, this won't do what I needto do.'andM;&quot;Then, you'll run the system back to the technical people, they'll revise itaccording to what the user said, and you'll have a way of delivering what theuser said he needed in the first place.andP;  That way, you didn't waste moneyjust going off in a corner somewhere and developing a solution for a problemthat never existed.&quot;andM;St.andP;  Denis said she has seen mission need statements drawn up by technicalofficials that do not address real problems but amount only to &quot;a wish list.&quot;andO;She said such wishes -- particularly where advanced hardware systems areconcerned -- sometimes end up costing the government large amounts of money.andM;In her life cycle course she will stress that program managers not sacrificequality in order to meet budget or schedule pressures.andM;Quality FirstandM;&quot;I think in DOD we've had big problems with quality in the past,&quot; she said.andO;&quot;We had too many managers who were being graded only on how fast they got itout and how much they spent.andP;  But if you really care about quality -- and thepeople above you in the organization really care about it -- there are waysto make sure it isn't sacrificed.&quot;andM;St.andP;  Denis said a misconception of the program manager role is that it isprimarily a technical one.andM;&quot;You need to have some technical knowledge so that you can communicate withyour staff, but the PM really ought to come more from the functional side ofthings, where systems are actually used, than a programmer or a technicalperson would,&quot; she said.andM;A high degree of political and administrative savvy is expected of programmanagers, St. Denis said, as well as lower level operatives in the managementoffice.andP;  A cogent life cycle management plan and sharply defined workbreakdowns can pay day-to-day dividends, she said.andM;For instance, the crucial government-contractor relationship often ischaracterized by the fact that many government IRM officials must deal withformer superiors who have gone to work for the contractor.andM;&quot;A person who once had authority over you on a daily basis retires and issuddenly working for the contractor, and you might have to oppose thatperson.andP;  You need a lot of self-confidence and just can't go blathering intothe contractor's office with a lot of uniformed nonsense,&quot; she said.andM;&quot;You need a strong sense of the program and what your organization canrightfully expect of the contractor.andP;  You might have to be pushy sometimesand you might just have to keep pushing.andP;  You can't afford to bewishy-washy.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
