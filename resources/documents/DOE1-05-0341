The major goal was to develop an understanding of whatcomplement of detectors would provide the capability for a well-balancedphysics program at the SSC. Unlike earlier studies which had emphasizedindividual components such as tracking, calorimetry, etc., the intentionwas to focus on complete detectors. The particular detectors discussedin this paper are: the large solenoid detectors, the compact solenoiddetectors, the non-magnetic detectors, the dipole detectors and muondetectors. 10 refs., 6 figs., 2 tabs.
