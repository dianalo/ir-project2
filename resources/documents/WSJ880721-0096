Robert K. Heady, publisher of the North Palm Beach, Fla.-based interest-rate newsletter Bank Rate Monitor, said the bulk of the increases were in the short-term yields. His newsletter's ratio of yield increases to decreases was up to 40.5 to 1, from 16 to 1 last week.    Mr. Heady said this week's rise doesn't have the same &quot;upward force&quot; that CD yields typically have after a one-half-point rise in the prime, and he concludes that the prime rate increase was an &quot;overreaction&quot; by banks to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's &quot;vow to possibly raise rates to prevent inflation.&quot;    The Group of Seven nations' most recent conference in Canada &quot;set in motion a set of (yield) increases both in Europe and Japan,&quot; which should continue, Norberto Mehl, publisher of Banxquote Online, a New York-based information service, said. But, to say how far would be &quot;mere speculation,&quot; he added.    Banxquote said the average yield for 30-day retail CDs was unchanged at 6.14% yesterday from the week before. Retail, or individual savings CDs, are generally regarded as those with denominations under $50,000.    Yields for longer-term CDs were up across the board, according to Banxquote. The average six-month CD rose to 7.03% yesterday from 6.94% the week before. The average one-year CD yield, meantime, was up eight basis points, or eight one-hundredths of a point, to 7.39%. Longer term, the 2 1/2-year and five-year CD rates rose seven basis points and five basis points, respectively, to 7.58% and 8.13%.    The average yield for money-market accounts was 5.72%, according to Banxquote. Bank Rate Monitor found a two-basis-point rise to 5.79%.    These bank accounts compete with money market mutual funds, whose average seven-day compounded yield rose to 7.04% in the week ended Tuesday from 6.93% a week earlier, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. The average 30-day yield for these money funds rose to 6.92% from 6.86% and the average maturity of funds was unchanged at 35 days. </TEXT></DOC>
