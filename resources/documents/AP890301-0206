ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A retired general testified at Oliver North'strial Wednesday that he and North decided in 1985 ``to assume theworst'' _ that North's actions were covered by a law forbiddingofficial aid to the Nicaraguan Contras _ and to act accordingly.   Earlier in the day, however, Robert Owen testified that he mademany trips between Washington and Central America for North,carrying instructions from the presidential aide for how theguerrilla war was to be fought, and carrying maps and money.   Owen said North told him he acted with the knowledge and approvalof superiors. The courier testified at one point that North said hehad President Reagan's approval, but he said later that testimonywas wrong, that North never got more specific than ``superiors.''   Retired Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub, an ardent anti-communist whodirected spy activities in three wars, also testified he persuadedTaiwan and another Asian nation _ with North's knowledge _ to give$5 million each to the Nicaraguan Contras but the plan failed forlack of a required signal from the U.S. government.   At the time, the Reagan administration was under aCongress-imposed ban, the Boland Amendment, against helping therebels conducting a guerrilla war against the Nicaraguan government.The second Asian country was not identified.   Singlaub said he proposed to North in December 1984 to solicitfunds in the Far East from Singlaub's ``close personal friends athigh levels sympathetic to the cause.''   ``I explained that the policy of the United States was quiteclear, to support the Nicaraguan resistance, and that Congress'temporary action stopped us,'' he testified.   Singlaub, who will return to the witness stand Thursday, was thefourth witness in the trial which resumed despite serious,still-unresolved, national security issues that had halted testimonyfor nearly two days.   Defense lawyer Brendan Sullivan has renewed a motion to declarethat a federal law designed to protect state secrets from beingspilled in the courtroom is unconstitutional as applied to the Northcase. Sullivan also has asked that the 12 criminal charges againstNorth be thrown out.   On Wednesday, the government replied that the process of handlingclassified material in court ``is not, as North contends, a reasonto conclude that the trial is unworkable.''   While North's trial continues, one of the key figures who willtestify for the prosecution, former National Security Adviser RobertMcFarlane, is to be sentenced Friday by U.S. District Judge AubreyRobinson. He pleaded guilty a year ago to four misdemeanorsinvolving withholding information from Congress about North'sactivities.   North is accused of lying to Congress about his activities onbehalf of the Nicaraguan Contras _ activities in which both he andSinglaub were deeply involved _ in the 1984-1986 period when theBoland Amendment banned such aid.   ``I argued that it could not possibly apply to the office of thepresident,'' Singlaub said. North, then a Marine lieutenant colonel,was assigned to the president's National Security Council.   ``Colonel North said he agreed, but could not get consensus _some said it did apply some said it did not,'' Singlaub said. Theyagreed that ``the best thing was to assume the worst: that it didapply.''   Singlaub said they worked out an arrangement under which he wouldwork with rebel leader Adolfo Calero and keep North informed.   Owen, at one point in his testimony, said North told him thateverything he was doing was with the president's knowledge. But helater said he ``misspoke'' and that North only referred to ordersfrom superiors.   ``Colonel North never said anything about the president'sknowledge,'' Owen said under questioning by assistant prosecutorDavid Zornow.   Q. Did he ever tell you the president of the United States toldhim to lie?   A. No sir.   Q. Did he ever tell you the president of the United States toldhim to conceal what he was doing.   A. No sir.   Further, said Owen, North never invoked the names of the nationalsecurity advisers he worked under, McFarlane and Adm. JohnPoindexter.   North's defense is that he had authorization from superiors foreverything he did.   Owen also said he met with at least half a dozen CIA agents inCentral American countries to discuss supply efforts to the Contras.The agents were referred to in the courtroom by number.   Singlaub, testifying about his efforts to get foreign funds, saidhe was going to try a second time to get the Asian money for theContras, got assurance from then-Assistant Secretary of StateElliott Abrams that a signal would be given, then was telephoned byAbrams and told to call off the effort.   Singlaub also testified that in March 1985 he went to Hondurasand met with Nicaraguan rebel leaders and base commanders, andreturned to give North a priority list of items that Contracommander Enrique Bermudez suggested.   Calero put $5 million into an account in Europe and the weaponswere bought and arrived in Central America by ship in 1985, Singlaubsaid.   In August 1986, days before the House Intelligence Committee hada face-to-face meeting with North to ask about his activities,Singlaub said, he offered a new list of weapons' prices to North whotold him he was ``no longer in the business'' and to send them tothe CIA.   Singlaub said he wrote to CIA Director William Casey, his WorldWar II boss in the Office of Strategic Services _ the CIA'sforerunner _ and said the list ``was developed in conjunction with amember of the NSC who is knowledgeable of the urgent need'' of theContras.   Later he saw Casey ``who threatened to throw me out of his officeif I discussed the subject of Nicaragua in his presence. I told himI would keep North informed. ... He indicated that was the properplace.''</TEXT></DOC>
