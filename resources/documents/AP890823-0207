Wigton in front of hiscolleagues, he was shocked.   When he was charged on the basis of information supplied byKidder's former high-flying mergers specialist, Martin Siegel _ whoalready had confessed to insider trading with Ivan Boesky _ hethought: ``I can't believe that lying so-and-so.''   The government did believe Siegel, but 2{ years after thedramatic February 1987 arrest, prosecutors anounced they weredropping their insider trading investigation of Wigton and a Kiddercolleague.   Wigton, 59, a paunchy Wall Street veteran, said Tuesday he was``not bitter _ angry is a better word'' about the episode that endedwith the government essentially saying he did nothing wrong.   ``I'm not waiting for an apology. I don't think I'm going to getit,'' Wigton told a news conference. ``At this point I just want toput it all behind me.''   ``The human cost was very bad for the first five or six months,but with the support of my family and all my acquaintances andfriends, I just came to live with it, came to feel good about myinnocence,'' Wigton said.   He said that if he encountered Siegel, who turned federal witnessafter he was implicated by now-imprisoned speculator Boesky, today:``I think at this point I'd turn my back and walk away.''   The U.S. attorney's office last week ended its probe of Wigtonand Kidder co-worker Timothy Tabor. Former Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.arbitrager Robert Freeman, who also was arrested in the case, agreedto plead guilty to one felony.   Wigton, Tabor and Freeman were charged with violating securitieslaws by making illegal securities trades using non-publicinformation, otherwise called insider trading. In May 1987, theprosecutors voluntarily dropped the charges after a judge refusedthe government more pretrial preparation time.   Former U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, now a New York mayoralcandidate who has said the timing of the arrests was a mistake,indicated at the time that a new indictment would be brought. Itnever was.   ``To accuse somebody of a crime when all you have is theuncorrobrated word of one man who himself is in trouble ... was justa terrible injustice,'' said Wigton's attorney, Stanley Arkin.``Theysimply went on (Siegel's) word, and they went swiftly without agreat deal of thoughtfulness.   ``I think they had hoped their shock tactics would bring peoplearound to confessing and getting others,'' he said. ``Themisjudgment here was they had innocent people.''   Arkin said he would not pursue a wrongful arrest case on Wigton'sbehalf against the government because it would be ``a nearlyimpossible case to mount legally.''   Wigton began working on Wall Street in 1956 and rose to becomeKidder's head of arbitrage, the risky trading in the stocks oftakeover targets. He received investment advice from Siegel, thefirm's widely admired young mergers specialist.   The arbitrage department's performance soared after Wigton andTabor began receiving advice from Siegel, but Wigton said at no timedid he suspect Siegel was passing them inside information.   The U.S. attorney's office has said it is satisfied it believesSiegel told the truth. Arkin said prosecutors never told him whatSiegel said.   Wigton, who lives in the affluent suburb of Short Hills, N.J.,said he has not decided whether to return to Kidder, which has paidhis legal fees and a reduced salary since his arrest.   For now, Wigton said he's happy playing golf and relaxing anddoesn't miss the long hours on the trading desk. The mild-manneredWall Streeter said he celebrated his victory over the government ata champagne dinner with his wife and three children Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
