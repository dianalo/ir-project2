After learning that 40 of 152 illegal immigrants prosecuted recently had entered Japan on student visas, the Justice Ministry's immigration bureau raided four Japanese-language schools in the Tokyo area. The bureau says the schools kept the workers on class rosters so that the foreigners could renew their student visas.    Illegal alien workers can be deported, but there isn't any punishment under current law for those who hire them. The government is considering imposing penalties on hiring firms and schools and is tightening screening of student-visa applications. In Tokyo alone, there are more than 100 language institutes.    Illegal immigration has been encouraged by the sharp rise of the Japanese yen this year, which has made yen income increasingly valuable in the illegal workers' home currency. Many Asians working in Japan send part of their income home. The migration also has been accelerated by the end of the construction boom in the Middle Eastern oil-producing countries.    Also, the strengthened yen has meant that Japanese companies, especially small construction concerns and parts makers, have had to cut costs, giving them an incentive to import cheaper labor.    Masahiro Tsubouchi, of the Tokyo regional immigration bureau, says the government doesn't know how many foreigners work illegally in Japan. But he says the number of such workers is increasing sharply as the &quot;needs of those workers and companies mesh nicely.&quot;    The number of foreigners entering on student visas in 1986's first eight months rose about 80% from a year earlier, to 10,369. Those from Bangladesh jumped almost fivefold, while those from the Philippines increased almost threefold.    In principle, Tokyo doesn't allow foreigners to work in Japan unless their jobs can't be done by Japanese. Until now, except for a number of Filipinas and other Asian women working as entertainers, Japan has had few illegal immigrants. But the press recently played up an incident in which four Thai construction workers were killed in a traffic accident on their way home from a work site. Each of the workers was said to have been sending home $600 of his monthly income of $940, compared with an average monthly income in the Thai countryside of $60.    So far, illegal foreign workers aren't taken as a job threat by Japanese workers. But Japanese unemployment is at historically high levels because of the yen's strength, posing a knotty problem for the government. Many Japanese companies in such industries as steel and shipbuilding are cutting their labor forces.    Unemployment in Japan isn't on the scale of that in the U.S. and Europe -- it currently stands at 2.8% of the work force. But the rate reached a record 2.9% earlier this year and is believed likely to surpass 3% soon. </TEXT></DOC>
