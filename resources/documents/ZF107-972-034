(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Leaping Ahead In Software ProductivityandM;As technology life cycles go, fourth-generation programming languages havehad a good run.andP;  First conceived and developed in the late 1970s, theselanguages came to be relied on by many companies for important applicationsdevelopment work.andP;  They were faster and more efficient than earlier languagesand produced better code that was easier to maintain.andM;But as the 1980s unfolded with an emphasis on downsizing and cost-efficiency,companies embarking on the integration of their computing resources ranheadlong into a major shortcoming of these so-called high-level languages.andO;Many of these 4GLS, as they are called for short, have a technologicalbias--they are specific to a particular vendor's way of doing things.andO;Historically, for example, Software AG's Natural language operated only withcode from AG's Adabas database management system.andP;  Cincom Systems Inc.'sMantis ran only with its Total DBMS.andP;  Unisys Corp.'s Linc operated only onBurroughs Corp.'s large-scale systems.andP;  And IBM's Cross System Product (CSP)is married to IBM technology.andM;Now, however, IS organizations, impatient with their inability to use 4GLsacross differing computing architectures and software systems, are demandingsoftware flexibility, believing, in many cases, that the development ofcompetitive edge systems is at stake.andM;The Four-and-a-Half GenerationandM;Many top corporate executives find themselves caught between yesterday'stechnology and tomorrow's promises of newer technologies for the 1990s.andP;  Butthey need weapons to produce productivity today, and they want todifferentiate themselves from their competition.andP;  The answer is something ofa halfway house--a four-and-a-half generation of IS technology, whose chiefcharacteristic is portability across multivendor computer environments.andP;  This4-1/2 generation is more than the fourth generation but less than a fifthgeneration, which would be characterized by artificial intelligence andexpert system technologies.andM;As the &quot;half&quot; suggests, the new technologies are transcending many of theperceived limitations of the fourth-generation languages.andP;  The emerging 4-1/2generation features computer-aided software engineering (CASE) generatorsthat not only crank out COBOL and C code but also produce database designsand networking schemes.andP;  Aimed primarily at technologists, these 4-1/2GLssupport IBM's DB2 DBMS and Structured Query Language (SQL).andM;C.andP;  Herbert Emilson, president of the brokerage house Colonial Group Inc. ofBoston, is one company executive whose impatience for a weapon to fighttoday's battles led him to adopt some unconventional methods on his way intothe 4-1/2GL camp.andM;Colonial had been operating a mutual funds system via an IBM-based servicebureau.andP;  But Emilson wanted a system that would be under his direct control,a system in which he could introduce new features and functions to the mutualfunds market rapidly.andP;  He researched the software market to determine howsuch a system could be built, discovering in the process that the mutualfunds arena was characterized by what he calls &quot;10-year-old technology andstock answers.&quot;andM;Conventional wisdom told him to use an off-the-shelf package that wouldrequire customization--as well as the purchase of an IBM 3090 computer.andP;  Buthow, he wondered, could he get a competitive edge from a standard package?andO;Another acceptable answer was to develop a custom mutual funds program inCOBOL, which also required the purchase of an IBM mainframe and would haveresulted in a four-year development effort costing $20 million and employing30 full-time IS professionals.andP;  &quot;But I wasn't buying conventional wisdom,&quot;says Emilson.andP;  What he wanted was the unheard of--a custom solution for theprice of a package.andM;To achieve the unheard of, Emilson turned to a former business schoolprofessor, who brought in two associates.andP;  This group of three artisans,which later incorporated in Boston to form Pyburn Systems Inc., built thesystem called Colonial Transfer Agency System (CTRAN), in two years at a costof $2 million.andP;  The project, which involved writing 3 million lines of code,came in on time and under budget.andM;The artisans chose a software creation tool that doesn't appear to fit intoany existing industry category.andP;  The tool was Linc--the Unisys language thatstarted life running on Burroughs large-scale systems, later was ported toSperry Univac systems and since has been introduced to the UNIX world.andM;When the work on CTRAN got under way in 1987, Linc's capabilities werelimited to the Burroughs and Sperry camps.andP;  But, armed with the knowledgethat Unisys was committed to opening up Linc to other environments, Emilsonwent ahead and developed the mutual funds system on a Unisys A 12 processor.andO;CTRAN became operational earlier this year.andM;DATAMATION has learned that Linc has now been ported to run on large-scaleIBM computers and is running at Unisys' development center in Christchurch,New Zealand.andP;  A Unisys spokesman confirmed that it has provided the IBMcapability in Linc, but says the company has not yet formally announced thedevelopment.andM;CA's Plans for Builder/GeneratorandM;Linc's evolution is a clear example of how a high-level language can bedeveloped beyond the fourth generation.andP;  Another example is EnterpriseBuilder/Generator, developed by Cullinet Software Inc. of Westwood, Mass.,andO;which was recently acquired by Computer Associates International Inc. ofGarden City, N.Y.andM;Builder/Generator, a high-level specification language, is coupled with CASEgenerators, which, like Linc, spew out third-generation language code,database designs and networking protocols to create a new application.andP;  TheCullinet 4-1/2GL currently runs on Digital's VAX, supporting both thatcompany's Rdb relational DBMS and the popular Oracle DBMS.andP;  &quot;We have bigplans for this product,&quot; says Sanjay Kumar, CA's senior vice president ofplanning.andM;Kumar reveals that other environments will be supported by the 4-1/2GL overthe next two years.andP;  &quot;We have both IBM [mainframes and PCs] and UNIX [bothATandamp;T and IBM flavors] in our plans for this product.&quot;andM;As part of these plans, Kumar has customers like Sam Schneider in mind.andO;Schneider's company, Lifeline Systems Inc., also based in Boston, is one ofthe earliest users of Builder/Generator and the focus of a budding usergroup.andP;  Lifeline sells personal emergency response systems that can either beworn on the person or placed in homes and offices.andM;Schneider, like other buyers of 4-1/2-generation technology, says he chosethe tool to develop systems rapidly, embrace relational technology and shiftfrom a programming to a systems orientation.andM;The Evolution of Natural, MantisandM;Fourth-generation language pioneers Cincom Systems of Cincinnati and Reston,Va.-based Software AG of North America have also developed 4-1/2-generationtechnology for mainframe and minicomputer shops.andM;Cincom's Mantis originally ran with IBM's VSAM file management system andthen was offered with Cincom's Total DBMS.andP;  Mantis, which now supports avariety of operating and database systems in IBM, as well as othermanufacturers' environments, began supporting VAX/VMS in the mid-1980s.andO;Cincom has developed a prototype Mantis version for UNIX and is currentlyassessing the market potential for such a product, a company spokesman says.andM;Software AG has ported Natural, which originally worked only in IBM 370environments, to VAX/VMS, OS/2, Fujitsu Ltd.'s and Hitachi Ltd.'s MVS-likeoperating systems, Siemens AG's mainframe environement and the Wang VSfamily.andP;  Software AG is currently working on a version of Natural to run onUNIX.andP;  &quot;We intend to offer them [customers] the best of both worlds,&quot; saysRoel Pieper, executive vice president of product technology at Software AG.andO;&quot;They won't be locked into IBM.andP;  And they won't be excluded from IBM either.&quot;andM;Customers say that these tools being created by Cincom and Software AG arethe core of the &quot;virtual software&quot; platforms--software that can be portedacross multiple vendor environments without modification.andP;  Says Bob Davis,MIS manager at Boston Industrial Products in Brentwood, Tenn., a division ofDana Corp., &quot;Customers have IBM, DEC and UNIX and want to use the same toolsacross all three.andP;  It could be that the independent software vendors are ourbest shot at getting such tools.&quot;andM;Unleashing Hoards of PCsandM;Corporations not only have multiple vendors, mainframes and minis but hoardsof PCs, too.andP;  &quot;We need tools that run on our workstations and help us getbeyond the limits of synchronous networks of big hosts and slave terminals,&quot;says Matt Saikkonen, divisional vice president of development in Anaheim,Calif., for the Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.andM;Saikkonen's operational desires are shared by others.andP;  Like Colonial, thebrokerage house of First Boston Corp. in New York City wanted to build newbusiness-critical applications but was offered just old or promised solutionsby vendors.andP;  Unlike Colonial, First Boston decided to invent its own toolsand ended up involved in a development effort that reportedly took threeyears and cost $100 million.andP;  The result was High Productivity System (HPS),which sources say is a combination of high-level language and CASE generatorsthat, together, provide a cooperative-processing architecture.andP;  Developedusing IBM PS/2 workstations linked to a 3090, HPS currently runs across PS/2computers, Stratus Computer Inc. fault tolerant minicomputers and IBMmainframes.andP;  With HPS, First Boston produced a global trading system and aretail system.andM;Fellow New York City investment firms Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. Inc. and BearStearns andamp; Co. Inc. say they have beta tested HPS.andM;First Boston, meanwhile, has rewritten portions of IBM's LU 6.2 peer-to-peercommunications protocol to accommodate HPS and achieve acooperative-processing model for the company.andP;  In rewriting portions of 6.2,First Boston developed an object-oriented data repository that will supportthe use of PS/2 computers running Presentation Manager.andP;  (In its currentform, IBM's MVS/Repository, announced in September, does not support PS/2 andPresentation Manager.)andP;  First Boston had considered IBM's Cross SystemProduct (CSP), which is the 4GL for Systems Application Architecture, butrejected it, according to insiders at First Boston and HPS test sites.andM;Other IBM customers, such as United Airlines (through a technicalsubsidiary), have been rewriting portions of LU 6.2 to accommodate their ownhigh-level CASE tools and ATandamp;T's UNIX operating system.andP;  Others are creatingLU 6.2 interfaces to Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh computer.andP;  Althoughalive to the dangers of opening up its SAA to other vendors' offerings, IBMis anxious to find and market software tools and other products that canadvance the acceptance and implementation of its architecture.andM;Keeping CustomersandM;Each vendor marketing a 4-1/2-generation tool is seeking new ways to lock incustomers.andP;  The database management system was formerly the way to ensurecustomer loyalty but, as the DBMS engine becomes more of a commodity, thissituation is changing.andP;  Whatever loyalty there is today comes from acombination of consulting and systems integration.andM;Or increasingly, as in Emilson's case, customer loyalty can be maintained bycourting the top executive of the corporation.andP;  Many times, languagesuppliers will attempt to bypass the IS organization and align themselveswith consultants or academics who have ties to the executive suite.andP;  In fact,companies like Big Eight's Price Waterhouse are actively funding 4-1/2GLdevelopment to leverage their consulting strengths.andM;A year ago, Price Waterhouse bought a young Santa Monica, Calif., venturecalled Errico Technologies Inc., which has developed new tools that not onlyfeature a 4-1/2GL core for new applications development but also enablereverse engineering of existing COBOL applications, as well.andM;New Technologies PromisingandM;Also nearing completion at Errico is an object-oriented data repository,which allows clients to build applications from reusable components andbetter maintain these applications at a very high level.andP;  In addition, Erricois developing an audit facility to ensure compliance of applications to SAAspecifications.andP;  Sources at the company say an announcement is imminent.andM;Robert Cawley, Price Waterhouse's national director of marketing at itsconsulting division in Tampa, Fla., says that injecting such technology intothe marketplace is akin to offering the loom to cottage industries inpreindustrial times.andP;  &quot;Combine these tools with artisan programming,&quot; heargues, &quot;and you'll have a revolution.&quot;andM;He predicts nothing less than the inevitable decline of assembly lineprogramming.andP;  This, he feels, would mean not only a change in the nature ofwork for programmers but a change in the targeted buyer of the work higher upthe corporate ladder, as was the case at Colonial.andP;  &quot;Back in 1955, we had abunch of Ph.Ds programming in machine language and other, more articulate,Ph.Ds selling to the top of the corporation.andP;  In a sense we've come fullcircle, but on a much higher level,&quot; says Phil Pyburn, the academic entrustedwith the Colonial development.andP;  &quot;It was all new then.andP;  It's all new again.&quot;andM;Whether these changes come about depends now on a loosely connected group ofvendors with similar goals.andP;  In one respect, at least, we seem to bewitnessing a repeat of what happened when 4GLs emerged earlier this decade.andO;This new half generation holds much promise by allowing users to embracewider choices, but it, too, is going into the world without standards.andP;  Each4-1/2-generation environment is, at its most basic level, still a proprietaryhigh-level specification language, albeit one that provides machineindependence--but not independence from the vendor providing it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
