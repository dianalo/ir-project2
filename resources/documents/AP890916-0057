Earlier, shelling reportedly killed12 people and wounded 72.   ``There can be no solution to the Lebanese crisis by militarymeans,'' the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria,who make up the committee, said in a communique released in thosecountries.   Beirut radio stations interrupted programming to broadcastreports of the cease-fire call. There was no immediate comment fromLebanese leaders.   The committee, appointed by the Arab League in May to find asolution to Lebanon's crisis, called for an ``immediate andcomprehensive'' cease-fire.   Previous similar calls have failed to end the violence pittingSyrian troops and allied Moslem militias against the mainlyChristian troops of army Gen. Michel Aoun.   Fierce overnight shelling by Syrian and Christian gunners blewgaping holes in apartment buildings in Beirut's Moslem and Christiansectors.   Police reported 12 people were killed and 72 wounded, bringingthe casualties to 914 killed and 2,685 wounded since the clashesbroke out March 8.   The thuds of explosions accompanied by the whooshing sound ofrockets echoed across ravaged Beirut, and fires caused by theshelling blazed out of control through the night.   Each side blamed the other for the escalation in fighting.   A spokesman for Aoun's command, who refused to be furtheridentified, said the Syrians ``provoked the barrage Friday evening.It seems they know that the committee's decision will condemn themagain.''   The newspaper Ash-Sharq, which is close to the Syrian governmentof President Hafez Assad, blamed Aoun, charging that the MaroniteCatholic general ``wants to foil Arab efforts.''   By 7:30 a.m., the ferocious shelling subsided into intermittentexchanges of mortar rounds across the traditional front lines inBeirut, the wooded mountains southeast of the capital and theeastern mountain range.   ``Don't be pessimistic. The coming few hours will bring goodnews'' from the Arab League committee, the Moslem Voice of theNation radio repeatedly told listeners early in the day.   The pro-Syrian leftist daily paper As-Safir said the overnightshelling duel, which at its peak reached 42 shells per minute, was``the storm that preceded the quiet.''   The independent newspaper An-Nahar referred to the barrage as``the last showdown'' and said the Arab committee would issue a``binding cease-fire call.''   The committee, which met Wednesday and Thursday, said in itscommunique that a Lebanese security body to be headed by LakhdarIbrahimi, an Algerian who is the committee's delegate to Lebanon,would supervise the implementation of the cease-fire.   This body also would supervise ships ``when information isreceived by the committee that they are carrying arms and ammunitionto any party,'' the committee said.   As soon as the security body begins its work, blockades on portsshould be lifted and Beirut's airport should reopen, the committeesaid.   It called on all concerned states and those who supported thecommittee in its task ``to work by all means to halt the flow ofarms to any one in Lebanon.''   The committee invited the members of Lebanon's Parliament to meetto prepare and discuss a ``charter for national reconciliation'' onSept. 30.   The committee tried to arrange a settlement once before butannounced July 31 that it had failed, and it blamed Syria's refusalto withdraw from Lebanon.   Syria has 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab Leaguemandate to quell the civil war. Aoun charges the Syrians violatedthat mandate by siding with the Moslems and has vowed to fight untilthe Syrian troops leave.   The latest round of fighting broke out in March after Aounblockaded ports run by Syrian-allied militias. Syria responded byshelling the Christian enclave north of Beirut, home to about 1million Christians.   Syrian gunners also have shelled a 28-mile stretch of Lebanon'sMediterranean coast controlled by Christian forces north of Beirutto prevent Aoun from receiving shipments of weapons and ammunitionsent by Iraq, Syria's main Arab foe.</TEXT></DOC>
