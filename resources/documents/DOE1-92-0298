Othersdeveloped n-isopropyl-p-/sup 123/I-iodoamphetamine which has been studiedintensively the last few years. In a previous study the authors describedthe development of /sup 201/Tl-diethyldithiocarbamate. A pilot studyin rats proved its high brain uptake. /sup 201/Tl-DDC showed a considerablegreater brain uptake than /sup 201/Tl-chloride. The brain uptake in ratsof /sup 201/Tl-DDC was comparable to /sup 123/I-IMP as described in literature.For /sup 201/Tl-DDC 2.73% of the injected dose per gram wet tissue wasfound in the rat brain, while Winchell found 2.14% for /sup 123/I-IMP.The authors compared the results of administration of /sup 201/Tl-DDCand /sup 123/I-IMP in rabbits. They report on the kinetics of brain andlung uptake, the ratio of binding to gray versus white matter and thedistribution of both agents to the main organs of the body. Initial quantitativeautoradiographic results are presented. Some of the results obtainedin human volunteers with SPECT employing /sup 201/Tl-DDC are demonstrated.</TEXT></DOC>
