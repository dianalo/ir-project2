The company didn't disclose its asking price.    The company said the action would enable it to concentrate on its core businesses -- Bradlees Discount Department Store Co. and Stop andamp; Shop Supermarket Co. The company said it retained Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. to explore opportunities for the sale.    Asked if the company is currently in negotiations for the sale of Almys, a Stop andamp; Shop spokeswoman said, &quot;We have not identified a buyer for the entire chain, but we are in negotiations with someone for the two Rochester (N.Y.) area stores.&quot;    Stop andamp; Shop acquired Almys from Federal Street Investors Inc. of Boston in January 1985 for $22 million.    In a statement, Stop andamp; Shop said &quot;while sales momentum improved dramatically, Almys has not yet become profitable and the amount of future investment and effort necessary to realize Almys full potential would divert the company's focus from its primary businesses.&quot;    For the fiscal nine months ended Nov. 8, Almys had sales of $55.5 million.    Stop andamp; Shop, whose stock has repeatedly jumped on takeover rumors in recent months, announced last week that it plans to reduce costs by $10 million to $20 million by eliminating headquarters' jobs and consolidating office space.    The company said the planned sale of Almys isn't part of that cost-cutting plan. </TEXT></DOC>
