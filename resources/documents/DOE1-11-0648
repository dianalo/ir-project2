In our two cases, highdensity spots on delayed CT myelography were bilaterally localized withinthe spinal cord, and believed represent pathological changes of the spinalcord, such as collection of microcavities or cystic necrosis. In case1, the high density areas seemed to be localized in the anterior hornand corticospinal tract, and in case 2, they seemed to be localized inthe corticospinal tract. The patient in case 1 produced signs and symptomsresembling motor neurone disease and lesion could not be differentiatedfrom the latter. Delayed CT myelography showed that the cause of theupper limb amyotrophy was attributed to an anterior horn disorder andthat of pyramidal tract sign to a corticospinal tract disorder. Therefore,we could differentiate the lesion from motor neurone disease on delayedCT myelography in case 1. In conclusion, we emphasize that delayed CTmyelography can demonstrate the intramedullary pathological changes inthe cervical disc disease and is useful in distinguishing between cervicaldisc disease simulating motor neurone disease and the latter.</TEXT></DOC>
