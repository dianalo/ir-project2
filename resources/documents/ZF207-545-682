 Obviously we must understant whatinformation should be measured as well as how to measure it.andP;  And we shouldunderstand how metrics theories that are preached by the leading experts arebeing applied by ase customers.andP;  Finally, we are all very interested in theverdict: Has the promise paid off?andM;However, before we address the questions listed above, we might ask: Are Casecustomers measuring at all?andM;Jerry Grochow, vice president of corporate technology at American ManagementSystems, Inc. in Arlington, Va., reports, &quot;I have posed this question to over2,000 people and only about 1% to 2% know what their current level ofproductivity or quality is using any measure at all.&quot;andM;This view is substantiated by Greg Boone, president of Case Research Corp.,andO;Bellevue, Wash.andM;In a recent survey, Case users were asked: Does your organization have anongoing application development productivity measurement program?&quot;andM;The answers, based on a sample size of 196, were tabulated as follows: usedto  1% plan to  12% yes  13% no  74%andM;&quot;The answers were biased.andP;  The returners were already interested in Case andthus did not represent a random sample,&quot; Boone said.andM;But maybe the wrong questions were asked.andP;  Contrary to the current statisticsabout formal measurement programs, a productivity measurement consultantsuggests that most firms have informal measurement systems in place.andM;Yuan Liu, a senior partner at Software Management Technologies in Huntington,N.Y., says, &quot;There are basically three reasons people measure.andP;  They want tojustify an investment in software tools such as Case.andP;  They want to improveproductivity and then show it.andP;  They want to minimize the risk involved andunderstand that what will happen [is related to] what has happened.&quot;andM;Software Management Technologies specializes in setting up custom measurementprograms in business environments.andM;Some of the informal but highly useful metrics Liu encountered include timerecording data, status reports of problems, and logs from operations andsystems support groups.andP;  These methods may be far from perfect but can serveas a basis of historical data, Liu added.andM;Furthermore, he argues, &quot;there are no scientific ways to measure.andP;  This isnot a problem from a management point of view because good managers thrive onimperfect information, which they use daily for risk assessment and makingdecisions.&quot;andM;VIEW OF A METRICS GURUandM;Given that at least some Case customers are measuring, we must thenunderstand what is being measured.andM;Among the experts who have contributed to out knowledge of metrics is TomDurek, assistant project manager at TRW in Fairfax, Va.andP;  He is also assignedto teh Software Productivity Consortium in Reston, Va.andM;Durek states the shared sentiment of the experts when he says, &quot;We must firstdefine productivity, then we can measure it.&quot;andP;  To remove subjectivity, Dureknot only prpvides some basic terminology but even offers the followingequation as a definition: Productivity = Product Produced/Resources UsedandM;&quot;Product is usually defined as lines of code or function points and resourcesare generally person-months or dollars,&quot; he said.andM;One of the foremost leaders in the field of metrics in Capers Jones, chairmanof Software Productivity Researcg, Inc., Cambridge, Mass., and author of thebook Programming Productivity, published by McGraw Hill, 1986.andM;Although Jones basically supported Durek's definition of productivity, he hassome strong objections to using lines of code as a measure of the productproduced.andM;Measuring lines of code as a metric is &quot;not mathematically consistent andthere is zero correlation between the lines of code and productivity,&quot; Jonessaid.andP;  He considers their use of harmful mistake, which he compares to&quot;treating an illness with bleeding or operating without washing.&quot;andM;Jones assers, &quot;Measurement was not technically possible until functionpoints.&quot;andM;Although a preecise definition of a function point is as elusive as that ofproductivity itself, it is a measurement invented by Al Albrecht of IBM that&quot;counts&quot; the visible attributes of a system such as number of interfaces.andM;Since it emphasizes these visible attributes and deals with both thefunctional and data aspects of systems, function points have garnered thereputation of &quot;measuring productivity in user terms,&quot; observes Bob Pickford.andM;Pickford is no stranger to this measurement method; he has been activelyinvolved in their application as an ATandamp;T data processing support manager inPiscataway, N.J., as well as serving as president of the InternationalFunction Point User Group (Ifpug), Westerville, Ohio.andM;The promise of function points can be judged by the growth of Ifpug and theseriousness of its members.andP;  Pickford says the group is engaging in advancedconcepts, such as those of &quot;the subcommittee that is building a manual toshow a function point as an asset.&quot;andM;Because the cost of a function point can be calculated, &quot;an executive canlook at the installed base of systems as a dollar figure and determine itsworth to the company,&quot; Pickford said.andM;Jones has been collecting data about function points for more than a dozenyears.andP;  However, most of his information remains proprietary to corporateclients.andP;  He was able to share some national averages.andM;The function point method is the one most widely accepted by experts andprospective measurers.andP;  Most Case customers with measurement plans are basingtheir metrics on function points.andM;According to Pickford, &quot;At this time, ATandamp;T is committed to function points asa measure.&quot;andP;  As an indication, ATandamp;T's CIO William Garrett gave the keynotespeech at the 1989 Ifpug Conference.andM;AMS' Growchow also uses function points to measure his developers'productivity.andP;  &quot;We have put together an integrated Case software environmentthat includes other companies' software and our own product, LifecycleProductivity Systems.andM;&quot;Within three years, we experienced up to 50% improvement on selectedprojects.andP;  The improvement was not limited to one part of the life cycle, butwas across the entire project effort,&quot; Grochow said.andM;Another user of function points in practical applications in NormandBilodeau, departmetn chief for data administration and methodology, at HydroQuebec in Montreal.andM;Bilodeau's Case tools include the Developer, a product of Asyst Technologies,Inc., Naperville, Ill., and a fourth-generation languages product from OracleCorp., Belmont, Calif.andM;&quot;When we began our program in 1983, or productivity level was 4.5 days oerfunction point,&quot; Bilodeau said.andP;  &quot;Our current level of productivity is 2.7days per function point and while there are a number of factors thatcontributed to this increase, it is certainly partially due to our use of a4GL and the Developer.&quot;andM;However, if we examine other customers who are already measuring, the realityis that teh majority are not using function points as a metric.andP;  In fact, theway customers measure may be related to the type of Case tool they areutilizing.andM;For example, the customers interviewed were using generators tended tomeasure estimates against actuals, and all claimed a substantial reduction ofrequired resources.andM;Nicholas Anzano, a business systems analyst at Midland International TradeServices in New York, relates the following productivity improvement storyusing MicroStep, a product of Syscorp International in Austin, Texas.andP;  &quot;Wewere able to develop the system five times as fast with MicroStep as with atraditional metod.&quot;andM;He based his measurement on estimated vs.andP;  actual data, and believes it to bereasonably conservative since they were redesigning an existing system.andM;&quot;The first time through it took eight months, but with MicroStep it only tookfour weeks.&quot;andP;  Anzano continues, &quot;Less resources were used, and they werebusiness analysts not systems analysts and programmers.&quot;andM;A similar story was told by Bob Younger, vice president of the developmentcenter at Sovran Financial Corp. in Norfolk, Va.andP;  Sovran is using theApplication Productivity System (APS) from Sage Software, Inc., Rockville,Md.andM;Younger said, &quot;One year after implementation, for every line of Sage Cobolthere are six lines of vanilla Cobol.andP;  We were able to cut back on resources,and on one project we had a one-third reduction.&quot;andM;Younger's measurement method also employed estimation vs.andP;  actual.andP;  Hereports the project leader had been within 4% of his estimate on the previousproject.andP;  He said he estimated 11,000 hours of work on construction, but theactual effort was less than 9,000 hours.andM;The notion of using resources as an indication of improvement is not confinedto generator tools.andP;  Mark Filteau, vice president of information systems atBDM in Kettering, Ohio, uses Excelerator, a product from Index TechnologiesCorp., Cambridge, Mass.andM;Filteau uses this Case tool to implement some in-house developed internaltechniques, which he calls the &quot;software blueprint.&quot;andM;He says, &quot;In 1986 we had 260 people.andP;  By the end of 1988 we had 184 and wereproducing more.andP;  We are also getting better at estimating how long and howmany people.&quot;andM;David Henry, vice president of technology at BancA, Dallas, also usesExcelerator as well as Netron/Cap from Netron Inc., Toronto.andM;He said, &quot;We are measuring lines of code per man-month, but the real key forus is reusability.andP;  Our company started at 5,000 to 10,000 lines of code perman-month and leveled off at 50,000.andP;  We built a reusable code set and on ourcurrent application of 2 million lines of code, 200,000 are unique.&quot;andM;Henry also relates an increase in quality to the reusable code set.andP;  &quot;Therewere 4,500 projected bugs but the actual was 800 to 900 in the acceptancetest--all related to unique code, not the reused lines of code.&quot;andM;Netron touts the reusability of its Bassett-frame technology-based tools,originated by founder and research VP Paul Bassett.andM;THE QUALITY INDICATORandM;Henry is not the only Case customer who is primarily interested in quality asopposed to productivity.andM;Indeed, many successful Case implementations are reported to be due tocompany's commitment to quality, and thus it is not particularly surprisingthat when these people measure they measure quality.andM;Filteau's predominant metric is defects per thousand lines of code.andP;  Hereports, &quot;In 1986 the BDM test group had 11 defects per thousand lines ofcode and now they have 2.6.andM;&quot;The code in production which has 5,000 online users has .024 user problemreports per thousand lines of code per month, and this is one-third of whatit used to be.&quot;andP;  He adds, &quot;The cost per line of code has decreased due tohigher quality.&quot;andM;Although he does not attribute the improvement solely to Case, a similar gainin quality was reported by Bilodeau.andP;  He says, &quot;In the period from 1983-1985there were 3.2 abends per 100 jobs; in 1989 there were 1.5 abends per 100jobs.&quot;andM;Several firms use Cobol restructuring tools to gauge the quality of theircode.andP;  Mike Butler, section manager of the development center at BaxterHealthcare Corp., Deerfield, Ill., has used Inspector and Recoder, productsfrom Language Technology in Salem, Mass., to improve and control quality.andM;Baxter maintains a problem log.andP;  If the problem can be traced &quot;we measure thecost of people, time, and machine time,&quot; Butler said.andM;&quot;We prioritize which systems to restructure with Recoder, or we might decideto re-engineer it or replace it altogether,&quot; he said.andM;The quality efforts do not stop here.andP;  Butler said his firm is developing aplan which will not allow an enhancement or repair to enter productionwithout first running it through Inspector.andP;  &quot;We want to ensure that we areimproving the code, not decreasing quality by adding complexity and lack ofstructure.&quot;andM;Alan Walton, director of information systems at Dunlop Tire Corp., Buffalo,N.Y., made similar use of Pathvu and Retrofit, products of Peat MarwickAdvanced Technology in Chicago.andP;  The software products of Peat Marwick wereacquired by XA Systems, Los Gatos, Calif., in June.andP;  XA Systems plans tocontinue offering all the Peat Marwick products.andM;Walton began his effort early in 1985 when he determined that his company'sinformation systems situation was desperate.andP;  &quot;I decided that there was notime for rewrites and replacements then decided to re-engineer the systems toavoid respecification time, expense and resources.andP;  We used Pathvu foranalysis because it shows complexity and then re-engineered with Retrofit toremove complexity.andP;  By 1986 we were finished and we began selectivelyimproving code.&quot;andM;He reports the results were quite impressive: &quot;In 1984 there were 138 abendsper week, in 1985 there were 111, in 1986 there were 88, in 1987 there were38 and in 1988 there were 14.andP;  Since we finished [with] Retrofit, there hasnever been a week that was worse than the correspondin week the year before.&quot;andM;MAKING SURE THE CODE IS &quot;HOME&quot;andM;He also recalls, &quot;An unexpected side benefit was that the actual processingefficiency increased which saves dollars.andP;  We removed dead code and [thesystem] just process what they need to process.&quot;andM;Walton offers the following analogy.andP;  &quot;If a program is like a house with alot of rooms, the old code was knocking at doors of a lot of empty rooms.andO;The new code only goes to rooms that it needs to go to.&quot;andM;Retrofit was transparent to the end users so there was no massive reeducationprogram.andP;  &quot;They got their reports on time instead of waiting for abends to befixed.andP;  The application developers now do new development and genuineenhancements instead of fixing things, and the risk of error is muchdecreased.&quot;andM;Walton says, &quot;The challenge of fixing existing problems at the same time wedeveloped new systems would have been impossible without the Case tools.&quot;andM;When instituting something as ambitious as a corporate measurement plan, onemight expect some substantial obstacles.andM;Liu observes that one common problem can occur &quot;when the information is notreally required by management, and then quality deteriorates and measurementbecomes a senseless exercise.andP;  People may fudge the data just to getmanagement off their backs.&quot;andM;The second problem is what Liu refers to as &quot;islands of data.&quot;andP;  He says,&quot;Suppose you keep a log of problems and the time reporting system keeps trackof people's time.andP;  But you don't know how much time is spent on each problem.andO;The data is not linked.&quot;andM;He continues, &quot;The danger is that you may have detail and spend a lot of timegathering it, but if information is missing, it is an illusion of detail andyou will still only get measurement on a gross level.&quot;andM;Some of the problems with measurement are simply resistant to change ingeneral.andP;  Both Henry and Bilodeau reported that people had difficultyadjusting to the concept of reusability, which many customers believe will bethe ultimate payoff of Case.andM;Many companies, including ATandamp;T's Network Operations Group, are laying thegroundwork for measurement, but are slowed down by a lack of historical data.andM;Another example is Steve Prescott, an analyst at ALK Associates in Princeton,N.J.andP;  The company is using Silverrun, a product of Peat Marwick AdvancedTechnology in Chicago.andM;Prescott says, &quot;We are establishing baseline data from similar projects so wecan use our actuals.&quot;andM;Eldonna Williamson, senior consulting engineer at DuPont in Newark, Del.,andO;echoes the sentiment expressed about the problems posed by a lack ofhistorical data.andP;  She also says, &quot;Although there is corporate commitment tofunction points, we are looking for multiple methods of measuring, includingmechanized tools.&quot;andM;Williamson's approach assumes measurement tools will meet with someresistance, just as Case tools have.andP;  &quot;Just as people began to use methodswith the availability of Case tools, people will start measuring when toolsare there to support [the process].andP;  Tools are arriving, but are standaloneand not yet integrated.andP;  We have project schedulers, function point tools,estimators, but they are isolated [from each other].&quot;andM;But if we hark back to Liu's advice about what to measure, we must admit thatif common sense is applied, it is possible to put into place a usefulmeasurement plan without years of expensive preparation.andM;Grochow recounts, &quot;A few years ago I set a goal for my project team.andP;  Theirsystem must have less than a specified number of problems during the firstthree months of operation or they would not receive their yearly bonuses.andM;&quot;The specified number was quite low, somewhat unprecedented, but attainable.andO;The team met this and it was one of the best systems ever developed,&quot; hesaid.andP;  Grochow attributed the success to the fact that he clearly spelled outthe goal and how progress would be measured.andM;It was no surprise that the arguments for one measurement technique overanother were heated.andP;  The strength of conviction was comparable to the degreeof devotion displayed in discussions of development methodologies.andM;However, Liu asserts that posing the question &quot;Which metric system do youuse?&quot; is the wrong question.andM;Liu advises, &quot;Every level of management must be interviewed.&quot;andP;  He said peopleneed to ask: 'Why do you want to measure?'andP;  'What does productivity mean toyou?' and 'What are you trying to achieve?'andM;Liu advises, &quot;Show them how the measurement data will be used includingexamples.andP;  This will show value to upper management and give a picture to thepeople which will eliminate fear.andP;  then management can pick the techniquesmost suitable for the organization.&quot;andM;Liu says he does not have a penchant for or bias against any particularmethod of measuring productivity or quality.andP;  &quot;Lines of code are as valid asfunction points.andP;  You must know the pros and cons of each measurement methodand what they are telling you.andP;  The most important thing is consistency andreasonableness.&quot;andM;In trying to answer the question of whether Case tools are paying off, it isimportant to understand what is being measured.andM;During the 1950s, a famous productivity study was conducted at a WesternElectric manufacturing plant in Hawthorne, Calif.andP;  The study subjects wereremoved from their everyday work environment and placed in a special settingwhere the impact of assorted changes on their productivity was studied.andM;The the surprise of the experimenters, any change caused an increase in theirsubject's productivity.andP;  The conclusion of the study was that the very act ofmeasuring can improve productivity.andP;  This became known as the HawthorneEffect.andM;In fact, many Case customers believed that at least some of the improvementwas due to the attention and emphasis placed on improvement.andM;The correlation between measuring and improvement was even measured byBilodeau, who reports, &quot;In 1983, when we began measuring with functionpoints, we did not introduce Case or a formal methodology.andP;  By 1986productivity had increased from 4.5 days per function point to 3.2 days perfunction point.&quot;andM;He believes the improvement was to &quot;the interest that [management] showed inthe people.andP;  If management is going to be concerned with productivity, thepeople will be with you.andP;  If management invests in tools and methods, [thenthe] people will be involved.andP;  People will make the difference by theirattitudes,&quot; Bilodeau said.andM;ETHICS OF MEASUREMENTandM;Another aspect of what factors are actually measured is the question of howthe measurements will be used.andM;Customer opinions on how the results should be utilized ranged from fear ofunfair reprisal to indifference, but did include some believers in the meritof measuring individuals.andM;BDM's Filteau found that &quot;people thought it was pointless and senseless, abureaucratic hassle.andP;  The project managers thought they would be judged andthey were right.andP;  I was called the Darth Vader of BDM.&quot;andM;In fact, the use of measurement to judge people is a matter of considerablecontroversy.andP;  Experts who believe that the information is not accurate enoughon an individual level advocate judging only overall departmentalimprovement.andM;Liu recommends retaining the normal performance appraisal process forpractical as well as humane reasons.andP;  He says there is a principle ofneutrality; the data providers must be neutral or they will distort thedata.andM;On the other end of the spectrum, Harvey Bookman, president of BookmanConsulting, Inc., New York, has developed a tool, Teck-chek, for measuringprogrammer proficiency.andM;THE VERDICTandM;Trusting an expert system to determine a person's productivity may seem a bitfrightening, but Bookman says &quot;if you understand what is being measured, youwill get the right people on the right project.andP;  This saves big dollars.&quot;andP;  Aproduct trial allows companies to test their entire staff.andP;  Bookman said, &quot;Myproduct only tests technical skill and does not test motivation, ethics,personality or ability.&quot;andM;It appears that customers who do measure improvement are convinced they arerealizing concrete and substantial benefit from Case tools.andP;  Yet it is quiteevident, however, that most companies and organizations are not measuring.andM;The issues surrounding the process of measurement are not specifically linkedto measuring the effectiveness of Case tools.andP;  Some users displayconsiderable reluctance and some fear to measuring anything at all.andP;  Bothmanagers and their staffs have apprehensions about the potential misuse ofinformation.andM;Nevertheless, it does seem that in order for us to be taken seriously asprofessionals, we must be able and willing to prove the results of our labor.andO;The fact that there are no perfect metrics or measurement techniques does notpreclude us from getting off the dime.andM;After all, the successful implementers of Case did not reap their benefits bywaiting for the perfect tools.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
