Debate was to have begun this week on the proceduresgoverning the EC's year-old merger regulation, which allowscorporate proposals to be investigated and blocked. The EC'sindustry commissioner, Martin Bangemann, had suggested thechange, opposed by Sir Leon Brittan, the competitioncommissioner, who argued EC antitrust policy could beundermined and the process complicated.   The delay means Sir Leon will continue to have the powerto order full-scale merger inquiries without seeking approvalof the 17-member commission, as Mr. Bangemann had proposed.   The commission increasingly is seeking to put offcontroversial decisions because of the tensions related to aDecember summit, where treaties on EC monetary and politicalunion are to be signed.                                                                                                          BRITAIN FAULTS EC AD LIMITS                                                                                                          Britain accused the European Community of threateningpress freedom through the cumulative effect of proposed ECcontrols on advertising. London opposes a plan to ban tobaccoads and to restrict ads for alcoholic beverages, cosmetics,cars and children's products. This would affect 20% to 40% ofad spending in Britain, an official said, warning that &quot;afree press needs an independent source of revenue&quot; and thatthe EC proposals could eliminate 16,000 jobs and 1,700magazines in the trade group's 12 member states.                                                                                                          EAST EUROPE'S ECONOMIC OUTLOOK                                                                                                          Gross domestic product this year is expected to plunge 15%to 16% in Eastern European countries and 13% in the SovietUnion from a year earlier, the Vienna Institute forComparative International Economic Relations said. A study bythe institute cited what it termed excessively restrictivenational policies to decontrol prices and check inflation.                                                                                                          SEOUL MAY RESCUE SHOE INDUSTRY                                                                                                          South Korea may lend 39.7 billion won ($53 million) to thenation's struggling footwear industry by year end and put theexport-dependent sector under Seoul's protection. Trade datashow 27 of 300 footwear firms have gone bankrupt this year,as manufacturing costs exceeded export prices. Footwearexports fell 8.4% to $2.72 billion in the first nine months.Shoe makers would get low-interest government loans and taxbenefits in return for controls, such as on mergers. Seoulhas taken similar actions for the auto and heavy-equipmentindustries, both of which returned to profitability.                                                                                                          JAPAN'S NUCLEAR-ENERGY PACE                                                                                                          Japan added only one nuclear power plant this year, andTokyo acknowledged the difficulty of achieving its goal ofbuilding 40 more by 2010. At the end of September, theScience and Technology Agency annual report on atomic energysaid, Japan had 41 nuclear reactors, which could supply 26.6%of electricity demand; the target is 43% two decades fromnow. Sites for 12 plants have been identified, but Japanesepublic opposition to nuclear power is growing.                                                                                                          ITALIAN TAX AIDS MOB VICTIMS                                                                                                          Italy set up a compensation fund, partly financed by a new1% tax on certain insurance policies, for organized-crimevictims. The measure set off a storm of protest by insurancecompanies.   Insurers said the tax penalized policyholders, in effectforcing them to finance the Mafia, and they vowed tochallenge its constitutionality. Critics said the taxrepresents a government admission it is powerless to stoporganized crime.   Italy's mobsters rake in more than $20 billion a year inextortion money alone, according to a national shopkeepersassociation. Protection money is paid by half the country'sbars and restaurants, and in some Sicilian cities, by 90% ofall shops and businesses.   Extortion victims can claim tax-free compensation fortheir payments from the $120 million &quot;solidarity fund.&quot; Thefund, which limits individual claims to $2 million over threeyears, also will be financed by the government budget andassets seized from mobsters. The measure is part of severalanti-Mafia decrees, which also created a special police unit.
