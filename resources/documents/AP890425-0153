The Confederation for an Independent Poland said it will fieldthree candidates in Warsaw for the larger Sejm chamber in an effortto weaken the communist system.   Police vehicles lined the street in front of the gates to WarsawUniversity, where the rally began.   Then police wielding batons and metal shields moved in anddetained at least three people, including two confederationmembers, when about 50 supporters ran into a police line.   Confederation campus leader Wojciech Gawkowski announced thathe, Stanislaw Mazurkiewicz and Stanislaw Dronicz will run for theSejm.   Anybody who gathers 3,000 signatures can run for one of the 161seats available to independent candidates in the 460-member Sejm,or a seat in the new 100-member Senate that will be the firstfreely elected legislative body in the East bloc.   Gawkowski said that if police do not stop interfering withelection efforts of the confederation, known by its Polish initialsKPN, the group will call for a boycott of the June voting.   ``KPN will not stop organizing protests. We want to beat thecommunist system down to its foundations,'' he told listeners.   Authorities consider the confederation an illegal organizationand police regularly break up its rallies and meetings.   Deputy government spokesman Zbyslaw Rykowski told reportersTuesday that confederation rallies are ``aggressive and rough,''and ``contradictory with the spirit of conciliation.''   Meanwhile, 1,500 supporters of the students' union NZS marchedacross Warsaw to the Education Ministry to demand legalregistration of the independent group and improved conditions atcampuses. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday on legalizing theunion.</TEXT></DOC>
