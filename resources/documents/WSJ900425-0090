Experts agree that free airline tickets earned withcredits for deductible business travel are personal income ifused for personal travel. But years after starting a&quot;project&quot; to write rules for taxing the income, the IRS stillis stumped by these questions: what to tax, when to tax it,how to value it, who (airline, company, or traveler) mustrecord and report it, and whether it is a nontaxable fringebenefit for employees. Now the IRS has reclassified itsregulation-writing project as a &quot;study.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   That doesn't mean the chore is downgraded, a spokesmansays; it means the IRS needs to learn more about the rapidlygrowing and changing programs. But, says Donald Alexander, aWashington lawyer who represents the Air TransportAssociation: &quot;I'd be surprised if we heard from the IRS soon.I think they are finding the game isn't worth the candle.&quot;William Raby, editor of a newsletter on tax practice, saysmany CPAs are concerned about the ethics of not reporting theincome on clients' returns.   Raby says he would raise an ethical question about theIRS's &quot;failure . . . to provide even one word of guidance.&quot;                                                                                                          JUDGES UP THE ANTE for taxpayers who gamble on frivolouscourt tactics.   The 1982 tax act let the Tax Court order taxpayers to paydamages of up to $5,000 for filing frivolous or delayingsuits. But the growing number of damage awards didn't seem tobe deterrent enough, so the 1989 tax act authorized the courtto impose a penalty of up to $25,000 for making groundlessarguments starting this year. Judges are beginning to applythat heavier hand.   Robert J. Urwyler of Modesto, Calif., made frivolous taxprotests and failed twice to appear for trial; Special JudgeGalloway has ordered him to pay $7,000 on top of taxes andother penalties. Judge Parr ordered Marjorie E. Brock,Redding, Calif., to pay civil fraud penalties and $5,000 for&quot;obnoxious behavior&quot; in 1989 and $10,000 for this year --including failing to appear for trial.                                                                                                          SELF-EMPLOYERS may trim Social Security taxes a bit, withsome figuring.   Half of employees' Social Security tax is paid byemployers. But the self-employed nominally pay the full tax-- in 1990, 15.3% of the first $51,300 of self-employmentearnings. Still, new two-step rules will let them lower therate, says Peter Elinsky of Peat Marwick, CPAs. First, beforefiguring the self-employment Social Security tax, they maydeduct from earnings a sum equal to the earnings times halfthe tax rate; the full rate then is levied on the balance.Thus, Elinsky says, the maximum tax of $7,848.90 applies toearnings of $55,550 or more; for lower earnings, the tax isless.   Step No. 2 comes when a self-employer files an income-taxreturn: On it, he may deduct half of the Social Security taxactually paid. Someone in the 28% income-tax bracket thuspays an effective Social Security rate of 12.15%, not 15.3%,on earnings of $55,550 or less, Elinsky says. Employees paySocial Security tax at a 7.65% rate.   Reducing self-employment-tax payments may result in lowerSocial Security benefits later, Elinsky adds.                                                                                                          REAL-ESTATE transaction reporting would be widened broadlyin 1991 by proposed IRS rules to cover land and allresidential, industrial, and commercial buildings. The IRSplans a hearing Sept. 24. Reporting now is required forone-to-four-family residential properties.                                                                                                          PERSONAL-SERVICE concerns owned at least 95% by presentand past employees pay a flat 34% tax, not the regulargraduated corporate rates on income up to $75,000. The IRSsays it is screening such companies' returns, because manyhave computed their taxes at the lower graduated rates.                                                                                                          TAXPAYERS' RIGHTS should be expanded, says Sen. Armstrong(R., Colo.). He has entered five bills to broaden rights torecover costs from the IRS and to sue it, to equalize theinterest rates on overdue taxes and refunds, and to protectconfidential communications with tax advisers.                                                                                                          WORKING COUPLES must watch for underwithholding, taxadvisers say.   So it's time to review Form W-4s, adds the CaliforniaSociety of Enrolled Agents, who are licensed advisers. IRSwithholding tables for couples filing jointly assume only onespouse works, and the society describes this potentialproblem: John and Jo earn $2,000 a month each and don'titemize deductions. On W-4s, they list themselves as marriedbut claim no dependents, to maximize withholding; theiremployers withhold $261 a month each, or a total of $522.   The couple also have $2,000 of interest income. Doingtheir 1990 return, they find they owe $844 more in tax. Yetif Jo as the sole breadwinner earned the same total sum,$4,000 a month, $695 would be withheld from her monthlypaycheck; and the couple would get a $1,232 refund. Thelesson for working couples: Be sure to use the nine-stepworksheet on the back of the W-4 to figure the rightwithholding, the society says.   The effect of the withholding tables varies, but falls onall working couples to some extent, the society says.                                                                                                          BRIEFS: Taxpayers Associations International -- joininggroups striving to restrain taxes in 15 nations -- plans itsfirst meeting in July, aboard the Cinderella sailing fromStockholm to Helsinki. . . . Missouri Sens. Danforth and Bondpropose to amend the Constitution to bar federal judges fromimposing state taxes. They would overturn the Supreme Court'sruling in the Kansas City, Mo., school-desegregation case.</TEXT></DOC>
