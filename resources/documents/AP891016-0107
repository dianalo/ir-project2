Bob Dole, R-Kan., to theWhite House Monday to discuss his proposed resolution memorializingthe ``Armenian genocide'' 75 years ago, a Dole aide said.   The Turks are up in arms about the resolution because ``theydon't want to be compared with Hitler,'' said Mike McNamara, alobbyist for Turkey.   ``It is the most offensive thing that Congress can do toU.S.-Turkish relations,'' said Daryal Batibay, the deputy chief ofthe Turkish Embassy. He said the measure, if passed, would damageties between the United States and Turkey, a close NATO ally thatplays host to American military bases.   Against that backdrop, Brent Scowcroft, the president's nationalsecurity adviser, asked Dole, the Senate minority leader, to meetwith him on the issue, according to an aide to Dole who asked thathe not be quoted by name.   Publicly, the administration has remained mute on the emotionalresolution, which has caught President Bush in a bind.   During the 1988 presidential campaign, Bush said the UnitedStates must acknowledge ``the attempted genocide of the Armenianpeople in the last years of the Ottoman Empire. ...'' Some 1.5million Armenians were killed in the early part of the century.   But Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's spokesman, said the administrationhad not taken any position on the Dole resolution. The Reaganadministration opposed such resolutions when they previously cameup _ and were defeated _ in the House.   With the Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled to vote on theresolution Tuesday, Turkey's lobbyists and Bush administrationofficials, including Morton Abramowitz, the U.S. ambassador toTurkey, worked frantically behind the scenes to convince senatorsto drop their support for the Dole resolution.   Several senators, including Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; StromThurmond, R-S.C., and Robert Kasten, R-Wis., have already withdrawntheir sponsorship. Others, like Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., and FrankLautenberg, D-N.J., have added their names to the resolution.   Dole needs 50 co-sponsors, half of them Republican, to have thejudiciary committee consider the measure, which would designateApril 24, 1990, as the ``National Day of Remembrance of the 75thAnniversary of the Genocide of 1915-1923.''   In a letter to other senators, Dole said the resolution wasprompted by his August visit to Armenia, a part of the SovietUnion, to visit earthquake victims.   ``And I can attest, from my own recent visit to Armenia, thatthe Armenian people feel real friendship for the United States andour people,'' he said.   Both Dole and Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said they didn't wantthe resolution to be misunderstood as a slap at Turkey.   ``I would also like to point out that the resolution does notimplicate the government of the Republic of Turkey in this terribleevent,'' Wilson said. Wilson is running for governor in California,a state with a large population of Armenian descendants.   Thurmond, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee,said he pulled his name as a co-sponsor ``since I've learned theadministration strongly opposes the resolution.'' He said he wasweighing whether to support the measure.   Leahy said he withdrew his name because the Turkish ambassadorsaid the Turks will allow scholars to study the events from OttomanEmpire archives. ``He thinks next year would be a better time for aresolution,'' said Leahy's spokesman, Joe Jamele.   Kasten's name had been put on the resolution by a staff memberwithout the senator's knowledge, said Kasten's spokesman, Jim Sims.Kasten asked that it be taken off, Sims said.</TEXT></DOC>
