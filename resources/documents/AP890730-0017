Higgins threatened Sunday to hang him within 24hours if Israel fails to free the pro-Iranian fundamentalist clericit abducted from Lebanon.   ``This will be our first response to the stupid Israeliaggression and the flagrant American support that proves U.S.complicity in the crime,'' said a statement issued by theunderground Organization of the Oppressed on Earth.   ``We shall carry out the death sentence handed down againstproven spy Higgins by hanging him at exactly 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT)Monday if Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid and his two brethren have notbeen freed by then,'' said the typewritten Arabic statement.   It was delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut two daysafter helicopter-borne Israeli commandoes kidnapped Obeid, 33, andtwo colleagues from Obeid's home in a southern Lebanese village andflew them to Israel.   The statement was not accompanied by a picture of Higgins, theusual confirmation of authenticity. But the statement appeared tohave been typed on the same machine and the same paper as earlierstatements. Previous statements had photographs of Higgins or ofhis military identification card.   After the commando raid Friday, some speculated that Israelwould try to swap Obeid and his colleagues for Higgins or for threeIsraeli soldiers believed to be held in Lebanon since 1986 byObeid's group or its affiliates.   Obeid is reputed to be the spiritual guide of the Iranian-backedHezbollah, or Party of God, in south Lebanon. Obeid has denied anylinks to the group.   Hezbollah is widely believed to be the umbrella for Shiiteextremist factions, including the Oppressed on Earth, that areholding most of the 17 Western hostages in Lebanon. Nine of thehostages are Americans.   The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini maintained that Iran's 1979Islamic Revolution was carried out for the mostazafin, or oppressed.   On Saturday, Israeli leaders dismissed criticism of theabduction and said Obeid led a ``fanatical'' group that hadlaunched terrorist attacks on Israel.   On Friday, President Bush said he could not condone the commandoraid and that he did not know if it would help efforts to freeHiggins.   In Tehran on Sunday, Iranian Interior Minister Ali AkbarMontashemi told reporters that Islamic groups worldwide willretaliate against the United States and Israel for the abduction ofObeid.   The Oppressed on Earth group claimed responsibility forabducting Higgins, a decorated Vietnam veteran, near southLebanon's port city of Tyre on Feb. 17, 1988. They charged he was aspy for the CIA.   Higgins, 44, of Danville, Ky., served as head of a 76-memberobserver group attached to the U.N. peacekeeping force in southLebanon.   In a statement issued Dec. 12, 1988, the Oppressed on Earth saidit sentenced Higgins to death after ``he had made full confessionsabout his espionage activities.'' That statement said Higgins hadbeen handed ``to those responsible in the organization ... toexecute this just verdict.''   Of the 17 Western hostages, the longest held is Terry A.Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress.   He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
