The approximation is derived rigorously fromthe Horner buildup and variable-rate superposition equations. The majoradvantage of this method compared to other proposals is that it not onlyforces the production volumes to be equal (material balance constraint),but it also forces the pressures at a particular time to be equal. Theapproximate method has been verified for several variable-rate schemesusing a finite-difference numerical simulator. The effect of wellbornestorage was studied using both surface and sandface rates. The effectsof a short shut-in time and a shut-in time equal to the duration of theproduction period were also investigated. The results of the new methodseldom varied more than 5% from the results obtained using rigorous superposition.</TEXT></DOC>
