Two teen-agers werereported shot.   In the Gaza Strip, a curfew was in effect for a sixth straightday. On Tuesday, some Arabs celebrated the Palestinian declarationof independence in the streets with songs and fireworks. It is thelongest the seaside area has been shut by authorities since the 1967Middle East war.   Hundreds of soldiers patrolled in jeeps, trucks with plasticshields to protect them from stones, and armored vehicles equippedwith machines to spray gravel at rioters.   In the West Bank, soldiers carried out raids to prevent violence,a military spokeswoman said. She said arrests were made, but shewould not say how many.   In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, fireworks continued into themorning and dozens of outlawed Palestinian flags were hung on wallsand utility poles. Graffiti read ``Congratulations to our people _the state is born.''   Two teen-agers were shot by soldiers in Gaza City, apparentlyafter violating curfew orders, officials at Ahli Arab Hospital said.One was a 14-year-old shot in the right arm and the other a15-year-old wounded in the leg, they said.   A military spokeswoman said there were incidents ofstone-throwing in the city but no injuries. Israel radio said theclosure order was issued after soldiers caught two youths andaccused them of inciting other youngsters to throw stones.   Smoke from burning tires rose above the city. At least five tireswere seen aflame in a two-hour, army-conducted tour for reporters.Stones were thrown at one journalists' car in a convoy guided by twoarmy jeeps.   Soldiers banged on the closed metal doors on one street where atire burned. They pulled out a middle-aged man and ordered him todouse the tire with water and clear the debris from the roadway.   As the soldiers shouted at the man, more than a dozen youths in anearby alley made V for victory signs for the benefit ofphotographers.   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, armed forces chief of staff, said themilitary will take whatever steps needed to keep the PLO declarationof independence from fueling the 11-month Palestinian uprisingagainst Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Atleast 312 Arabs and 11 Israelis have been killed in the uprising.There are 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied areas.   ``The Israel Defense Forces will keep as many troops in the areaas is needed. We will continue to keep the quiet by keeping peopleunder curfew as necessary,'' he said on Israel radio.   The military said it filedcomplaints against three Israelijournalists whom it accused of violating orders prohibitingreporters from entering the West Bank on Tuesday, the day theindependence declaration was declared.   The three were caught in Al-Ittihad hospital in Nablus, said themilitary spokeswoman. One of them, Joel Greenberg of the JerusalemPost, said the reporters were not aware of the military order.   In the Gaza Strip, 650,000 Palestinians were under curfew. Thearmy said curfews requiring people to stay in their homes also werein effect in the West Bank towns of Tulkarem, Qalqilya, Nura Shamsand Shuweika, where 85,000 Arabs live. A reporter in Nablus saidsoldiers put the city of 120,000 under curfew.   The army declared Ramallah a closed military area, preventingpeople from entering or leaving the West Bank city of 40,000.</TEXT></DOC>
