The NRC earlier had imposed a $64,000 fine, charging that the unit of General Public Utilities Corp. had discriminated against Richard Parks. Mr. Parks is a former Bechtel North American Power Corp. employee who was assigned to GPU's Three Mile Island Unit 2 power plant.    The NRC complaint said that Mr. Parks was harassed through reassignments after he raised concerns about repairs on the power plant's polar crane.    In settling the complaint, GPU didn't admit to any discrimination, and the company declined to comment. Bechtel North American is a unit of Bechtel Group Inc., a San Francisco engineering and construction concern. </TEXT></DOC>
