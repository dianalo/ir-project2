The enormity of the destruction, either executed or threatened,severs the nexus of proportionally between means and ends which usedto characterize the threat and use of force. This does not mean, however,that the nuclear strategies are equally irrational. The nuclear policyof the Reagan administration-which is essentially the same as that ofthe Carter administration and which has its roots in developments initiatedby even earlier administrations-is particularly ill-formed. The authorexplains why for this is that the strategy rests on a profound underestimationof the impact of nuclear weapons on military strategy and attempts tounderstand the current situation with intellectual tools appropriateonly in the pre-nuclear era. American strategy for the past several years-the&quot;countervailing strategy&quot;-has been based on the assumption that whatis crucial is the ability of American and allied military forces to denythe Soviets military advantage from any aggression they might contemplate.The U.S. must be prepared to meet and block any level of Soviet force.The strategy is then one of counterforce-blocking and seeking to destroySoviet military power. The goal is deterrence. Although it is concernedwith how the U.S. would fight many different kinds of wars, both nuclearand non-nuclear, it is not correct to claim that the strategy seeks toengage in wars rather than deter them. Instead, it argues that the bestway to deter wars and aggression is to be prepared to fight if need be;theRussians are unlikely to start or risk a war if they know that they cannotwin. To a significant extent, current strategy fits with common sense,but the author argues that nuclear weapons do not conform to our traditionalways of thinking.</TEXT></DOC>
