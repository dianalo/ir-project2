The low pressure center which represented what once was thehurricane that battered Galveston, Texas, on Sunday movednortheastward out of southwestern Arkansas during Monday afternoon.Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across the lowerMississippi Valley into the lower Ohio Valley.   The heaviest precipitation during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDTwas 1.32 inches at Jonesboro, Ark.   Thunderstorms associated with the hurricane drenchedeast-central Texas and west-central Louisiana with up to 5 inchesof rain.   A flash flood watch was posted for northern Mississippi and aflash flood watch was issued through the night for central andwestern Tennessee.   A cold front stretched across the central part of the nation andshowers and thunderstorms developed along it from eastern Kansas toLower Michigan. Thunderstorms along that front on Sunday producedsevere weather in Iowa and Wisconsin with gusts to 65 mph atWinterset, Iowa, and hail as big as golf balls in Wisconsin, theNational Weather Service reported.   Snow fell over some of the mountains and foothills of Colorado.Denver had 3 inches of wet, slushy snow by mid afternoon and up to8 inches accumulated in the surrounding foothills.   The snow caused traffic snarls for commuters and reducedvisibility at Denver's Stapleton airport, causing flight delays ofup to an hour, said Richard Boulware, airport public informationofficer. The number of flights arriving and departing was reducedto 30 per hour from the average of 80 per hour at midmorning.   ``Visibility is the problem, not the snow,'' Boulware said.   Interstate 25 was closed for about an hour five to six milessouth of the Colorado-Wyoming border after a truck overturned onthe slushy surface, patrol officials said.   Elsewhere, showers extended across central Kansas into easternColorado.   During the morning, dense fog reduced visibility in New Jerseyand eastern Pennsylvania, parts of Georgia and Florida, and in someCalifornia valleys.   Morning lows in the teens were reported in Montana, northwesternWyoming and northwestern North Dakota, and afternoon temperatureswere only in the 30s in northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin,Upper Michigan and the Rockies.   At the other extreme, Montgomery, Ala., tied its record high forthe date at 90 degrees.   Monday's overnight low for the Lower 48 states was 11 atBroadus, Mont.</TEXT></DOC>
