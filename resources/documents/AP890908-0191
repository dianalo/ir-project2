DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than half the money to pay for PresidentBush's war on drugs would be cut from programs that primarily assistlow-income families and less than one-fifth would come from defense,a private research group said.   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, afoundation-supported nonpartisan group generally identified withliberal positions, said $410 million, or 55 per cent of the $751million in cuts, would come from low-income programs.   The center also argued all those cuts would reduce or terminateprograms, while the only cut from the Pentagon budget would merelyforce postponment until a future year of the purchase of a $132million communications system.   The organization analyzed proposed reductions in funds for publichousing, juvenile justice and assistance to recent immigrants.   It took issue with Bush's statement in his speech Tuesday that heis ``targeting $50 million to fight crime in public housing projects_ to help restore order, and to kick out the dealers for good.''   ``The president failed to note that funds for these efforts wouldcome from cutbacks in funds for the basic operation of suchprojects,'' the center said.   ``Specifically, the president proposes cutting by $50 million theamount that the House of Representatives has recently appropriatedfor fiscal year 1990 federal subsidies for the operation of publichousing projects.   ``Thus, on the one hand, the president is proposing to rid publichousing of drugs by providing the funds to hire additional securityguards and support innovative drug reduction programs,'' the groupsaid. ``On the other hand, the president's proposal ... will allowfor further physical deterioration of the housing conditions, whichin turn could hamper drug eradication efforts.''   The report also criticized Bush's proposal to cut $40 millionfrom grants to states for juvenile justice and juvenile deliquencyprevention programs. The Reagan and Bush administrations have soughtto eliminate the programs on grounds their goals, including keepingyoung prisoners separate from adults, have been met.   But the center said 1987 Justice Department figures show onlyabout half the states in full or substantial compliance with theseparation of prisoners. The House has approved $69 million for theprograms, which Bush wants reduced to $29 million.   The largest reduction proposed to fund the drug strategy, thecenter said, is a $320 million cut in grants to states forfinancial, medical and education aid to 3 million recent immigrantswho gained temporary legal status under the 1986 Immigration ReformAct.   The administration says the appropriation can be safely reducedbecause states have been slow to spend $1.6 billion alreadyappropriated. The center agreed states have been spending the moneymore slowly than expected, but quoted the Congressional BudgetOffice as saying all of the appropriated funds would be used by theend of 1994.</TEXT></DOC>
