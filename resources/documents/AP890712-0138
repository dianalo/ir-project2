Police said 10 people were wounded in the duel between gunnersfrom the Syrian army and mainly Christian Lebanese Army across amountain range southeast of the capital.   The wounded are four Christian soldiers, two Christian civiliansand four Moslem civilians, police said.   Since the latest round of the civil war began March 8 overChristian leader Gen. Michel Aoun's blockade of illegal ports run bySyrian-backed militias, 405 people have been killed and 1,593 havebeen wounded.   Smoke billowed from the wooded slopes overlooking Beirut asshells thudded across the valleys Wednesday morning. A policespokesman said they exploded at a rate of six a minute. The shellingsubsided into intermittent exchanges around noon.   The barrage coincided with the arrival in Damascus of theMoroccan, Algerian and Saudi foreign ministers to discuss a trucewith Syrian President Hafez Assad.   ``In spite of the difficulties, I still think that conditions areappropriate for brotherly (Arab-sponsored) solutions,'' MoroccanForeign Minister Abdel Latif al-Filali said in Damascus.   The three are on an Arab League mission to negotiate a settlementto Lebanon's 14-year civil war by November. Lebanese media saidtheir efforts face failure.   The official Syrian Arab News Agency said they gave Assad lettersfrom King Hassan of Morocco, Algerian President Chedli Bendjedid andSaudi King Fahd.   A commentary by Radio Damascus reaffirmed Syria's committment tothe peace moves, saying ``extracting Lebanon from its crisis is anational task'' in which the Arab League mission ``should persevereand continue.''   Syria considers Lebanon within its sphere of influence and has40,000 troops stationed across the country under a 1976 Arab Leaguepeacekeeping mandate. Six Syrian gunboats are blockading a 28-milecoastal stretch east of Beirut controlled by Christians.   Beirut's conservative daily Ad-Diyar quoted unidentifiedChristian sources as predicting a ``major escalation ofhostilities'' by the weekend if the Arab League envoys fail topersuade Syria to lift the blockade.   Ad-Diyar said Syria's navy is waiting to intercept ``a largeIraqi ship carrying more than 15 Gazelle helicopter gunships, inaddition to air-to-surface missiles and bombs for Aoun's forces.''   It said another Iraqi vessel is carrying Soviet-made Frog-7surface-to-surface missiles for Aoun.   Syria sent its navy to block the coast last week after it saidAoun had received an undisclosed number of Frog-7 missiles anddemanded they be removed because they can hit Damascus.   At least seven reportedly are deployed in the Christian enclave.If fired from the easternmost flank of Christian-held mountains,they could reach Damascus 40 miles away.   Aoun refuses to say whether he has any of the missiles andreportedly has threatened air strikes against the Syrian gunboats.   On Tuesday, Aoun sent a lone jet fighter roaring low over Syrianbatteries in west Beirut. The aging warplane is one of Aoun's threeoperational British-made Hawker Hunters that, with eight Gazelles,make up his air force.   As-Safir, a leftist daily newspaper close to the Syriangovernment, said Aoun plans ``a major escalation of theconfrontation in the next few days with the aim of achieving ameeting of the United Nations Security Council on Lebanon.''   The paper quoted unidentified Western sources as saying Franceand Iraq support Aoun's bid to force a discussion at the world body.   Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, has declared support for Aoun's``war of liberation'' to drive Syria out of Lebanon because itstroops have betrayed their mandate by siding with the Moslems.   Syria and its local Moslem and leftist militia allies in Lebanoncommand 80,000 troops that far outnumber Aoun's army of 20,000.</TEXT></DOC>
