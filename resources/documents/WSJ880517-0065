Visa International and Japan's Sony Corp. said they will join PepsiCo Inc.'s Pepsi Cola International unit as the first foreign advertisers to buy commercial time on TV in the Soviet Union. PepsiCo made its announcement last week.    David Brancoli, a spokesman for Visa, said the firm will show five identical 30-second spots featuring its sponsorship of the Summer Olympics in Seoul, even though the Visa card isn't available yet to Soviet citizens. He said the card is expected to be offered within the next few months, but will only be issued to foreign nationals living in the Soviet Union and to Soviet citizens who travel abroad.    He said the commercial is essentially the same as one shown in the U.S., but that Visa had to alter certain phrases. For example, the slogan &quot;Visa is everywhere you want to be&quot; had to be rephrased, he said, because &quot;everywhere&quot; could mean &quot;on the wall or in my shoe&quot; to Soviet citizens.    Sony officials familiar with the electronics firm's commercial couldn't be reached for comment, but a spokesman confirmed Sony's participation. Sony also will sell five 30-second spots. PepsiCo will sell five 60-second spots. None of the companies disclosed the commercials' cost.    The ads will be shown during a show called &quot;Pozner in America,&quot; featuring Soviet commentator Vladimir Pozner speaking with Americans on a range of topics. The show, a joint U.S.-Soviet production, will be broadcast from tonight through May 21, before Moscow summit talks between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.    All three transactions were arranged by Global American Television, a Colrain, Mass.-based company representing the Soviet broadcast agency Gostelradio. </TEXT></DOC>
