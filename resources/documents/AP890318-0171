The April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S.benchmark grade of crude oil, hit $20.33 a barrel on Friday, thehighest level since Aug. 14, 1987 when crude prices closed at$20.57. The contract closed at $19.84 in the previous session.   On Monday, crude prices crossed a resistance level of $19 afterfluctuating in the $18 range the previous two weeks. Since Fridaywhen the contract stood at $18.50, prices have risen $1.83, drivenby several reports pointing to a decline in available raw petroleum,traders said.   ``This week had one piece of bullish news after another in amarket that is technically strong,'' said James R. Fiedler, vicepresident in charge of energy brokering for E.D.andamp;F. ManInternational Futures Inc.   The reports indicated: falling U.S. inventories; a tightening ofcrude oil supplies in the Gulf of Mexico, a major U.S. oil-producingregion; problems in the North Sea that temporarily disruptedproduction at a large Norwegian oil complex; and sharp cutbacks bySaudi Arabia to Japan, Europe and the United States.   Among refined products traded on the exchange Friday, unleadedgasoline for April delivery declined 0.21 cent to 55.62 a gallon andApril heating oil fell 0.26 cent to close at 53.57 cents.   Traders said April and May gasoline prices were under pressurefrom Friday's announcement that the Environmental Protection Agencywould not enforce new higher octane rules for some northeasternstates until after June 1 instead of May 15 as previously announced.   Traders said the strong showing on the April crude oil contractwas due largely to short covering _ or buying to repay borrowedpositions _ in advance of the contract's expiration on Monday whenmany players will be out of the market for a national petroleumrefiners conference.   ``There was a definite reluctance to sell. People were buying,''said Stephen Piasio, vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   May crude rose 24 cents and June advanced 13 cents, with smallergains for second-half contracts. Traders said investors remaineduncertain about OPEC's intentions after June, when the cartel'scurrent production quota expires. The Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries hasn't revealed whether it will raise or loweroutput for the rest of the year, although speculation is that thecartel will boost production slightly.   OPEC agreed to its current quota of 18.5 million barrels a daylast November after the cartel flooded the market with oil andprices sank to 1986 lows. Since the accord, prices have risen morethan $5 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
