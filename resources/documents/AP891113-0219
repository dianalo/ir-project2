Ron Carey, president of the7,000-member Teamsters Local 804 in New York City, is the firstmember to say he will take advantage of new election procedures andchallenge the union's leadership.   He was endorsed Sunday by the Teamsters for a Democratic Union,a dissident group within the 1.6 million-member InternationalBrotherhood of Teamsters, the nation's largest trade union.   ``We have an opportunity to move this union in new directions,and we can't miss our chance to regain control of the leadershipthat has ignored the needs of members for too long,'' Carey toldthe Teamsters for a Democratic Union on Saturday.   ``Our union's negative image has been formed because of 5percent of union officials who are corrupt,'' he said.   About 500 members from across the United States and Canadagathered over the weekend at a Pittsburgh hotel for the 14th annualconvention of Teamsters for a Democratic Union.   In addition to endorsing Carey's nomination, delegates passed aresolution prohibiting negotiation of two-tier contracts, whichprovide lower wage scales for some workers doing the same job.   The TDU was formed in 1976 in Detroit to oppose union electionpolicies. Now claiming 10,000 members, the group has beeninstrumental in winning sweeping reforms in the union, notably theright to majority rule in elections and contract votes.   Also invited to address the convention were Teamsters PresidentWilliam J. McCarthy and Secretary-Treasurer Weldon Mathis, who wereexpected to run for the union's top office. Neither accepted theinvitation or was available to comment on Carey's remarks.   Carey, 53, has been a Teamsters member for 34 years as a UnitedParcel Service delivery driver. He doesn't belong to the TDU, butsaid he supports its goal of giving members more of a voice.   ``I would hope that with what we could achieve in 1991, that TDUwon't have to be TDU,'' he told the crowd, which interrupted hisspeech several times with standing applause. ``I've been TDU allalong in terms of my beliefs.''   Last year, under pressure from the Justice Department, which isfighting alleged corruption in the Teamsters, the union agreed toallow all union contracts to be decided by majority vote.   Previously, union policy required a two-thirds vote to rejectpacts approved by Teamsters leaders. The TDU and other assertedthat such elections led to sweetheart deals between unionleadership and employers at the expense of the members.   In March, union leaders agreed to allow the rank-and-file tovote directly for the union's president, secretary-treasurer andthe 16 vice presidents who make up the Teamsters' general executiveboard.   Until now, Teamsters leaders were appointed by the board, whichin turn was selected by the general president and confirmed byfellow board members.   In a six-month selection process that will begin in October,members will vote for delegates to a June 1991 convention, wherecandidates who receive 5 percent of the delegates' vote will be upfor a ballot in an election in the fall of 1991. All union memberswill be eligible to vote in that election.   Carey hopes to appear on the ballot and says he is trying toassemble a coalition of reform-minded candidates.</TEXT></DOC>
