The federal government this month issued its harshest attack yet on health risks from passive smoking and urged broad action to restrict smoking in the workplace. Some employers plan tougher anti-smoking rules; others already have them in place. Starting this week, the Pittsburgh Press bans smoking in its newsroom. Lighting up will be allowed only in lounges.    UAL Inc., the parent of United Airlines, considers permitting smoking only in posted areas. National Data Corp. of Atlanta is &quot;looking very seriously at a more restrictive policy&quot; as it moves to new quarters. Only one of the firm's top executives is a smoker. McKesson Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. adhere to local bans against smoking in public places.    No bans are planned at Burlington Industries, a textile concern based in North Carolina, the top tobacco-producing state.    POLICE SCORE POINTS for performance and win better work schedules.    The Arlington County, Va., police department begins an innovative pilot plan to reward top-performing day-shift officers. All their tasks were ranked and assigned points. A felony arrest merits 50 points. Writing a parking ticket or responding to a service request such as replacing highway signs is worth one point. Ranked in between are arrests for driving while intoxicated and other infractions.    Officers scoring more than 35 points a day -- which is defined as above-average productivity -- are given priority by seniority in picking work schedules and neighborhood assignments. &quot;It's just the opposite of a quota,&quot; says Lt. Earl Flowers, the day-section commander, who says productivity has risen &quot;across the board.&quot;    TOUGH TALK from management is expected again in 1987 labor bargaining.    Contract talks next year cover about 3.1 million workers in the auto, aerospace, airline, construction, food, health-care service and other industries. That represents about 35% of the employees under major agreements. Although the Labor Department says bargaining will be comparatively light in private industry, about half the 2.3 million public-sector workers will be affected.    Analysts expect little softening of management's aggressive bargaining strategy. A survey of 181 firms by the Bureau of National Affairs, a private research group, finds 77% will seek to hold average annual pay raises at 2% to 4%. Many want to relax work rules, reduce cost-of-living protection, and install two-tier wage scales.    The Conference Board predicts first-year wage and benefit increases of 2.5% for union workers, possibly less than the inflation rate.    STOCKING STUFFER: Wells Fargo Bank rewards its employees for their hard work during the firm's acquisition of Crocker National Bank. This month, Wells Fargo's workers got an extra day off and a coffee mug reading &quot;Take a Break.&quot; They also got a $100 bonus and an extra week's paid vacation in 1987.    REAGAN'S &quot;STAR WARS&quot; plan stimulates demand for artificial-intelligence and robotics experts in the aerospace industry, says executive search firm Richards Consultants. It says it recruited 24% more aerospace scientists/executives this year than last, with top annual salaries running near $100,000.    INCENTIVE ORGANIZERS: That's what the American Federation of Government Employees union is recruiting as a supplement to its regular organizers. &quot;High-energy persons with good people and 'sales' skills&quot; can earn, on top of their $15,000 base pay, cash bonuses for organizing extra new members.    PREGNANT WORKING WOMEN need about 271 hours for activities associated with having a baby, says a new time-planning guide published by Little Company of Mary Hospital in Torrance, Calif. Those with morning sickness may lose up to one work hour a day; telling bosses and colleagues they are expecting should take two hours.    ACADEMIC CAREERS rebound as some professional schools see a decline.    A survey shows that the Class of 1986 at Harvard and Radcliffe has more members who will pursue academic careers in the arts and sciences than any other class in a decade. Conversely, interest in law and medicine declines. Occidental College, with a similar increase, links the resurgence in academic careers to a shortage of qualified teachers and an increase in minimum pay at public schools.    The University of Rochester reports a 43% rise in the number of seniors preparing to get teaching credentials in the past year. The number of math and science majors preparing to teach jumps 40%. At the same time, the number of seniors going to law school falls by 34% and those going to medical school declines by 19%.    The state of California projects that there will be 80,000 teaching vacancies in the state by 1990.    THE CHECKOFF: More than 85% of lawyers under age 35 polled by the ABA Journal say their work hurts their love lives. . . . The National Alliance for Women in Communications Industries, formed to represent women's interests in the industry, goes out of business, saying industry leaders were deaf to funding appeals. . . . Nearly half those surveyed by Century Research Corp. in Ridgefield, Conn., say they wouldn't mind if their son became a secretary. </TEXT></DOC>
