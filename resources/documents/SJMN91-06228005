A friend advised usingeggshell water, but I don't eat eggs. What are the best plants requiring onlya little care?;    A Eggshell water on potted plants is not a treatment I'veused but presumably it is designed to &quot;sweeten&quot; acid soil. My advice is stickto plain tap water, applied at room temperature or slightly warmer.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CARE-FREE PLANTS JUST DON'T EXIST; EVEN HARDIESTNEED SOME ATTENTION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  HouseplantsElvin McDonald is a New York-based garden columnist.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Plant leaves do not mysteriously turn yellow as a rule. Usually the soilhas gotten so dry between waterings that the leaves have wilted, or the rootshave been left standing in water until rot has set in. Or the plant has beensuddenly deprived of sunlight.;    If you consistently have trouble withplants becoming too dry between waterings, it may be that the pots are toosmall. Transfer them to several sizes larger if necessary in order to suityour ability to water, which might be only once a week.;    So far as giving alist of plants needing little care, let's be honest: If you really want plantsin the rooms where you live, you must also be willing to take care of them. Itdoesn't take much time or effort; a few minutes every day is all any plantneeds and many can get by, as I have just suggested, being watered asinfrequently as once weekly.;    If a living plant isn't worth a little TLC,why bother? There are &quot;permanent&quot; types that thrive on neglect and makefirst-rate dust-catchers.;    There are unusually durable real plants, some ofthem no doubt to be found at your local garden shop. Anything in widespreaddistribution is fairly tough or it wouldn't be out there in the market.;   There is also that unknown factor having to do with the individual person, theindividual plant, and the particular situation in which they exist. Putanother way, the same plant may thrive in the care of one gardener while itdies in that of another, all things being seemingly equal.;    One fairlyconstant guideline is that all plants need a certain amount of light in orderto live, and even desert cactuses and other succulents have to be watered onoccasion.;    That said, some plants that have survived life with me for manyyears include sansevieria, calathea, syngonium, ficus, pleomele, dracaena,spathiphyllum, pink cissus, African gardenia and murraya. Perhaps surprising,because they are so small, I have also had great and extended success withminiature sinningias in plastic bubble bowls or other small glass enclosures.;   Q You have often written about the African gardenia or mitriostigma. I havea young plant in a five-inch pot. What kind of care will get it to grow welland bloom freely?;    A Mitriostigma grows well in humus-rich soil such asequal parts packaged, all-purpose potting soil, clean sand, peat moss andwell-rotted compost. If you have it, add an extra part of peat moss as thisrelative of the gardenia does best with plenty of acid.;    Mitriostigma alsothrives in warm, fresh, moist air that circulates freely, and with up to ahalf day of direct sun. It also needs generous watering, so there is neverenough dryness to even slightly wilt the leaves.;    Mitriostigma has been oneof my favorite houseplants for many years. I have even managed to give awayseveral after getting them to grow and bloom profusely. This plant does seementicing to brown scale and may also get mealybugs. Weekly sprays ofinsecticidal soap will keep the leaves and stems clean, but only if theundersides are completely coated at each spraying.;    Mitriostigma is alsocalled African gardenia, a name that hints of its creamy white blossoms andseductive fragrance. The flowers are much smaller than the related truegardenia; they are an inch across, single and delightfully pink-tinged. Theyhave a fleeting life but appear in clusters off and on through the year.;   If you don't find mitriostigma through your usual plant sources, ask about itwhen visiting any public garden or arboretum. Mail-order specialists such asLogee's (55 North St., Danielson, Conn. 06239; catalog $3) also list it.;   Most mitriostigma plants are fairly recently rooted cuttings or young bushes,up to 18 inches tall and as wide. After several growing seasons it is possibleto have a specimen three or four feet tall. This kind of increase depends onplenty of all the good things previously mentioned and regular applications offertilizer. I have used various combinations of 14-14-14 timed releasepellets, 30-10-10, 15-30-15 and fish emulsion.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Elvin McDonald column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910815  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  778  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday August 15, 199100228005,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
