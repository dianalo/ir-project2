The Wallingford, Conn., industrial concern was sold in a1987 leveraged buy-out, and it has racked up losses eversince. It was highly leveraged at the time of the LBO, and itis highly leveraged today. Its debt stands at $373 million --19 times its meager $19.5 million of equity.</LP><TEXT>   Now, ever in fashion, Amphenol wants to reduce its debtand is seeking the public's help. Specifically, the companywants to sell stock to the public.   In a preliminary prospectus, Amphenol said it wants tosell 12 million shares, or 44%, to the public at a price in arange of $13.50 to $15.50 a share. If the offering, to be ledby Shearson Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, is completed,Amphenol says it will have the cash to retire all itshigh-cost junk bonds and replace them with lower-cost debt.Then, it says, it would start to show positive earnings pershare.   Analysts say Amphenol's strategy is to join the parade ofcompanies that have reduced debt by going public. Many, suchas Duracell International and AnnTaylor Holdings, have soaredin subsequent trading.   But Amphenol doesn't sell batteries or high-fashionskirts. Its basic business -- making the electricalconnectors that hook up computers and military gear -- is inthe doldrums. The company's sales shrank in 1989 and 1990before increasing a scant 1.3% in this year's first half.Operating profit margins have bounced around in recentquarters but remain well below the 12.8% posted in 1988.   And people who follow the electrical connector industry orhave looked closely at Amphenol are chary about itsprospects. The electrical connector industry &quot;is having avery difficult time,&quot; says John Lazlo, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. The two biggest sets of customers -- defensecompanies and computer makers -- are retrenching and havescaled back orders.   Connector companies haven't been able to impose priceincreases for as long as seven years, Mr. Lazlo says, and hedoesn't see much prospect of price boosts soon. If anything,he says, &quot;there's intensified competition.&quot;   In the past year, the connector industry's second largestcompany, Molex, has been picking up overseas market share atthe expense of the traditional industry leader, AMP. Thus,while Amphenol says it's the second largest U.S. connectorcompany, it's an also-ran on a global scale -- at best, tiedfor third place with a handful of other world-widemanufacturers.   Apparently, Amphenol is shedding debt in the nick of time.Without the offering, Bruce Hyman of Standard andamp; Poor's warns,Amphenol's &quot;financial strain&quot; is expected to remain severe,with &quot;potential for default on its interest payments.&quot;   The prospectus spells out a Cinderella-like transformationto a healthy company, which would be expanded to include twosmall companies that Amphenol plans to buy from its majorityowners. And insiders would win big: Amphenol's 75-year-oldchairman, Lawrence DeGeorge, acquired his controlling stakeat roughly $4 a share.   Amphenol's treasurer, James Rogers, contends that Amphenolis offering stock at a price that, &quot;when you compare it toothers in the industry, will look good.&quot; By &quot;good,&quot; he meanscheap. But at the midpoint of its desired price range,Amphenol would sell at about 20 times trailing proformaearnings -- hardly a steal for what is no longer a growthindustry.   And Amphenol is leaving angry junk-bond investors in itswake. Last month, its investment bankers at Shearson Lehmanmanaged to buy back at a discount $50 million of thecompany's $215 million in junk bonds -- just before the plansto go public were announced.   Believing that Amphenol's finances were precarious,bondholders sold the bonds to Lehman in early August at 70cents on the dollar, slightly above market prices at thetime. After the company said it wanted to go public, its junkbonds soared. Yesterday, traders quoted Amphenol's 15% bondsof 1997 at about 90 cents on the dollar.   Lehman officials say they made adequate disclosures,telling bondholders that Amphenol was &quot;exploring a variety ofdifferent restructuring possibilities.&quot; However, the Lehmanofficials say they didn't mention the prospect of a stockoffering.   For now, its as if the bondholders' loss is Amphenol'sgain. But given the price-earnings multiple of the offeringand the prosaic nature of the industry, it's reasonable towonder whether Amphenol's future shareholders will be anymore content than its junk-bond holders.   ---               De-leveraging at Amphenol                                                                                                                        (Figures in millions)                                                                                                                                              ACTUAL       PRO                                        AS OF      FORMA                                      JUNE 30     WITH IPO                                                                                                        Long-term debt                        $373.1      $322.8 Shareholder's equity                    19.5       246.3 Debt/equity ratio                    19 to 1    1.3 to 1                                                                                                                                RESULTS                                                                                                                                 6 MONTHS                             ENDED                           JUNE 30       1990        1989                                                                                                        Sales                      $219.6     $420.9      $421.1 Operating Income             25.7       45.9        47.0 Net Loss                      4.8       12.1        14.5</TEXT></DOC>
