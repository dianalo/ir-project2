Ask Jack Tymann. His goal of upgrading the air trafficcontrol system took off when the Soviet Union splintered into15 independent republics. The Soviet general who used tocontrol civil aviation was uncivil to foreigners with designson Soviet airspace. But now the general has been replaced bya woman -- and she'll meet with Mr. Tymann in Moscow nextmonth.</LP><TEXT>   While the military interference is gone, however, moneyhas become a big problem. Before, there was one centralforeign-trade bank, Vnesheconombank, that provided all Sovietgovernment guarantees for project financing. Now that bank isnearly bankrupt -- and no replacement has emerged so far.Unless someone provides loan guarantees, the project will bedead, frets Mr. Tymann, an executive at Westinghouse ElectricCorp. and the point man for a six-company internationalgroup.   At the end of 1987, there were only 23 joint venturesbetween the Soviet Union and foreign interests. By last July,that figure had grown to more than 2,000. And now, as Mr.Tymann and others like him are discovering, the demise ofossified bureaucracies is enabling Western businesses to cutdeals directly with local officials and managers. ButAmerican and European executives also spend much of theirtime figuring out just who is in charge, what laws they'll beoperating under and how to circumvent a currency in ruins.   &quot;There's total chaos. Nobody knows who's responsible forwhat,&quot; says Czechoslovak businessman Igor Junas, who runsKerametal Foreign Trade Co., a concern that does extensivemetal trading. Kerametal used to have one procurementcontract with one central authority. Now, it negotiatesdirectly with representatives of three mines in Georgia,Russia and Ukraine, none of whom has ever before acted as anindependent businessman.   The dissolution of the central government has createdunprecedented unknowns. Perhaps the biggest is who owns what.One European bank says its purchase of St. Petersburg realestate has been delayed for months -- because it can't getclear title to the property.   While new republic laws affecting privatization, jointstock companies and taxation seem compatible with those ofthe old union, many macroeconomic issues have been left tochance. Western concerns, for instance, face the prospect ofdealing with multiple currencies as the ruble dissolves --and with multiple inflation rates. Moreover, the Commonwealthof Independent States hasn't adopted a central registrationsystem for medicines, as Western drug makers had hoped itwould.   Newmont Mining Corp. of Denver finds itself stymied intalks with officials in Uzbekistan who have never negotiateda business contract. &quot;They have no one to tell them this isthe way the law works,&quot; says James F. Hills, vice presidentof corporate affairs at Newmont, which wants to mine andrefine the region's rich gold deposits and hopes to form ajoint venture.   Some companies don't even know whether the agencies theyonce reported to still exist. Polaroid Corp.'s two-year-oldjoint venture has continued producing camera parts despitethe political changes. But its chief partner, the SovietMinistry of Atomic Energy and Industry, no longer exists.&quot;We're trying to find out what that means, if anything, forour operations,&quot; says a Polaroid spokesman.   Meanwhile, Western companies that had been negotiatingwith the old central government are sometimes viewedsuspiciously by the independent republics. Consider ChevronCorp., which a year ago was close to winning a contract todevelop the giant Tengiz oil field in Kazakhstan near theCaspian Sea. Since then, Kazakh officials nationalized thefield. Although talks continue, &quot;the ride's been a littlebumpy,&quot; says Daniel Johnson, Chevron's manager of public andgovernmental affairs.   When the talks began, it was assumed the project's oilexports would generate hard currency. That currency in turnwould have allowed the central government to buy goods from aconsortium of companies allied with Chevron, includingJohnson andamp; Johnson, Eastman Kodak Co. and RJR Nabisco HoldingsInc. But with the Soviet government dead -- and the fate ofthe ruble in question -- the consortium disbanded. &quot;Untilthere are some encouraging signs over there, you're not goingto see substantial investment,&quot; says James H. Giffen, afounder of the consortium.   One impediment for the consortium was its sheercomplexity. Simpler ventures, involving less money and fewerparties, are less likely to get derailed.   &quot;The more ambitious plans are on hold,&quot; says Robert Starr,head of the Central and Eastern European practice of Cole,Corette andamp; Abrutyn, a Washington law firm. &quot;People realizewe're at a stage where things could get a lot worse beforethey get better, so most people are scaling down theirambitions.&quot;   That's the strategy at Digital Equipment Corp., whichopened a Moscow office in December, only days before theSoviet flag flew for the last time above the Kremlin. Thecompany plans additional offices in St. Petersburg and Kiev.But Digital's investment is modest. &quot;Our employees number inthe tens, not hundreds,&quot; says a spokesman. &quot;We'reestablishing modest sales offices, not manufacturing plants.&quot;   Many companies anticipated the Soviet Union's dissolutionand had sought contacts in the four most populous republics,Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. One such company isAnglo-Suisse L.P., a small oil outfit in Houston. Thecompany's joint venture started drilling last summer inSiberia, and although it isn't yet profitable, exports havestarted to Italy. Anglo-Suisse says it signed agreementsearly on with city and regional officials in Siberia, as wellas in Moscow.   So far, Anglo-Suisse says there hasn't been anyinterference in its operations. Company officials say theyare planning dozens of new wells, requiring the import ofexpensive Western equipment, in the next three years.   A far graver question than who is in charge is how the newgovernments will pay for goods and services. The removal ofstate price controls has sent prices skyrocketing for manygoods and has made the ruble almost worthless.   Moreover, within republics, few banks have emerged thatcan guarantee loans the way the central trade bank used to.That gap is keeping Japanese investors on the sidelines. &quot;Aguarantee from the central bank of each republic is necessary{for Japanese companies to make investments}, but theseinstitutions aren't functioning yet,&quot; says an official at amajor Japanese trading company.   The collapse of the ruble may cause Gillette Co. torenegotiate terms of a joint venture to make shaving productsin St. Petersburg. Initially, Gillette had agreed to receivehard currency at a set exchange rate that is increasinglyirrelevant in a hyper-inflationary environment.   Some republics are running out of hard currency to pay forsuch critical goods as food and food-processing equipment.U.S. grain exporters, which shipped about 60 million bushelsof wheat to the republics in December, expect to do briskbusiness this spring. That's largely because one old centralagency -- Exportkhleb, the Soviet grain importing agency --has been converted into a grain-buying company that's jointlyowned by the republics.   Still, cash shortages will affect the farm sector. Westernbanks agreed to loan the Gorbachev government some $3 billionlast year to buy U.S. food after the White House guaranteedrepayment. Last week, as scheduled, the republics are said tohave made their first loan payment of less than $2 million.But they face another $333 million in payments through spring-- and if they default, the White House could balk at moreloan guarantees.   The cash crunch is causing companies to create barterarrangements. Tambrands Inc., a personal-care productsconcern in White Plains, N.Y., used ruble profits from afactory in Ukraine, where it makes Tampax tampons, to buy acotton bleachery in St. Petersburg from the workers'collective that privatized it. &quot;We'd never have been able todo that deal unless Russia had become independent,&quot; says PaulE. Konney, senior vice president of Tambrands.   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., meanwhile, will payfor its 39% stake in Ukraine's telephone authority byproviding switching equipment. Under the transaction,announced last week, ATandamp;T will get its hard-currency profitspartly from long-distance calls from other countries toUkraine. The venture marks the first time the company hasmoved to construct, own and operate a long-distance phonenetwork outside the U.S.   Not all of the change has been for the worse. Ply GemIndustries Inc., for example, a New York maker ofhome-improvement products, has a joint venture called RussianWood Express, which can now keep as much as 50% of its exportrevenue, up from about just 15% under the Soviet regime.   And Kodak finds it can hire talented Russian managers andworkers at a modest cost. Among the recent applicants: aPh.D. physicist employed by a state research institute whoearns just $12 a month at current exchange rates. Says EdwardHoppe, Kodak's vice president for Eastern Europe: &quot;There areincredibly talented people who are anxious for jobs.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
