(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Air Force isspending $90 million to rebuild a launch pad for its new Titan 4rockets, which will take secret military payloads into space, anofficial said.   Space Launch Complex-4 East has been used for Titan 34D launchessince 1982 and was rebuilt after one exploded in April 1986.   The Titan 4 will carry payloads previously intended for the spaceshuttle. Vandenberg's shuttle pad was dismantled in the aftermath ofthe Challenger disaster.   The 1986 explosion of the Titan 34D destroyed what was reportedlya spy satellite and put the launch pad and one close by out ofcommission for more than a year.   The Air Force spent $50 million to rebuild the two pads so itcould continue launching the Titan 34Ds, said Col. John E. Angell,who is in charge of Air Force space launches from Vandenberg.   The launch pads were further rebuilt to handle the Titan 4launches, he said.   The first Titan 4 launched at Vandenberg likely will carry a $1billion KH-12 spy satellite, said John Pike, a space policy expertwith the Federation of American Scientists.   The reconnaissance satellite is capable of taking sharpphotographs of the Earth's surface through clouds, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
