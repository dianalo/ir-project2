The April 18 decision grew out of a suit filed by an animalrights group against a local angling club that staged a fishingcontest two years ago.   The object of the contest was to see which fisherman could catchthe most pounds of fish in two days. After the fish were pulled inand weighed, they were returned to the water.   Civil court Judge Horst Brinkmann based his decision ontestimony of experts called in to determine whether or not fishfeel pain when hooked, and if they suffered during the time theywere out of the water.   Four wildlife experts testified that an increased heart rate andlabored breathing of the fish after they were pulled from the waterindicated that they feel pain.   Brinkmann ruled that fishing was permissible if fish werequickly killed, and if they were caught for useful purposes. But headded that simply catching the fish to weigh and determine whichangler was more skilled subjected the creatures to unusually crueltreatment.   ``Fishing contests serve no further purpose than to determinewho has won,'' Brinkmann ruled.</TEXT></DOC>
