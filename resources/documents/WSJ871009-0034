Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan was said by a close source to believe that Wednesday's increase in banks' prime, or base, lending rates isn't a signal for a further increase in the discount rate, and shouldn't be interpreted as a signal for one. Separately, another Fed policy maker said the board believes &quot;we've got policy about right.&quot;    But central bank officials acknowledged in private comments that their policy stance could change if they see signs of increased fears of inflation in the financial markets, such as a run-up in long-term interest rates.    Since August, the Fed has been pushing up short-term interest rates, such as those on Treasury bills and bank certificates of deposit, largely in response to fears of inflation in the long-term bond market.    Mr. Greenspan and other Fed officials have said publicly that they don't see any signs in current economic statistics that inflation is accelerating. But they decided to boost interest rates anyway, in order to keep fears of inflation in the financial markets from mushrooming into a general inflationary psychology. On Sept. 4, the Reserve Board raised its discount rate to 6% from 5.5%.    Since the discount rate rise, officials say, market fears of accelerating inflation appear to have eased. Although interest rates on long-term bonds have risen somewhat, short-term interest rates have risen even more. Indeed, rates on six-month Treasury bills yesterday rose about a third of a percentage point. As a result, the difference between short rates and long rates -- known in market jargon as the &quot;yield curve&quot; -- is less steep than it was a month ago.    &quot;We consider that a satisfactory indication that the inflation performance is settling down,&quot; one Fed official said yesterday.    Fed officials also expressed concern about recent moves by the West German central bank to boost its interest rates, and about rumors that similar moves may be under way in Japan. &quot;For Germany, in particular, to be tightening with their situation is difficult to understand,&quot; one official said. He noted that the West German economy is growing at a very sluggish pace, and still has high unemployment.    The official added that &quot;there is a stronger case for a tighter policy in Japan than in Germany.&quot;    Some financial analysts fear that higher interest rates in Germany and Japan could force the Fed to boost interest rates here. That's because higher interest rates abroad could cause the dollar to fall, as international investors shift away from dollar-denominated assets to take advantage of improved interest earnings overseas.    But the Fed official said that any fall in the dollar caused by tighter policies in West Germany and Japan wouldn't necessarily prompt the Fed to tighten. &quot;It's not the kind of thing that would lead us to raise interest rates,&quot; the Fed official said.    Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson has argued that any fall in the dollar caused by excessively stringent monetary policies overseas shouldn't raise inflation concerns in the U.S. If such a dollar drop occurred, the Fed might not try to stop it, and urge West Germany and Japan to reverse their interest rate increases.    The Fed and Treasury Secretary James Baker have been urging the West Germans and the Japanese to pursue policies that stimulate growth and thus boost U.S. exports.    If the falling dollar fueled inflation fears in the financial markets, however, the Fed might feel compelled to boost interest rates in response, as it did last month.
