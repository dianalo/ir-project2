 The following can be viewed as a guide to buildingthe Multimedia Company from Hell.andM;Here are our Big Mistakes, in a vague order of importance.andM;Fail to offer enough supportandM;In general, multimedia products are used by professionals who are earning allor most of their living creating audiovisual communications, documentation,marketing communications and so forth.andP;  The market isn't hobbyists and casualusers yet, so that vendors have to pay particular attention to the needs ofthe serious users.andM;Support isn't just for users.andP;  Resellers need help, too, especially those whoaren't computer resellers, such as professional video equipment resellers.andM;Newsletters, application notes, bulletin boards and seminars are a few of thesupport mechanisms that you should employ.andM;Set prices too lowandM;In a market that's made up mostly of professionals, low prices are dumb andcostly, since you need the money to pay for heavy support.andM;People who create multimedia for a living aren't sensitive to the initialprice of the product.andP;  They're sensitive to the long-term cost, which ismeasured in their productivity.andP;  Charge them plenty and give them theirmoney's worth!andM;Fall in love with random-access informationandM;A badly designed HyperCard stack isn't an information product, it's anadventure game, to paraphrase Reese Jones, president of Farallon.andP;  The sameis true of all hypermedia products.andP;  It's true that random access toinformation is possibly the most valuable asset that interactive systemsoffer.andP;  But structure is important, too, especially when you're creating aproduct that tries to teach.andM;Forcing people to wander through information is like making someone runthrough a maze to find dinner.andP;  Browsing is only useful if you don't knowwhat you want--and neither does the computer.andM;Avoid your customersandM;Those pesky customers can really cause trouble by tying up your phone linesand creating work for your staff.andP;  But as Dan Ryder writes in this issue (seepage 6), consulting work is a great way to understand your customers' needs.andM;You many be aware (heavens, we hope you are!) of our International Directoryof Multimedia Producers, as well as the classes we sponsor.andP;  We don't make awhole lot of money on those products--but they keep us in touch with ourcustomers, which is vital.andP;  It was only by talking to customers that werecognized the great need for the &quot;Multimedia Producer's Legal SurvivalGuide,&quot; which we published this month.andP;  It's selling very well.andM;Build self-contained productsandM;All the information in the world is accessible by computer, or it can easilybe put into a computer, so there's no need to integrate multimedia productswith the &quot;real world.&quot;andP;  Wrong, wrong, wrong.andM;The major driving force for information systems growth in the '90s won't becreation of information, it'll be management -- coping with informationoverload.andP;  A lot of the information overload problem isaudiovisual--television, radio, voice mail, training, documentation, etc.andO;Using computers to cope with the mess is a big opportunity.andM;Design products that replace peopleandM;If you're creating courseware or marketing communications products, don't tryto replace the teacher or sales person -- help them.andP;  The greatest marketwill be for products that help people, rather than replacing them.andM;This idea is very closely related to the one above.andP;  Teachers and salespeoplehave greater information overload problems than almost anyone else.andP;  That'swhy, for example, California's Superintendent of Schools is developingScience 2000, which is a teacher's resource manager.andM;Fancy interactive marketing kiosks that try to advertise, sell, close thesale, manage the inventory and chart the financials may look terriblyattractive in theory, but there are very few places they'll be accepted.andO;There will be a few such revolutions, but most of the growth will beevolutionary.andM;Remember this: the vast majority of teachers and sales people don't usecomputers.andP;  Start by helping them, not replacing them.andM;Use too much technologyandM;One step at a time, please.andP;  There are a few gifted souls, such as RobertAbel, the folks at the Apple Multimedia Lab, and the MIT Media Lab, who arerevolutionaries, able to develop futuristic systems.andM;But there isn't a lot of reward in overwhelming people with systems that tryto do everything.andP;  There's no reward in building systems that try to dothings that aren't possible.andM;Start small, think add-on.andP;  Not only will you avoid overwhelming yourcustomers, you'll make your resellers very happy, because they won't have tokeep finding new customers to stay in business.andP;  Selling to past customers isapproximately a gizillion times easier than finding new ones.andM;Using the wrong medium in the wrong placeandM;Wanna really screw up?andP;  Use text to introduce and motivate the user--hire aworld-class writer to create a great introduction to your product, then forcethe user to read it from the screen.andP;  Use audio to communicate a spreadsheet.andO;How about text to describe a ballet dancer's movement?andM;Perhaps you could teach someone to drive with a keyboard?andM;Multimedia is great, but it's very, very easy to use media inappropriately.andO;Stop and think about what video does well, what text does well, what icons dowell, what query-by-example does well.andP;  And so forth.andP;  Never, everunderestimate the importance and subtlety of interface design.andP;  The interfaceis the boundary across which the computer and user must communicate.andP;  If youchoose the wrong &quot;road&quot; (medium) across the boundary, you're going to fail.andM;As a brief refresher, here's the capsule version of the four-layer model thatwe employ to understand what medium works where.andM;* Introduction and motivation -- this is where audiovisual materials andgraphics excel.andM;* Information navigation -- following linked paths is fine when you knowapproximately what you're looking for; query-by-example is great for tabularmaterial such as databases; but for really complex systems, you have toinclude some kind of &quot;agent&quot; to help the user get in the vicinity of theinformation he or she wants.andM;* Information acquisition and analysis -- cold, hard facts are mostlyexpressed in text and numbers, but audiovisual materials are important inspecial cases: simulation and visualization, taking you places you can't go,and showing inherently audiovisual data, such as movement or sounds analysis.andM;* Creative tools -- often forgotten, the tools to create the material in thefirst three layers are essential to growth and learning.andM;Next month -- more stupid ideas.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
