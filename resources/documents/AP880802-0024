Neither Fitzwater nor State Department spokeswoman PhyllisOakley would dwell on the contents of the message. Fitzwater saidit did address the issue of the return of Iranian assets, estimatedto be worth more than $1 billion, that the United States froze inthe wake of the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.   Fitzwater said the message indicated the United States would beexpected to move on the assets issue or ``some other quid pro quokind of movement, which we are not prepared to do.''   Last week, Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of Iran's parliamentand acting commander-in-chief of Iranian armed forces, said hewould help obtain the release of American hostages in Lebanon ifthe United States returned the assets.   ``No deals,'' Fitzwater retorted at the time, reflectingrepeated official U.S. statements that there would be nonegotiations with Iranian officials for the release of nineAmericans believed held hostage in Lebanon by people sympathetic tothe revolutionary government of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   Fitzwater repeated that stand Monday, saying: ``We have alwayssaid that the best signal they can give to new relations and newdialogue is to release the hostages. But we don't make the directlinkage. In fact, we just simply state they should release thehostages.''   At the State Department, Mrs. Oakley said the Iranian messagecame late Friday through a ``third party.''   ``We simply said that we had sent a message. We had aresponse.'' Asked whether the United States had replied to Iran,she said: ``No.''   The Reagan administration had written a letter to Irancongratulating the government for accepting U.N. Security CouncilResolution 598, seeking a cease-fire to the Iran-Iraq war andexpressing an interest in an improvement of relations.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Sunday that he iswilling to meet with his Iranian counterpart to discuss an end tothe Iran-Iraq war, terrorism and hostage-taking _ but not thereturn of Iranian assets.   U.S. officials are trying to find ``an authoritative channel''for direct talks with Iran, but Shultz said he has not sought ameeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati during theIranian official's visit to the United Nations for peace talks.   The frozen Iranian assets include military equipment and somefunds in American bank accounts.   Many of the assets were released in January 1981, as Iran freedthe Americans embassy hostages after a 444-day ordeal. A specialtribunal in The Hague, which arbitrated claims by the twogovernments, has jurisdiction over the assets that remain frozen.Iran has petitioned that tribunal for return of those assets.</TEXT></DOC>
