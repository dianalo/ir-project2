LaserJet Series II, even ignoring the recentannouncement of a LaserJet III, remains the best-selling laser printer in itsmarket.andP;  Recognizing this, all the competitors include LaserJetcompatibility.andM;However, the more well-heeled computer users active in desktop publishingprefer more expensive printers for their PostScript capability.andP;  The reasonfor the preference is clear: Based on the Adobe standard, the PostScriptlanguage outdoes the Printer Control Language (PCL) native to the LaserJet infonts, with greater ability to manipulate existing fonts to create others.andM;The chief disadvantage remains the cost, with the typical PostScript printerthousands of dollars more expensive.andM;One of the first to offer a solution has been Pacific Data Products, anestablished manufacturer of HP cartridges.andM;That solution is the $695 Pacific Page PostScript Language EmulationCartridge.andP;  Though it specifies support for the LaserJet II, other versionsare expected to follow.andM;The most important requirement that LaserJet owners need to know prior topurchasing is that they will need to add 2M of memory to the existing 512K ofthe standard printer if they have not yet done so.andP;  Such a board is availabledirectly from Pacific Data in its 1-2-4 Plus memory board, as well as fromother sources.andM;Insert the cartridge into the left socket of the memory-enhanced LaserJet.andO;Power up the printer, which now has a different warm-up cycle display andtakes longer.andM;If there are no error messages, proceed with a test page.andP;  After that, try afonts test.andP;  The latter takes about six minutes, with about a dozentypestyles exhibited, each in four fonts.andM;The cartridge provides a large number of new fonts ranging in size from 6points to at least 30 points, depending on software.andP;  The application program-- word processor, desktop publisher, or spreadsheet, for instance -- shouldallow a printer driver that is for a generic PostScript printer or an AppleLaserWriter.andM;I tested the cartridge with Total Word from Volkswriter Inc., Monterey,Calif.andP;  I installed a new printer driver and added new typestyles to TotalWord running in a Motorola 80286 AT clone.andM;A minor downside would be the inability to use old files produced underordinary LaserJet PCL commands or to use software that doesn't supportPostScript.andP;  However, the package includes both hardware and softwareswitches.andP;  You can always remove the cartridge before turning on the printer.andO;Hence, you do not need to convert files.andM;With the PostScript Emulation Cartridge installed, the LaserJet now displaysfile-size information as the computer downloads files.andP;  An advantage to usingthe cartridge is the same as that of the company's well-known 25-in-One fontscartridge, and its more recent Headlines in a Cartridge: speed and memory.andO;Whereas soft fonts consume RAM and take time to download, there is no suchproblem here.andM;Indeed, there is so much ROM in the casing that you get 35 typefaces, eachscalable in size.andP;  I was pleased with the output, ranging from a lilliputian6 points up to a headline-size 30 points.andM;With the Pacific Page PostScript Language Emulation Cartridge, theHewlett-Packard LaserJet Series II is transformed into a plug-in PostScriptprinter with a rich array of sharp, attractive new fonts.andP;  It worksbeautifully and simply, limited solely by your application software.andP;  It is afar less expensive way to get PostScript capability.andM;Pacific Data Products, San Diego, tel.andP;  619-552-0880.andM;Michael W.
