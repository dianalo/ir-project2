(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Only enough nuclear waste to carry outexperiments will be placed in the repository planned as thenation's first resting place for defense-related radioactivewastes, the Department of Energy says.   The department said Tuesday it was following the NationalAcademy of Sciences' recommendations to test whether WIPP, theWaste Isolation Pilot Plant in underground salt beds near Carlsbad,is suitable as a permanent repository.   The department also said that by June it would meet theacademy's request for a detailed five-year plan for itsexperimental waste disposal program for the repository, which wasdesigned to contain low- and intermediate level wastes.   Both recommendations were made in report of the WIPP Panel ofthe academy's Board of Radioactive Waste Management on March 3,about four months after scientists told Congress that water seepinginto the repository threatened its ability to safely store wastesthat would remain radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years.   The academy panel, however, concluded that technicaluncertainties regarding brine seepage at the plant were not seriousenough to halt research at the site. Shipments of waste are tobegin arriving in October.   Energy Department officials said Tuesday the academy report willassist in resolving the issue of brine accumulation at the site andwill be useful in burying waste in a manner that protects of theenvironment.   About 25,000 barrels of waste will be delivered to the site inthe first 1{ years of the test, the department's Albuquerque officesaid Tuesday. The department originally had planned to entomb125,000 barrels of wastes during the next five years.</TEXT></DOC>
