More particularly, the present invention relates to a process      for producing a composite between a polyester fiber and a nitrile      group-containing highly saturated copolymer rubber of low iodine value. </PAR><PAR>  A fiber-rubber composite is used in automobile timing belts, polyribbed      belts, conveyer belts, hoses, diaphragms, etc. As the rubber for such a      composite, there has conventionally been used an oil-resistant      acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer rubber (NBR); however, a nitrile      group-containing highly saturated copolymer rubber having heat resistance      and oil resistance has come to be widely used recently. </PAR><PAR>  The present inventors had previously found that a composite between      polyester fiber and nitrile group-containing highly saturated copolymer      rubber, excellent in initial adhesion strength and heat-resistant adhesion      strength can be produced by subjecting a polyester fiber before making      into said composite, first to a treatment with an adhesive composition      consisting mainly of a latex of a vinylpyridine-conjugated diene type      copolymer containing a vinylpyridine unit in an amount of not less than      20% by weight but not more than 70% by weight and a      resorcinol-formaldehyde resin, and then to a treatment with an adhesive      composition consisting mainly of a latex of a nitrile group-containing      highly saturated copolymer rubber having an iodine value of 120 or less      and a resorcinol-formaldehyde resin (Japanese Patent Application No.      21998/1989), which corresponds to EPA 381,457, filed Jan. 30, 1990. </PAR><PAR>  The present inventors made further study on a composite between polyester      fiber and nitrile group-containing highly saturated copolymer rubber and      consequently found that the use of a nitrile group-containing highly      saturated copolymer rubber of low iodine value in said composite gives a      composite of excellent heat resistance and weather resistance and further      that the composite produced from a polyester fiber treated with the      above-mentioned two adhesive compositions and a nitrile group-containing      highly saturated copolymer rubber had different properties depending upon      the type of vulcanizing system used in production of the composite. The      present invention has been completed based on the above finding. </PAR><PAR>  According to the present invention, there is provided a process for      producing a polyester fiber-rubber composite comprising: </PAR><PAR>  a polyester fiber treated with 1 an adhesive composition (AR) consisting      mainly of a latex (A) of a vinylpyridine-conjugated diene type copolymer      containing a vinylpyridine unit in an amount of not less than 20% by      weight but not more than 70% by weight and a resorcinol-formaldehyde resin      and then with (2) an adhesive composition (BR) consisting mainly of a      latex (B) of a nitrile group-containing highly saturated copolymer rubber      having an iodine value of 120 or less obtained by emulsion polymerization      or by emulsion polymerization followed by hydrogenation in the emulsion      state and a resorcinol-formaldehyde resin, and </PAR><PAR>  a nitrile group-containing highly saturated copolymer rubber of low iodine      value, which process comprises bonding said polyester fiber and said      nitrile group-containing highly saturated copolymer rubber having an      iodine value of 20 or less, by vulcanizing by a peroxide vulcanizing      system. </PAR><PAR>  In the latex (A) of a vinylpyridine-conjugated diene type copolymer used in      the present invention, the copolymer constituting the latex (A) can be any      vinyl-pyridine-conjugated diene type copolymer as long as it contains a      vinylpyridine unit in an amount of not less than 20% by weight but not      more than 70% by weight. However, in view of the adhesion strength, the      copolymer preferably contains a vinylpyridine unit in an amount of 25-60%      by weight and a conjugated diene unit in an amount of 40-75% by weight.      The copolymer may contain other monomer unit(s) in amount(s) of not more      than 40% by weight, as long as the meritorious effects of the present      invention are not impaired. </PAR><PAR>  The conjugated diene used in the synthesis of the latex (A) is not      particularly restricted and its specific examples include aliphatic      conjugated dienes such as 1,3-butadiene, isoprene,      2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene and halogen-substituted      butadienes. These conjugated dienes can be used singly or in combination      of two or more. </PAR><PAR>  The vinylpyridine used in the synthesis of the latex (A) is desirably      2-vinylpyridine. However, 2-vinylpyridine may be partially or wholly      replaced by at least one of 3-vinylpyridine, 4-vinylpyridine,      2-methyl-5-vinylpyridine, 5-ethyl-2-vinylpyridine, etc. </PAR><PAR>  As the monomer(s) copolymerizable with the conjugated diene and      vinylpyridine, there can be mentioned, for example, aromatic vinyl      compounds such as styrene, .alpha.-methylstyrene, 2-methylstyrene,      3-methyl-styrene, 4-methylstyrene, 2,4-diisopropylstyrene,      2,4-dimethylstyrene, 4-tert-butylstyrene, 5-tert-butyl-2-methylstyrene,      monochlorostyrene, dichlorostyrene, monofluorostyrene,      hydroxymethylstyrene and the like; unsaturated carboxylic acids such as      acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, cinnamic acid, itaconic      acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, butenetricarboxylic acid and the like;      unsaturated monocarboxylic acid esters such as methyl acrylate, ethyl      acrylate, methyl methacrylate and the like; unsaturated dicarboxylic acid      esters such as ethyl itaconate, butyl fumarate, butyl maleate and the      like; unsaturated sulfonic acids and their salts such as sodium salt of      sulfoethyl acrylate, sodium salt of sulfopropyl methacrylate,      acrylamido-propanesulfonic acid and the like; and aliphatic vinyl      compounds such as ethylene, propylene, acrylonitrile, vinyl chloride and      the like. These compounds can be used singly or in combination of two or      more. </PAR><PAR>  The vinylpyridine-conjugated diene type copolymer can be produced usually      be emulsion polymerization but may be produced by other method. The method      of monomers addition in polymerization is not particularly restricted,      either. In one method, all monomers are fed into a polymerization vessel      in one portion to effect polymerization in one stage; in another method,      part of the monomers is polymerized and then the rest of the monomers is      added in one portion to continue polymerization (in this method, the      polymerization is effected in two stages); in still another method, part      of the monomers is polymerized and then the rest of the monomers is added      continuously or intermittently to effect polymerization. </PAR><PAR>  The latex (A) can be directly produced by emulsion polymerization, or can      be produced by subjecting an organic solution of a copolymer obtained by      other polymerization method, to phase inversion. </PAR><PAR>  The nitrile group-containing highly saturated copolymer rubber constituting      the latex (B) used in the present invention is not particularly restricted      as long as it is a nitrile group-containing copolymer rubber having an      iodine value of 120 or less, preferably 100 or less in view of the initial      adhesion strength. However, there is ordinarily used a copolymer rubber      containing an .alpha.,.beta.-ethylenically unsaturated nitrile unit in a      amount of 10-50% by weight, a conjugated diene unit in an amount of 30-90%      by weight and an ethylenically unsaturated monomer unit in an amount of      0-20% by weight. </PAR><PAR>  Such a nitrile group-containing highly saturated copolymer rubber may be      obtained directly as a copolymer having an iodine value of 120 or less, or      may be obtained by hydrogenating a nitrile group-containing copolymer      rubber of high iodine value (e.g. a copolymer prepared using a large      amount of a conjugated diene). </PAR><PAR>  The .alpha.,.beta.-ethylenically unsaturated nitrile used in the synthesis      of the latex (B) can be any as long as it has a nitrile group and      polymerizable unsaturated bond(s), and its specific examples include      acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile. </PAR><PAR>  As the conjugated diene, there can be used the same conjugated dienes as      used in the synthesis of the latex (A). </PAR><PAR>  The ethylenically unsaturated monomer includes unsaturated carboxylic acids      such as acrylic acid, methacyrlic acid, itaconic acid, maleic acid and the      like, as well as their salts; esters of said unsaturated carboxylic acids,      such as methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, butyl(meth)acrylate,      2-ethylhexyl(meth)acrylate trifluoroethyl (meth)acrylate,      tetrafluoropropyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl itaconate, butyl fumarate, butyl      maleate, methoxymethyl (meth)acrylate, ethoxyethyl (meth)acrylate,      methoxyethoxyethyl (meth)acrylate, cyanomethyl (meth)acrylate,      2-cyanoethyl (meth)acrylate, 1-cyanopropyl (meth)acrylate,      2-ethyl-6-cyanohexyl (meth)acrylate, 3-cyanopropyl (meth)acrylate and the      like; (meth)acrylamide; N-substituted (meth)acrylamides such as      N-methylol(meth)acrylamide, N,N'-dimethylol(meth)acrylamide,      N-ethoxymethyl(meth)acrylamide and the like; fluoroalkyl vinyl ethers such      as fluoroethyl vinyl ether and the like; vinylpyridine; and so forth.      There may be further used, as a comonomer, a copolymerizable antioxidant      such as N-(4-anilinophenyl) (meth)acrylamide,      N-4-anilinophenyl)cinnamamide, N-(4-anilinophenyl)crotonamide,      N-(4-anilinophenyl)amino-2-hydroxypropyl (meth)allyl ether,      5-N-(4-anilinophenyl)amino-2-hydroxypentyl (meth)acrylate,      2-N-(4-anilinophenyl)aminoethyl (meth)acrylate,      N-andlsqb;4-(methylanilino)phenylandrsqb;(meth)acrylamide,      N-(4-anilinophenyl)maleinimide, N-andlsqb;4-(methylanilino)phenylandrsqb;maleinimide,      N-phenyl-4-(3-vinylbenzyloxy)aniline, N-phenyl-4-(4-vinylbenzyloxy)aniline      or the like. In the present invention, the ethylenically unsaturated      monomer further includes non-conjugated dienes such as vinylnorbornene,      dicyclopentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene and the like. </PAR><PAR>  Specific examples of the nitrile group-containing highly saturated      copolymer rubber include hydrogenation products of butadiene-acrylonitrile      copolymer rubber, isoprene-butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer rubber,      isoprene-acrylonitrile copolymer rubber, etc.; butadienemethyl      acrylate-acrylonitrile copolymer rubber, butadieneacrylic      acid-acrylonitrile copolymer rubber, etc. and their hydrogenation      products; and butadiene-ethyleneacrylonitrile copolymer rubber, butyl      acrylate-ethoxyethyl acrylate-vinyl chloroacetate-acrylonitrile copolymer      rubber, butyl acrylate-ethoxyethyl acrylate-vinylnorbornene-acrylonitrile      copolymer rubber, etc. </PAR><PAR>  The latex (B) is produced by emulsion polymerization. When the nitrile      group-containing copolymer rubber constituting a latex produced by      emulsion polymerization has an iodine value of more than 120, the      copolymer rubber is hydrogenated so that the rubber after hydrogenation      has an iodine value of 120 or less. This hydrogenation must be effected      for the latex obtained by emulsion polymerization. When the copolymer      rubber constituting a latex produced by emulsion polymerization has an      iodine value of 120 or less, the latex can be used in the present      invention as it is; however, it may be subjected to hydrogenation as      necessary. </PAR><PAR>  It is also known to obtain a latex of a nitrile group-containing highly      saturated copolymer rubber by subjecting an organic solvent solution of      said copolymer rubber to phase inversion. However, the object of the      present invention cannot be attained with the latex obtained by this      method. When a low-saturated copolymer rubber is hydrogenated in a      solution state to obtain a nitrile group-containing highly saturated      copolymer rubber, the obtained rubber must be subjected to phase inversion      to obtain its latex; therefore, the object of the present invention cannot      be attained with this latex, either. </PAR><PAR>  The hydrogenation of the nitrile group-containing copolymer rubber in a      latex state is not particularly restricted; and it can be effected by, for      example, the method described in Japanese Patent Application No.      334831/1988 (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 178305/1990). </PAR><PAR>  The emulsion polymerization for obtaining the latex (B) can be effected by      a conventionally known method. That is, it can be effected batchwise,      semibatchwise or continuously, and neither polymerization temperature nor      pressure is restricted. </PAR><PAR>  The emulsifier used in polymerization is not restricted, either; however,      an anionic surfactant, particularly an anionic surfactant of fatty acid      type is preferred. The amount of the emulsifier used is not particularly      restricted; however, it is 1-10% by weight, preferably 2-6% by weight      based on the total monomers, in view of the adhesion strength of the      adhesive composition obtained with the resulting latex. </PAR><PAR>  The polymerization initiator, molecular weight modifier and other additives      used in polymerization can be those ordinarily used. </PAR><PAR>  It is possible to add to the latex obtained, an antioxidant, a pH-adjusting      agent, etc. as necessary. </PAR><PAR>  The adhesive compositions (AR) and (BR) used in the present invention      consist mainly of the latex (A) and a resorcinol-formaldehyde resin and      the latex (B) and a resorcinol-formaldehyde resin, respectively. In the      adhesive composition (AR) or (BR) used in the present invention, the      amount of the resorcinol-formaldehyde resin is 10-180 parts by weight (as      dried) per 100 parts by weight (as solid) of the latex (A) or (B). </PAR><PAR>  The resorcinol-formaldehyde resin used in the present invention can be      conventionally known resin, for example, the resin disclosed in Japanese      Laid-Open Patent publication No. 142635/1980, and has no particular      restriction. In order to increase its adhesion strength, it can be used in      combination with 2,6-bis(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl-methyl)-4-chlorophenol,      isocyanate, blocked isocyanate, ethylene urea, polyepoxide, modified      polyvinyl chloride resin or the like. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, part of the latex in the adhesive composition      (AR) and/or (BR) can be replaced by at least one latex selected from      styrene-butadiene copolymer rubber latex and modified latex thereof,      acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer rubber latex and modified latex thereof,      natural rubber latex, etc. as long as the scope of the present invention      is not impaired. </PAR><PAR>  The polyester fiber used in the present invention has no particular      restriction as long as it is a linear high molecular polyester composed      mainly of polyethylene terephthalate. As the examples, there can be      mentioned polyester fibers disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No.      50184/1982, etc. which corresponds to U.S. Pat. No. 4,251,409 etc. These      polyester fibers are ordinarily used in the form of thread, cord,      continuous filament, cloth or the like, and may also take other form. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, the polyester fiber is treated first with the      adhesive composition (AR) and then with the adhesive composition (BR). </PAR><PAR>  The methods for treating the polyester fiber with these adhesive      compositions have no particular restriction, and there can be used the      same methods as for known resorcinol-formaldehyde resin/polymer latex type      adhesive compositions. An example of the methods is described. A polyester      fiber is first dipped in an adhesive composition (AR), dried as necessary,      and heated. The heating conditions are not particularly restricted. The      heating is effected at such a time and temperature as the adhesive      composition adhered to the polyester fiber by dipping is reacted and fixed      sufficiently, and it is effected usually at about 140.degree.-about      250.degree. C. for several minutes. The resulting fiber is then dipped in      an adhesive composition (BR), dried as necessary, and heated. The      conditions are the same as in the treatment with the adhesive composition      (AR). It is possible that prior to the above dipping treatments, the      polyester fiber be dipped in an isocyanate compound solution, an epoxy      compound dispersion or their mixture and then dried. The drying      temperature employed in this case is desirably the same as or lower than      the drying temperature employed after dipping in the adhesive      compositions. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, the total amount of the adhesive compositions      adhered to the polyester fiber is not particularly restricted; however, it      is usually 2-20% by weight, preferably 3-10% by weight based on the      polyester fiber. The ratio of the amount (as solid) of the adhesive      composition (AR) to the amount (as solid) of the adhesive composition (BR)      is not particularly restricted, either; however, it is usually 50:50 to      80:20. </PAR><PAR>  The thus obtained polyester fiber is bonded to the nitrile group-containing      highly saturated copolymer rubber of low iodine value by vulcanizing by      using a peroxide vulcanizing system. </PAR><PAR>  The nitrile group-containing highly saturated copolymer rubber (hereinafter      referred to as adherend rubber, in some cases) used in the present      invention for making a composite with the polyester fiber can be a      copolymer rubber between .alpha.,.beta.-ethylenically unsaturated nitrile      and conjugated diene and/or ethylenically unsaturated monomer, or its      derivative. The content of the nitrile group-containing monomer unit in      the adherend rubber is usually 10-60% by weight in view of the oil      resistance of the resulting polyester fiber-rubber composite. (The iodine      value of the adherend rubber is 20 or less.) When the iodine value is more      than 20, the resulting composite has low heat resistance and weather      resistance. In synthesizing the adherend rubber, there can be used the      same monomers as used in the synthesis of the above-mentioned latex of a      nitrile group-containing highly saturated copolymer rubber. </PAR><PAR>  The adherend rubber can be obtained as it is, directly by copolymerizing      the individual monomers. It can also be obtained by hydrogenating a      nitrile group-containing unsaturated copolymer rubber. The polymerization      method and hydrogenation method for obtaining the adherend rubber are not      particularly restricted. As specific examples of the adherend rubber,      there can be mentioned highly saturated butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer      rubber, highly saturated isoprene-butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer      rubber, highly saturated isoprene-acrylonitrile copolymer rubber, highly      saturated butadiene-methyl acrylate-acrylonitrile copolymer rubber, highly      saturated butadiene-acrylic acid-acrylonitrile copolymer rubber, highly      saturated butadiene-ethylene-acrylonitrile copolymer rubber, and butyl      acrylate-ethoxyethyl acrylate-vinylnorbornene-acrylonitrile copolymer      rubber. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, it is necessary that the nitrile group-containing      highly saturated copolymer rubber and the polyester fiber be bonded by      vulcanization with a peroxide vulcanizing system. When there is used a      sulfur vulcanizing system, it is impossible to attain the present object      of obtaining a composite of high adhesion strength. </PAR><PAR>  The peroxide usable in the present invention has no particular restriction      and can be a peroxide ordinarily used in vulcanization of rubber. Specific      examples of the peroxide include dialkyl peroxides such as di-tert-butyl      peroxide, tert-butylcumyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide,      .alpha.,.alpha.-bis(tert-butylperoxyisopropyl)benzene,      2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy)hexane,      2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-butyl-peroxy)hexyne and the like, as well as      peroxyketals such as 1,1-bis(tert-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane,      2,2-bis(tert-butylperoxy)octane, n-butyl bis(tert-butylperoxy)valerate and      the like. Of these, dialkyl peroxides are preferable in view of the      properties of vulcanized rubber compound. </PAR><PAR>  The form of the peroxide used is not particularly restricted and can be a      peroxide form or a mixture with an impregnating agent. </PAR><PAR>  The amount of the peroxide used is 0.5-10 parts by weight, preferably 1-4      parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the adherend, i.e. the nitrile      group-containing highly saturated copolymer rubber. </PAR><PAR>  The conditions for bonding the polyester fiber and the nitrile      rubber-containing highly saturated copolymer rubber by vulcanization are      not particularly restricted and can be the same as conventionally used in      the bonding of a rubber and a fiber by vulcanizing with a peroxide      vulcanizing system. The bonding by vulcanization of polyester fiber and      nitrile group-containing highly saturated copolymer rubber can be achieved      specifically by adding to said rubber a peroxide vulcanizing agent and      compounding agents such as filler and the like to prepare a rubber      compound, embedding a polyester fiber into the rubber compound, and      vulcanizing the resulting system. The conditions of vulcanization are      usually 130.degree.-180.degree. C. for 1-120 minutes under an applied      pressure of 0.5-10 MPa. </PAR><PAR>  The composite between polyester fiber and nitrile group-containing highly      saturated copolymer rubber of low iodine value, obtained by the process of      the present invention is excellent in initial adhesion strength and      heat-resistant adhesion strength, and accordingly is suited for use in      timing belts, polyribbed belts, etc. </PAR></BSUM><DETD> <PAR>  The present invention is described more specifically below with reference      to Examples. In the following Examples and Comparative Example, parts and      % are by weight unless otherwise specified. </PAR><PAC>  PREPARATION OF LATEX (A) </PAC><PAR>  Into an autoclave provided with a stirrer were fed 100 parts of a monomer      mixture shown in Table 1, 150 parts of water, 0.1 part of tetrasodium      ethylenediamine-tetraacetate, 5 parts of sodium lauryl sulfate, 0.5 part      of sodium hydrogencarbonate, 0.5 part of tert-dodecyl mercaptan and 0.3      part of potassium persulfate. The mixture was subjected to a reaction at      60.degree. C. with stirring. When the polymerization conversion reached      95%, 0.05 part of hydroquinone was added to terminate the polymerization.
