In sintered magnets, coercivity progressivelydevelops as H/sub init/ is increased. The variation of S/sub v/ is attributedto different values of the activation volume for different grains. Thevariation of the coercive field deduced from the variation of the coercivefield deduced from the variation of the activation volume correspondsto the experimental one. In MQII magnets, the high field part of thefirst magnetization curve is shown to be determined by the same irreversibleprocesses which govern the magnetization processes on the hysteresisloop. The field dependence of the magnetization and of the magnetic viscositycoefficient S/sub v/ are analyzed assuming that the angular dependenceof the coercive field obeys a simple 1/cos {Theta}law.</TEXT></DOC>
