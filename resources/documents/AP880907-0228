The drop in oil prices Tuesday came as traders continued to loseconfidence in the ability of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries to restrain production.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, futures contracts forOctober delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade ofU.S. crude, dropped 55 cents a barrel to $14.24. Crude prices hadnot been that low on the exchange since October 1986, when theyreached $13.73 per barrel.   The news on oil failed to have much of an impact on othermarkets.   Stock prices rose modestly Tuesday on the momentum of Friday'sstrong gain. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocksincreased 10.67 points to 2,065.26 after leaping 52.28 on Friday.Broader indexes also rose.   The dollar declined against most major currencies and bondprices were little changed, while in the commodities market, porkfutures posted steep losses following indications of a sharpincrease in hog supplies.   In another indication of the economy's direction, Chrysler Corp.reported sales gains for late August and for the entire month, butsales slid at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. compared to ayear ago. Sales were high in August 1987 because the Big Threeautomakers slashed financing rates, analysts said.   Oil market skepticism about the ability of the 13-nation OPEC totrim its output has deepened in recent days, after initial optimismabout cooperation within the cartel resulting from the cease-firebetween OPEC members Iran and Iraq.   ``There's too much oil right now. OPEC is showing a completelack of discipline,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of theenergy group at Elders Futures Inc.   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto recently capped off a series ofmeetings with oil producers by visiting officials in Iran and Iraq,and tried to persuade Iran to allow Iraq a higher production quota.But Subroto made little headway in his efforts to win cooperationamong OPEC members for curbing overall output.</TEXT></DOC>
