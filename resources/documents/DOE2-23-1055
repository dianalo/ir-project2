New ceramic materials are in spite of theirproved and expected properties at a disadvantage with regard to the conventionalmetallic superconductors. The ceramic materials are hard to manufactureinto materials with the requested mechanical properties. The applicationpossibilities of superconduction can increase because of cost reduction.This reduction of costs is a consequence of nitrogen cooling which makesit possible to compete with existing and accepted techniques. This canbe true for steam transport and electric power storage. Magnetohydrodynamic(MHD) techniques as well as fusion techniques can profit too of the developmentsin superconducting ceramic materials. The perspectives for generators,motors and transformers seem to be favorable. 1 fig., 5 refs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
