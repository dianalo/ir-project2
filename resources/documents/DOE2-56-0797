<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-56-0797 </DOCNO><TEXT>We suggest that the CsCl-to-7R structural transition undergone by Ni/subx/Al/sub 1-//sub x/, where 0.6approx. andless;xapprox. andless;0.65, may be attributedto the anharmonic interaction between the {Sigma}{sub 4}{011} phononsand the homogeneous strains associated with the (1/2(c/sub 11/-c/sub12/) elastic constant. We show that the strains predicted by this theoryare compatible with those of the experimentally observed 7R monoclinicunit cell. Also, we purport that the temperature dependence of the elasticconstant (1/2(c/sub 11/-c/sub 12/) is responsible for the very strongdependency of the martensitic start temperature on Ni concentration.Further, if above the transition the minimum of the dip of the {Sigma}{sub4} phonon occurs at {xi}{sub 0}(0,1,1), we show that, since, in principle,there must be a wave-vector dependence of the Landau coefficients appearingin the free-energy expansion, the modulation in the martensitic phasemust correspond to {xi}/sup */(0,1,1), where (i) {xi}/sup */ cannot beequal to {xi}{sub 0} and (ii) {xi}/sup */ need not correspond to a commensuratelock-in value.</TEXT></DOC>
