(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former New York Federal Reserve Bank boardmember pleaded guilty Wednesday to illegally passing on confidentialinterest rate data in the first insider trading case involvinggovernment securities.   In a plea agreement, Robert A. Rough, 50, pleaded guilty to asingle bank fraud charge and the government in exchange dropped twoinsider trading charges and four related counts.   Rough admitted leaking confidential data while he served as a NewYork Fed board member from 1982 to 1984 to a securities firm thatmade about $50 million from the information.   As part of the plea deal, prosecutors also agreed to recommend aprison term of under one year for the former banker. Rough faces amaximum five years in jail and $10,000 fine. Sentencing is set forAug. 18.   Rough's attorney, Michael Himmel, said his client had sentletters of apology to the New York Fed and Federal Reserve Bank inWashington.   ``To me, it's certainly a step in the right direction, an exampleof contrition,'' Himmel said.   U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise called the apologies a``good step.''   Rough admitted giving a Livingston brokerage confidential dataabout the discount rate set by the Fed in Washington. The New YorkFed and 11 sister regional banks make regular recommendations to theFed on the rate, which has a powerful bearing on governmentsecurities.   Rough sat on the New York Fed's board as president of theNational Bank of Sussex County in Branchville. He admitted leakingrecommendations as well as advance word of a change in the Fed'sdiscount rate.   The allegations surfaced during the 1987 trial of a Gilbert C.Schulman, president of the brokerage firm of Bevill, Bresler andamp;Schulman Inc. He and three other Bevill, Bresler officials wereimprisoned for the firm's $144 million collapse in 1985.   Rough admitted that he passed on the data to Schulman, a longtimefriend and business associate, and other principals.   The government said the information allowed the firm to make anestimated $50 million in profits and avoid losses. In exchange,Rough allegedly received $47,000 in interest deferred loans.   After the charges were disclosed, the Fed tightened itsprocedures regarding the discount rate.   Himmel said Rough's disclosures were ``not done out of anymotivation for greed or to line his pockets'' and blamed ``pumpingand prodding by Gilbert Schulman.''   He claimed Rough probably would have received the loans fromBevill, Bresler regardless of whether he provided the information.   Schulman had agreed to cooperate in the prosecution of Rough.   Himmel said Rough, a former chairman of the New Jersey BankersAssociation, admitted the facts outlined in those charges eventhough he was not required to plead guilty to them.   In pre-trial arguments, Himmel argued the discount rate data hadno inherent material value and was not comparable to informationabout stocks. But Debevoise disagreed, ruling that insider tradinglaws could apply to Rough's case.   The insider trading charges would have carried a fine of $100,000per count.</TEXT></DOC>
