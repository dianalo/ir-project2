(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim and Tammy Bakker and a former aidetook money out of PTL and were indifferent to the ministry'sfinancial woes, a PTL attorney says.   In a U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing expected to last all week,PTL representatives are trying to regain $52 million they contendthe Bakkers and former aide David Taggart took throughmismanagement of funds, cash advances on PTL credit cards andunjustified compensation, benefits and fees.   As the trial began Monday, PTL attorney Brad Leggett said theBakkers and Taggart were uninterested in money problems ``whiletaking money out at times faster than it was coming in.''   Peter Bailey, an accountant and financial director at PTL fromJune 1979 through July 1987, testified he routinely warned Bakkerof financial troubles.   Bailey testified today that he was continually frustrated by a``lack of financial integrity'' on the part of Bakker and otherministry executives. Memos regarding cost reductions and a limit ofexpenditures were either ignored or inadequately addressed, hecharged.   Bakker lawyer Ryan Hovis told Judge Rufus Reynolds, who ishearing the case without a jury, that the continuing financialcrisis PTL experienced under Bakker's leadership was not unusual.   ``Every ministry of this type in the nation had the same type offinancial crisis,'' he said.   The Bakkers and Taggart were not in court Monday or today, butHovis told reporters he plans to call them as witnesses when it istime to present their case.   Meanwhile, bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton filed papersin court saying he couldn't meet Monday's deadline to recommend abuyer for the ministry's assets. He asked for an extension untilSept. 27 to continue negotiations.   In court Monday, PTL lawyers maintained that the Bakkers tookhuge personal bonuses while bills weren't being paid, and usedmoney that was raised to build hotels as general operating funds.   Entered into court records were numerous memos from Bailey toBakker recommending such things as cutting expenses, reducingpayroll and using competitive bidding for construction jobs.   Bailey said some staff members were hesitant to approach Bakkerwith information about financial problems. ``He (Bakker) was outthere planning and building, and he had a saying _ he didn't wantto hear any bad news,'' Bailey said.   PTL lawyers used internal documents to detail the ministry'sproblems from 1984-1987. They cited bonuses given to the Bakkersand Taggart at the same time the ministry was having seriousfinancial problems.</TEXT></DOC>
