The Ministry of Finance said last month's trade surplus dipped 10% to $5.93 billion from $6.6 billion in June 1987. The decline was the 14th consecutive year-to-year decline.    Imports, which have been rising sharply for months, jumped 32% in June to $16.08 billion, while exports gained 17% to $22.01 billion. In volume terms, exports rose in June after declining in May.    After seasonal adjustment, however, Japan's trade surplus rose 1.2% in June to $5.2 billion from $5.14 billion in May, with adjusted exports rising 7.7% to $21.95 billion and adjusted imports gaining 9.8% to $16.74 billion. By comparison, the adjusted surplus fell 21% in May from April, when exports fell 6% month to month.    For the U.S., the June figures brought further evidence that it is taking advantage of Japan's efforts to reduce its trade surplus. The Japanese surplus with the U.S. fell 9.5% to $3.63 billion from $4.01 billion the year before. While that represented an increase from $3.3 billion in May, analysts said the overall trend is extremely encouraging, because imports from the U.S. rose 33% year to year to $3.71 billion. Japan's exports to the U.S. were up 8% to $7.34 billion.    William P. Sterling, senior economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in Tokyo, said the increase in U.S. sales to Japan &quot;is consistent with recent overall U.S. export growth and indicates the U.S. export machine continues in high gear.&quot;    On the other hand, said Susumu Saito, chief economist at Credit Suisse Investment Advisory Co., the growth in Japanese exports means that the improvement in Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. will be only gradual. &quot;It will be three to four years before the trade surplus will go down to a manageable level,&quot; Mr. Saito said.    Japanese exports have shown consistent year-to-year growth in dollar terms for several months. That partly has reflected the yen's appreciation during the period; exports last month were calculated at 125.24 yen to the dollar, compared with 142.67 in June 1987. A stronger yen makes dollar-denominated exports more expensive.    But in volume terms, exports have fluctuated. In June, according to a weighted index issued by the Ministry of Finance, export volume rose 4.7% after dropping 0.6% in May. Import volume rose 20% in June after an 18% rise in May.    While exports to the U.S. rose only slowly, Japanese companies found strong demand for their goods in the European Community and Southeast Asia.    Economists say capital-goods exports were particularly strong last month, as U.S. factories retooled to meet strong domestic demand and Japanese companies continued to set up export bases in Southeast Asia. U.S. companies stepped up their capital-goods purchases in several categories last month: Imports of motors rose 35% from June 1987, and semiconductors and other electronics parts soared 77%.    &quot;In the U.S., American firms are now showing very strong investment plans for 1988,&quot; said Nobuyuki Ueda, senior economist with Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. &quot;That explains why the Japanese are now exporting their capital goods to the U.S. very vigorously.&quot;    David Gerstenhaber, senior economist with Morgan Stanley International Ltd., said that the U.S. now is &quot;starting to make progress in selling Japan higher value-added equipment.&quot;    At the same time, Japan's exports of automobiles managed only a slight gain in June. Global shipments rose 8.4% on the year to $3.88 billion, but fell 3.5% in volume terms to 507,860 units. The disparity reflected Japanese auto makers' continued shift toward marketing luxury cars.    U.S. imports of Japanese cars continued to fall in the month, down 13% to $1.7 billion. Mitsutoshi Tomita, an auto industry analyst with James Capel andamp; Co. in Tokyo, said the &quot;prime factor&quot; for the decline was &quot;weak exports by Nissan Motor Co., since its inventories in the U.S. are quite large.&quot;    Japan's imports increased across the board in June. Most important was the rise in purchases of foreign manufactured goods, representing 48% of imports.    Economists said it was too early to see any signs of an impact on U.S.-Japan trade of the roughly 8% appreciation of the dollar against the yen since mid-June. But some said that if the dollar can hold its gains, there may be further declines in Japan's surplus with the U.S. before the current quarter ends. </TEXT></DOC>
