[This is not a toll-free number].</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Over the past several years, both HUD and Congress have expressed growinginterest in increasing the economic mobility of public housing residents.Since 1982, HUD has initiated several demonstrations and technical assistanceprojects designed to improve the economic mobility and general living conditionsof residents in public housing or families eligible for public or assistedhousing (<T3>e.g.,</T3> see the Project Self-Sufficiency notice published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>on May 21, 1984, 49 FR 21433).Under Section 222(a) of the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983(HURRA), Congress authorized the Public Housing Child Care Demonstrationprogram (``PHCC'') for the purpose of determining the feasibility of usingpublic housing facilities to provide child care service for lower incomefamilies residing in public housing.In enacting this demonstration program, it was Congress' belief that residentsof public housing want to be employed or to enroll in training and educationprograms, but that many experience difficulty because they are unable toobtain convenient or affordable care for their children. In 1986, HUD completeda congressionally mandated study of child care programs in public housingprojects. While the study disclosed a wide range of existing child careprograms, it was unable to correlate the effect of these programs on publichousing resident employment. (Copies of this study can be obtained by writingto HUD-USER, P.O. Box 280, Germantown, Maryland 20874).On February 5, 1988, President Reagan signed the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1987 (``the 1987 Act'') (Pub. L. 100-242). Section 117of the 1987 Act amends the PHCC demonstration under HURRA and providesthat grants may be awarded to nonprofit organizations for the purpose ofoperating child care programs that enable the parents or guardians of youngchildren to be employed or to receive employment training. The primaryobjective of the demonstration is to determine whether the availabilityof on-site child care enables public housing residents to obtain or retainjobs, or to enroll in training that might lead to employment.Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) are encouraged to work with the nonprofitgrantee to develop a comprehensive program of providing training, services,and employment for public housing residents in conjunction with the useof PHCC grant funds to establish child care facilities under this demonstration.This also applies to Indian Housing Authorities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Program Requirements</ITAG>1.
