L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., which backs commercial bank deposits, said he foresees nofailures rivaling it in the immediate future.   Regulators picked Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, the nation's25th largest banking company, from among six firms bidding to takeover the insolvent banks with $13.1 billion in assets.   Banc One Chairman John B. McCoy assumes the chairmanship of theTexas institutions on July 5 and will operate them under the name ofBank One Texas.   The Ohio company, one of the most innovative retail bankingoperations in the country, is contributing $500 million in a complexarrangement that will permit it to exclude the Texas operation fromits consolidated balance sheet and maintain its record as one of thenation's five most profitable banks.   The MCorp banks have been under federal control since March 28when regulators stripped them from the parent holding company,leaving five banks and a trust operation still in private hands.   Seidman said $2 billion was the agency's ``best estimate'' of thebailout cost, but cautioned that could end up being $200 million to$300 million too high or too low. Most of the subsidy comes fromcovering losses on the failed banks' $3 billion to $3.5 billion insour commercial real estate loans.   The FDIC will be part owner of Bank One Texas for at least fiveyears.   ``This transaction ranks as the second most expensive in theFDIC's history,'' Seidman said.   The costliest was last year's bailout of First RepublicBank ofDallas, which the agency estimates will wind up costing it $3billion. Third, he said, is the bailout of Continental Illinois ofChicago, which should ultimately require $1.5 billion in federal aid.   ``At this time, for the year 1989, we do not foresee anytransactions near this size,'' Seidman said.   Bank failures have risen for seven years, hitting 221 in 1988,the fifth consecutive post-Depression record. For the first timesince it began operating in 1934, the FDIC saw its reserves decline,dropping from $18.3 billion at the end of 1987 to $14 billion a yearlater.   Seidman said the agency booked its loss for the MCorp rescue lastyear and he expects it to begin rebuilding its reserves this year.He is predicting bank failures will decline slightly from 1988.   However, Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst inAlexandria, Va., said, ``The slate of problems has not been wipedclean. ... We've still got some weak sisters out there in thebanking world.''   He said the sharp deterioration of the Arizona real estate marketwould produce banking problems there. FDIC-insured savings banks inthe Northeast also are slipping because of real estate weakness andbank involvement in financing corporate buyouts will make some biginstitutions vulnerable, he said.   Banc One, in winning the MCorp banks, fended off five rivals:NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., which bought First RepublicBank lastyear; Houston-based Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc., a subsidiary ofChemical Banking Corp.; First City Bancorp. of Houston, itself therecipient of $1 billion federal bailout in 1987; the New York-basedleveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co.; and the Bank ofScotland.   ``The selection of Banc One was the result of a highlycompetitive bidding process in which the margin of difference amongthe finalists was extremely narrow,'' Seidman said.</TEXT></DOC>
