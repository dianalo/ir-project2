Other factors which the energy analystmust also consider are the electric utility rate structure, the priceof fuel used in the cogeneration system, and the working habits of thepeople at the site. The evaluation of cogeneration energy systems forthe purpose of selecting a configuration with the best performance requiresa great amount of effort. A computer program to analyze a cogenerationsystem would greatly reduce the effort needed to evaluate cogenerationsystems. Realizing the need for such a tool, the Naval Civil EngineeringLaboratory developed such a cogeneration analysis computer program, CivilEngineering Laboratory Cogeneration Analysis Program (CELCAP), for thepurpose of evaluating the performance of cogeneration systems on a life-cycleoperating cost basis.</TEXT></DOC>
