Four hundred scientists and public officials from 13 countriesattended the four-day Global Climate Change meeting that focused onthe warming of the atmosphere and damage to Earth's protective ozonelayer.   ``The activities of 5 billion people on Earth are clearlyproducing changes in the world's climate,'' said Mark Harwell,director of Cornell University's Global Environment Program. ``Inour lifetimes, and certainly in our children's, climate changes andother environmental impacts will profoundly affect the way humanslive.''   The participants called for changes in human activities whoseby-products are gases that may be causing a rise in atmospherictemperatures, resulting in hotter summers, droughts, more violentstorms, rising sea levels and an increase in diseases.   The participants urged Congress to pass a more stringent versionof the Clean Air Act, and to stop production by the year 2000 of allchlorofluorocarbons, which cause the ``greenhouse'' effect.   They also recommended that the fuel economy of all new cars beincreased by 1{ mpg per year to at least 42 mpg by the year 2000.Other energy sources, including nuclear plants, should be used moreefficiently and with added safety standards, the participants said.   The conference also urged that land use and building controls beenacted to provide for nature conservation, coupled with increasedmass transit that would reduce automobile congestion.   The conference was convened by Gov. Mario Cuomo, Gov. Tom Keaneof New Jersey, Gov. Madeleine Kunin of Vermont, Cornell Universityand the National Governors' Association.   Among those who addressed the meeting were physicist Carl Sagan;Ted Turner, head of the CNN cable network; Sen. Albert Gore, Jr.,D-Tenn.; and Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo.   The 150 scientists attending the meeting included Vassily Sokolovof the Soviet Union's Institute of U.S.A. and Canada Studies and MaShijun, chairman of China's Commission on the Environment.   ``We must learn to understand and live rather than fight naturalforces, including those unleashed by our own activities,'' said theparticipants in their final recommendation.</TEXT></DOC>
