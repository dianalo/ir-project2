The fast wind from the blue star is expected to drive a shellinto the slow, dense red supergiant wind. Observed narrow ultravioletlines are probably from shell gas that was photoionized by the initialradiation burst from the supernova. The light travel time effects onthe evolution of the line fluxes, line profiles and spatial structureof the emission are described. Current high spectral resolution observationssuggest a lower limit to the age of the shell of 5,000 yr and suggesta relatively low shell velocity. The narrow lines are predicted to shiftto the red at a rate depending on the shell age. Observations of X-raysbelow 10 keV by the Ginga satellite are difficult to interpret in termsof circumstellar interaction because of the time variability.</TEXT></DOC>
