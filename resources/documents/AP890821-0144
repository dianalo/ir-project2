There were no reports, however, of any drug cartel bossesarrested in the emergency crackdown, which follows theassassinations of a leading presidential candidate, a nationalpolice colonel and a magistrate.   Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the 46-year-old Liberal Party candidate,was buried Sunday after hundreds of thousands of people took to thestreets in a public display of grief.   Meanwhile, thousands of judges and magistrates who walked off thejob last week to protest inadequate security from hitmen hired bydrug traffickers have called off the strike to join the fight, aspokesman for the jurists said.  </TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States should stand ready to helpthe Colombian government in its fight against drug terrorism even ifit means sending in U.S. troops, Attorney General Dick Thornburghsays.   ``I think we have to look at any request that we get for eitherlaw enforcement or military assistance seriously,'' Thornburgh saidSunday on NBC TV's ``Meet The Press.''   ``You now see an aura of terrorism rather than simplynarco-trafficking,'' he said. ``The assassination of a presidentialcandidate, of the chief of police in Medellin, of other judges andtop officials have really brought that country to its knees as faras enforcing its own laws'' is concerned.   ``I don't think we ought to respond, as some suggest, willy-nillywith a military response,'' Thornburgh said. ``But I do think that'san option that we have to keep open.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dire forecasts of summer gas lines and higherprices aren't materializing, and analysts say prices at the pump maybe headed even lower as the vacation season draws to a close.   Although consumers are paying about 15 cents a gallon more thissummer than last, nearly all the increases came in the two monthsfollowing the Exxon Valdez oil spill last March. Since June, retailprices in most areas have slipped slightly.   On June 13 the consumer group Buyers Up, a division of the RalphNader-founded Public Citizen organization, issued a report sayingtight supplies and rising demand would lead to higher prices andpossibly 1970s-style gas lines by early August.   In fact there have been no reported shortages of gasoline, evenin remote areas with heavy tourist traffic, according to JosephKoach, executive director of the Service Stations Dealers ofAmerica. He noted that many industry groups, as well as the Bushadministration, had disputed Buyers Up's prediction.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Five months after he retired from a 16-yearcareer in Congress, Missouri Republican Gene Taylor reached into hisold campaign fund-raising account and tok home $345,000.   It was perfectly legal thanks to a decade-old law, but even so,Taylor's decision highlights a practice that is drawing criticism asethics questions simmer in Congress.   President Bush has proposed outlawing the practice and the Senatealready has voted to ban it. The debate could shift this fall to theHouse, which has vigorously resisted such proposals because itsmembers are the ones that would be affected and they have millionsof dollars at stake.   ``It amounts to a special interest-financed retirement fund,''complains Susan Manes of Common Cause, a government watchdog groupthat advocates an overhaul of the system for financing congressionalcampaigns.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In Manhattan, where even the air is for sale,developers are wheeling and dealing to keep building higher anddenser on an island that isn't getting any bigger.   Donald Trump wants to use the rights he owns to land under theHudson River to create the world's tallest building. Across town,the owner of the air space above Grand Central Terminal has beenbattling for more than 11 years to convert it to glass, steel, andcash on the ground.   ``It's a logical extension of the cleverness of New York Citydevelopers' lawyers,'' says Steve Robinson, co-chairman ofWestpride, a community organization fighting excessive development.``They push the limits, they invent new mechanisms, they tryanything that may have a shot at working, because there are so manydollars at stake.''   Dozens of office and apartment buildings are going up in NewYork's midtown area alone, especially around Times Square.</TEXT><DATELINE>ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Frankly, Fritz the schnauzer doesn't knowan arpeggio from a doggie bone. But when he plink-plonks a few noteson the family grand piano, his mistress beams admiringly as if VanCliburn himself were tickling the ivories.   As far as Shirley Mae Ross is concerned, Fritz is a doggonesensation.   ``He is by far my best student,'' says Mrs. Ross, who gives pianolessons to children in the living room of her suburban Washingtonhome. ``He's not a pet. He's an artist.''   Twelve-year-old Fritz has been ``playing'' the piano since he wasa pup. To show off for visitors, he leaps to the keyboard, frownshis shaggy eyebrows at a book of Beethoven sonatas, and taps out achord or two with his front paws.</TEXT></DOC>
