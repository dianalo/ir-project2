(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Commissioners of the South Carolina StateMuseum are suing a slot machine, but only because they want to keepit around.   State law forbids possession of a slot machine, but the statemuseum commission has an old one-armed bandit it hopes to displayafter the new museum opens later this year.   To get around the law, the museum needs to have a judge rulethat the law is inapplicable in this case.   But before a judge can rule, there has to be a lawsuit.   Since there was nobody available to sue, museum sued the slotmachine, said Jane McCue Johnson, the assistant attorney generalwho is handling the case of South Carolina Museum Commission vs.One Mills Slot Machine.   The machine, now in the custody of the State Law EnforcementDivision, is not represented by counsel.   The mechanical, wood-and-steel slot machine was built about 50years ago by Mills Novelty Co. in Chicago.   It was given to the museum recently by James Graham Jr. ofNewberry, who discovered it under a blanket while he was preparingto sell his father's country store.   ``The plaintiff is informed and believes the slot machine is ofsignificant historical value as a reflection of the history andcustoms of the people of South Carolina, said the complaint filedin Richland County Court of Common Pleas.   ``You put a nickel in and it works _ or so I'm told. I didn'ttry it because it's illegal,'' said Rodger Stroup, the museum'schief curator.   He said the machine won't be used for play, just display, if themuseum is allowed to keep it.   The machines were once legal, and Graham's machine bears a SouthCarolina Tax Commission stamp dated June 30, 1952.</TEXT><DATELINE>BELLEVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Just as a penny saved is a penny earned,but an hour spent may be $60 saved.   That's the bait for prospective buyers of an apparel store ownedby Ed Dollus, who also owns the Dollus Bros. shoe store next door.   Every business hour, Dollus is marking down the price by $60.   When he started on Thursday, the price was $240,000.   Karen Morgan, a clerk at the shoe store, ``is supposed to changethe price every hour, but sometimes she forgets,'' Dollus said.   Dollus said he also would sell the three-story building whichhouses the shoe store, but only if the buyer bought the three-storyapparel building.   ``If I sell it (the shoe store building), I'm gone out of thecity of Belleville,'' Dollus said. ``But I'm going to keep sellingshoes somewhere. After 64 years in the business, I've got too manygood, faithful customers I wouldn't desert.   ``My motto has always been `It's a feat to fit feet,' and I fitcustomers with a quality shoe made in America to fit American feet.I've never sold a plastic shoe.''</TEXT><DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When the world's tallest woman left her jobat the Guinness Museum of World Records to become the mayor'stallest secretary, she didn't have a thing to wear.   The clothes Sandy Allen had worn as a``live attraction'' at theGuinness museum in Niagara Falls, Ontario, for eight years were tooinformal for the office of Mayor William H. Hudnut III.   But at 7 feet, 7\ inches, off the rack was out of the question.   Thanks to some helpful seamstresses and consultants, however,the 32-year-old Shelbyville native goes to work in style.   ``Sandy's circumstances bring a whole new meaning to `I haven'ta thing to wear,' '' said Sherry Boram, a personal image consultantwith Color 1 Associates.   The two women hit it off immediately and Ms. Boram, who lives inPendleton, began organizing the forces to bring Miss Allen'swardrobe up to date.   Ms. Boram first planned a ``capsule wardrobe'' that includednine color-coordinated pieces that could be mixed and matched.   Then she recruited volunteer seamstresses, sewing supplyretailers, pattern drafters and fitters to produce Miss Allen'stailor-made wardrobe.   Three Purdue University instructors and six students drafted thesewing patterns and several area merchants donated fabric andnotions for the project.   The 24 members of the American Sewing Guild's Indianapolischapter made the garments.   The project also included making custom-sized accessories,including a shoulder bag, a reversible vest and more than 30handmade wooden clothes hangers.   ``I'm quite flattered,'' Miss Allen said. ``Saying thank youdoesn't seem enough.   ``I'll be at least a half-hour late for work every morningbecause, with all of my lovely new clothes, I'll have a hard timedeciding which to wear,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
