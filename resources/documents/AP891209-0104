Michael S. Dukakis signed legislationSaturday banning assault weapons in Boston, saying he'd like to seegreater gun control across Massachusetts and the nation.   ``Semiautomatic assault-style weapons are designed for onepurpose and one purpose only,'' Dukakis said. ``They are designedto kill other human beings as fast as possible.''   The ban prohibits the sale of six military-style weapons, andrequires anyone who already legally owns one to register it withthe police commissioner. It also bans certain shotguns and rifles.   ``This is a message to drug dealers and gangs bent on violencethat we simply will not tolerate these weapons or the violence ordestruction that they bring,'' the governor said at the signingceremony at an inner-city police station.   Police Commissioner Francis Roache said the ban is not a panaceafor Boston's drug or gang problems, but is an important step in thecommunity's response to violence.   ``It's going to be a long and painful process until we fullycome to the realization that we're the most violent society in theworld and we have an attitude problem,'' Roache said. ``So we beginlike this, one city changing laws and changing attitudes.''   The new law gives the commissioner power to place any firearm onthe list of proscribed weapons for 30 days while a board, providedfor in the legislation, decides whether to permanently add the gunto the list.   The measure began as a home-rule petition from the City Councilin the spring. The Legislature approved it late last month after alengthy debate.   Michael Yacino, president of the Gun Owners Action League,described it as the toughest firearms regulation in the state, butmaintains it will do nothing to stop the gang-related violence ittargets.   Gang- and drug-related slayings are rarely committed by licensedgun owners, Yacino argued, and more homicides are committed withhandguns than assault weapons.   Mayor Raymond L. Flynn said tapping the community's outrage overviolence turned the tide in the Legislature.   ``We probably had more community meetings and discussions aboutlobbying state legislators for this legislation than any other,''Flynn said. Lawmakers' offices were flooded with phone calls insupport of the bill.   ``It's not enough to do it just for Boston, it's time we did itfor all of Massachusetts and all of America,'' Dukakis said.``These are weapons that belong on the battlefield, not in crackhouses or in the neighborhoods.''   The law bans the sale or illegal posession of the AK-47semiautomatic rifle; the Uzi semiautomatic rifle; the FN-FLsemiautomatic rifle; the FN-FNC semiautomatic rifle; the Steyr Augsemi-automatic rifle; and the SKS semiautomatic rifle.   It also bans all shotguns with revolving cylinders andsemiautomatic rifles with fixed magazine capacities of more than 10rounds, as well as modifications of any proscribed weapons.   The first offense under the ban carries a $1,000 fine.Subsequent offenses carry penalties up to 2{ years in jail.   The Bush administration imposed an import ban on assault-typerifles in July, but the ban didn't affect guns already owned byAmericans or similar weapons produced by U.S. companies.   California in May became the first state to enact restrictionson the possession or sale of such guns. The law was prompted by theshooting of 35 people at a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard by a gunmanwith an AK-47.   Cities and counties in Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey,New York, Ohio, Colorado and Texas also have enacted ordinanceswith certain restictions.</TEXT></DOC>
