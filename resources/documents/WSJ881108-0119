But it will be up to Daimler-Benz to ensure that the new company's life is less tortured than its birth has been.    Months in planning, the preliminary accord approved by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet calls for the 52% stake in MBB held by three state governments to be reduced to about 35%. It would create a leviathan with yearly revenues approaching 80 billion marks ($44.76 billion). Daimler-Benz, an automotive giant based in Stuttgart, stands to gain lucrative government contracts in defense, which has better long-term prospects than cars and trucks. The holding in MBB, West Germany's largest defense contractor, would give Daimler-Benz, with its existing aviation and aerospace operations, control of about 60% of the West German aerospace industry.    MBB, undercapitalized, overstaffed but a giant in its own right, would get cash and the management talents of a large, professional shareholder. MBB, which holds Germany's 37.9% share in the Airbus Industrie jetliner consortium, also would receive additional subsidies from Bonn for the loss-making Airbus program.    Daimler-Benz hasn't yet signed on the dotted line. Its supervisory board is to vote on the plan tomorrow. The matter is expected to clear the coalition government's parliamentary budget committee tomorrow. The purchase price, expected to be about 800 million marks ($447.6 million), will be determined later.    The accord calls for Bonn to take a 20% interest in a holding company that would be formed for MBB's 37.9% Airbus interest. MBB would take over the Bonn holding by the end of 1999.    Bonn agreed to subsidize Airbus with two programs that could total as much as 4.3 billion marks. The subsidies would be tied to losses resulting from exchange-rate fluctuations. Bonn already has pledged 10.7 billion marks to support Airbus.    The accord is controversial, both in Germany and abroad. It raises concerns about industrial concentration and the possibility of monopoly behavior by Daimler-Benz. The opposition Social Democrats called for a special parliamentary debate this week to attack what they view as creation of a &quot;military-industrial complex&quot; under Daimler ownership. Bonn's pledge to continue subsidizing MBB for its Airbus work also has the potential to ignite a trade war with the U.S.    In a statement released in Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called Bonn's pledge &quot;incongruous and indefensible&quot; at a time when West Germany has &quot;an extraordinarily large trade surplus.&quot; His aides said Mr. Yeutter will weigh his options after discussing the issue with West German officials in Bonn next week.    Although Daimler-Benz would get MBB without the financial risk associated with MBB's Airbus stake, the car maker is assuming another challenge, that of management. Daimler's rapid-fire purchases since 1985 of the AEG AG electrical group, Dornier G.m.b.H. aerospace concern and jet-engine maker Motoren andamp; Turbinen Union G.m.b.H. were intended to make Daimler-Benz an international technology company. But so far the acquisitions have done little more than distract management from its slumping core business -- automobiles.    Adding MBB, a collection of loosely connected programs that resulted from numerous mergers over 60 years, is certain to exacerbate that problem. There are inefficiencies stemming from MBB's involvement in mostly collaborative ventures such as Airbus. With just over six billion marks in annual sales, MBB cooperates with other European companies in virtually all of its programs. But the collaboration bred a culture epitomized by a sign in an MBB hangar in Augsburg: &quot;Cost consciousness at MBB is a foreign word.&quot;    &quot;Ten years from now the acquisition may make Daimler a stronger company. But in the short-term it will absorb a lot of top management's energy and attention,&quot; says Philippe Haspeslagh, a business professor at the European management school, Insead, in Paris.    To reap big benefits, Daimler-Benz must integrate MBB with Dornier, MTU and AEG's defense electronics unit. &quot;MBB is the missing link,&quot; says Dagmar Bottenbruch, a securities analyst at First Boston in London. Although the synergies won't be realized soon, she says, &quot;if Daimler-Benz wants to make their long-term diversification strategy work out, they need MBB.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
