Mr. Reagan has remained largely silent during the three months of hearings, maintaining that he would respond only when the sessions had ended. The joint Senate and House committees investigating the affair ended their public sessions last week, although they won't publish their official report until after Congress's August recess.    The president's aides said Mr. Reagan will use the speech to give his &quot;personal&quot; reaction to the hearings' inquiry into his administration's arms sales to Iran and the diversion of some proceeds to Nicaragua's Contra rebels. He is likely to report on a new, bipartisan peace plan for Central America he has just endorsed and on an agreement with Congress to tighten up White House reporting of covert operations such as the Iranian arms sales.    But he also is likely to use the speech to try to shift attention to other issues, such as arms control and the budget debate.    &quot;The president feels that it's appropriate for him to make some comment on the process to date and also to give the American people a report on where he's going the next 16 months,&quot; said the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater. </TEXT></DOC>
