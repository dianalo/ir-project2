BERGSTROM</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Late April domestic car sales sagged belowyear-earlier levels, while for the full month import car makersshowed signs of rebounding despite pricing disadvantages stemmingfrom the weaker U.S. dollar.   Combined domestic car and truck sales fell 2.6 percent to420,626 in the sales period of April 21-30, the automakers reportedWednesday.   General Motors Corp. car sales for the late April period fell19.7 percent from a stronger-than-usual sales period a yearearlier, leading a 6.7 percent decline in domestic car sales.   Chrysler Corp. car sales rose 10.3 percent from the year earlierand Ford Motor Co. sales were up 8.7 percent.   Domestic truck sales for all makers rose by 6.5 percent.   Industry analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. inNew York, said the figures were skewed because GM sales surged lastApril due to sales incentives.   ``They were 55 percent of the market, so the comparison will bekind of distorted. GM will look poor,'' Healy said.   For the month, GM car sales were down 14.2 percent to a total of314,671, Ford's were down 1.4 percent to 186,175 and Chrysler'ssales rose 8.8 percent to 95,170.   GM held a 47.2 percent makret share during the late Aprilperiod, compared with 27.9 percent for Ford and 13.9 percent forChrysler. GM's share in the year-earlier period was 54.9 percent,due largely to the special sales incentives.   Imported car sales totaled 236,451, up 0.7 percent, for April,though imported light truck sales plunged 37.4 percent to a 50,318monthly total. Importers report their sales monthly.   The decline of the dollar over the past three years has forcedJapanese and European automakers to raise their prices, to reflectthe strengthening of their own currencies.   As a result, the Japanese imports have begun using the tactic ofsales incentives that domestic manufacturers have focused on forthe past couple of years, said Chris Cedergren, analyst at J.D.Power andamp; Associates in Agoura Hills, Calif.   Nissan, with aggressive incentive programs, sold 31,197 importedcars for the month, up 7.3 percent, and 6,545 U.S.-produced cars,up 2.8 percent.   Toyota sold 43,605 imports, up slightly from 43,339, and 2,200U.S.-made cars, up from 2,187.   Honda import sales dropped 3.6 percent to 19,702, but sales ofdomestically made Hondas rose 7.5 percent to 17,512.   Volkswagen import sales dropped 25 percent to 11,922 anddomestic sales sank 7.5 percent to 2,712.</TEXT></DOC>
