 Now corporate developers can staff getting a fix on the issuesof building LAN server applications.andP;  LAN server DBMSs will constitute animportant development opportunity in the near future, but selecting fromamong the platform products wiU be tricky.andM;HYPE AND FUD.andP;  Marketing hype alone accounts for most of the confusion aboutthe different products.andP;  For example, in introducing its LAN server DBMSs,Oracle raised the specter of multiprocessing support as an importantselection criterion.andP;  But multiprocessing support is not available on themajor LAN server options today.andP;  By the time multiprocessing is available,every major LAN server DBMS vendor will support it.andP;  To raise the issue todayis a FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) tactic, pure and simple.andM;Oracle Server is based on the latest version (Version 6) of Oracle's DBMSengine.andP;  Oracle is positioning it as an &quot;open&quot; product in the sense that itwill be ported to a variety of LAN operating environments.andP;  NovellNetWare/386, OS/2, Unix/ 386, and Banyan VINES will be available by October.andM;LAN SERVER ISSUES.andP;  What follows is an analysis of the issues facingcorporate developers considering LAN server DBMSs, and a comparison ofMicrosoft/Ashton-Tate/Sybase SQL Server, IBM's OS/2 Extended Edition DatabaseManager, and Oracle's server version of its best-selling relational DBMS(RDBMS).andP;  These three products were chosen because they take up so muchattention in this developing market.andP;  The issues are:andM;* Operating environmentsandM;* Front endsandM;* Distributed DBMSsandM;* Transaction processingandM;* Gateway services/back-end connectionsandM;* Portability/opennessandM;Operating Environments.andP;  The first issue facing corporate developers weighingthe LAN server DBMS choices is how well the different products will leverageand extend existing investments.andP;  Oracle is making a big initial play in thisarea with its portability strategy.andP;  Oracle is building support for fourtransport protocols-Novell's SPX/IPX, OS/2's Named Pipes, NETBIOS, and BanyanVINES-into its SQL-Net network interface.andP;  By comparison, OS/2 Extended'sDatabase Manager runs under OS/2, and an AIX version is planned.andP;  Sybase'sSQL Server engine runs under OS/2, Unix, and VAX/VMS.andM;The distinction here isn't as dramatic as it appears.andP;  All of the major PCLAN environmentsNetWare, Banyan, Unix, OS/2-will soon support the sametransport protocol, Named Pipes.andP;  Thus, the fact that OS/2 Extended'sDatabase Manager hasn't been ported to NetWare isn't all that significant.andO;When NetWare supports Named Pipes (Novell has announced intent to do this),OS/2 Extended will be able to interact with NetWare server DBMSs.andP;  The sameis true of Sybase.andM;Named Pipes promises connectivity between multiple LAN server DBMSs.andP;  Movingbeyond connections between database engines to applications portability willbe much more difficult, however, because there are simply too manydifferences in the structures and semantics of the three major databaseengines at present to allow it.andP;  For example, although Sybase SQL Server andIBM's OS/2 Extended Database Manager both offer stored procedures as a way toenforce business rules across applications, each implements these in adifferent way.andP;  Applications written to one won't necessarily recognize thestored procedures of the other.andP;  If applications portability is important,users have to select a single vendor to get it.andM;Front Ends.andP;  Client support is a slightly different story.andP;  Oracle has anadvantage today in its support of Macintosh clients as well as of DOS, OS/2,and Unix.andP;  IBM and Sybase are playing catch-up.andM;IBM's focus is on providing distributed access among the DBMSs in its SystemsApplication Architecture: OS/2 Extended's Database Manager, OS/400, DB2, andSQL/DS.andP;  Providing support for Unix clients is also a priority, but Macintoshsupport isn't.andP;  IBM will publish specifications that will allow third partiesto address Mac connections to its DBMSs.andM;Sybase is taking a different approach with the Adaptable Window Environment(AWE) feature of the upcoming Release 4.0 of its engine.andP;  AWE is a layer ofsoftware that mediates between Sybase's SQL Toolset development toolket andvendor-specific window systems.andP;  It is a series of run-time modules fordifferent windowing environments, allowing window-based applications to takeon the look and feel of a host windowing system.andP;  AWE will be implementedfirst for X termi nals, Motif, character terminals, and Open Look.andP;  Next willcome the Macintosh, MS Windows, Presentation Manager, NextStep, NewWave, andDECwindows.andM;Client support is pan of the story of front ends.andP;  The other parts arefront-end applications software that can use the LAN server DBMS andapplication-development tools.andM;Users won't find too many packages for any of the contenders.andP;  The three havebeen waging a war of endorsements, few of which have paid off in realsoftware yet.andP;  Borland's Paradox is unique in that it runs with all threeoptions.andP;  SQL Server is the early leader in attracting front-end software toits banner, but IBM expects some 50 front-end packages to be available forits entrant by year's end.andP;  Oracle, meanwhile, has signed up 30 vendors tosupport its new Oracle Servers, many have promised to deliver in thiscalendar year.andM;Oracle is also providing its own office applications as front ends to OracleServer.andP;  Oracle is unique in this regard: It both aggressively developsapplications to use its DBMS engines and encourages third-patty support.andP;  IBMand Sybase are more dependent on third parties.andM;Oracle and Sybase provide full suites of application development tools fortheir engines.andP;  Oracle's SQL Forms, SQL Report Writer, SQL Menu, SQL Plus,SQL Loader, and CASE Tools will each work with Oracle Server.andP;  Sybase'sTransact SQL, AWE, Window/Forms System, APT-SQL fourth-generation language,and DBLibrary will work with Release 4.0.andP;  IBM's LAN server DBMS lags in thisdepartment.andP;  IBM provides, with OS/2 Extended Database Manager, a utilitymuch like SAA's Query Management Facility to generate SQL statements.andM;Distributed DBMS.andP;  Oracle, Sybase, and IBM each provide distributed access todata within their own server environments, but only Oracle and Sybase offerdistributed databases as well.andP;  Oracle and Sybase give users the ability topull information from multiple LAN server DBMSs as if it all came from thesame DBMS.andP;  This is a single logical view of multiple physical databases;such views can span geographically separated servers.andP;  Sybase allows forupdates within logical databases as well.andM;IBM doesn't support logical views across servers and media, although diefeature is in the plan.andP;  IBM provides the ability to perform &quot;remote units ofwork&quot; in OS/2 Extended's Database Manager.andP;  A remote unit of work is acollection of SQL statements comprising a transaction that is executed on aremote DBMS.andP;  More than one remote DBMS may be involved in a transaction, butthe user or application must overtly bring them into the process.andM;Currently, support for remote units of work exists within IBM's DBMSs;DB2-to-DB2 and Database Manager-to-Database Manager, for example.andP;  IBM'spriority is to extend the feature across its SAA databases-DB2, SQL/DS, OS/400, OS/2 Extended Database Manager-so that an OS/2 Extended Database Managercan execute a remote unit of work on a DB2 database.andP;  Distributed data is alonger term development objective.andM;OLTP.andP;  Oracle, Sybase, and IBM each provide support for online transactionprocessing (OLTP) in their LAN server DBMSs.andP;  Sybase's Transact-SQL allowsfor the aforementioned transactions across SQL Servers, providing a two-phasecommit feature to ensure integrity.andP;  Oracle and IBM are moving toward thismodel.andP;  Currently, both use &quot;cursor hold,&quot; a related database-coordinatingtechnology, to ensure transaction integrity.andM;Oracle made an issue of locking in its announcement of Oracle Server,claiming an advantage over SQL/Server and OS/2 Extended Database Manager.andP;  Infact, the three offer equivalent capabilities.andP;  Oracle Server locks at therow level.andP;  SQL/Server locks at the page level (although, in Browse mode,Sybase locks only when the user begins an update).andP;  IBM's Database Managerlocks at the row level, within five modes of exclusivity ranging from anexclusive lock attached to die lock owner to a lock that allows lock ownersto read but not change data.andM;Gateway Services(Back-End Connections.andP;  Oracle Servers communicate with otherDBMSs using SQL-Net and SQL Connect.andP;  SQL-Net supports TCP/IP, DECnet, 3270data streams, async, and IBM's APPC connectivity.andP;  SQL Connection providesgateways between Oracle Servers and IBM's DB2 and SQL/DS currently; a gatewayto Digital's Rdb is in the works, and others are sure to follow.andM;Sybase's Release 4.0 provides a new gateway method for SQL/Server as part ofSybase's Open Client/Server Architecture.andP;  This architecture provides anapplication programming interface and protocol based on the InternationalStandards Organization's Remote Database Access protocol.andP;  An Open Serveracts as a back-end link to outside data sources.andP;  Open clients areapplications written to Sybase's DB -Library; they can access various typesof servers through Open Servers.andP;  An Open Server has two logical components:the Network Interface and Server Utilities.andP;  The Network Interface acceptsrequests from client programs running DB-Library or remote procedure callsfrom an SQL Server.andP;  Server Utilities ensure completion of the request bypassing it to the appropriate Open Server &quot;user defined handler' forconnection to die remote data source.andP;  Sybase Open Servers perform thisfunction residing beside SQL Servers on a network.andM;IBM's aforementioned remote unit of work development effort is the key to itsconnections between OS/2 Extended Database Manager servers and other IBMdatabase management systems.andP;  The priority in IBM's development progam issupporting remote units of work between OS/2 Extended Database Manager andDB2.andP;  Dis wiU provide a direct connection between OS/2 Extended DatabaseManager servers and DB2, without software intermediaries.andM;Today, OS/2 Extended's Database Manager can download data from DB2 via IBM'sQNElike facility.andP;  This is an indirect procedure: Users issue a query andobtain a copy of DB2 data for downloading.andM;When IBM incorporates remote unit of work support spanning its LAN serverDBMS and DB2, it will not need a separate gateway on OS/2 networks.andP;  Thisraises an issue for Sybase and Oracle in the many environments that featurelarge IBM databases.andP;  Why buy the Sybase open archiecture or the Oracle SQLConnect scheme when the same basic functions can be performed by a serverrunning OS/2 Extended Database Manager? Sybase and Oracle offer advantages inmultivendor schemes, but their advantage is not so clear in IBM shops.andM;Portability/Openness.andP;  Sybase and Oracle are both positioned in LAN serverDBMSs to support a variety of environments, Oracle through its portabilitystrategy and Sybase through its open architecture.andP;  IBM's OS/2 ExtendedDatabase Manager is currently OS/2-specific, but IBM is committed to portingit to AIX, its Unix variant.andP;  Also, as previously mentioned, IBM will publishthe infoffnation third parties need to provide connectivity between OS/2Extended's Database Manager and other environments.andM;CONCLUSION.andP;  Performance was left off the list of issues because too littleis known about it.andP;  Firs% there's the problem of measurement-read&quot;benchmarks.&quot; Are the same benchmarks relevant for DB2 and OS/2 ExtendedDatabase Manager? (Are benchmarks relevant at all?) Then there's the LANenvironment itself as a determinant of LAN server DBMS performance.andP;  Given ahigh percentage of transaction processing applications, a LAN server DBMSwill perform differently than a DBMS with a high percentage of ad hoc queryapplications.andP;  Balancing the loads of these two kinds of applications onindividual servers and LANwide will also improve performance.andP;  For thepresent, then, testing the options is the best user strategy.andM;There's also a good chance that other vendors will enter the picture withimportant LAN server data management products.andP;  Oracle, Sybase (with itspartners, Microsoft and Ashton-Tate), and IBM appear to be the leadingplayers in this drama today.andP;  Lotus Development Corporation, once thought tobe interested in LAN server DBMSs, has now indicated that it isn't.andP;  But notall the database vendors have yet been accounted for.andP;  Vendors likeInformation Builders Incorporated, makers of Focus, for example, could add tothe mix of products.andP;  Stay tuned for developments.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
