And Queens District Attorney John J. Santucci's office hasentered the investigation to be ``on the lookout for violations oflocal laws,'' said Santucci spokesman Richard Piperno.   A grand jury may be asked to investigate possible criminalwrongdoing related to last week's crash of the Boeing 737-400 atthe end of a LaGuardia Airport runway that killed two passengers,according to a source in the Queens district attorney's office.   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said possiblecharges included criminally negligent homicide and leaving thescene of an accident.   The pilot's licenses of the flight's captain and co-pilot weresuspended because they left the accident scene. The two also werecriticized by federal officials for failing to submit immediatelyto drug and alcohol testing, although they are not legally requiredto do so.   A lawyer for the captain, Michael W. Martin, and co-pilotConstantine Kleissas said Sunday that he saw ``no basis'' for agrand jury.   ``Based on everything I know, there is absolutely no criminalact committed by either pilot and no wrongdoing by either ofthem,'' said Frederick Hafetz.   He declined to comment on whether his clients would cooperatewith a grand jury, should they be called to testify.   He said they have been ``fully cooperative with the regulatoryauthorities,'' but added that neither would make a public statementin the near future.   Although two people died late Wednesday on Flight 5050, headedfor Charlotte, N.C., 59 other passengers and crew members wererescued from the East River and from the partially submergedwreckage.   National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Ted Lopatkiewiczsaid crews had the front and tail sections of the plane out of thewater Sunday afternoon. The main fuselage section was removedlater. The operation had been hampered by bad weather.   The pieces were being trucked to an American Airlines hangar atLaGuardia Airport, where investigators were waiting to examinethem, he said.   James Kolstad, the NTSB's acting chairman, said at a newsconference Saturday that although the co-pilot inadvertently pusheda button shutting off an automatic throttle, it was not known ifthat was a factor in the plane's aborted takeoff and crash.   Among other factors under investigation is the plane'sunexplained veer to the left during its takeoff, Kolstad said.Investigators found skid marks on the runway from the plane's threesets of wheels, he said.   Lopatkiewicz said the jet's nose gear was recovered Sunday and,``we're going to be looking at those tires very carefully.''   Another critical question was whether the plane had reached aspeed known as V-1, the velocity _ based on a complicatedcalculation involving numerous variables _ at which the takeoff mayno longer be safely aborted.   Kleissas, 29, who had flown a 737-400 only once before on aregular passenger flight, was at the controls, but Martin manuallytook over the throttle when Kleissas pushed the button that turnedoff the automatic throttle.   Martin, 36, told investigators that he decided to abort thetakeoff after manually accelerating the jet because it begandrifting to the left and he felt and heard an unusual vibration.   He believed he had enough room to stop the plane, but it insteadskidded off the runway, landing partially in the water andpartially atop a line of pilings, cracking the fuselage into threesections.   Martin and Kleissas submitted Friday to urinalysis but resultswill not be available for three weeks, Kolstad said.   On Saturday, they also gave urine samples to investigators fromthe district attorney's office after they were told that a warrantwas being prepared.   Piperno said that Martin ``didn't want anybody to see his face''and had a blanket wrapped around his head when he met localinvestigators at Jamaica Hospital.</TEXT></DOC>
