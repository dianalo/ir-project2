The suit, filed in federal court here, seeks to enjoin Newport's directors from recommending a rival tender offer by Sensor Control Corp. until Newport amends a related Securities and Exchange Commission filing.    Newport has said it intends to recommend acceptance of a merger agreement it has with Sensor, a Sunnyvale, Calif., maker of pressure sensors and gauges. Under the agreement, Sensor would acquire Newport for $9 a share. Newport officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment on the suit.    In national over-the-counter trading, Newport closed at $9.125 a share, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
