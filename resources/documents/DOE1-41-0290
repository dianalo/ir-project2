For a phi{sup 2}/sup p/ theory the method consistsof expanding a phi/sup 2(1+//sup {delta}//sup )/ theory in powers of{delta}. A diagrammatic procedure for computing the terms in this seriesis given. We believe that for any Green's function the radius of convergenceof this series is finite and is, in fact, 1. Moreover, while the termsin the unrenormalized series are individually divergent, they are considerablyless so than in the standard weak-coupling perturbation series. In simple,low-dimensional quantum-field-theory models, the {delta} expansion givesexcellent numerical results. We hope this new technique will ultimatelyshed some light on the question of whether a (phi{sup 4}){sub 4} theoryis free.</TEXT></DOC>
