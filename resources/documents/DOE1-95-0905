By considering grain boundarysliding and diffusion as concurrent processes, the analysis shows thatsliding of faceted grain boundaries can induce time-dependent stressconcentrations of sufficient magnitude to cause cavity nucleation atthe ledges. The transient stress concentration has been found to dependon the ledge height and spacing, and to decrease rapidly with time andwith distance from the ledge. Whether or not cavity nucleation occursat the ledge depends on the local stress, the shape of the critical nucleus,and the characteristic time for cavity formation. The theoretical resultsare discussed in conjunction with nucleation rate measurements obtainedfor a sintered alumina using small angle neutron scattering.</TEXT></DOC>
