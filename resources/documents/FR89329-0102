Also, thelevel and amount of boric acid in the storage tanks must be increased asa result of the modifications to the safety injection and residual heatremoval systems.The Need for the Proposed ActionsIn response to NRC Generic Letter 88-04, Potential Safety-Related PumpLoss, plant modifications are necessary to the recirculation system forthe residual heat removal and safety injection systems. These modificationsare to increase the recirculation flow rates in order to offer an increasedmargin of pump protection during conditions which require pump operationat minimum flow and also parallel pump operation. These conditions couldexist when the reactor coolant system pressure is higher than the shutoffhead of the pumps. The increased recirculation flow rates are beneficialin that the potential of accelerated wear is reduced. Also, as a resultof the recirculation modification, additional boric acid water is neededbecause of the larger recirculation piping system.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe Commission has completed its initial evaluation of the proposed revisionsto the Technical Specifications. The proposed changes improve operabilityof the components by reducing the potential for accelerated wear due tolow flow operation, particularly during surveillance testing. The proposedchanges do not increase the probability or consequence of accidents becausethe flow delivered to the reactor coolant system will remain above therequired flow delivery with increased recirculation flow as required inthe accident analysis. No changes are being made in the types of any effluentsthat may be released, or in the allowable individual or cumulative occupationalradiation exposure.Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would resultin no significant radiological impact.With regard to the potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changesto the Technical Specifications involve systems located within a restrictedarea as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect non-radiologicalplant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commissionconcludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impactsassociated with the proposed amendment.Alternative to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Ifthe requested amendment were denied, the plant would continue to operatewith current surveillance test requirements that could result in reducedpump reliability with a potential for adverse environmental effects.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not considered inthe Final Environmental Statement for the Ginna Nuclear Power Plant.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Findings of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the applications foramendments dated November 21 and 29, 1988, which are available for publicinspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW.,Washington, DC, and at the Rochester Public Library, 115 South Avenue,Rochester, NY 14610.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 21st day of March, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard H.
