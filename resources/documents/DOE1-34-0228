Multitasking is useful for server virtualmachines, e.g. Network Transport Managers, File Managers, Disk SpaceManagers, Tape Unit Managers, where the execution of a task involveslong waits due to I/O completion, VMCF communication delays or humanresponses, during which the task status stays as a control block in memory,while the virtual machine serves other users executing the same linesof code. Multitasking is not only for multi-user service: a big datareduction program may run as a main task, while a side task, connectedto the virtual console, gives reports on the ongoing work of the maintask in response to user commands and steers the main task through commondata. All the service routines (Wait, Create and Delete Task, Get andRelease Buffer, VMCF Open and Close Link, Send and Receive, I/O and ConsoleRoutines) are FORTRAN callable, and may be used from any language environmentconsistent with the same parameter passing conventions. The outstandingfeature of this system is efficiency, no user defined SVC are used, andthe use of other privileged instructions as LPSW or SSM is the bare necessary,so that CP (with the associated overhead) is not too involved. Systemcode and read-only data are write-protected with a different storagekey from CMS and user program.</TEXT></DOC>
