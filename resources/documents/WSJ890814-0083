Producer prices fell in July for the second month in a row, the Labor Department reported. The 0.4% decline was the largest in three years. Tumbling gasoline prices were primarily responsible, although prices slipped across a spectrum of wholesale goods, from cars to children's clothes. Even excluding energy and food prices, which often swing widely from month to month, inflation at the wholesale level declined 0.2%.    Economists said the slowing economy was easing demand and consequently reducing pressure on prices. But a Commerce Department report suggested that consumer demand at least may still have some vim.    Retail sales grew 0.9% in July, to $143.73 billion, the department reported, after declining a revised 0.1% in June. The June decline was originally calculated at 0.4%. The department also made a huge upward revision to its May retail sales figures, earlier reported as a 0.1% decline; after collecting additional data from retailers, the department said sales during the month actually increased 0.8%.    While the price figures are the latest -- and by far the strongest -- evidence that inflation is easing, the sales report choked talk that the economy has slowed to the brink of a recession.    &quot;Economically the country appears to be in the best of both worlds, facing neither significant inflation nor recession in the near term,&quot; said Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.    But Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, said: &quot;This is suggesting that maybe we are having a miracle, but I say, no, not really.&quot;    The financial markets seemed dubious as well. After jumping at the first news of the producer price report, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 28.64 points, partly in response to the retail sales revisions, analysts said. Bond prices dropped sharply as well.    Because of the strong retail sales numbers, coupled with recent reports showing the economy is still generating a large number of new jobs, a number of analysts believe the Federal Reserve Board won't act to bring down interest rates any further for a while.    A few months ago the Fed, confronted with evidence that the economy was slowing sharply, began nudging interest rates down after steadily pushing them up for a year. The Fed had been trying to wring inflation out of the economy by making borrowing more expensive.    Fed policy makers are due to meet next week to chart monetary and credit policy for the following several weeks. But Mr. Dederick said, &quot;My feeling is the producer price index gives the Fed the opportunity to ease when they think the moment is appropriate, but the retail sales report says now is not the time.&quot;    David Berson, chief economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association, added: &quot;I think the combination of moderate growth with inflation coming down a bit means the Fed is probably very happy now with the way things are going and probably sees no overriding reasons to change policy now.&quot;    Despite two months of falling prices, wholesale inflation is still running at a 5.7% annual rate in 1989, well above the 4% rise for 1988. Steep increases in world oil prices this winter boosted the producer price index for finished goods at an alarming rate earlier this year, triggering fears that the country was headed for an inflationary spiral. But oil prices have since plummeted, yanking overall price levels back down. In July the prices wholesalers and distributors paid for energy products plunged 3.0%. This, however, masked a 1.5% increase in the price of natural gas, which followed a 2.0% drop the month before.    A 1.9% drop in car prices also pulled producer prices down, as auto companies added sales incentives and began year-end discounts early to rid their lots of excess stock, government and private analysts said. &quot;August prices are even better than July so there's likely to be another decline in August,&quot; said Peter Pekkala, domestic economist for Ford Motor Co. But he warned that the company will raise prices in the fall, when new models come out.    The auto incentives seemed to be attracting customers after several poor months. According to the retail sales report, automotive dealers posted a 2.7% gain in sales in July following a 1.0% decline in June.    Sales at building-supply and hardware stores advanced 0.6% in July after slipping 0.2% in June. But furniture sales slipped 0.3% after climbing 1.3% in June. Overall sales of durable goods -- such items as cars, furniture and household appliances, expected to last three years or more -- showed a strong 1.7% gain in July, after several months of weakness. Sales of nondurable goods grew 0.4% for the second month in a row.    In additional reassuring news on inflation, the prices of intermediate goods -- materials with some processing -- declined for the second consecutive month in July, suggesting that finished goods prices will continue to be held down in the future. Intermediate goods prices dropped 0.2% last month. And crude goods prices edged up only 0.2% after a 2.0% decline in June.    Figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal changes.    Here are the Labor Department's producer price indexes (1982=100) for July, before seasonal adjustment, and the percentage changes from July 1988: @ Finished goods .......................... 114.0 5.0% @ Minus food andamp; energy ................... 121.9 4.1% @ Intermediate goods ...................... 112.6 4.1% @ Crude goods ............................. 103.7 6.6% </TEXT></DOC>
