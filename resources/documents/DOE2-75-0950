Cost-efficientautomation requires very low-cost sensors. The use of microprocessorsin automation presents an opportunity to make use of the repeatabilityof a sensor rather than accuracy. The recognition of the needs and opportunitiesin advanced gas distribution prompted the Gas Research Institute to sponsorthis project on low-cost sensors.</TEXT></DOC>
