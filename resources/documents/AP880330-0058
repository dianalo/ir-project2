The girl, 6-year-old Eleanor Armell, has nightmares over thepossibility of being taken from the custody of her foster family,``the only parents she has ever known,'' said her attorney, CookCounty Public Guardian Patrick Murphy.   But Diane La Plante, an attorney for the tribe, the Potawatmis,said Tuesday that the tribal system is where the case belongs.   ``It is entirely possible'' the tribal court would rule the girlshould remain with her foster family, she said.   The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 gives tribal courtsjurisdiction in custody cases involving Indian children. Its aim is``to stop the erosion of the American Indian family and to protectAmerican Indian children,'' Ms. La Plante said after Juvenile CourtJudge Claude Whitaker delayed ruling on a motion by Murphy.   Murphy asked the judge Tuesday to postpone enforcement of hisMarch 18 ruling to transfer the case to the tribal court of thePotawatami Indian Reservation in Mayetta, Kan.   Murphy sought the delay while he is appealing the ruling, butWhitaker said he would not consider the request until today becauseMurphy failed to give Ms. LaPlante adequate notice of his motion.   ``This involves a very real little girl ... having nightmaresand getting sick'' out of fear that she will be taken from herfoster parents, Murphy told the judge.   Lorraine Swett, the girl's foster mother, had planned to testifyTuesday and wept after Whitaker delayed action in the case.   ``If possible, I want her to stay with me. I've had her forthree years, she's just like my own,'' Mrs. Swett said outside thecourtroom.   Mrs. Swett, 46, is a Menominee Indian. She and her husband,Paul, a U.S. Navy officer, have four children of their own. Theymoved to Novato, Calif., from the Chicago area a year ago andEleanor was allowed to go with them.   ``I want what's best for Eleanor. She's been saying she wants tostay with me,'' Mrs. Swett said.   Eleanor, who was not in court, was found eating garbage in aChicago alley in April 1985. She was suffering from tuberculosisand lice and had been abandoned by her natural mother, MichellePawless, Murphy contends.   Ms. LaPlante said the tribe was slow to become involved becauseMurphy's office did not notify the tribe of the case, as requiredby law. But Murphy contends Ms. Pawless did not tell his officethat she was a Potawatami until late last year.   The girl's father, a Winnebago Indian, died in a 1985 caraccident, Murphy said.   The Winnebagos were the first to seek jurisdiction over thecase, but her mother objected. Ms. Pawless relented in October whenher own tribe moved to take over the case.</TEXT></DOC>
