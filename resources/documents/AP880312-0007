Coalition organizers said at a news conference following threedays of meetings in Washington that they will consider joint publiceducation campaigns, lobbying efforts and perhaps an advertisingcampaign.   ``This is not a state, local or regional issue, it is a nationalissue,'' said Rachael Binah of the Ocean Sanctuary CoordinatingCommittee. ``We want Americans to see the bigger picture.   ``If the Department of Interior is allowed to continue with itsfive-year leasing plan, the coastline of the United States will besystematically destroyed,' she said.   Environmental leaders said they will focus on federallegislation for sensitive coastal areas in New England, Florida andCalifornia that would block or defer implementation of thefive-year leasing plan, which was unveiled last year by InteriorSecretary Donald Hodel.   The most sensitive parts of Georges Bank, a fishing-rich areaoff the New England coast, already are protected under acongressional moratorium. Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., vowed lastweek to fight for the Georges Bank ban again this year.   Ann Whitfield of the Florida Public Interest Research Group saidHodel, because of the five-year plan, makes former InteriorSecretary James Watt ``look like an environmentalist.'' Watt andhis policies were constantly under attack by the environmentalcommunity during his tenure early in the Reagan administration.   Richard Charter, who represents some cities and counties in theoffshore leasing controversy in California, said the coalition alsowants to force the leasing issue into the presidential campaign.   ``We're here to send a message that America cares about itscoastline,'' he said.   He said all the Democratic presidential aspirants have vowed toeither oppose or modify Hodel's plan, which outlines the areas openfor leasing and creates a timetable for the leasing of tracts.   The Republican candidates have not answered issue inquiries sentby the activists, Charter said.   Regional activists said they are fighting proposals to leasetracts off the coasts of California, Florida, New England, the Gulfand the Pacific Northwest.   A group of environmentalists in August sued the InteriorDepartment to halt the Interior Department's leasing plan. Thatsuit is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals.</TEXT></DOC>
