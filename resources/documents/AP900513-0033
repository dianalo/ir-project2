Bush got in a soggy round on the Andrews Air Force Base coursewith pro golfer Lee Elder, former congressman Thomas ``Lud'' Ashleyand national security adviser Brent Scowcroft.   The foursome hit the links shortly after Bush, his wife,Barbara, and Scowcroft attended a communion service at St. John'sEpiscopal Church across Lafayette Square from the White House.   Bush teed off under overcast skies that soon opened up into adownpour. The presidential party played on for 18 holes. Bush, whostarted the round in a pink sweater, finished in a white one, hishair dripping wet.   ``Well, that was fun,'' the president said as he walked off the18th green and paid off a dollar bet to Elder.   An onlooker asked what Bush shot.   ``Quite a bit,'' was the president's only reply.   ``Next time we'll try to get out here when there's a littlesunshine,'' the president told the course manager Andrews, locatedin Maryland suburbs outside Washington.   It has poured during several recent Bush golf outings, both atAndrews and in Bermuda where he played last month after a meetingwith British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.   White House press aide Jay Allison said the Bushes had nothingspecial planned for Mother's Day, except screening a Chuck Norrismovie later Sunday with friends.</TEXT></DOC>
