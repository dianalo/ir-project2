A lawsuit seeking access to such records was brought byTraci Bauer, a 21-year-old senior at Southwest Missouri StateUniversity in Springfield, and the editor of her campusnewspaper, the Southwest Standard.</LP><TEXT>   Under the 1974 federal Family Educational Rights andPrivacy Act, or the Buckley Act, universities can losefederal funding if they release students' educational recordswithout the students' written permission. Southwest Missouricontended that campus police reports are considerededucational records, whether a student is a victim or crimesuspect.   In the opinion released yesterday, U.S. District JudgeRussell Clark in Springfield ruled that Congress neverintended that campus police reports be considered educationalrecords and that it is unconstitutional for the Department ofEducation to withhold funds from universities that releasecrime records.   The judge wrote that the U.S. Constitution does notentitle student crime suspects and crime victims to anygreater privacy rights than those of the general public. Andhe found that, under the First Amendment, students must begiven the same level of access to police reports as any othergroup.   &quot;This is going to send shock waves across the land,&quot; saidDouglas W. Greene, a Springfield lawyer for Ms. Bauer. Hesaid the decision might prompt Congress to review the law.   A spokesman for the Department of Education said hecouldn't comment because he had not yet seen the decision.But the case is believed to be the first in the nation toraise the issue, and a spokesman for Southwest Missouri Statesaid the ruling could affect thousands of schools across thecountry.   While no federal funds have actually been withheld as aresult of disclosure of campus-crime reports, the Departmentof Education has issued warnings to some schools, accordingto the court's opinion.   Southwest Missouri State &quot;and other universities haveoperated under the presumption that {the Buckley Act} isconstitutional in its application,&quot; the university said in astatement. The spokesman said the university's board ofregents is meeting tomorrow and will decide whether to appealthe decision.   Student journalists have long contended that universitieshave used the Buckley Act to protect their images by coveringup crimes. Mark Goodman, executive director of the StudentPress Law Center, said that his group would now encouragestudents to file lawsuits if they are denied access to crimereports. &quot;The decision clearly indicates that universitieswho try to cover up crime may be running afoul of theConstitution,&quot; he says.   Judge Clark also ruled that because the university is apublic institution, the records are subject to disclosureunder the state's &quot;government-in-the-sunshine&quot; law, whichgives the public access to government proceedings and relateddocuments. He awarded Ms. Bauer $1 in damages.   ---   ACTOR JACK KLUGMAN wins suit over ill-fated popcorn-storefranchise.
