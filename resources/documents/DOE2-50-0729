Recently, however,US and Soviet officials have expressed renewed optimism that an accordto reduce strategic offensive arms may follow closely on the heels ofan INF treaty. Given the limited progress that has been made in the StrategicArms Reductions Talks (START) since the 1986 Reykjavik summit, this optimismis surprising. No doubt the momentum and general popularity of the INFnegotiations have whetted the appetites of leaders on both sides hungryfor a place in history as men of peace. Both Shultz and Shevardnadzecharacterized the imminent INF treaty as a beginning, a first step towarda more significant nuclear arms control agreement. More telling, perhaps,is a growing hope among some US officials that the Soviet Union may breakthe stalemate by changing its approach to START in time for the Reaganadministration to shepherd a second arms control treaty through the Senate-ratificationprocess.</TEXT></DOC>
