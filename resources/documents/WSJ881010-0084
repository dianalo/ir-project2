Drawing on my hands-on experience with numerous &quot;Superfund&quot; sites over the past several years, I wish to put forward a more comprehensive answer to the question posed by Mr. Naj, &quot;How to Clean Up Superfund's Act?&quot; The answer I propose is based on risk management as the determinant of priorities, rather than the currently mandated site-by-site total-cleanup strategy.    While I fully agree with Mr. Naj's proposal that private industry be given a much broader role in developing and applying new technology to achieve &quot;final&quot; cleanup, I submit that such participation must be accompanied by a priority system that directs resources first at immediate reduction of risk to human health where that risk exists, after which attention can be directed to longer-term cleanup of residual chemicals.    At almost any former chemical-waste disposal site, there may be an urgent need to reduce risk to human health to acceptable levels. Risk of exposure to chemicals may result from any of the following pathways:   -- Chemicals in ground water moving away from the site, which may have an impact on drinking-water supplies;   -- Chemicals that might be carried off the site by moving surface water such as rain;   --Chemicals that might be moved off the site by the action of wind or might come into contact with people or animals walking on the site.    The technology for dealing with all of these possibilities is well known, and can be implemented effectively once the need has been properly defined. When immediate risks have been reduced to acceptable levels, attention then can be turned to the possible or potential risks thought to arise from chemical materials still in the disposal area, but now isolated from human contact. It is in this area that advances in technology are sorely needed.    Mr. Naj correctly observes that competent technical manpower in this field of technology is in short supply.    Bryce I.
