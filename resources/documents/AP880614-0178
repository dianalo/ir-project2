The biggest economic news was the Commerce Department's reportthat the April trade deficit shrank to $9.89 billion, the bestshowing in more than three years.   Many economists had expected a wider deficit, assuming exportswould not not sustain high levels and imports would surge. Butexports declined only slightly and imports plunged, dampening fearsthat the economy is growing too rapidly and acute inflation isinevitable.   The news was greeted enthusiastically in the dollar, bond andstock markets. The dollar leaped in value against most majorforeign currencies, rising 1.7 percent against the British pound,1.6 percent against the West German mark and 1.1 percent againstthe Japanese yen.   In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of interest rates, thekey 30-year Treasury issue jumped more than $20 per $1,000 in faceamount and its yield fell to 8.81 percent, the lowest point in twomonths.   The bond rally spilled into stocks, where prices surged and thekey Dow Jones industrial average rose 25.07 points to 2,124.47, itshighest close since the October crash. Broader market barometersalso hit post-crash highs.   Elsewhere, oil prices rose after the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries decided to prolong an output-restraint pactuntil the end of the year.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude oil, rose 40 cents tosettle at $16.83 per 42-gallon barrel.   In other economic news, major automakers said sales ofdomestically built cars and light trucks fell 4.1 percent in earlyJune from last year's levels for the same period.   But industry analysts attributed the decline largely to buyingincentives last year that inflated sales. They said that 1988spring sales have held steady and consumer confidence remainsstrong.   Car sales were down for all domestic makers except Toyota MotorCorp., which was just beginning U.S. production last year, andMazda Motor Corp., which began U.S. production in September.</TEXT></DOC>
