Miller, former assistant postmaster general, will head the newdepartment, which reports to Michael S. Coughlin, the deputy postmastergeneral.andM;Until the reorganization is complete, postal officials would not discussspecifics about the new department or how it will affect the service's otherADP units.andP;  USPS spokesman Lou Eberhardt said postal officials expect thedepartment to be in full operation next month.andM;The department will have its main office in Washington, with a field officein each of the service's five postal regions, he said.andM;The reorganization comes after the General Accounting Office reported thePostal Service has not been able to control labor costs and realize savingsfrom automation.andP;  Employees cost $1.3 billion more than estimated for 1989,GAO found.andM;&quot;Work hours that might have been replaced by automation were not put toeffective use elsewhere,&quot; L. Nye Stevens, director of the Government BusinessOperations Issues Branch of GAO's General Government Division, told the HousePost OFfice and Civil Service Committee.andM;The GAO analyzed the service's processing costs and found productivity gainsdwarfed by labor costs.andP;  At 22 sites examined by the Postal InspectionService, automation achieved a third of projected work-hour savings, GAOsaid.andM;&quot;This shortfall in savings was attributed to poor management and utilizationof automated equipment,&quot; Stevens said.andM;Stevens warned that USPS' automation would be valueless if managers cannotuse it effectively.andP;  He said a new system to track automation savings and thenew department may help postal officials improve the service's return on itsADP investment.andM;USPS officials declined to respond to the GAO report.andM;The creation of the new automation department is part of the Postal Service'scontinuing effort to automate mail processing fully by 1995.andP;  A statementfrom the service called the reorganization &quot;a move designed to bring moremanagement oversight to the implementation of automated mail processing.&quot;andM;The service's five-year plan estimates the agency will spend $5 billion onADP for mail processing over the next five years.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
