(DEC), Zenith Data Systems and Sony Corp., to develop systemsbased on RISC processors from MIPS Computing Systems Inc.andP;  These computerswill run either OS/2 3.0, Microsoft's forthcoming high-end operating system,or an Open Software Foundation-compatible version of Unix being developed byThe Santa Cruz Operation Inc.andM;The objective, according to Rod Canion, CEO of Houston-based Compaq, is tolet users run existing software with little or no modification on RISC-basedcomputers.andM;Canion conceded that the group's Advanced RISC Computing (ARC) specification,around which future systems will be built, will not be completed for at leastanother two to three months.andP;  Once the specification is finished, it will beavailable only under nondisclosure to ACE initiative member companies &quot;untilwe actually get machines shipped,&quot; he said.andM;Observers don't expect the initiative to result in changes to corporatecomputing anytime soon.andP;  Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash., won't be able tocomplete its complicated new operating system until late 1992 or early 1993,and customers aren't likely to see products based on the new specificationuntil 1993, according to Vicki Brown, an analyst with International DataCorp., a market-research firm in Framingham, Mass.andM;ACE executives went to great lengths to reassure users that the MIPS-basedcomputers will coexist easily with current computer environments, thanks toOS/2 3.0.andM;Although many observers have predicted that the availability of anIntel-compatible operating system from Microsoft running on RISC-basedcomputers from Compaq and others will end Intel Corp.'s dominance of thedesktop PC market, Gates thinks otherwise.andP;  More than 20 million PCs based onIntel processors were sold last year, he said, while leading workstationvendor Sun Microsystems Inc. sold only 200,000 systems.andM;So even if MIPS-based workstations became the most popular of all time, salesof Intel-based systems would still outpace workstation sales by 100-to-1,Gates said.andP;  &quot;Our primary architecture will continue to be Intel for theforeseeable future.&quot;andM;Likewise, Compaq executives voiced strong support for Intel's microprocessorline.andP;  Asked whether MIPS-based systems will outperform Intel-basedcomputers, Lorie Strong, Compaq's vice president of product marketing, said,&quot;Our research doesn't show a clear winner between Intel and MIPS.&quot;andM;Compaq is developing a MIPS-based computer line because customers who wantUnix &quot;today link Unix and RISC,&quot; Strong said.andP;  In addition, having RISCcomputers protects Compaq in case MIPS' RISC chips end up withprice/performance advantages over Intel processors, she said.andM;Compaq's Canion claimed that the ACE initiative companies &quot;will fully supportthe installed base of PCs, as well as future generations of the X86architecture.&quot;andM;Compaq had little choice about starting work on RISC-based systems, accordingto Canion.andP;  &quot;Our customers have told us they want multiple choices,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;Customers' current investments are fully protected,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;There's justno way that one hardware platform and one operating system can meet [allusers' needs].&quot;andM;Users appeared glad that Compaq has spelled out its RISC plans.andP;  &quot;Theannouncement clarified a lot of issues for me,&quot; said Fred Zickert, manager ofmicrocomputer support at Eaton Corp., a Cleveland manufacturing firm and amajor Compaq customer.andM;Because he no longer has to second-guess Compaq's RISC strategy, Zickert saidhe can now begin including Compaq's RISC systems in his strategic planning.andM;Eaton will undoubtedly buy Compaq's MIPS-based computers.andP;  &quot;We haveapplications that need it now -- work-group computing, manufacturing supportsystems, engineering and very large financial models.andM;--------------------Additional reporting by Laura Brennan</TEXT></DOC>
