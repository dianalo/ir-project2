France and Canada have restored relations with the Tehrangovernment and there are moves to restore links with the countriesof Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the Persian Gulf. Thatincludes Saudi Arabia, Iran's main rival in the Moslem world.   ``There is no reason for us to quarrel with the countries in thesouth of the Persian Gulf,'' Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjanideclared recently.   Saudi Arabia, whose population is predominantly Sunni Moslem,severed relations with Iran, dominated by the rival Shiite sect,last April, citing terorrism and subversion.   To restore ties with the United States, ``the Great Satan,''would climax Iran's widening links with the outside world. But itremains a distant prospect.   The United States severed relations nine years ago when the U.S.Embassy in Tehran was stormed and diplomats held hostage for 444days.   ``We can see no reason to reserve a special place for the UnitedStates,'' Mohammad Javad Larijani, deputy foreign minister for U.S.and European affairs, said in a recent interview with Tehran'sResaalat daily.   ``We have done without it for the last 10 years and can dowithout it for another 100 years.''   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini stressed earlier this month that aslong as he lives there will be no deviation from the ideals of theIslamic revolution, including dealings with ``the criminal Sovietsand world-devouring America.''   Nonetheless, in recent months, Tehran has restored relationswith France after a year's rift and with Canada, which closed itsTehran embassy in 1980 after its diplomats sheltered severalAmericans and smuggled them to safety.   The Iranians are discussing normalizing relations with Britain,frozen a year ago, have opened an embassy in New Zealand, areupgrading relations with the Dutch, Italians and West Germans andseeking to improve ties with the East bloc.   The Iranians are also normalizing relations with Kuwait thatwere all but severed during the 8-year-old war with Iraq, when thenorthern gulf state was a target for Iranian missiles and saboteurs.   Rafsanjani, the most powerful figure in Iran after Khomeini, isthe main architect of Iran's new foreign policy.   Khomeini clearly had given Rafsanjani's foreign policy hisblessing, but the quickening pace of the speaker's bridge-buildinghas alarmed Tehran's radicals. Khomeini's strictures earlier thismonth appeared to be a caution to Rafsanjani to tread warily.   Iran's isolation because of the Islamic revolution's fierceanti-Western ideology and support for terrorism by fundamentalistShiite Moslems cost it dearly during the gulf war.   Rafsanjani, aided by Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, beganopening doors two years ago.   But his efforts gathered momentum after the Tehran government,at his urging, unconditionally accepted a United Nations-sponsoredcease-fire July 18 following a string of military defeats by Iraq.   The cease-fire, which took effect Aug. 20, triggered an intensedebate in Tehran over how to tackle the massive task of postwarreconstruction, and how far Iran should go in opening its doors toforeign capital to pay for it.   President Ali Khamanei declared last month: ``We have bitterexperience of foreign investment in our country. But this will notbe an obstacle to countries wanting to have healthy trade andeconomic relations with us.''   He and Rafsanjani have stressed that Iran's revolutionary idealsmust not be jeopardized by opening up to foreign imports andcompanies to revive the war-battered economy.   But they recognize that Iran's 50 million people are weary ofwartime austerity and that Tehran needs foreign money to rebuildits economy and create jobs.   Hardline radicals, such as Prime Minister Hussein Musavi andInterior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, insist on limited foreignintervention and tight state control of the economy.   ``A completely open-door policy is out of the question,'' Musavisaid in an interview with the London-based Middle East EconomicDigest, his first with a Western publication.   Rafsanjani has not changed the direction of Iran's foreignpolicy because he has any great love for the West. But economic,political and military imperatives apparently convinced him thatthe revolution's long-term prospects of survival lay in ending thewar and reaching out to the world.   Musavi tried to resign in August, claiming among other thingsthat Rafsanjani and others did not consult him on foreign policy.Khomeini ordered him to stop rocking the boat.   U.S. officials have said Washington is prepared to discussrestoring relations with Tehran once it stops supporting terrorismand the nine American hostages in Lebanon are freed.   But Rafsanjani must move cautiously because of widespreadhostility toward the United States, fueled by its navalintervention in the Persian Gulf and the shooting down of anIranian airliner in July, killing all 290 people aboard.   Larijani said in the Resaalat interview, ``If the Americanschange their hostile policies and opt for mutual respect andnon-intervention in Iranian affairs, our relations with the Unitedstates will be like those with any other country.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Ed Blanche is The AP's Middle East News Editor,based in Nicosia.</TEXT></DOC>
