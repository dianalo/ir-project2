The federal bank robbery charge carriesa maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, Dearborn said.   Police said Dickerson demanded money from a teller, and set offa smoke bomb after the bank employee apparently hesitated. Afterthe smoke bomb went off, bank officials gave an undisclosed amountof money to Dickerson, who then detonated a fragmentation bomb madeof match heads stuffed inside a small fire extinguisher, policesaid.   The second bomb sent pieces of metal flying for a half-block andbroke windows, damaged an automatic teller machine and a parked carat the Maryland National Bank branch.   The robber was chased for several blocks by two men. Dickersonlittered the street with $10 and $20 bills and dropped a bagcontaining four more bombs while fleeing, police said.   ``I heard an explosion and a man came running down the street.Somebody said he robbed the bank so I chased him through thealleyway,'' said Jim Phillips. ``He stopped in front of a car andtook off some of his clothes and a wig and sunglasses he had on.''   The two eventually lost sight of the robber. A police officerseveral blocks away spotted Dickerson, who matched a description ofthe robber.</TEXT></DOC>
