The workhas been performed using the computer program MINSUN and concentrateson the optimal portion of solar energy compared with the price of energy,variations in climate from year to year, and different operating conditionsand the optimization of the collector surface for the solar plant. Theresults show that the optimum solar energy fraction is 80-85% with current(1986) energy prices. The optimal collector surface area and storagevolume for the plant are approximately 25 000 m/sup 2/ and 100 000 m/sup3/ respectively. Further, the calculations have shown that a large proportionof the auxiliary energy can be reduced if the operational strategy canbe improved, for example by reducing the return temperature of the districtheating system. The energy price for the optimized plant was then 0.40SEK/kWh.</TEXT></DOC>
