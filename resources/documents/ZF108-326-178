 Diligent network administrators are continually seeking betterand easier ways for users to back up their data.andP;  The MacBack 8000, a newnetwork tape backup system from Redmond, Wash.-based Advanced DigitalInformation Corp., attempts to meet this need with a tape-drive systemconnected to the AppleTalk network and accessible to multiple users.andP;  Butalthough it delivers a good software setup, MacBack falls short inperformance.andM;Installation, specifications.andP;  Measuring 7.5 inches high by 17 inches wide by12 inches deep and weighing 25 pounds, the MacBack unit is a large and heavyhunk of hardware.andP;  It has a door that opens to accept a sturdy tape magazineholding up to 10 quarter-inch tape cartridges.andP;  There are only two hardwarecontrols: the magazine load and unload buttons.andP;  Three lights on the unitindicate power, drive activity and whether the magazine buttons are disabled.andO;The rear of the unit has two 50-pin SCSI connectors, a SCSI ID dial,serial-port connectors and a power switch.andM;Each 300-foot tape cartridge usable by the MacBack can hold 128 Mbytes ofinformation, giving the MacBack 8000 a total storage capacity of more than 1Gbyte.andP;  Given the availability of 8mm and digital-audio tape drives of equalor higher capacities in the same price range, we felt the MacBack's multitapeautochanger was a slightly klunky solution.andM;MacBack 8000 is set up for use much like an AppleShare file server.andP;  The tapedrive is connected to a dedicated Macintosh running MacBack Server, anapplication that monitors incoming network requests and controls the MacBacktape drive and autochanger.andP;  Besides the standard SCSI connector, a serialcable connects the MacBack to the Macintosh modem port.andM;Although hooking up the hardware on our test Macintosh SE was no trouble, wedid have some problems getting the unit to work.andP;  The server softwareinitially didn't recognize the attached unit.andP;  We called the company severaltimes for technical support, but few of our phone calls were returned.andO;Finally, we were told to change an internal jumper switch to correct the SCSItermination, which solved the problem.andM;We used MacBack Server to check the contents of all 10 tapes.andP;  This processtakes over 15 minutes and, unfortunately, happens every time you launch theapplication.andP;  According to the company, a stand-alone server application willsoon be available separately for $99 that can control a variety of other tapedrives besides the MacBack 8000.andM;Operation.andP;  After the drive and server software are set up and a user listinstalled, users on the network may access the tape drive through AdvancedDigital Information's special user software.andP;  The user software consists oftwo Startup documents (INITs) and the MacBack Client application.andP;  One INITsupports the high-speed AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol, and the other willlaunch MacBack Client according to a user-definable schedule.andM;The client software allows you to select which files you wish backed up,specify a regular backup schedule and restore files from the backup tapes toyour local hard disk.andP;  All of the functions available in the clientapplication are also available in the server and stand-alone versions.andM;The software was developed by 3M Corp. and looks like a traditional Macintoshprogram.andP;  Although this made it easy to choose among various functions, thesoftware felt modal and un-Maclike.andP;  It typically requires a specificsequence of tasks to accomplish a single function.andM;The client software's main strength is its ability to set up a regular backupschedule that will automatically launch the application and perform thebackup.andP;  The calendar window to specify the schedule is one of theapplication's better points and will be learned easily by new users.andP;  Thedocumentation is of average quality and helped to ameliorate the confusingnature of the client software.andP;  In addition to the installation and usersguides, extensive on-line help is available.andM;Performance.andP;  Multiple users cannot access MacBack simultaneously.andP;  Inattempting to do so, we managed to freeze both client and server machines;MacBack's normal response to attempted multi-user access is a confusing errormessage.andP;  Instead of informing the user that it was busy, MacBack said it&quot;couldn't find&quot; the unit, which implied a network problem when one didn'texist.andP;  We also received an error message that complained about a memoryproblem on a user's machine when the actual problem was corrupted directoryfiles on the server.andM;When both client and server Macintoshes were connected via the same LocalTalknetwork, we found that MacBack backed up data to the server at about 500Kbytes per minute.andP;  It also required an additional minute or two to updatethe tape directory after the file transfer.andP;  Data was restored at a slightlyfaster rate.andM;We had significant performance problems when we tested MacBack over FastPath4Ethernet bridges from Kinetics Inc. (now part of Novell Inc.).andP;  The backupspeed was slashed to an incredible 50 Kbytes per minute.andP;  At that speed ittakes nearly 24 hours to back up a 70-Mbyte hard disk.andP;  The company confirmedthat there are problems with using MacBack in bridged AppleTalk environmentsand suggested that we would get maximum performance if the client and servermachines were connected to the same Ethernet network.andM;Conclusions.andP;  Does MacBack meet our standards for a LAN backup device?andO;Despite some problems, the software looks like an advance over other backupsystems we have used, and by itself it might be worthwhile.andP;  But the totalpackage performed far below expectations.andP;  The poor performance in bridgedenvironments and tardy technical support need to be corrected by AdvancedDigital Information.andP;  Until the problems shadowing this new entrant arefixed, we cannot recommend the MacBack 8000 for LAN backup.andM;Why should you back up?andM;Although it seems like a silly question to experienced computer users, thedisaster of data loss is usually unappreciated by those who have neverexperienced it.andP;  Network managers who know about the dangers of hardware andoperational errors need to instruct users how to guard against it.andM;The challenge for those managers is how to make backup a regular andpalatable part of users' computing routines.andP;  A basic information-safetyprocedure is to concentrate on those files that need the most protection:data files, also known as documents, created in applications.andP;  If a user'shard disk is destroyed, it is much easier to replace the lost applicationsand system files than data the user has created.andP;  Good data-backup trainingshould enable users to easily copy newly created data files to a backupsystem, be it a floppy disk, remote file system or tape drive.andM;AppleShare file servers have provided an easy way for users to copy theirimportant files to a convenient remote file system that is periodicallybacked up by the network administrator.andP;  AppleShare is simple to use, and theclient software is part of Apple's system software.andP;  A simple one-page tipsheet can be helpful, showing users how to copy important files to anAppleShare file server.andM;This scheme usually entails a file server that is itself backed up to tape ona regular schedule.andP;  Any SCSI-compatible tape backup system can be used tocopy the file server's disks to tape.andP;  Maintaining a sequence of tape backupsensures access to older versions of files, and tapes can be moved off-site toguard against catastrophes such as fire, earthquake or flood.andM;Direct tape backup requires the system administrator to take the file serverdown periodically, restart the Mac with a special system disk and start theapplication that creates the backup tapes.andP;  Data transfer rates for directSCSI tape backup systems are typically about 2 Mbytes per minute.andP;  -- ByVernon KeenanandM;Advanced Digital Information Corp.andM;MacBack series tape drives: $1,895 to $6,495; software alone: $99andM;14737 N.E.andP;  87th St., Redmond, Wash.andP;  98073-2996; (206) 881-8004; (800)336-1233andM;AppleandM;Apple 40SC: $1,499; AppleCD SC: $899andM;20525 Mariani Ave., Cupertino, Calif.andP;  95014; (408) 996-1010andM;Blackhole Technology Inc.andM;MacTAPE/SCSI-5: $5,500andM;225 West St., Winchester, Mass.andP;  01890; (617) 721-7690andM;Brier Technology Inc.andM;2363 Bering Drive, San Jose, Calif.andP;  95131; (408) 435-8463andM;Connectix Corp.andM;Virtual 2.0: $199; with PMMU: $275andM;125 Constitution Drive, Menlo Park, Calif.andP;  94025; (415) 324-0727andM;FWB Inc.andM;HammerDAT: $3,995; HammerTape 250: $1,895; HammerTape FMS: $9,995andM;2040 Polk St., Suite 215, San Francisco, Calif.andP;  94109; (415) 474-8055andM;GCC Technologies Inc.andM;HyperTape II: $999andM;55 Winter St., Waltham, Mass.andP;  02152; (617) 890-0880 GigaTrend Inc.andM;Gigapack MAC: $5,950andM;2234 Rutherford Road, Carlsbad, Calif.andP;  92008; (619) 931-9122andM;Insite Peripherals Inc.andM;4433 Fortran Drive, San Jose, Calif.andP;  95134-2302; (408) 946-8080andM;Iomega Corp.andM;Bernoulli Box II: $1,299 to $2,799andM;1821 West 4000 South, Roy, Utah 84607; (801) 778-3000; (800) 456-5522andM;Irwin Products Group, a division of Cipher Data Products Inc.andM;Model 5080: $1,295andM;2101 Commonwealth Blvd., Ann Arbor, Mich.andP;  48105; (313) 930-9000andM;Maynard Electronics Inc.andM;MaynStream 2200HS: $7,495andM;460 E.
