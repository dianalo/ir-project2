Several dailies quoted a Shiite Moslem news agency, the DailyNews, as saying the Bonn government was engaged in direct contactswith the kidnappers holding Cordes in Beirut.   ``These energetic negotiations might culminate in Cordes' releasewithin a few days in exchange for releasing Mohammed Ali and AbbasHamadi,'' the agency was quoted as saying. The Hamadis are Lebanesebrothers held in West Germany.   Newspapers said the agency cited ``sources concerned with thehostages' affair in Lebanon'' for its report.   The agency is known to have close links with moderate ShiiteMoslem clerics in Lebanon, including Sheik Mohammed MehdiShamsheddin, head of Lebanon's Supreme Shiite Council, and SheikAbdul-Amir Kabalan, the sect's senior religious judge.   Cordes, a 53-year-old businessman, was kidnapped Jan. 17, 1987,shortly after Mohammed Ali Hamadi was arrested in West Germany. Agroup calling itself Holy Warriors for Freedom claimed June 8 itabducted Cordes and said it would release him if the Hamadi brotherswere freed.   Mohammed Ali Hamadi is to go on trial in July in Frankfurt oncharges of air piracy and murder in the June 1985 hijacking of a TWAjetliner. In the hijacking, Shiite sky pirates held 39 Americanscaptive for 17 days and killed a U.S. Navy diver.   Abbas Hamadi, 29, is serving a 13-year prison term forinvolvement in kidnapping Cordes and another West German, AlfredSchmidt.   Schmidt, 48, was abducted in west Beirut Jan. 20, 1987 and freedSept. 7.   The group holding Cordes is believed to be headed by the Hamadis'older brother, Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, chief of security for theIranian-backed Hezbollah.   Hezbollah also is believed to be an umbrella for extremistfactions holding most of the 18 foreign hostages missing in Lebanon.They include nine Americans.</TEXT></DOC>
