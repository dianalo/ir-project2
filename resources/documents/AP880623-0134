The study by the Institute for Educational Leadership, aWashington-based think tank, said steps must be taken now to assurethese new workers have adequate education and job choices.   The study drew its data from demographic analyses of several``indicator'' states considered representative of the nation'spopulation: New York, Florida, Connecticut, Michigan, Texas,California, Indiana, Arizona, Delaware, Kentucky and Ohio.   It concluded that 20 million people will start work between nowand the year 2000, and that 83 percent of them will be women,minorities and immigrants.   Unless better education opportunities are provided, the jobsavailable to these new workers will continue to be low-level,low-paying service positions, the study said.   For example, for every computer programmer hired in the UnitedStates, there will be 13 new jobs for cashiers, the study said.   States in the Southwest will feel a decided impact on theirstudent populations and work force from the increasing numbers ofHispanics, while the Southeastern states will face pressures fromthe growing number of blacks, the study said. States like New York,Florida and California will have to make sure they have resourcesto provide for a fast-growing elderly population.   ``There are significant challenges ahead which will require allsectors of society to join together if our states are to providequality education and meaningful employment,'' said HaroldHodgkinson, a senior fellow at the institute.   The institute includes representatives from education, businessand the media. It is supported by various private foundations andalso receives some federal money.</TEXT></DOC>
