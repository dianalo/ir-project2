(Devil's advocate.) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Kelly-Bootle, Stan.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>SHIFT THEM PARADIGMS!andM;Having failed to half, or even decelerate, the paradigmatic bandwagon, I havedecided to jump aboard at the deep end, feet first and belly up, ignoring alldangers and mixed metaphors.andP;  (Which recalls the politician's warning: &quot;Theship of state has a difficult road ahead&quot;.andP;  He was also reported as saying:&quot;I smell a rat but I intend to grasp this nettle firmly and nip it in thebud&quot;.andP;  I discount this report and urge you not to spread such scurrilousrumors.)andM;For example, just to give you one instantiation, I have recently shifted fromthe 8088-with-640-KB-RAM-and-20-MB-HD paradigm to the80386-with-4-MB-RAM-and-85-MB-HD paradigm, scorning all intermediateparadigms.andP;  If you shop around, you'll find that some emporia are willing tosell you the equipment and throw in the appropriate paradigm at no extracharge.andP;  However, don't expect much of a trade-in on your old paradigm: &quot;Ihope you won't take offense, Sir, but, really--O dear me--we haven't seen oneof those in years.andP;  I doubt if it's even listed in Kuhn's Blue Book.andP;  Haveyou tried the Smithsonian?&quot;andM;To celebrate my conversion, I have updated for you and Ella Fitzgerald an oldtorch song, &quot;There'll Be Some Changes Made&quot;.andP;  Scat along with Ella in B flat:andM;There'll be a meteorological paradigm shift;andM;Similarly, an oceanographic paradigm shift;andM;As of this memo, please note that paradigms will also be shifted in theandM;Ambulatory, sociolinguistic, and onomastic environments;andM;The class of paradigmatically unshifted objects will soon be empty;andM;O Lawd, there'll be some paradigm shifts today!andP;  Hey, Hey!andM;There'll be some paradigm shifts made! Yeah!andM;[The scansion needs a lot of work, Stan!--Ed.]andM;For our younger readers, who may not be familiar with the original, it goes:andM;There'll be a change in the weather,andM;A change in the sea;andM;From now on, there'll be a change in me;andM;I'll change my way of walking, my talk and my name;andM;Nothin' about me will be quite the same;andM;O Lord, there'll be some changes made today;andM;There'll be some changes made!andM;Rotate Them Paradigms!andM;The chip makers, too, are responding to this growing market.andP;  According tousually well-informed observers and typically well-bribed insiders, theMotorola 68080 will have the following new instructions:andM;LSPR Dm, #n (Logical Shift Paradigm Right): shift the paradigm in register Dmn places to the right.andM;LSPR Dm,Dn (Logical Shift Paradigm Right): shift the paradigm in register Dmto the right by the number of places given in register Dn (modulo a number Icannot reveal!).andM;LSPL (Logical Shift Paradigm Left): operands as above.andM;There are also four Arthmetical variants, ASPR, and so on.andP;  These shifts, andthe associated rotates, ROPR, ROPXR, etc., work in the obvious manner--thatis to say they are subject to the usual quirks that make assembly languagesso much fun.andP;  For example, paradigms can only be shifted left an odd numberof places on even-numbered dates, and (to maintain orthogonality) vice versa.andM;Careless shifting may lose you significant bits of your paradigm, and in theworst (best) case you could lose your paradigm completely.andM;Depending on the size and direction of the paradigm shift, the MC68080 can bemade a CISC, MISC, or RISC processor.andP;  The really exciting innovation is thatyou can shift to the RAM (Reduced Address Mode) or DRAM (Drastically ReducedAddress Mode) paradigms.andP;  The latter uses only direct, data-registeraddressing.andP;  RAM (Random Access Memory) is not supported in DRAM, so there isno need for address registers or address modes.andM;However, you get from 0 to 2.sup.64 data registers (the width of which Icannot divulge), depending on the model.andP;  The economy 0-register model isfully &quot;register-ready&quot;.andP;  &quot;You'll know when you are ready for registers&quot;,quipped my informant.andP;  &quot;Entre nous and the gatepost, the regs are all on-chipawaiting activation--zip-zip with our exclusive on-site laser-upgradeservice.andP;  It's an idea we got browsing through an old IBM 360 marketingguide.&quot;andM;When I queried the unfortunate overloading of the acronyms RAM and DRAM, aspokeslady replied: &quot;Yes, some of us noticed that, but there are only so manyletters in the alphabet, and the meaning is usually clear from the context.andO;In any case, the older usage will soon be obsolete, and so will a largesection of the Japanese electronics industry.&quot;andM;The OOPS Answer Man CornerandM;Reader J.D.andP;  of Springfield, IL, writes: Dear Mr. OOPS:andM;How can I tell if my Sinclair ZX-81 BASIC interpreter supports the ObjectOriented paradigm?andP;  Check for $9.95 enclosed for your Save the Paradigm Fund.andO;Dear J.D.:andM;Try running the following lines of code: IF INSTR(1, CLASS$, &quot;OBJECT&quot;) = 0THEN PRINT &quot;BUY ACTOR&quot; : END ON VAL(X$) GOSUB VIRTUAL,CONSTRUCT,DESTRUCT DEFPRIVATE FN(A) = A*AandM;Let me know how you make out.andP;  And keep them checks rolling in.andM;Frustrated, of Clapham Common, London, writes: Dear OOPS Answer Man:andM;Reading the excellent documentation that came with our new HCR C++ version2.0 compiler, I was delighted to see that identifier names can now be of anylength--all characters are significant, not just the first 32!andM;I go back to those mean old days when one single-case letter was the limit,two if you were lucky, and even then one of the two was your bleedin' dollarsign or your bleedin' percent sign.andP;  And to make matters worse, scope andvisibility had not been invented.andP;  Talk about your Dark Ages!andP;  And nowadayswhen you can hide things, there's less need to, if you get my drift.andM;Any road, my colleague Harry who works on the same project in the nextcubicle is always using global names like: extern long doubleIDontMindIfIDoVeryKindImSure;andM;And since we have the same weird sense of humor, his identifiers are alwaysclashing with mine.andP;  Even if I try: extern long doubleIDontMindIfDoVeryKindImSureTaEverSo; chances are that Harry gets in therefirst, right down to the last case shift.andP;  so, hoping to check HCR's claimsand nail Harry once and for all, I declared a pubic function using all theletters in sequence from Gorn Wiv The Bleedin' Wind--omitting, of course,white space and illegal punctuation.andM;Or should that be &quot;whitespace&quot;?andP;  Between you, me, and Douglas Hofwhatisname,I think we've got one of them self-reverent fings here wot can drive a personbarmy--is there white space in whitespace or whitespace in white spaceor--where was I?andP;  Well, after a few weeks of steady typing, compiling, andlinking, blow me down if I didn't get a &quot;function defined twice&quot; error andMargaret bleedin' Mitchell scrolling for days!andP;  What can I do? DearFrustrated:andM;Underlines for blanks might do the trick (and improve legibility, too) or youcould try just changing the 80,021st character from &quot;s&quot; to &quot;f&quot;.andP;  But frankly,my dear, I don't give a damn!andP;  However, keep them questions and checksrolling in.andM;Reader's CornerandM;Responding to my list of sources for the DP Laxicon (see this space in Vol.andO;7 No.andP;  8), Rick Rodman writes from Manassas, VA: &quot;...you neglected to mentionfood (e.g., menus)&quot;.andP;  I did, in fact, refer to &quot;chips&quot;, the Liverpudlianstaple diet known here as French (sic) Fries, but Rick must share the genralsuspicion that all Scousian dishes are inedible.andP;  He enclosed a clipping fromDEC Professional (May 1989):andM;The Xworkbench program would be analogous to MicroSoft Paint or MacDraw.andP;  Theprogrammer would have a palate of objects (windows, widgets and gadgets) thatcould be selected...andM;Ah, Rembrandt's sombre palate, and the taste of burnt sienna.andP;  I'll just havethe widgets please--medium rare.andM;My thanks to Ira Chayut, who like the &quot;Open Column&quot; concept.andP;  His &quot;OpenRaincoat&quot; badge was a hit at the recent Xhibition.andP;  Ira is amused by Sun's&quot;Open Windows&quot;.andP;  Whenever he opens a window, he says, he gets bugs!andM;Earlier space constraints excluded mention of Mark Warrian's submission toour Profound/Inane contest.andP;  He found the rumor of a Wang takeover by Xeroxhighly risible: &quot;The thought of a computer company being rescued by Xerox isabout as absurd as you can get ...andP;  the combined marketing savvy of Xerox andWang pushes inanity to truly profound heights&quot;.andM;Chapter 1: In Which TheandM;True Doryphore is RevealedandM;Several months ago (Vol.andP;  7 No.andP;  7), I reported Israel Shenker's definitionof a doryphore as one who takes excessive delight in pointing out minorerrors.andP;  This prompted Charles R. Moose of Springfield--the unrifled,unlincolned Springfield of unruffled Virginia--to write: &quot;I would like to beincluded in the camp of doryphores, but cannot find the word in either RandomHouse or Webster's unabridged dictionary.andP;  Can you give me a reference to anauthoritative source for the definition, or did it originate with Mr.andO;Shenker?&quot;andM;Nor, Charles, is it in Mrs. Byrne's Dictionary of Unusual, Obscure, andPreposterous Words (a wonderful collection from University Books, Secaucus,NJ, 1974).andP;  As the electronic thesauri say: doryphore is not in thisdictionary, but if it were it would fall between: dorty adj.andP;  bad-temperedandandM;doseh n. a Mohammedan custom of riding over the prostrate bodies of dervishesandM;(Perhaps my Ayatollah readers could inform this pastime.andP;  How is it scored?andO;Tehran Camels 3, Abu Dhabi Dervishes 0?andP;  Dervishes losing streak stretches to541?)andM;But Charles, you should consult your trusty old Trevoux: Dictionnairefrancois-latin.andP;  Not your 3-vol.andP;  1704 ed., nor your 5-vol.andP;  1721 ed.,andO;nor--damn it--your 6-vol.andP;  eds.andP;  of 1732, 1734, and 1743.andP;  Yes, Dieu soitloue, you'll find doryphore in your 7-vol.andP;  1752 ed.! Mangez vos coeursdehors, Webster, Random, et Madame Byrne! You simply take the Greek pherein(to carry) and doru (a lance), which gives you a portelance or lance bearer(the operatic equivalent of pumping gas in Hollywood).andP;  By 1827, thesupplement to the Dictionnaire de l'Academie francaise was reporting asecondary meaning: coleoptere d'Amerique; d'apr.andP;  les bandes noires deselytres.andP;  So, mixing our etymology and our entomology, we have the doryphoreas a nasty, striped, hard-cased beetle pecking away at potatoes and typoswith equal aplomb.andM;Chapter 2: In Which TheandM;Doryphore is Out-Doryphored!andM;Wayne Hathaway of Ultra Technologies, San (next aleph-0 exits off US 101)Jose, CA, writes:andM;I really hate to bring something like this up (especially since it relates toa column in which my name appears, and on the very same page!), but when onelives by the nit-pick, one must be prepared to at least suffer a little atthe picking of others.andM;In your August [typo for &quot;august&quot;?--SKB] column you say: &quot;If a kettle ofwater placed on a hot stove has a small but finite probability of freezingsolid...&quot; I, too, used to use that phrase, at least until my statistics profpointed out none too subtly that since they range between 0 and 1, allprobabilities are in fact &quot;finite&quot;.andP;  Perhaps, as he would have said, youmeant to say &quot;nonzero&quot;?andM;Chapter 3: In Which TheandM;Crowd Falls SilentandM;As Stan Prepares His DefenseandM;Unblushingly donning my Signor Wriggletto costume, I reply as follows:andM;Escape #1: As hinted in the column, this was a boozy Boston non-tea party,provably conducive to inexactitudes.andP;  We had also exceeded the unofficiallimit of two servings of boston Harbor fish per week.andP;  (I was told thatBoston Harbor fish now say &quot;thank your&quot; when caught.)andM;Escape #2: I had intended to surround the challenged phrase with quotationmarks to indicate that I knew that you knew that we all knew that the cliche&quot;small but finite&quot; was to be taken neither literally nor &quot;literally&quot;.andO;Perhaps all satire carries implicit, global quotation marks.andP;  Tom Clune founda wonderful misuse of the gloss.andP;  A writer on NiCad cells claimed that theyandM;literally &quot;remember&quot;.andM;Escape #3: Just as c (the velocity required to travel one light-year in oneyear!) is both a finite number and an infinite velocity (c [is greater than]= v for all observable v), I boldly invoke the same relationship between thefinite number 1 and the infinite probability P = 1.andP;  Nobody would claim thatthe kettle is certain to freeze on a hot stove (if so, getting your stove hotto begin the experiment might present a problem), so the predicate &quot;finite&quot;is correct, though admittedly a mite pedantic.andM;Odious AdCompsandM;AdComps are those comparison tables with confident Y's (Yes! we got thatfeature!) and derisory N's (No! They don't got it!).andP;  I saw one recently thatbackfired: ASAP Software Express Inc. of Northbrook, IL, is pushingAshton-Tate's new dBASE IV.andP;  Its table purports to compare dBASE IV withdBASE III Plus.andP;  Under the feature column &quot;Compatible with dBASE III Plus?&quot;andO;dBASE IV scores a Y, but poor dBASE III Plus gets an N!andP;  If dBASE III Plus istruly non-self-compatible, the sooner it is replaced the better, I say.andM;E/S--The Last WordandM;Philip Daley of Hillsboro, NH writes:andM;I have never considered the E/S ratio when generating surplus error messagesfrom a compilation.andP;  I always took into account the (number of programlines)/(number of error messages), and when this ratio becomes greater thanone, you are on the right track.andM;My comment: this ratio would not work for me, but I could use the reciprocal(hee-hee!).andP;  Philip is &quot;rather more interested in programs that compile andlink correctly, but then explode when run.&quot;andP;  The following excerpt from agood sized source file compiles and runs under Microsoft C, but blows up onan early Wang C. main() ( test(); } test() int test; test=1; printf(&quot;%d/n&quot;,test); }andM;Yes, Wang C at the time had function and variable names in same name space!andM;FootnoteandM;From Dr. Dobbs' (May 1989) Michael Swaine (winding up an interview withRobert Floyd):andM;It occurs to me that, although we've used the word paradigm liberally, wehaven't really defined it except through examples.andP;  Maybe that's the best wayto define it.andP;  But could you give one more example of a paradigm?andM;Self-reverence strikes again.andM;For Sale:andM;Unused, rare.andP;  300 feet of banner hex dump in DeVille Gothic.andP;  No offerrefused.andP;  Would suit visually impaired.andM;Stan Kelly-Bootle has been computing, on and off, for over 30 years.andP;  He isthe author of The Devil's DP Dictionary, The MC68000 Primer, The Modula-2Primer, and Mastering Turbo C, and other books.andP;  His ninth title, due soon,is Mastering C++.andP;  Stan can be reached on MCI as SKELLY-BOOTLE ID: 392-5678.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
