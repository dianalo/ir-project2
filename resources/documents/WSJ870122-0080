Raymond Sodini, 59 years old and a judge since 1971, was accused of accepting bribes totaling more than $1,000 a month between 1980 and 1983, allegedly in exchange for fixing cases and steering clients toward lawyers who had paid him off. The plea came in the tenth week of his trial.    Mr. Sodini is the forty-second person indicted as a result of the Greylord undercover probe to plead guilty or be convicted. One defendant was acquitted, one is a fugitive, one died and 10 are awaiting trial. In addition to the prison term, Mr. Sodini could also be subject to a fine of as much as $30,000. He couldn't be reached to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
