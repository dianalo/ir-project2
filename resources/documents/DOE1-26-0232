First-ordereffects become dominant as the spatial extent of the electron pulse becomesmuch shorter than the radio frequency wavelength. A buncher cavity betweenthe electron gun and accelerator can improve the quality of the acceleratedbeam. The buncher has two adjustable parameters, the input power andits phase with respect to the accelerator. The input power determinesthe bunching parameter, which is a measure of the extent of bunching.The buncher cavity's phase controls the phase at which the electron pulsesenter the accelerator and thus far their final energy. In any travelling-waveinteractions, half of the beam gains energy while the other half losesenergy. For synchronism of the beam with the wave, the two terms exactlycancel and there is no net power transfer. Energy loss dominates gainwhen the beam is properly mistuned from synchronism. The enhancementscheme for the cyclotron autoresonant maser, recognized as appropriatefor any TWI, is to effectively suppress the electrons which are phasedto gain energy by using the gyro-resonant properties of a FEL wiggler.This enhancement wiggler is distinct from the FEL wiggler.</TEXT></DOC>
