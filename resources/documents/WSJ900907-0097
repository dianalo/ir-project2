The case is one of the biggest ever against a penny-stockfirm and roughly equals the size of the case against Blinder,Robinson andamp; Co., the Denver penny-stock brokerage giant thatthe SEC has been battling for years.</LP><TEXT>   So far, all of the defendants appear to be fighting theSEC charges, which also include allegations of insidertrading. The agency's civil suit, filed in federal districtcourt in Denver, seeks repayment of all profits plus $3million of civil penalties for the insider-trading charges.   The agency said the firms, Power Securities Corp., LasVegas, and Allied Capital Group Inc., Englewood, Colo., alongwith executives and promoters of the firms, misled investorsinto buying penny stocks through fraudulent sales pitches andused &quot;high pressured, coercive sales practices.&quot; The firms,which the SEC said had a &quot;secret working relationship,&quot;netted $9.4 million through excessive markups in sixsecurities, according to the commission.   The SEC also said the firms manipulated the market for thesecurities of Star Publications Inc. and Art Cards Inc., twoother companies with penny stocks. Power and Allied&quot;secretly&quot; limited the supply of securities, artificiallycontrolling the supply, demand and price of Star Publicationsstock, the agency said. In the case of Art Cards, thebrokerage houses disseminated false information toprospective investors, the SEC said. These two &quot;schemes&quot;resulted in illegal profits of more than $10 million, the SECsaid.   Some of the claims made by the brokerage firms wereblatantly false, the SEC said. For example, Power gavebrokers scripts to read to clients that touted pop artistPeter Max and Yoko Ono, wife of the late Beatle John Lennon,as spokesmen for Art Cards. Power salesmen claimed that thetwo had appeared on Music Television, the Larry King &quot;Live&quot;Show on Cable News Network and elsewhere to promote ArtCards, the SEC said. But neither Mr. Max nor Ms. Ono workedfor the company, the agency said.   The SEC also said that Power scripts stated that Star had55 million shares outstanding and only 20 million trading;but the company actually had 170 million to 500 millionshares outstanding at the time the statements were made, thecommission contended. In addition, Power brokers stated thatStar's razor product was biodegradable when in fact the razorwas made of plastic that wouldn't decompose and wasn'tbiodegradable, the SEC said.   The agency also charged the two brokerage houses withinsider trading in Star securities before the company wasacquired by closely held Inner Vision Inc. The SEC is seekingrepayment of $1 million in allegedly illegal profits, plus $3million in insider-trading fines.   In addition to the firms, the SEC charged Power's chiefexecutive officer, Richard T. Marchese; Power's formerpresident Orville L. Sandberg; Allied President PeterMercaldi; Allied's former president, Barry H. Freedman; andseveral other executives of the two firms.   A person at Allied Capital said that Mr. Mercaldi andother officials qualified to comment were out of town. PowerSecurities and the other officials named in the suit couldn'tbe reached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
