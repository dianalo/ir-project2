<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-01-0749 </DOCNO><TEXT>In one- and two-dimensional computer simulations we investigate anomaloushigh-frequency resistivity in a plasma driven by a large electric fieldoscillating near the electron plasma frequency. The large field excitesthe oscillating two-stream and the ion-acoustic decay instabilities inagreement with the linear theory. When the ion and electron fluctuationssaturate, a strong anomalous heating of the plasma sets in. This strongheating is due to an efficient coupling of the externally imposed largeelectric field to the plasma by ion fluctuations. We determine the anomalouscollision frequency and the saturation fluctuation amplitudes as a functionof the external field amplitude and frequency, and the electron-ion massratio. A simple nonlinear theory gives results in reasonable agreementwith simulations. 24 refs., 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
