RoseStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/05/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CANDACOMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)PETROLEUM (PET)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS) </IN><TEXT>   Concern about potential conflict in the Middle East pushed foreign currency futures lower for the second consecutive day, but some analysts and traders predicted that a temporary respite is near.    The declines reflect a flight to the dollar by investors seeking a haven amid the international turmoil, analysts said. And the recent strength in oil prices is considered positive for the dollar because the U.S. is relatively less dependent on oil imports than Japan and Western Europe.    Continued flow of foreign cash into the U.S. also is contributing to bullishness about the dollar, said Michael Ballow, an analyst in Chicago at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. That trend should continue as the U.S. trade deficit shrinks and investors realize that the money supply is growing more slowly in the U.S. than in other nations, Mr. Ballow said.    However, despite the bearishness surrounding most foreign currency futures, those currencies have fallen too far too fast and should find support, or buying, near current levels, Mr. Ballow said.    The foreign currencies also could be supported by central bank intervention, said Anne Parker Mills, international currencies analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York. Still, even this might not do much to sap the strength of the dollar, Ms. Mills said.    Dennis Gartman, president of Gartman Financial Services Inc. in Portsmouth, Va., said that if the foreign currencies stabilize but fail to rally in the next few days, he would expect their downturn to resume.    Meanwhile, Mr. Gartman is placing some bets on Canadian dollar futures. The Canadian currency benefits not only from a perception that it, too, is a &quot;safe haven,&quot; he said, but from Canada's position as a big producer of precious metals and oil.    In other futures markets yesterday:    ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices sank below $22 a barrel amid profit-taking following Monday's surge. Traders continued to focus on the Persian Gulf, where Iran completed the first stage of its naval maneuvers near the Strait of Hormuz. Until Iran's intentions become clearer, though, some traders will stay on the sidelines, brokers said. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for September delivery slipped 19 cents a barrel to $21.97. Heating oil and gasoline also closed lower. Although crude prices easily could jump $2 a barrel if there is an attack on shipping in the Persian Gulf, &quot;the market could be susceptible to a dramatic correction&quot; if those problems pass, said Donald Morton, vice president, energy futures, at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in Boston. In the meantime, many traders are reluctant to hold short, or selling, positions for any length of time. &quot;If you're short the market, and something happens in the gulf,&quot; a New York trader said, &quot;you'll soon be looking for a new job.&quot;    PRECIOUS METALS: Platinum futures prices surged amid continued strong bullion demand from Japan, leading gold and silver higher. Some of the strength in precious metals continues to stem from concern about a possible strike Sunday by South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers. Although the chances of a halt in output are remote, &quot;the labor situation seems to be getting worse, and the possibility of a disruption is creeping into the market,&quot; said William O'Neill, director of research at Elders Futures Inc. in New York. October platinum on the New York Merc surged $14.10 an ounce to $648.70. It was the eighth advance in the past 11 sessions; during that time, October platinum has risen $74.80 an ounce, or 13%. However, if a South African strike is averted, precious metal prices could tumble, analysts and traders warned. And if that happens, &quot;platinum prices could get hit pretty hard,&quot; a New York trader said.    GRAINS andamp; SOYBEANS: Forecasts of rain in the Midwest pushed soybean, corn and wheat futures prices lower. The National Weather Service predicted as many as 10 days in a row of normal temperatures and above-normal rainfall throughout most of the Farm Belt. The forecast appeared to signal the end of a month-long hot and dry spell, and eased concern about crop damage. &quot;Assuming this weather forecast is unchanged, there will be continued pressure on prices,&quot; said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. Meanwhile, some traders were surprised by farm state reports that said corn and soybean crops were in better shape than expected. In Iowa only 2% to 3% of the corn and soybean crop is in poor condition, a state official said. An Illinois official said 74% of the state's corn crop and 79% of its soybean crop are in good to excellent shape. Michael Hunst of the Indiana Agricultural Statistics Service said about 89% of that state's soybean crop is in good to excellent shape.    LIVESTOCK andamp; MEATS: The price of pork bellies for August delivery soared the daily limit of two cents a pound amid news that the supply of pork bellies, or uncured slabs of bacon, in frozen storage continued to shrink. Meanwhile, cattle futures prices rose amid heavy buying of cattle by meatpackers in the cash market. On Monday alone, cattle raisers in the Texas Panhandle sold about half of what they expected to sell in the entire week, said Charles Levitt, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Chicago.    COCOA: Prices fell amid the prospect that Ivory Coast's cocoa harvest will be more abundant than expected because of recent heavy rains. &quot;The rains have taken away the last major bullish factor in the market,&quot; an analyst said. September cocoa settled at $1,928 a metric ton, down $19, after being down as much as $42. The day's low of $1,905 represented a drop of $245 in the past three weeks. The early weakness also was attributed in part to arbitrage-related selling. With the dollar stronger against the British pound, traders bought cocoa contracts in London with pounds and sold them at relatively higher dollar prices in New York, said Debra Tropp, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. Also weakening prices, Miss Tropp said, was a retreat from the market by chocolate makers, who are well-supplied for the near term. &quot;When prices were rising sharply because of the dry weather in the Ivory Coast and West Africa generally, they bought cocoa beans out of concern that the supply would tighten,&quot; she said. </TEXT></DOC>
