The award ceremony and luncheon at the Imperial Palace incentral Tokyo was the first meeting between the two men sinceAkihito succeeded his father, the late Emperor Hirohito, in Januaryand since Reagan retired to California.   ``I am humbled and deeply honored to have been awarded,'' Reagansaid.   Akihito and Empress Michiko looked on as palace Grand Master ofCeremonies Kiyoshi Sumiya presented the award to Reagan, palaceofficials said. Nancy Reagan, Crown Prince Naruhito and AmbassadorMichael Armacost also attended the ceremony and luncheon, they saidon condition of anonymity.   The Reagans last met the imperial couple in October 1987 whenthey made an official visit to the United States.   Reagan received the award from the Japanese government forpromoting peace and friendship with Japan and for working toprotect the free trade system during his eight years in office,officials said. The last and only other U.S. president to receivethe honor was Dwight Eisenhower.   Later in the day, Reagan, who is in Japan at the invitation ofFujisankei Communications Group and the Japanese government, metwith Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and attended a dinner held byKaifu in his honor.   At the dinner, Kaifu admired Reagan's popularity, noted thedeepening of bilateral relations during his years in office andwarmly congratulated Reagan on his award.   ``I know that over the years, every relationship has its ups anddowns. Even among the best of friends, there are sometimes issueswhich need careful and candid evaluation,'' Reagan said, alludingto often rocky trade issues.   Reagan and Fujisankei have refused to confirm reports he willreceive about $2 million for his appearances on television and atcharitable events during his Oct. 20-28 stay.   Fujisankei, Japan's largest media group, has said it wasspending $7 million on the visit. On Sunday, the group sponsored agala benefit concert for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Libraryattended by over 10,000 people.   Like its chairman, Nobutaka Shikanai, many of Fujisankei's mediaoutlets espouse conservatism and nationalism.   At the time of Hirohito's death on Jan. 7, the Fuji TV networkgenerally carried less critical views of Japan's imperial system.</TEXT></DOC>
