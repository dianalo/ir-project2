Speaking on the eve of meetings with Japanese FinanceMinistry officials in the latest round of the so-calledYen-Dollar talks, David Mulford, Treasury undersecretary forinternational affairs, said steps the Japanese FinanceMinistry has taken so far don't address the root cause of thefinancial scandals.</LP><TEXT>   In particular, he said, the ministry must stop relying onthe practice of informal administrative guidance as a way ofmanaging Japanese financial markets, and must instead issueclear, codified written policies that are available to allplayers in the market.   The ministry's reform effort will directly influence U.S.government attitudes toward Japan, he said.   &quot;There is very much a question of whether the Ministry ofFinance is going to introduce real, I underline the wordreal, reforms,&quot; Mr. Mulford said.   At Thursday's meeting in Tokyo, &quot;we're going to listen totheir plan . . . to restore the credibility of Japanesecapital markets,&quot; he said. &quot;If they say they're going to takethe same step-by-step system of non-transparent management,my judgment is going to be quite negative.&quot;   He said that might mean the Bush administration wouldbecome more favorably disposed to congressional actionthreatening sanctions if Japan doesn't open up more of itsfinancial system to foreign companies. &quot;The members ofCongress think dialogue simply hasn't worked,&quot; Mr. Mulfordsaid.   He also said the administration might urge the Japanesegovernment to change its ministry practices.   The recent scandals in Japan, which involve majorbrokerage firms' paying compensation for underperformingassets to favored clients over several years, stem fromexisting ministerial practices, the Treasury official said.   &quot;Everybody knew&quot; about loss-compensation payments, Mr.Mulford said. &quot;The Ministry of Finance knew it. {Companies}had been doing it since the early 1980s. You can't have acredible enforcement agency if that kind of thing is goingon.&quot;   Mr. Mulford noted the U.S. has its own financial scandal,in the form of Salomon Brothers' attempt to corner the U.S.Treasury bond market. But Salomon, he said, &quot;is a case whereSalomon Brothers broke clearly laid-out rules.&quot; By contrast,Japanese officials knew about, and tolerated, losscompensation, he claimed.   Japanese Finance Ministry officials, however, have deniedany longstanding detailed knowledge of the practice ofsecurities firms' compensation to clients who lost money inthe securities markets.</TEXT></DOC>
