But decades after flier Beryl Markham was forgotten, Hollywoodis showing a renewed interest in the heroine. Several movies of herwildly adventurous life are underway or planned, including afour-hour CBS-TV special starring Stefanie Powers, and at least twofeature-length films.   In 1986, public television presented the film, ``World WithoutWalls: Beryl Markham's African Memoir,'' shortly after her death atthe age of 83. The movie reconstructed her life from old filmfootage and interviews with her gossipy contemporaries in Kenya,where she once hunted barefoot with African friends.   ``She represented some kind of magical-like past, something thata woman did but that can't ever be done again because the world inwhich that took place is gone,'' said George Gutekunst, whorediscovered Markham's memoirs, ``West With the Night,'' and helpedget them republished in 1983.   The book chronicled her Kenyan childhood and historic flight.Praised by Ernest Hemingway as ``bloody wonderful,'' it became abest seller in both Britain and the United States when it wasrepublished. ``She's caught the imagination of much of this countryand the world since then,'' Gutekunst said.   Gutekunst met Markham in Kenya before her death. With hispartner, Albert del Masso, he later secured movie rights to thebook.   In some cities, such as San Francisco, fascination with Markhamapproaches cult status, according to Berniece Green, a New Yorkpublicist for CBS, which in January began filming in Africa on``Beryl Markham: Shadow on the Sun.''   Markham was born in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, in England,and was brought to Kenya at age 4 by her divorced father, retiredBritish Army Capt. Charles B. Clutterbuck, who purchased a farm.She learned to fly and became a bush pilot.   By 1936, several planes had successfully crossed the Atlanticwestward from Europe. But all the aircraft had at least two peopleaboard. Markham, in a single-engine Percival Gull monoplane,departed Britain's Abingdon Royal Air Force aerodrome on Sept. 4,1936. Low fuel forced her to land in a bog in Nova Scotia. Shelater received a ticker tape parade in New York, her original goal.   She had less than four years of formal education but said herfather made her read widely. Later, she was given a crash course inliterature and music by an Oxford-educated aristocrat andprofessional hunter, Denys Finch-Hatton, the lover of the Danishwriter Karen Blixen, whose pen name was Isak Dinesen. The AcademyAward-winning movie, ``Out of Africa,'' was based on Blixen's life.Markham was apparently Finch-Hatton's last love.   Markham's poetic account of her childhood and famed flight waslargely ignored when first published in 1942. But following itsre-release and then her death, the book's sales soared. It has beenon the New York Times best-sellers list since November 1986,according to North Point Press.   In 1936, Markham became the first person to fly soloeast-to-west across the Atlantic, accepting a challenge fromEngland's Lord John Carberry. She had grown up in Kenya with Masaichildren, become a winning horse trainer and also one of thecontinent's premier ``bush pilots.''   Kenya in the 1920s and '30s was a haven for titled Europeans,and Markham _ who spent much of her youth hunting wild boar andfending off lions _ lived with them. She took up thoroughbredtraining to support herself at 17 when her bankrupt fatherimmigrated to Peru.   CBS' story, based on English journalist James Fox's book,``White Mischief,'' will portray Markham's three failed marriages,affairs with fliers Finch-Hatton and Tom Campbell Black and heryears in Santa Barbara, where she taught flying for ParamountPictures.   Actress-producer Diane Baker of Artemis Productions, whichoptioned the movie rights to Markham's book from Gutekunst andMasso, said her company plans to begin filming ``West With theNight'' in Kenya in June.   Nelson Films plans to film ``The Lives of Beryl Markham'' thisfall. It is based on a book by Errol Trzbinsky to be published nextyear, according to producer Anthony Rufus-Isaacs, who knew Markhamin Africa.   No stars have been named for either film project.   Lindsay Wagner has optioned Mary Lovell's 1986 biography ofMarkham, ``Straight On Till Morning,'' for a possible leading rolefor the actress, according to St. Martin's Press.   Markham's ``amazing freedom'' in the African outback is whatcaptivates people, said Lovell in a telephone interview from herhome in England.   An accountant who quit her job to travel to Kenya to meetMarkham, Lovell found the flier in 1985 living in a tiny houseoutside Nairobi at a track where she had trained some of Kenya'sgreatest race champions.   ``Here was a woman who I found had lived the way we all wouldhave if we had the courage,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
