(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A-CrossandM;While A-Cross, $995 from strawberry Software, may be only a cross-tabulationpackage, it does cross-tabs with more ease, speed, and flexibility thanalmost any other piece of software currently available.andP;  A-Cross, Version2.00, enables you to know things such as the percentage of football-playingmales under age 18 who will buy your product and to see this cell of amultiway table quickly, without issuing complicated commands.andM;With A-Cross it is easy to specify a table's contents using the spreadsheetformat and fill-in-the-blank windows.andP;  The run-time version of DESQviewmultitasking software that comes with A-Cross allows simultaneous computingand printing, which speeds up analyses.andP;  Almost any combination of stub andbanner points, cell contents, marginal averages, and weighting of cases thata market researcher could ever want can be included in a single table.andO;Unfortunately, the market survey analysis task included in this review didnot afford the opportunity to show off these qualities of the program.andM;Professional market researchers and survey analysts will not only findA-Cross's speed and flexibility appealing, but they will appreciate theavailability of runtime modules of the software, as well.andP;  These modulesallow a consultant to set up a copy of the software with preformatted bannersand stubs for a specific data set that the client can use to produceadditional tables.andM;Two features simplify table setup and help keep track of analyses of a largesurvey.andP;  A Data Glossary handles shorthand definitions of the variablelocations and values in the data file.andP;  This simplifies the specification ofthe formulas indicating the observations for each stub and banner point.andP;  ANotes utility has been included for keeping on-line notes about the data setbeing analyzed.andP;  Thirty multiscreen notes can be linked with the tables tofurnish site-specific on-line help, annotate assumptions about tables or datasubsets, or indicate the wording of questions and answers.andM;One drawback of the package (which will be addressed in the next version) isthe complete lack of data management facilities.andP;  The data validation stepsin the market survey analysis task were accomplished indirectly, through thecombined use of the program's Marginals utility--a subprogram for screeningtypographic errors--and table filtering capabilities.andP;  To offset thislimitation, Strawberry Software currently comarkets MPA, a separatedata-entry product not included for this review.andM;A-Cross is not a statistics package per se, although the newest version doesinclude chi-square computation.andP;  Some summary statistics can be supplied forcells, but not expected frequencies or each cell's contribution to thechi-square.andP;  T-tests can be computed for any pair of columns by weightingcounts by the value.andP;  the user must ensure that the choice of columns androws makes sense for such analyses; the manual does not provide help oradvice for making such choices.andM;Designed for a small niche of analysts, A-Cross is a tool that must be usedin conjunction with other tools.andP;  Most people who would benefit from apackage such as a-Cross won't mind its statistics shortcomings.andP;  They willappreciate the quick answers to most questions that arise about survey data.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
