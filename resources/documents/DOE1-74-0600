The release of irradiated insects into a wild population is anexample it might just as well be a marked increase in mutagen levelsinduced by the environment. In either case there would be an increasein developmental abnormalities in the population survival or extinctionwould be in question. We are interested in exploring the models of autocidalcontrol of insects because the role of the females has been ignored,and greatly confused. This theoretical question offers us an intermediatestage for the development of more complex models of community interactionand speciation. The results reported here support that this is an efficientroute to modeling speciation and packing communitites by phyletic modes.We have followed observations of screw-worm communities in Mexico, andthe eradication program there has given us a chance to see widely distributedcommunities of gamodemes dissected as different ones were removed andothers increased to an extent that they were detectable. 6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
