Ross, director of IRMS' Agency Liaison Officer Program, overseesthe training course and helps agencies draft charters and meet programrequirements.andM;Francis J. Balint, chief of the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration's Automation Division, was the first trail boss named by IRMSand has charge of his agency's supercomputer upgrade.andM;Sidney L. Haggard is the Agriculture Department's trail boss in charge of theagencywide telecommunications procurement, AgComNet.andM;Ludwig Kuttner, director of the Internal Revenue Service's Quality AssuranceDivision, graduated from the first Trail Boss class and served as firstchairman of the Trail Boss Interagency Committee.andM;Donald Andreotta, NASA's manager of IRM policy development, also was agraduate of the first class and now chairs the Trail Boss InteragencyCommittee.andM;GCN editor Jake Kirchner and staff writer Kevin Power interviewed Ross andthe four trail bosses at GCN's offices in Silver Spring, Md.andM;GCN: What are the goals of the Trail Boss Interagency Committee?andM;KUTTNER: To provide a strong voice, independent of agency bias, and promoteeffective systems acquisition and roll-out.andP;  The committee holds periodicmeetings with candid discussions of policies, practices and events, such asGeneral Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals hearings, tobroaden the knowledge and skills of our members.andM;The other thing we are still learning to do is provide the impetus fornetworking among trail bosses.andP;  It's astonishing what you can learn from eachother.andM;ANDREOTTA: The committe is trying to define its role and assess where we'regoing.andP;  The areas we want to attack are networking support structures andprofessional development -- what we can provide our members in terms of doinga better job of program and acquisition management.andM;We also have the opportunity to leverage our experiences to change the way wedo business in the government.andM;GCN: How can the committee influence IRM policy?andM;ANDREOTTA: Right now we have a couple of subcommittees working on the needfor a new personnel classification for trail bosses and other regulatoryissues.andM;I see us feeding that kind of output to GSA's policy people.andP;  From thecomments I get from our members, we have a strong role in the regulatoryarea, less so in the legislative area.andP;  We'll be working with GSA and theOffice of Management and Budget as necessary.andM;ROSS: This committee has the same kind of stature as the InteragencyCommittee on Information Resources Management.andP;  While IAC/IRM is mostlysenior managers, this organization has a variety of levels of management andan enormous amount of expertise.andP;  The Trail Boss program is dynamic.andM;GCN: How do you ensure participation, given that trail bosses have thegovernment's most demanding acquisition jobs?andM;HAGGARD: Trail bosses understand the value of networking.andP;  Instead of beingon your own, you can seek out the expertise and it automatically brings youinto the continuing Trail Boss program and support process.andP;  It's not likeother committees, where you do all the giving.andP;  Here you're doing some givingbut also doing a lot more getting.andM;GCN: How is Trail Boss operating today compared with GSA's original plan?andM;ROSS: It's more appropriate to the needs of the community.andP;  The originalconcept is still there -- a single acquisition manager fully responsible andaccountable.andM;One [difference] is the real requirement for teamwork to accomplish the job.andO;Second, up-front planning is much more structured.andP;  If you're going into aTrail Boss delegation, you must do everything up front.andP;  You must develop thecharters and strategies.andP;  In the past, it was not uncommon to do anacquisition and somewhere down the pike develop a charter.andM;Also, we have designated trail bosses with full support of the program butwithout a Trail Boss delegation.andP;  They've taken the training and wanted to bein the program, but their process was far enough down the line that to gothrough a delegation would have delayed the program.andM;GCN: What is the program's status?andM;ROSS: We've had seven classes.andP;  About 200 people have gone through thetraining.andP;  There are about six or seven with Trail Boss delegations ofprocurement authority, and we hope to have 15 to 17 by 1991.andM;We need to expose government managers to industry in non-threatening ways.andO;We're starting to bring in industry people to talk about how they view thesituation.andP;  The class is a good way to open up that dialogue.andM;We're looking at having 300 senior managers take the initial training, andthen we'll have to deal with the replacement factor.andP;  We're not sure exactlywhat is needed, but we're looking at about 10 percent.andM;Also, how do we get younger people, the GS-11s, 12s and 13s, into thisprogram restricted to senior people?andP;  We've got to develop junior-level orprerequisite training.andM;HAGGARD: Sometimes Trail Boss gets interpreted as an acquisition program, butit's really project management that lasts.andP;  Very few contracting officershave actually worked in the program.andP;  Those that haven't still do not want torecognize trail bosses as major players.andM;BALINT: It's really not an acquisition program.andP;  The contracting officers areinvolved and are important team players, but so are the budget people.andP;  Asthe program goes on, you change your emphasis.andM;ROSS: We've tried to apply the program management approach to informationtechnology.andP;  There's been some misunderstanding by some of the older,dyed-in-the-wool contracting officers who felt Trail Boss was usurping theirauthority.andP;  But those who have worked in the program don't think that at all.andO;The Internal Revenue Service has developed an approach of putting together ateam of contracting officers supported by the program manager.andM;GCN: Does Trail Boss training enhance the government's ability to recruit andretain quality managers?andM;ANDREOTTA: The training is outstanding.andP;  Depending on the agency, I thinkhaving the training or having Trail Boss authority would be a draw.andP;  I've hadindications in NASA that some people view it as an opportunity to move intothe higher ranks of agency management.andM;KUTTNER: Retention is based on a number of variables.andP;  To the extent thatpersonal development, professional development, mastery of skills and otherjob enrichment are part of the program, it's a retention factor.andP;  It's thekind of thing that government needs to do more for the senior civil servicebecause cash is never going to do it.andM;BALINT: The Trail Boss programs themselves are long-lasting.andP;  If you begin atthe funding stage and go through to implementation, it's five to 10 years.andO;What we've done is personalize it for the trail bosses themselves.andM;It's hard to leave once you get into a program and take on authority andresponsibilities.andP;  That's a real positive factor in keeping with the programand the government.andM;ROSS: Out of the first three classes, only four people have left thegovernment.andP;  Two retired from the military, one left for disability and oneleft because he did not want to move where the job was.andM;GCN: How has Trail Boss affected agency operations?andM;KUTTNER: There are ways to change the classic bureaucratic culture.andP;  TrailBoss creates a team where no one gives up authority.andP;  It radically modifiesbehavior and the process.andM;The behavior of technical people and program people has changed as much asthe contracting officers' behavior.andP;  For the first time, they have someunderstanding of the challenges and restrictions of contracting officers.andM;ROSS: When you work together with technical, legal and contracting people,you begin to learn their problems.andP;  The attitude becomes, &quot;Let's find a wayto do it.&quot;andM;ANDREOTTA: We've encourage procurement officials and program managers to gojointly to Trail Boss training to build and uphold that team relationship.andM;GCN: What were the biggest challenges to the program in your agency?andM;HAGGARD: The biggest reluctance was with the contracting office.andP;  Theythought Trail Boss was taking contractual authority and placing it in thehands of program managers.andP;  We had to get over that concern by writing thecharter with the procurement people.andM;When we sent the charter to GSA, the contracting people agreed to go forwardas a pilot, because they were not convinced it was a good idea.andP;  Evidentlythey have recognized it was OK because we have since approved a Trail Bossprogram for the Forest Service and other programs.andM;KUTTNER: [Treasury] has not gone forward for formal Trail Boss delegation forthose reasons, plus the feeling that designation of a Trail Boss programwould unduly hinder our departmental oversight people from establishing theirown timetables for oversight of major systems acquisitions or activities.andM;That fear is not unfounded.andP;  When you get into relationships between adepartment's oversight functions as an arm of GSA and its missionaccomplishment deadlines, that's a tough place to be.andM;What we did on a collegial basis was adopt these practices on a case-by-casebasis, and it has worked pretty well.andP;  One of the reasons the TreasuryMultiuser Acquisition Contract is still on track is that it adopted TrailBoss practices.andM;ANDREOTTA: We've got it in a lot of our NASA culture.andP;  I sold it on the basisthat it wouldn't be any real change.andP;  As soon as certain misconceptions wereclarified, I think the agency bought wholeheartedly into it.andP;  Seniormanagement likes the total accountability that Trail Boss achieves.andM;BALINT: When I first went into the program, it appeared to me that GSA wasgiving me tremendous responsibility but questionable delegation of authority.andO;At Commerce, Trail Boss is a change manager and in some cases a change agent.andO;It's important that Trail Boss assume this position of being able to keeptrack of all the variables going on and make sure the ship continues on itsroute.andM;I've found that I have all the authority I want and the senior management inCommerce has been very supportive.andM;GCN: Have agency fears about losing contracting authority been fullyresolved?andM;ROSS: Yes, I think so.andP;  The Defense Department had the most concerns, butwe've got a trail boss designated for the Reserve Component AutomationSystem, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff said they would manage their officeautomation acquisition under the Trail Boss concept.andM;GCN: Where is the Trail Boss program headed?andM;KUTTNER: We have to learn to roll out systems using contractors as part ofthe team.andP;  Classically, my agency has done all the analyses, programming andso on for major systems.andM;But changes in policy and the work force mean we will be increasinglydependent on contractors.andP;  It's going to be a fantastic time of change.andM;We have to learn how to manage development contractors.andM;It's going to take a while to build that culture, and it's vital that TrailBoss evolve to give some focus to that.andM;GCN: Will Trail Boss survive on its own or should there be legislation tomake it permanent?andM;ANDREOTTA: The challenge is to demonstrate that this style of manage issuccessful.andP;  The environment we're building will be more complex, and that'swhy we have to demonstrate this is a good way of doing business.andM;As with any program, it stands a hair's breadth from going away.andP;  But as longas GSA maintains some carrots with early delegations of procurementauthority, good managers will jump on its and you don't need legislation.andM;ROSS: One of the concerns we have is burnout, especially when we look at thelong-term assignments.andP;  But there are enough people with energey that want tojump into the program that it should continue.andP;  It has a little mystique andgood visibility, but we're not going to try to make it mandatory.andP;  You can'tlegislate good management.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
