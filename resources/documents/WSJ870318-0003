The health care services company said the transaction, which is part of its capital restructuring program, will result in a pre-tax gain of about $11.8 million, which will be amortized over the initial lease term. Proceeds will be used to repay the $50 million mortgage on the facilities previously provided by Healthvest when Healthcare purchased the hospital last year.    Healthcare also said it plans to restructure and reduce its $200 million floating rate credit arrangement with a syndicate of seven banks led by New York-based Citicorp's Citibank unit. If completed, Healthcare said it expects to lower the cost of its credit arrangement and to change the terms to reflect its need for operating and development capital rather than real estate project financing.    Healthcare said the restructuring may result in an acceleration of the amortization of financing costs in the form of a nonrecurring charge of between $1.6 million and $2 million, possibly in the current quarter.    Elliott H. Weir Jr., Healthcare executive vice president and chief financial officer, said the company is seeking a new credit arrangement with current and prospective lenders. He said the company expects to complete the arrangement in the near future.    Separately, Healthcare said it intends to buy back as much as $5 million of its Class A common stock from time to time on the open market. Healthcare currently has 4,524,820 Class A shares outstanding. In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday, Healthcare closed at $9 a share, down 12.5 cents.    Healthcare said a portion of the shares it buys back will be for its employee stock purchase and stock option programs. Other shares will be retired in an effort to increase the company's per-share earnings. </TEXT></DOC>
