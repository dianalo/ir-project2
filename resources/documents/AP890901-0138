But federal officials in Washington said Friday that no requesthad been received from Mrs. Marcos.   Mrs. Marcos said she made the request when Marcos was verycritically ill in June and was not expected to live more than a fewdays. He has rallied somewhat but remains in critical condition atSt. Francis Hospital.   Marcos turns 72 later this month.   His wife told The Honolulu Advertiser that she sought burial inthe national cemetery because her husband fought alongside Americansduring World War II and because current Philippine President CorazonAquino has said Marcos will not be allowed to return to thePhilippines dead or alive.   Alan Sumitomo, a supervisor at the cemetery, said that to beeligible for burial there, a person must be a veteran of U.S. armedforces with honorable or general discharge or a dependent of aveteran. Exceptions to the rule can be made by the federalDepartment of Veterans Affairs, he said.   Mrs. Marcos said the request was made to U.S. Veterans AffairsSecretary Edward J. Derwinski through her Washington attorney,Richard Hibey. She said Derwinski told Hibey there was ``no way''that Marcos would be allowed burial in the national cemetery.   But Pam Siciliano, spokeswoman for the Department of VeteransAffairs, said Friday: ``We are not aware of any conversation orcontact between Mr. Derwinski and Mrs. Marcos or her attorney.''   Derwinski was in Poland representing President Bush at World WarII commemoration ceremonies and was to return Sunday.   ``We have not received a request from the Marcos family forinformation on Mr. Marcos' eligibility for burial in a nationalcemetery, and we can't discuss or make a final determination abouthis eligibility until we have a contact from the family or Mrs.Marcos,'' Ms. Siciliano said.   There was no listing in Washington telephone directories for alawyer named Hibey.   The national cemetery is located in Puowaina Crater, morecommonly known as Punchbowl, and overlooks Honolulu. It is theburial place of World War II correspondent Ernie Pyle and astronautEllison Onizuka, who died in the space shuttle Challenger disaster.   The Marcoses have lived in Honolulu since they were ousted in apopular revolt that swept Mrs. Aquino to power in February 1986.They face a U.S. indictment accusing them of stealing more than $100million from the Philippines treasury and stashing the money in theUnited States.   Mrs. Marcos previously said she would never bury her husbandanywhere but in the Philippines. She said she thought burial in theHonolulu veterans cemetery would be a way to resolve the controversy.   However, she said she continues to hope that Marcos will beallowed to return to the Philippines to die in his country or to beburied there.   ``I will take (his remains) to the airport and wait there as longas necessary,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
