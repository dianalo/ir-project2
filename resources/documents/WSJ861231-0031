U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter denied that the announcement of the crippling duties on about $400 million worth of imports was a negotiating ploy. But he said he expects the Europeans to come up with a new offer beyond trade concessions they previously proposed to defuse the controversy.    The U.S. is losing an estimated $400 million in feed-grain exports because Spanish tariffs were increased when that country joined the Common Market. U.S. officials valued the most recent European offer of offsetting concessions at between 20% and 30% of the lost American shipments.    Mr. Yeutter said he &quot;wouldn't give odds&quot; on whether the new U.S. tariffs would actually go into effect. He warned that if they are imposed some time in late January, as announced, the Europeans probably would retaliate.    If that happens, the U.S. would take further actions, and &quot;there will be major disruptions in international trade,&quot; Mr. Yeutter warned at a press conference. President Reagan is vacationing in Palm Springs this week.    The European Community said yesterday in Brussels and Washington that it would take countermeasures against U.S. exports of wheat, rice and corn gluten if the U.S. goes ahead with its latest threatened tariff hikes.    Willy de Clercq, the EC's commissioner for external affairs, expressed regret that the dispute had come to the brink of retaliatory actions. In comments relayed to the EC office in Washington, he said there is &quot;one month left for negotiated solutions.&quot;    Mr. Yeutter said that the prospective U.S. tariffs would hit France the hardest, essentially eliminating U.S. imports of $150 million of brandy and $100 million of white wine from that country. The higher U.S. duties would apply to brandy for which foreign producers charge more than $13 a gallon that is in containers of up to a gallon. The new tariffs also would hit imports from France of inexpensive white wine in containers of a gallon or less.    The U.S. tariffs also would affect $70 million worth of gin, mostly imported from Great Britain, in one-gallon containers or less. Some canned ham, blue mold cheeses, edam and gouda cheeses, soft ripened cheeses, endives, carrots and unripe olives in brine also are included on the list of targets for higher duties.    &quot;The intention is to stop that trade in its tracks,&quot; Mr. Yeutter said. He said the U.S. would be willing to return to the current 15% to 20% duties on those products if the Common Market offers the U.S. sufficient compensation for its lost feed-grain exports.    Officials said the U.S. would accept a mix of concessions involving agricultural and industrial products. But they observed that most of the compensation would have to involve the agricultural sector, given the sensitive political situation in the U.S. Farm Belt.    The administration's latest action, announced with some fanfare here, is aimed partly at undercutting momentum in Congress for tough punitive restrictions on European imports. Mr. Yeutter said that the administration opposes congressional measures because they would violate the international General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, treaty.    In contrast, the U.S. trade representative said, the new tariffs the administration announced yesterday were consistent with the EC's obligations under GATT to compensate the U.S. for losses resulting from the entry of Spain and Portugal into the EC.    Mr. Yeutter also announced, as expected, that the U.S. will give Brazil a six-month extension before taking action against it for imposing barriers to U.S. computer equipment and software shipments. The U.S. decided to postpone retaliation because some progress has been made in negotiations with the Brazilians. </TEXT></DOC>
