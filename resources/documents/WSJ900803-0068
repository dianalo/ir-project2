Miami-based Video Jukebox operates a so-called interactivecable-TV network that lets viewers select music videos theywant to watch by making a telephone call to a 900 number.Phone companies bill callers $2.50 per request, keep as muchas 70 cents a call for themselves, and pay Video Jukebox therest.</LP><TEXT>   Video Jukebox, in turn, shares 20% to 25% of its &quot;jukebox&quot;revenue with cable operators that carry the network.   Denver-based Tele-Communications is the largest cableoperator in the U.S., controlling about 12 millionsubscribers. Its cable system in Miami was the nation's firstsystem to carry the Video Jukebox Network, which now hasabout 9.5 million subscribers. But since the network firstaired in 1985, no other Tele-Communications-owned systemshave added the channel to their offerings.   Hence, in addition to the equity investment,Tele-Communications is now in an excellent position to boostVideo Jukebox's growth by distributing the channel to a wideraudience.   &quot;I love this interactive stuff,&quot; said Peter Barton,Tele-Communications' senior vice president of programming.&quot;It enhances the audience's relationship with the TV set.Customers like it. We're very bullish on it.&quot;   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Video Jukebox'sshares rose $1.25 to close at $7 bid.   Though Video Jukebox is the most interactive of cablenetworks on the air today, its technology is still a long wayfrom where media analysts and the company's own executivessay the industry is headed. Its 9.5 million subscribers aredivided among 109 separate &quot;jukeboxes&quot; nationally, meaningthat viewers must wait while the requests of othersubscribers connected to a given system are played beforetheir own request comes on.   Eventually, with the spread of fiber-optic networks thatcan carry massive amounts of data, Video Jukebox and otherswill be able to sell customized TV programs to individualhomes.   Currently, said Andrew Orgel, Video Jukebox's presidentand chief executive officer, the average wait per JukeboxVideo request is about 25 minutes, depending on the marketand time of day.   &quot;We feel somebody should have to wait no more than 40minutes to see a video,&quot; said Mr. Orgel. The channel, hesaid, wants to develop one &quot;jukebox&quot; system for every 30,000to 40,000 subscribers. The ratio is currently one for every87,000 viewers.   Mr. Orgel said the company also wants to sell betweenthree minutes and six minutes per hour of advertising time,beginning later this year. And he said Video Jukebox isplanning to test a non-music network, using the sametechnology, in the fourth quarter.   John Reddan, an analyst with John Moran andamp; Associates, saidVideo Jukebox's revenue per &quot;jukebox&quot; system has grown 12% inthe past 18 months. He estimates the company now collects$11,000 per system per month, compared with $9,800 in thebeginning of 1989 -- without having advertised the channel.   &quot;The future of TV is interactive, but that's really manyyears away,&quot; said Mr. Reddan. &quot;This is interactive today.&quot;   For the first quarter, Video Jukebox posted a loss of$322,147, or three cents a share, compared with a loss of$680,804, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. Its revenueclimbed in the quarter to $2.6 million from $376,986.</TEXT></DOC>
