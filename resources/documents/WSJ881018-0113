Robust economic growth and a solid government surplus were enviable accomplishments for Mr. Lawson, the chancellor of the exchequer. The ultimate flourish came in March, when Mr. Lawson announced generous tax cuts.    But today, signs are emerging that the chancellor of the exchequer may have flubbed it. Rising inflation threatens his Conservative government's greatest achievement: steady growth with low inflation. Mr. Lawson insists the acceleration is but &quot;a blip&quot; and says recently imposed higher interest rates will cool things off without interrupting growth. He is expected to stress those points in Thursday's Mansion House speech to London's financial community.    But the argument is becoming an increasingly tough sell. Britain's annual inflation rate in September edged up to 5.9% from 5.7% in August, the highest of any industrial country, and could reach 7% by year end. Other figures released last week showed average wages rising at a 9.25% annual clip, the fastest pace in six years. Britain now hangs on each monthly trade report. The July and August deficits were monstrous; September's is due next week. The chancellor himself says the full-year tally may triple his March forecast.    The chances of real disaster remain slim, but even Mr. Lawson concedes that Britain's economy has gone a bit over the edge -- &quot;too much of a good thing,&quot; he calls it. The next few months will tell if his luck will hold.    Mr. Lawson wants Britons to grin and bear it. Tales of hard-pressed homeowners and distress sales don't faze him: That just means the rate increases are working, he says. He tells homeowners beset by a 30% jump in mortgage payments to skimp on other purchases. Mortgages are pegged to 12% base interest rates, up from 7.5% in the spring.    &quot;Too much buying has been paid for by too much borrowing,&quot; Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the Conservative Party conference in Brighton on Friday. Inflation is &quot;too high,&quot; she added, endorsing Mr. Lawson's interest-rate increases. &quot;Make no mistake, we intend to bring inflation down.&quot;    Mr. Lawson lately has strayed from Mrs. Thatcher's tough-minded adherence to monetarism, which emphasizes avoiding inflation by controlling money creation. The economy's extraordinary ebullience earlier this year was one result of Mr. Lawson's more-pragmatic thinking -- but so is the current crop of anxieties. &quot;He likes to live dangerously,&quot; says Patrick Minford, a University of Liverpool economist who wants Mr. Lawson to return to exact targeting of money-supply growth.    Tim Congdon, an economist who recently left Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to write books, finds Mr. Lawson's thinking &quot;bewildering.&quot; He adds: &quot;What is certainly not true is that this man is a committed sound-money chancellor with a set group of ideas {with} which he has stuck year after year. He has a number of basic prejudices, like rapid economic growth and low taxes. He really just picks up whatever's fashionable and implements it up to a point.&quot;    The chancellor wields much more clout than many of his counterparts in other countries, where central bankers and legislators share the credit -- and the blame -- for the economy. But Mr. Lawson oversees the central bank's operation of monetary policy as well as government spending and holds great sway over taxation.    Appointed in 1983, he has stayed in No. 11 Downing Street, the chancellor's residence, longer than anyone since Neville Chamberlain in the 1930s. Backed by Britain's strong performance, Mr. Lawson has grown in international stature and has promoted initiatives to coordinate exchange rates and alleviate Third World debt.    Mr. Lawson, 56 years old, brought to the job a reputation for intelligence and arrogance, both of which he honed in his early career as a policy-critiquing journalist. After his election to Parliament, he and other radical Tories embraced monetarism as the cornerstone of their free-market cure for Britain. Critics say Mr. Lawson's faith has wavered but they are at a loss to explain why. &quot;He has now become somewhat of an agnostic monetarist,&quot; says John Biffen, a former Tory cabinet member who was sacked last year.    Mr. Congdon, the economist, and other adherents began sounding warning bells more than a year ago. They argued that the combination of soaring house prices and burgeoning credit growth spelled inevitable inflation. Mr. Lawson focused on other statistics, in part theorizing that Britain's banking deregulation clouded the figures' meaning.    One main focus was the exchange rate between the pound and the German mark. Keeping sterling's value &quot;shadowing&quot; the mark, the major European currency, appeared to help British exporters. It also appealed to Mr. Lawson as the next best thing to full membership in the European Monetary System, something he has favored and Mrs. Thatcher has opposed. The EMS is an exchange-rate mechanism devised by major European countries to keep their currencies roughly in line with each other. Britain has refused to join.    &quot;Until this EMS exchange-rate targeting business, things were pretty good,&quot; says Mr. Minford, the Liverpool economist. The problem is that British industrial productivity has grown far faster than Germany's, allowing British manufacturers to raise pay far faster than in Germany and add to inflationary pressures, he says. &quot;Shadowing the Deutsche mark was in effect quite a loosening of money,&quot; Mr. Minford says.    Early this year, Mr. Lawson and Mrs. Thatcher sparred over the policy. Mrs. Thatcher, urged on by monetarist advisers, worried that the intervention required to keep the pound steady would be overly inflationary. Their in-house debate, which leaked to the press, spurred talk of a cabinet crisis. Speculation flew that Mr. Lawson would resign.    He didn't, but he did relent. Now he indicates that inflation takes priority over stable exchange rates. The pound recently has traded at about 3.17 marks (about $1.75), well above the three-mark informal ceiling maintained until earlier this year.    It is now clear -- even to Mr. Lawson -- that he cut interest rates too far last spring. That was understandable with the world fretting that the stock-market crash would trigger a depression. But economists say the cuts, aimed at braking the pound's rise, were too stimulative.    Mr. Lawson conceded in an Oct. 7 television interview that monetary conditions had become &quot;a little bit too loose.&quot; &quot;Had I realized quite how strong the domestic growth had been, quite how big borrowing has been, then I would have tightened up that much earlier,&quot; he said.    The uncharacteristic concession contrasts with Mr. Lawson's midsummer derision of worried London economists as &quot;teenage scribblers.&quot; But the chancellor was his stridently confident self at last week's party conference, blithely dismissing worries of &quot;the current-account scare.&quot; But he warned that lower inflation won't come until next year, after prolonged high interest rates.    ---   Barbara Toman in Brighton, England, contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
