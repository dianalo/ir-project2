The half-percentage point hike in the prime rate by two big NewYork banks, Chase Manhattan and Republic National, was the secondincrease in two weeks and lifted the rate to 11.5 percent, thehighest level since November 1984.   The prime is a benchmark for a wide range of business andconsumer loan rates, including car loans and adjustable-rate homemortgages. An increase in the prime means borrowers will have to paymore to finance their debts.   It also reflects the higher cost of borrowing the banks facethemselves, indicating the Federal Reserve is soaking up money inthe banking system, one of its weapons in restraining inflation.   The prime hike overshadowed another report that suggested theeconomy might be slowing, which might have eased fears aboutinflation. The Commerce Department said durable-goods factory ordersfell 3 percent in January.   Chase said it raised the prime rate because its own cost of fundshad risen sharply since the last prime rate hike Feb. 10. Majorbanks then boosted the rate to 11 percent from 10.5 percent.   The prime-rate hike came a day after the Labor Departmentreported consumer prices rose in January at an annual rate of 7.2percent, the highest level in two years. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspancalled the inflation trend disturbing and vowed to pressure rates upuntil he squeezes inflation out of the economy.   Fears about inflation and interest rates influenced the financialmarkets, although they already had closed by the time the prime-rateincrease was announced.   On Wall Street stocks recovered only slightly from the daybefore, when they tumbled on anxiety about inflation. In the bondmarket, a sensitive economic barometer, prices fell because of whattraders called indications that the Fed was tightening creditfurther.   In foreign exchange trading, the dollar slipped over pessimismabout Washington's ability to restrain the U.S. budget and tradedeficits, which have been partly blamed for the currency'sdepreciation over the past three years.</TEXT></DOC>
