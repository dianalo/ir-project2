Joel Zweibel, a New York attorney representing the unsecuredcreditors' committee, said Eastern sent copies of the plan to thecreditors, who will study it and meet next Tuesday to vote. Theplan details Eastern's proposals for repaying its debts after itemerges from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization that protects itfrom creditors.   Zweibel wouldn't comment on Monday's creditors' committeemeeting in New York.   Other sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the16-member committee voted to rescind instructions given at an Oct.18 meeting for its financial experts to develop alternativeproposals. The committee includes representatives of four Easternemployees' groups.   The New York Times, quoting two unidentified sources, reportedin Tuesday's editions that creditors are near agreement onaccepting Eastern's revised plan. But a striking union officialnoted that negotiations are continuing.   ``I'm not sure there's been a change of heart,'' said Skip Orr,spokesman for Eastern's striking pilots. ``What we've seen that Ithink is most significant is that there hasn't been an agreementand the parties are still negotiating.''   An Eastern spokeswoman said the company was upbeat about thenegotiations, although it couldn't comment in detail.   ``We're pleased with the progress being made with the creditors'committee, but we're not in a position to comment beyond that,''Karen Ceremsak said.   Eastern on Wednesday will add 75 flights, bringing its dailyschedule to 775 flights, compared with nearly 1,100 before thestrike began.   Some creditors have expressed concern that Eastern's effort torebuild without its unions, who walked out on March 4, wouldn'tgenerate enough revenue to pay its debts.   But The Times reported that one source said the creditors, whohave been lobbied intensely by Texas Air Corp. Chairman FrankLorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes, now believe they have agood chance of being repaid under Eastern's plan. Eastern debtstotal some $3.1 billion, with more than $2 billion in long-termdebt.   Houston-based Texas Air is the parent of Eastern.   ``The one thing that we have not seen come out is any refutingof the figures that were presented two weeks ago,'' said Orr, thepilots' spokesman. ``Those were the figures that gave the creditorsa great deal of concern.''   The creditors' advisers, Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. and Ernst andamp; Young,had reported that their analysis of Eastern's rebuilding planshowed the company would still be losing money over the next fewyears, and Goldman Sachs said Eastern would have to borrow moremoney to pay rebuilding costs.   Eastern officials last April announced plans to rebuild to aregional carrier about 65 percent its pre-strike size. But Lorenzoand Bakes said recently that Eastern's rebuilding is moving fasterthan expected and they expect to return to 85 percent to 90 percentof pre-strike operations with 1,000 daily flights. They say Easterncan start making profits in 1990 and would have little debt left bythe end of 1993.   They dropped plans to sell Eastern's South American routes,expected to raise about $400 million in cash. Eastern did sell itsNortheast shuttle service to New York developer Donald Trump, somePhiladelphia property and Canadian routes to Midway Airlines, andmade several other sales of planes, gates and landing rights toother buyers.   Soon after Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection on March 9,some creditors indicated a preference for liquidation of thecarrier to pay debts, but U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Liflandhas made it clear he wants Eastern revived.   The Senate last week approved a bill calling for a Senate-Housecommission to investigate and make recommendations about how toresolve Eastern's labor dispute. The bill goes to a conferencecommittee to combine it with a similar House bill, but Bushadministration officials have said the president would veto such abill.</TEXT></DOC>
