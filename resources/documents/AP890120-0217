The Xinhua News Agency said 23 other participants in the March 5uprising were given prison terms. One was sentenced to lifeimprisonment.   Losang Danzim, identified after his arrest last year as a TibetUniversity student, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.   The suspended death sentence, common in Chinese criminal cases,is commuted to life imprisonment if the prisoner demonstrates a goodattitude during a two-year period.   Danzim was charged with the murder of policeman Yuan Shisheng,22, who was stabbed and thrown out of a second-floor window duringthe riots. Another policeman was seriously injured in the attack.   Soinam Wangdui, another of four suspects arrested in the attack,was sentenced to life imprisonment, Xinhua said.   It said four other rioters were sentenced to a maximum of 15years in prison at the public trial. Thirteen received a maximum 14years and five were sentenced to up to three years in prison.   Three others were convicted of small crimes but did not receiveprison terms.   Yuan's death was one of five reported by the government in theprotest. Western travelers in Tibet, however, quoted local residentsas saying 24 were killed.   The March disturbances followed pro-independence unrest inSeptember and October 1987 in which at least 14 died by unofficialcount.   Violence broke out again Dec. 10 when police opened fire on apro-independence demonstration, killing at least one Buddhist monkand one child.   The protests have been led by Buddhlst monks loyal to theirspiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile after a faileduprising in 1959.   China, which says Tibet has been an integral part of itsterritory for seven centuries, has sought to reduce tensions in thearea by showing greater tolerance for Tibetan religious and culturalpractices and elevating some Tibetans to positions of localauthority.</TEXT></DOC>
