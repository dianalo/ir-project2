While small banks are closing at a rate unseen since the GreatDepression, the government, in effect, has declared large banks toobig to fail, the critics say.   The best known example of the ``Too-Big-To-Fail Syndrome'' isContinental Illinois Corp., which in 1984 required $4.5 billion inthe largest-ever government bailout.   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the agency that insuresdeposits in commercial banks, hopes to recover all but $1.7 billionof that by selling its stake in Continental. But nearly four yearsafter the bailout, the FDIC is still the major stockholder in thebank.   Two government moves last week to prop up institutions nearlyidentical in size to Continental are renewing concerns.   The FDIC on Thursday pumped $1 billion into First RepublicBankCorp. of Dallas, which has lost nearly $2 billion in deposits sincethe start of the year. With $33.2 billion in assets, it is thenation's 13th largest commercial bank holding company.   The agency also promised to protect all depositors and generalcreditors of the company's 73 subsidiary banks.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates savingsinstitutions, made a similar pledge on Friday regarding the $33.7billion Financial Corp. of America, owner of the Stockton,Calif.,-based American Savings andamp; Loan Association.   The second largest thrift holding company in the country, FCAhad lost $493 million in deposits in January and February. Itsrequest for $1.5 billion in assistance is under review.   The eventual price tag of solving the problems at FirstRepublicBank and FCA isn't known for certain, but analysts believethe bailouts ultimately could rival, and possibly even surpass, theContinental Illinois rescue.   The promises made by the FDIC and bank board go beyond theagencies' normal practice. Usually, deposit accounts are protectedonly to $100,000, and creditors are not protected at all.   When smaller banks fail, as 184 did last year, the FDIC pays offdepositors up to the insurance limit or arranges for the accountsto be transferred to a solvent institution.   Big banks, with their extensive ties to other banks, present amore complicated problem. The failure of a large institution couldcause a chain reaction of insolvencies at smaller banks and end upcosting the FDIC more than the amount needed to keep the big bankoperating.   Using government aid to entice private investors to take over anailing institution also is often cheaper than a straight payoff ofdepositors.   That logic doesn't make it any easier for executives who watchtheir small banks go under while their colleagues at largeinstitutions stay in business.   Beyond the big bank-small bank double standard, there is whatsome regard as a dual standard in dealing with large regional bankslike First RepublicBank and the even bigger money center banksdeeply involved with shaky loans to Third World countries.   Paul Getman, a financial economist with The Wefa Group, aPhiladelphia consulting firm, said bankers at the large regionalinstitutions, whose loans are in real estate and energy, believeregulators are much more reluctant to force money center banks towrite down the value of overseas loans.   ``Texas bankers feel ... the FDIC is not clamping down as hardon New York City banks because the nature of their bad loans issuch that they can get away with saying they're worth 50 cents onthe dollar, for example,'' Getman said.   ``There's a lot of political play (in how loans to Third Worldcountries are valued), whereas everyone knows that loans on Texasreal estate are worth 15 cents on the dollar,'' he said.   Rep. Ferdnand G. St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the HouseBanking Committee, said he plans hearings this spring on thecriteria used to decide ``who survives and who fails among thetroubled institutions.''   St Germain has voiced concern in the past about ``sweetfail-safe deals for private investors.''   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman, however, has pointed out thatgovernment bank rescues bail out depositors, usually notstockholders, corporate debt holders or management.   Bert Ely, a private financial institutions analyst inAlexandria, Va., defended bailouts as saving money for theinsurance funds, which are funded by premiums paid by banks andsavings and loans and ultimately backed by the taxpayer.   Ely argued that regulators ought to make bailouts far soonerthan they usually do.   ``The important thing is that they end the tragedy. ... Everyhour that goes by increases banks' losses and the losses (to theinsurance funds). It is so critical to get that assistance in thereand stop the bleeding right away,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITORS' NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Dave Skidmore covers banking and financialissues in Washington for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
