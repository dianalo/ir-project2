On April 1, the world body plans to begin implementing a one-yearplan to create the world's newest independent nation, in the processsettling the last major colonial problem in Africa.   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I, when itcaptured the former German colony. In December, Pretoria finallyagreed to cooperate with the U.N.'s one-year plan to make theterritory a sovereign state.   The General Assembly was able to clear the last hurdle toimplementing the plan after its budget subcommittee, overridingobjections from several African nations, decided Tuesday night thatU.N. peacekeepers in Namibia may buy goods from South Africa as longas it continues to be the cheapest supplier.   Countries led by Zambia and Zimbabwe had delayed approval of theassessment for the force by trying to make the United Nations heedits own calls for trade embargoes on South African products.   Britain, France and the United States opposed the restrictions onpurchases for the force, citing the higher cost of buying goods andservices elsewhere that are available from South Africa.   Late Tuesday, the assembly's budget committee adopted languagethat noted the embargoes but called on the United Nations to buyfrom the lowest bidder among the ``widest possible sources ofprocurement'' in the interest of ``economy and efficiency.''   A dejected Zambian Ambassador Peter Dingiswayo Zuze said heviewed the compromise as the ``best as can be.''   U.N. fiscal controller Luis Maris Gomez pledged that the worldbody would not buy helicopters from South Africa, as the blackAfrican states had feared.   He said peacekeeping troops would bring their own militaryvehicles, but mine-resistant vehicles would be needed in the earlystage of the mission, and these would likely be leased from SouthAfrica.   Other U.N. officials noted that South Africa is readily able tosupply the $10.2 million in gasoline and aviation fuel the Namibiaforce will need.   The black African states had proposed that fuel be bought fromAngola or the Congo _ a more expensive proposition.   In December, the five permanent members of the Security Councilhad clashed with the black African states over the size and cost ofthe mission. The Africans wanted 7,500 peacekeepers sent, at a costof up to $700 million.   The Security Council instead adopted the Big Five plan of sendingjust 4,650 personnel, with the rest held in reserve.   The Big Five _ the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, Franceand China _ pay 57 percent of all peacekeeping costs.   The U.N. mission in Namibia is to oversee November parliamentaryelections in the territory also known as South-West Africa.   South Africa agreed to grant Namibia independence as part of anaccords signed in December that also call for the withdrawal fromAngola of an estimated 50,000 Cuban troops who have aided thatcountry's Marxist government in a 14-year-old war against SouthAfrican-supported rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
