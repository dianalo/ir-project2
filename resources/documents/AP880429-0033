The House voted Thursday to ban all but the smallest U.S.nuclear tests, the third restriction approved in two days as thechamber works on its version of a defense bill.   But the Senate Armed Services Committee, which finished workThursday on its version, includes only one restriction that Reagandoesn't want.   That would ban any Star Wars tests that violate the narrowinterpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   That limit was approved by the House, along with the restrictionon most nuclear tests, and a prohibition against any nuclearweapons that violate the numerical limits in the unratified SALT IInuclear arms treaty. Neither of the last two is in the Senatemeasure.   When the two bills are passed separately by the House andSenate, they will be sent to a House-Senate conference committee toreconcile differences.   ``In some ways, we're more liberal than the Senate, or at leastthe liberals are more powerful here,'' explained Rep. Les Aspin,D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.   Both bills authorize Pentagon spending of $299.5 billion in thefiscal year starting Oct. 1. That was the total set last Decemberin the ``budget summit'' between Congress and Reagan to reduce thefederal budget deficit.   The total was $33 billion less than the Pentagon had originallythought it would receive in the next fiscal year. To meet the lowerfigure, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci ordered cuts in manpower,along with the early retirement of 16 Navy frigates.   ``He took some tough decisions and made hard choices and wesupported him in our budget,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairmanof the Senate Armed Services Committee.   Aspin agreed. ``Carlucci made a lot of tough choices and that'swhy the Pentagon fared pretty well in our committee. We didn't cutmuch.''   On Thursday, the House:</TEXT><TEXT>   _Voted 214-186 to ban all underground nuclear tests of weaponslarger than one kiloton. The decision came after the House passed,399-0, a Republican-backed amendment praising Reagan's effort tonegotiate limits on testing.   A similar ban was also approved a year ago by the House, but wasdropped by the House-Senate conference committee and ended up asonly an advisory request.   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said ``we owe it to our children''to vigorously pursue a total ban on all atomic tests. But Rep.William Broomfield, R-Mich., said the restriction would ``totallyundercut our negotiators.'' He referred to ongoing U.S.-Soviettalks.   _Voted down, 205-197, an anti-satellite (ASAT) ban which wasproposed for a fourth year. But the panel also turned down,212-195, a proposal to spend $100 million for development of aground-based anti-satellite weapon.   The ASAT limit had been imposed by Congress the past three yearsand the Pentagon responded by dropping work on the program todevelop an ASAT weapon fired from a high-flying F-15 jet. The AirForce is now working on different types of ASATs, particularlythose using ground-based lasers.   Another difference between the two bills is over how much toauthorize for the Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars isformally known.   The Senate panel recommended $4.6 billion for SDI. The Housebill provides $4.0 billion, although that figure may change whenthe issue is debated next week on the floor.   Currently, SDI receives $3.9 billion and Reagan had sought $4.8billion for the next fiscal year.</TEXT></DOC>
