If Bush failed to declare the veterans benefits anemergency war cost, the package would be considered null and void.;    Theadministration already has threatened to veto the House package, saying theproposed benefits cost too much, don't address an emergency and shouldn't bepaid for by the allies.;    The key vote on the House bill came when membersrejected 248-175 an amendment that would have forced Congress to come up withthe money to pay for the new benefits.;    Circumventing the House,administration officials are trying to negotiate a bipartisan deal in theSenate.;    Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Wednesday that anagreement on a pared-down benefits package is close.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  R.A.
