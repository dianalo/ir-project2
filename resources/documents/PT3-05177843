The disc support 23 includes a      movable block comprising a through-hole 77 through which scraps are      discharged and a press cylinder 79 to push up a lower tool 19 for forming.      In a punching operation, the through-hole 77 is arranged in the working      area and scraps are discharged from the through hole 77. In a forming      operation, the press cylinder 79 is arranged in the working area and      pushes up the lower tool 19 to project above a pass line for a workpiece.      Since the lower tool 19 is positioned below the pass line, the workpiece W      cannot be damaged. Further, the workpiece W is not obstructed by the lower      tool 19 when the workpiece W is positioned in the working area and the      turrets are rotated, thus forming is properly performed. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to a turret punch press, and more      particularly to a turret punch press able to process a workpiece without      causing damage to the workpiece. </PAR><PAR>  A conventional turret punch press comprises a rotatable upper turret      provided with upper tools and a rotatable lower turret provided with lower      tools. The upper and lower tools include a plurality of upper and lower      tools for punching a workpiece and a plurality of upper and lower tools      for forming a workpiece, respectively. A movable striker is vertically      mounted so as to strike the upper tool positioned in a working area where      the workpiece is processed. A disc support for supporting the lower turret      when the striker hits the upper tool is provided under the lower turret. </PAR><PAR>  In the above turret punch press, to perform forming, the top ends of the      lower tools for forming are positioned above a pass line (feed level      height) for the workpiece. As a result, the punch press includes the      following faults: </PAR><PAR>  1. Workpiece damage. The workpiece is damaged when it touches the lower      tools for forming during the positioning of the workpiece. Further, the      workpiece is damaged when it is punched while being placed on the lower      tools for forming. </PAR><PAR>  2. Workpiece inclined. The workpiece is inclined when it is placed on both      the lower tool for punching and the lower tool for forming. Thus, proper      processing cannot be achieved. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  An object of the present invention is to provide a turret punch press      having upper and lower tools for punching and forming wherein the machine      can process a workpiece without causing damage to the workpiece. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the present invention is to provide a turret punch press      of the above stated type wherein the machine can maintain the workpiece in      a level state while processing the workpiece. </PAR><PAR>  These objects are achieved in the present invention by the provision of an      improved turret punch press as described below. The turret punch press      comprises rotatable upper and lower turrets. The upper turret is provided      with at least an upper tool for punching and an upper tool for forming.      The lower turret is positioned to oppose the upper turret, and is provided      with at least a lower tool for punching and a lower tool for forming. The      lower tool is normally arranged not to project above a pass line for the      workpiece. A movable ram is provided to vertically act on the upper and      lower tools which are positioned in a working area where a workpiece is      processed. A disc support is provided in the working area under the lower      turret, for supporting the lower turret. The disc support includes means      for pushing up the lower tool for forming, positioned in the working area      so that the upper end of the lower tool projects above the pass line      during a forming operation. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention      will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred      embodiment taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a plan view showing a disc support for a turret punch, in      accordance with the invention, during a punching operation; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a section taken along the line II--II of FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a plan view showing the disc support of the turret punch, in      accordance with the invention, during a forming operation; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a section taken along the line IV--IV of FIG. 3; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is an enlarged section showing the upper and lower tools prior to      the forming operation. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is an enlarged section showing the upper and lower tools during the      forming operation; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a front elevation of the turret punch press according to the      invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a plan view taken along the line VIII--VIII of FIG. 7. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  Other features of this invention will become apparent in the course of the      following description of exemplary embodiments which are given for      illustration of the invention and are not intended to be limiting thereof. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, a turret punch press 1 comprises a base 3, side      frames 5, 7 provided on both sides of the base 3, and an upper frame 9      provided on the side frames 5, 7. A disk-like upper turret 15 is rotatably      supported by an upper rotation axis 15a under the upper frame 9. A      plurality of upper tools 11 for punching a workpiece W and upper tools 13      for forming of the workpiece W are removably installed on the upper turret      15. A disk-like lower turret 21 is rotatably supported by an lower      rotation axis 21a opposing the upper turret 15 and above the base 3. A      plurality of lower tools 17 for punching the workpiece W and lower tools      19 for forming of the workpiece W are removably installed on the lower      turret 21. A disc support 23 is secured on the base 3 under the lower      turret 21. A ram 27 having a striker 25 for striking the upper tools 11,      13 is provided on the upper frame 9. </PAR><PAR>  The upper and lower turrets 15, 17 are synchronously rotated by a servo      motor (not shown) installed on the frames. Thus, during a punching      operation, the desired upper and lower tools 11, 17 for punching are      positioned in a working area where the workpiece W is processed. During a      forming operation, the desired upper and lower tools 13, 19 for forming      are positioned in the working area. </PAR><PAR>  A pair of guide rails 29 extending in the Y direction (FIG. 7) are provided      on the base 3. A pair of movable tables 33 are positioned, one on each      side of a fixed table 31, and supported on the guide rails 29. The movable      tables 33 are attached to a carriage base 35 extending in the X direction      (FIG. 8) bridging the fixed table 31. A carriage 37 movable in the X      direction perpendicular to the moving direction of the movable table 33 (Y      direction) is provided on the carriage base 35. The carriage 37 is      provided with a clamp device 39 for clamping an end of the workpiece W. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, positioning of the workpiece W is controlled by moving the carriage      37 on the carriage base 35 in the X direction and by moving the carriage      37 on the guide rail 29 in the Y direction. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIGS. 5 through 8, a plurality of upper tools 11 for punching      are removably installed on the upper turret 15, and a plurality of upper      tools 13 for forming are removably installed in tool installation holes 41      in the upper turret 15. The configuration of the upper tool 11 for      punching is well known in the art, and therefore will not be described in      detail. The upper tool 13 for forming is provided with a punch body 43      with a recess 45 at its lower end. The punch body 43 has a flange 47 at      its upper end. A spring 49 which normally presses the flange 47 upward is      provided between the flange 47 and the upper turret 15. The punch body 43      is slidably installed in a punch guide 51 mounted on the upper turret 15.      The punch body 43 is supported by a spring 53 at the upper end of the      punch guide 51. The spring constant of the spring 53 is larger than that      of the spring 49. A flange 55 is formed projecting outward from the upper      end of the punch guide 51 to keep the punch guide 51 from dropping through      the hole 41. </PAR><PAR>  A plurality of lower tools 17 for punching are removably installed on the      lower turret 21; a plurality of lower tools 19 for forming are removably      installed in tool installation holes 57 in the lower turret 21. The      configuration of the lower tool 17 for punching is well known in the art,      and therefore will not be described in detail. The lower tool 19 for      forming comprises a die holder 59, a die chip 61 integrally formed on the      die holder to be inserted into the recess 45 of the punch body 43, and a      work ejector 63 vertically movable with respect to the die chip 61. A      spring 67 is provided between the work ejector 63 and the die holder 59 to      push up the ejector 63. A spring 69 is provided between the die holder 59      and a flange 65 which is formed in the tool installation hole 57 to push      down the die holder 59. Thus, the lower tool 19 in a normal state does not      project above a pass line PL (the feed line for the workpiece W). </PAR><PAR>  The disc support 23 comprises a hollow rectangular parallelepiped block, as      shown in FIGS. 1 through 4 with apertures on the right side and on the      upper and lower sides. Both side walls 23a and 23b mainly support the      lower turret 21 from the underside. The thickness of the side walls 23a      and 23b is determined so that the cross-sectional area thereof is larger      than a predetermined area subject to pressure. </PAR><PAR>  The disc support 23 contains a freely reciprocating movable block 71. The      left end of the movable block 71 is connected to a piston rod 75 of a      slide cylinder 73. The movable block 71 is formed as a rectangular      parallelepiped to fit the inside configuration of the disc support 23. A      through hole 77, through which punched scraps are dropped, is provided on      the right half of the movable block 71. A press cylinder 79 with a piston      rod 81 is embedded in the left half of the movable block 71 as means for      pushing up the lower tool 19 for forming. A top 81a of the piston rod 81      pushes up the die holder 59, causing the lower tool 19 to project above      the pass line PL (FIG. 6). During the punching operation, the piston rod      81 is retracted into the press cylinder 79, so that the lower tool 19 does      not project above the pass line PL (FIG. 5). </PAR><PAR>  In operation, as shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, the carriage 37 clamping the      workpiece W moves in the X direction on the carriage base 35. In addition,      the carriage base 35 moves on the guide rails 29 in the Y direction, so      that the part of the workpiece W to be processed is positioned in the      working area between the upper and lower turrets 15 and 21. </PAR><PAR>  In the punching operation, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the desired upper and      lower tools 11, 17 are positioned in the working area by synchronously      rotating the upper and lower turrets 15, 21 by means of servo motors (not      shown). The piston rod 75 of the slide cylinder 73 is then retracted to      move the movable block to position the through hole 77 in the working      area, after which the striker 25 actuates the upper tool 11. The punched      scraps drop down through the through hole 77. </PAR><PAR>  In the forming operation, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the part of the      workpiece W to be processed is positioned in the working area between the      upper and lower turrets 15, 21 in the same manner as stated above. The      desired upper and lower tools are positioned in the working area by      rotating the upper and lower turrets 15, 21 by means of the servo motors. </PAR><PAR>  The piston rod 75 of the slide cylinder 73 is extended to move the movable      block 71 to position the press cylinder 79 in the working area. The right      end of the movable block 71 then projects from the aperture at the right      side of the disc support 23 (FIGS. 3 and 4). At this stage, the piston rod      81 of the press cylinder 79 is retracted so that the lower tool 19 does      not project above the pass line PL, as shown in FIG. 5. The piston rod 81      is then extended to push up the die holder 59, as shown in FIG. 6, so that      the lower tool 19 projects above the pass line PL. The striker 25 strikes      the upper end of the punch body 43 which descends accordingly together      with the punch guide 51. The spring 53 also descends and is not compressed      until the flange 55 of the punch guide 51 comes into contact with the      upper face of the upper turret 15. When the striker 25 further descends,      the punch body 43 descends compressing the spring 53, thus performing      forming. </PAR><PAR>  After completion of the forming process, the striker 25 is elevated and the      spring 53 extends by its restoring force to press up the punch body 43.      The striker 25 further ascends and then the spring 49 extends to raise the      punch body 43 with the punch guide 51. On the other hand, the piston rod      81 of the press cylinder 79 is retracted and the die holder 59 with the      die chip 61 is pressed down by the restoring force of the spring 69.      Consequently, the work ejector 63 is raised with respect to the die holder      59 by the restoring force of the spring 67, thereby pushing up the      workpiece W and releasing it from the die chip 61. </PAR><PAR>  Alternatively, it is to be understood that after positioning the upper and      lower tools 13, 19, the striker 25 can descend to the original bottom dead      point so that the upper tool 13 abuts the upper surface of the upper      turret 15. Thereafter the piston rod 81 of the press cylinder 79 can be      extended to push up the die holder 59 to perform forming of the workpiece      W. That is, pushing up the lower tool 19 for forming is equivalent to      lowering the striker 25 with respect to the lower tool 19. The striker 19      is vertically actuated by a hydraulic cylinder. </PAR><PAR>  According to the above embodiment, the disc support 23 is secured to the      base 3 in the working area and the thickness of the side walls 23a, 23b is      determined so that the cross-sectional area is greater than the      predetermined area subject to pressure. Accordingly, the upper turret 21      is reliably supported during striking. Further, since the position of the      lower tool is not changed with respect to the upper turret 15 and the      upper tools 11, 13, high-precision processing can be obtained. </PAR><PAR>  The upper and lower turrets 15, 21 are provided with tools for punching and      forming, thus the tools can be readily changed only by rotating the      turrets 15, 21. Further, the disc support 23 contains the movable block 71      having the press cylinder 79 to push up the lower tool 19, and the through      hole 77 through which punched scraps are discharged. This means that the      disc support 23 functions as both a support for the lower turret and a      push-up means for the lower tool. If a support for the lower turret and a      push-up means for the lower tool were provided separately, a changing      operation would be required. According to the invention, however, punching      and forming can be performed without such a changing operation. </PAR><PAR>  The workpiece W can be processed without damage since the lower tool 19 for      forming normally does not project above the path line PL and therefore      does not interfere with the positioning operation of the workpiece W. When      the turrets rotate after positioning the workpiece W at the working area,      the workpiece W does not interfere with the lower tool for forming.      Accordingly, the workpiece remains level, thus the workpiece W is properly      processed. </PAR><PAR>  While the above embodiment has been described with the movable block 71      with the through hole 77 on its right and the press cylinder on its left,      and with the slide cylinder 73 at the left side, it should be understood      that any other arrangement can be employed. Further, while the slide      cylinder 73 is used to move the movable block 71, any other suitable means      to control the positioning of the movable block 71, for example, a drive      motor combined with a gear assembly could be employed. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
