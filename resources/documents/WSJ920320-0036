But in Germany,electronics firms are finding that all their products willsoon have to be PC -- politically correct, that is.   Under draft legislation slated to take effect in 1994,anyone who sells new electronic equipment in Germany will beobliged to accept and recycle customers' old equipment. As aresult, computer makers at the CeBIT exhibition here, a hugecomputer industry show that ended Wednesday, say they arehustling to make their machines more environment-friendly sothey won't be saddled with enormous recycling costs.</LP><TEXT>   And while Germany is undoubtedly in the vanguard of&quot;green&quot; computing, other countries won't be far behind. TheEuropean Community is likely to adopt similar recyclingregulations by the mid-1990s, industry executives say, andthe U.S. and Japan may follow. The prospect is forcing everymajor computer maker to rethink how its machines aredesigned.   &quot;In the future, everyone will have to develop moreecological products,&quot; says Sylvia Bleck, a spokewoman on theissue for IBM Deutschland G.m.b.H., the German unit ofInternational Business Machines Corp. &quot;Computers can be veryproblematic from an environmental point of view, and makerswill soon have to deal with this themselves.&quot;   Of course, electronic equipment doesn't have the pollutionproblems of, say, automobiles. But some computers containdangerous chemicals or coatings and many contain &quot;complex&quot;plastics that are especially hard to recycle -- or to burnsafely. Almost all computers are hard to dismantle intoseparate, recyclable components such as glass and metal.   More important, however, is the politically incorrectculture of the electronics industry. Its emphasis on constantinnovation creates a vast number of obsolete machines everyyear: About 800,000 metric tons of &quot;electronic waste&quot; aregenerated annually in the former West Germany alone,according to the German Ministry for the Environment.Computers currently constitute less than a tenth of thatwaste but, 10 years after the personal-computer revolution,the percentage is growing quickly.   As one of the pioneers in Germany's green-computer push,IBM has since June 1990 accepted return of all its productsfor recycling, charging customers as little as 50 marks ($30)to cart away a computer terminal or as much as 5,000 marks todispose of a large mainframe computer. IBM's German unit hasalso created a &quot;chief ecologist&quot; position, a move nowduplicated at most of the company's European units.   Already, IBM Deutschland's chief ecologist has convened aworld-wide meeting of IBM product designers, hoping toinstill awareness of necessary changes in the industry.Still, Ms. Bleck says, much remains to be done: Because someof IBM's bigger machines are on the drawing board five yearsbefore they hit the market, many design changes won'tpercolate through until the mid-1990s.   Other computer makers agree about the size of the task.&quot;It requires some drastic changes that we started preparingfor quite a number of years ago,&quot; says Bruno Didier, Europeandirector of marketing for Compaq Computer Corp., which hasits European base in Munich.   First fruits are now becoming evident, Mr. Didier says:Compaq uses a new type of recyclable battery in its latestnotebooksized PC, for example, and a new family of Compaq PCsis designed so users can make a machine more powerful simplyby changing a circuit board, rather than buying an entire newmachine.   At Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG, the company hasadopted an internal rule that says SNI must perform betterthan any competitor on environmental issues. Starting nextmonth, the Siemens AG unit will accept any of its oldmachines for recycling, free of charge to anyone with an SNIservice contract.   Computer industry officials have different explanations ofwhy Germany-and, to a lesser extent, Europe as a whole-istaking the lead on making computers recyclable. In part, themovement is a societal phenomenon that has touched allindustries: German car makers are now touting therecyclability of their newest models, for example.   &quot;The German conscience on this matter is simply deeper,&quot;says Rainer Hoffman, deputy director of theinformation-technology arm of VDMA, a broad German industrygroup. &quot;There is a lot of pressure to be in the avant-gardeon environmental issues. Politicians can't afford to ignorethis, which has led to the new reglations.&quot;   Mr. Hoffman and others say a major reason is the strengthof the Green party in Germany, which has forced the ChristianDemocrat government to pass stringent regulations thatpre-empt criticism from the left. Mr. Rogge of SNI alsosuggests that Germany's high population density has madeGermans more conscious of waste-disposal issues.   At Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co., spokeswoman Loredana Gambinosays another big factor is a traditional European concernabout the relationship between man and machine -- a field nowknown by the buzzword &quot;ergonomics.&quot; Sweden has led aworldwide campaign to reduce the electromagnetic emissions ofcomputer monitors, for example, while Scandinavian design isoften touted as the most user-friendly in the world.   Olivetti, the Italian office-equipment giant, is alsoknown for its meticulous attention to design and has gainedvaluable knowledge in making its photocopiers moreenvironment-friendly. (With their extensive use of poisonouschemicals, copiers pose especially thorny problems.) The firmhas also developed biodegradable ribbon cartridges for itsprinters and typewriters and may even enter the field ofrecycling electronic equipment for other companies, says Ms.Gambino.   Along with Scandinavia and Switzerland, Italy seems to beemerging as a European leader in green electronics. But evenOlivetti has saved some of its best efforts for Germany: Hereat the CeBIT show, the firm's German unit TA Triumph-Adler AGis touting a new electronic typewriter made from recycledtypewriter-ribbon cartridges, for example.   Ms. Gambino says Triumph-Adler decided to start making the&quot;Cyclo&quot; typewriter when it collected five tons of plasticfrom German customers who responded to the firm's offer tocollect old cartridges. The new machine's marketing pitch isexplicitly green -- designed to appeal to the same customerswho returned the cartridges in the first place.   Still, not every aspect of the German green-electronicsmovement pleases manufacturers. For instance, the draftlegislation would require firms to accept and recycle oldequipment made by their competitors. &quot;We don't think this isthe best way to motivate companies to make changes,&quot; says Mr.Hoffman of the VDMA industry group, who says equipment makersshould only have to accept their own machines, giving goodrecyclers a competitive advantage.</TEXT></DOC>
