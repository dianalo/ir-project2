The results from the first twocontact periods of 82 and 172 days are in good agreement with those obtainedpreviously on a high burnup BWR fuel rod. In particular, it was foundthat under oxidizing conditions, uranium saturates at about the 1 mg/llevel, and plutonium at about the 1 {mu}g/l level. Under reducing conditions,these solubilities decreased by about two orders of magnitude.</TEXT></DOC>
