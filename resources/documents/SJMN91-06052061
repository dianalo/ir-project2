He referred to Iraq'sresponse to the Soviet peace plan which his foreign minister, Aziz, wasexpected to convey to the Kremlin later today.;    Saddam complained theUnited States and its allies had stated that the war would end andnegotiations would begin when Iraq agreed to withdraw from Kuwait but laterchanged their minds.;    &quot;The word withdrawal was stated by Iraq. What didBush say? What did his loyal servant Fahd say? Bush rejected it as a ploywithout careful study. This has unveiled the reality of the aggression,&quot;Saddam said in his Baghdad radio speech.;    Bush also signalled hisdisapproval of the Soviet peace initiative, telling President MikhailGorbachev that the proposal for an end to the Persian Gulf war should includeIraqi withdrawal from Kuwait within four days after agreement to do so, theimmediate release all prisoners of war, and disclosure of the location of allmines, diplomatic and administration sources said.;    The four-day deadlinewas said to have been aimed at forcing Iraq to leave many of its tanksbehind.;    It was not clear from Saddam's 40-minute address, the first in hisown voice since Feb. 10, if Aziz was carrying more concessions to Moscow. Healso did not accept or reject the Soviet proposal, details of which have notbeen disclosed.;    The proposal was given to Aziz by Gorbachev at a meetingin Moscow on Monday. Aziz returned home with the proposal and Saddam summonedhis ruling Revolutionary Command Council to a meeting Wednesday to considerit. Saddam then sent Aziz back to Moscow.;    &quot;What Iraq wants is peace in thegulf. Peace that opens the door to a real comprehensive and durable solutionto all the problems of the region foremost of which the issue of Palestine,&quot;Saddam said. His address was monitored in Nicosia.;    Bush has publiclycriticized the Soviet plan as falling &quot;well short&quot; of the administration'srequirements. Officials said he was concerned that the proposal, which callsfor Iraqi withdrawal but also offers a number of post-war inducements toSaddam, would undermine United Nations resolutions and leave Saddam in power.;   Therefore, the sources said, Bush urged Gorbachev in a private message thisweek to stiffen or modify elements of the proposal. The message was a critiqueof the document Gorbachev had sent to Bush and Secretary of State James Bakeroutlining his offer to the Iraqis.;    Word of Bush's reported conditions cameas the world waited to see if Saddam would accept the Soviet plan. If not,Bush is expected to order a ground offensive soon.;    Iranian ForeignMinister Ali Akbar Velayati said in Paris that Aziz was en route to Moscow viathe Iranian capital. &quot;My colleagues in Tehran are waiting for him,&quot; Velayatisaid.;    Iran has been playing a leading role in peace diplomacy, andVelayati said things &quot;do not seem to be going as well as before,&quot; apparentlybecause Iraq did not respond quickly to the Soviet plan.;    In Washington,Baker renewed the demand that Iraq pull out of Kuwait &quot;immediately, totallyand unconditionally&quot; and comply fully with U.N. resolutions.;    &quot;Anythingshort of that is unacceptable,&quot; he said Wednesday.;    The mere existence ofthe Soviet proposal has created a quandary for the U.S.-led coalition. IfSaddam accepts it, he could remain in power, with a large part of his militarymachine still intact. Bush, who last week called for Saddam's overthrow, hassought to oust him or so weaken him that Iraq would not be a major postwarpower in the region.;    House Speaker Thomas Foley said Bush may not have achoice: &quot;I don't know how he could fail to accept it, if Saddam Hussein wouldagree to withdraw unconditionally and without linkage.&quot;;    Earlier Wednesday,French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas was quoted as saying that Iraq has untilsometime today to make its decision known or face a full-scale ground attack.;   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush had set no deadlinefor an Iraqi response.;    Allied forces are preparing &quot;one of the largestland assaults of modern times&quot; and are confident of prevailing against Iraq,Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told Congress today. He offered no hints of whenthe full-scale land war might begin.;    Cheney, in testimony to the SenateArmed Services Committee, said the &quot;precise course&quot; of the war wasunpredictable.;    &quot;Nonetheless, we are confident that ultimately we willprevail,&quot; he said. &quot;In the near future, one way or another, Iraqi forces willleave Kuwait.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Nicosia, Cyprus  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910221  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  848  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday February 21, 199100052061,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
