But prospects for selling the $10 tickets looked better after thepolice officers' plight was publicized Thursday by the Los AngelesTimes.   ``We've been getting a lot of calls from a lot of differentpeople, including some publicity agents, coming on board to helpus,'' said Officer Dale Erwin of the Los Angeles Police Department'sHollenbeck Division. ``People read the article and want to getinvolved and help us out.''   The newspaper story explained how Sgt. Alexander Gomez wasdejected because he had volunteered to sell tickets to the July 1-2Linda Ronstadt concerts, but had sold only 3,000 of the 30,000 byWednesday.   ``Where do I go from here,'' Gomez had asked rhetorically. ``It'sso much easier for me to go out on patrol and put my suspect in jailand go home.''   Gomez came up with the concert idea to raise money to help meethigher operating costs of the police department's soon-to-expandHollenbeck Youth Center, where 10,000 youths each year participatein boxing, karate, baseball and basketball programs.   Ronstadt agreed to do the benefit concerts if the police promotedthem.   A Hollywood production firm helped Gomez with public relations,and he hoped to get by with a tiny budget for posters and publicservice announcements.   ``They don't tell you they run them at 3 in the morning whennobody is up,'' he said with disgust.</TEXT><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Actress Lisa Bonet is suing a drug store chainover a photograph of her baby that disappeared from a set of newlydeveloped snapshots and turned up in a supermarket tabloid.
