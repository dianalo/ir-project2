<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-41-0493 </DOCNO><TEXT>A dry flue gas desulfurization process is described comprising: (a) dispersingan aqueous media containing finely divided calcium carbonate particulateshaving a weight average diameter of 10 microns or less in a gas streamcontaining sulfur oxides; (b) passing the gas stream containing the calciumcarbonate particulates to a particle separation zone; and (c) recoveringthe calcium carbonate particulates from the gas stream substantiallyfree of sulfur oxides, the aqueous media containing finely divided calciumcarbonate particulates being produced by a process comprising the stepsof: (i) forming a slurry of calcium carbonate in an aqueous media; (ii)adding carbon dioxide from an external source to the slurry; and (iii)abrasively grinding the calcium carbonate in the slurry in the presenceof the carbon dioxide to produce the finely divided calcium carbonateparticulates.</TEXT></DOC>
