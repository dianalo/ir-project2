In addition, some traders said the Japanese government's drive to pressure major Japanese investors not to sell dollars is showing some results, at least for now. The government continued its campaign of persuasion yesterday.    In late New York trading, the dollar was near its highs for the day against most major currencies and close to the top of its recent range against the Japanese yen. The dollar stood at 140.28 yen, compared with 139.60 late Friday, and at 1.7826 West German marks, compared with 1.7788.    Dealers said trading was quiet, with speculators buying dollars to cover short, or oversold, positions. They said the buying was prompted by fears the Fed may be tightening policy and by news that 28 U.S. servicemen died in Sunday's apparently inadvertent Iraqi attack on a Navy ship patroling the Persian Gulf.    &quot;For the time being, there's some caution in the market, and people are a little wary of being short dollars,&quot; James T. McGroarty, vice president, foreign exchange, at Discount Corp. of New York, said.    Speculation grew that the central bank is adopting a tougher credit policy after the interest rate on federal funds rose yesterday and the Fed took no action to drive the rate back down. It was the first time in more than two weeks that the Fed hadn't intervened in the credit markets. The funds rate, the rate on reserves that banks lend one another overnight, hovered around 6 7/8% much of the day, compared with an average of 6.67% in the week ended last Wednesday.    The Fed's inaction yesterday &quot;adds credence to the rumor that the Fed is going to raise the discount rate,&quot; Larry Ryan, senior vice president and foreign exchange manager at European American Bank in New York, said. Higher U.S. interest rates make dollar-denominated investments more attractive and tend to increase demand for the currency. The discount rate is the Fed's fee on loans to financial institutions.    Although the Iraqi attack on the USS Stark was described as accidental, the incident sparked fears of a rise in tensions and possible new U.S. involvement in the Middle East. Traders said some speculators bought dollars yesterday as a &quot;safe haven&quot; currency.    &quot;A heating up in the Middle East usually creates a demand for dollars,&quot; Francoise Soares-Kemp, vice president and chief corporate trader at the New York branch of Credit Lyonnais, said.    In Tokyo yesterday, the government renewed its pressure on big Japanese trading companies to refrain from selling dollars. Hajime Tamura, international trade and industry minister, made the plea to chief executive officers of the companies, a ministry spokesman said. Last week, Finance Ministry officials made similar requests to top officials of Japanese financial concerns.    Some traders said they have noticed a drop in selling pressure on the dollar from Tokyo.    Japan wants to keep the dollar from falling further against the yen to prevent harm to Japanese exporters, whose products would become more expensive in the U.S. A declining dollar also creates foreign exchange losses for Japanese investors in U.S. stock and bond markets.    In early trading Tuesday in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 140.30 yen.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for May delivery fell $3.30 an ounce to $471.50 in brisk trading estimated at five million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $471.25 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Monday, May 18, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
