The magazine that's not written for old fashioned housewives, it's written for the newest, hottest mamas ever. Or at least 23,000,000 of them.&quot;    Or is it only 19,578,000 of them? Probably, neither figure is right. And therein lies the central issue of a long-simmering controversy.    The numbers come from the two major readership research firms: the first from Mediamark Research Inc., a unit of London-based MAI PLC; the second from Simmons Market Research Bureau Inc., a unit of WPP Group PLC, also in London. Besides measuring how many people read various magazines and national newspapers, the firms look at such demographic information as readers' ages and incomes. Based largely on these numbers, advertisers decide where to place more than $5 billion of print ads annually.    Yet Simmons and MRI, as Mediamark is known, rarely agree in their results. Sometimes they aren't even consistent with themselves, showing inexplicable readership swings.    The question of which is closer to the truth is an urgent one. As the magazine and newspaper industries enter the third year of an advertising slump, ad-rate increases and new advertisers are ever harder to win. Poor numbers -- accurate or not -- can spell trouble. As a result, many publications, including The Wall Street Journal, have challenged the research firms' methods and results.    The readership figures &quot;are life or death for individual publications,&quot; says Robert Coen, a senior vice president of the New York office of the advertising firm McCann-Erickson Worldwide. &quot;If the readership figures shift just a hair, there's a big shift in the (number of) ad pages.&quot;    Executives at both Simmons and MRI stand by their research. &quot;We're like the umpires at the ball game,&quot; says Frank Stanton, president and chief executive of Simmons. &quot;Everybody boos the umpire.&quot;    Publishers say that it's difficult to tell which figures are more accurate, and complain that the differences between them are hard to reconcile. For example, MRI says that last year 20.9 people read each copy of House and Garden; Simmons says the figure was only about 9.2. This year, Simmons says, 37.5 million people read Reader's Digest, while MRI puts the figure at 50.9 million.    Nor do changes in a single firm's results always seem logical. Mal Ochs, a magazine consultant currently working with Us magazine, says Simmons reported a 21% drop in Us readership this year -- despite a circulation gain. (Readership figures are usually higher than those for circulation because more than one person reads each copy.)    Simmons's Mr. Stanton notes Us has undergone editorial changes and says, &quot;The techniques we use tend to be hypersensitive to changes the publisher makes.&quot;    The key to the quirks -- and the controversy -- lies in the two firms' research methods. Simmons shows specific issues of magazines to people, and counts as readers those who have read or glanced through those issues. MRI shows people flash cards with magazine logos printed on them, and counts as readers anyone who says they have read a weekly within the past seven days or a monthly within the past 30 days. While both firms interview about 20,000 people for each study, MRI's figures are generally higher -- in 1987, about 10% higher for weeklies and 35% higher for monthlies, according to research by Simmons.    Problems can crop up for smaller-circulation magazines because the research samples for them are often small. For example, Simmons's latest study included responses from only 424 readers of Esquire, which has a circulation of more than 700,000. When the figures are broken down to look at certain income and age groups, &quot;you're getting under 30 respondents, and the data is completely useless,&quot; contends Alan Lutrin, Esquire's research director.    Still, adds W. Randall Jones, Esquire's publisher, poor numbers &quot;absolutely affect us economically. It takes a lot of selling&quot; to woo advertisers put off by the figures.    MRI and Simmons respond that their reports flag numbers that are based on samples too small to be reliable, and that they list a margin of error for each magazine's results.    Critics have disputed other procedures as well. To prevent backaches among its researchers, who must lug 110 different magazines door to door, Simmons uses stripped-down issues that include only nine or so articles and no ads. But publishing executives say the stripped versions of certain magazines don't bear any resemblance to the originals.    Metropolitan Home, to illustrate the point, commissioned a study of women who said they read the magazine. When shown an actual issue, 42% said they were sure they had read it. When shown the same issue in the stripped version used by Simmons, only 28% said they were sure they had read it. &quot;Simmons was remaking our magazine,&quot; says Stephen Burzon, the publisher of Metropolitan Home, which was measured by neither firm this year. (Simmons responds that it did a similar study in 1976 and that the results for actual and stripped copies were identical.)    Critics contend that MRI's technique, on the other hand, may overinflate readership figures in some cases. They argue that people get confused by similar names -- such as House and Garden and Better Homes and Gardens -- and are apt to say they read publications they really don't. In a study done several years ago, they note, Time Inc. asked people about four magazines that were either fictitious or defunct. It came up with 13.1 million people who claimed to read them, including 2.8 million for Popular Sports (fictitious) and 6.7 million for Look (defunct).    &quot;Sure, there are errors,&quot; concedes Timothy Joyce, MRI's chairman and chief executive. &quot;If you put in a plausible name, you'll get a few readers.&quot; However, he defends the validity of MRI's studies.    In acknowledgment of the inconsistencies in the figures, big ad agencies often massage the raw data from the two firms, and they try to take into account other factors when deciding where ads should be placed. But the agencies' media planners often stick to the numbers anyway.    &quot;I've seen magazines knocked off of lists when the data falls,&quot; says Phillip Bernstein, a media supervisor at the ad agency Backer Spielvogel Bates, a unit of Saatchi andamp; Saatchi PLC. &quot;Sometimes we'll adjust the data or come up with our own numbers. We try to give guidance (to the media buyers) and flag the numbers that aren't stable -- but who knows? The bottom line is, you never know how a media planner deals with the data.&quot;    To help resolve the issue, a committee of advertising and research executives are trying to come up with absolutely accurate results by counting as readers only those people in study populations who say they read a publication the day before.    But the committee still needs $200,000 to finish its four-magazine trial. Measuring all 250-plus U.S. magazines, says Richard Lysaker, president of Audits and Surveys Inc. and committee chairman, &quot;could be very expensive&quot; -- if possible at all.    ---   Study in Contrasts   Top five magazines based on total adult readership, in millions     The Simmons List   1.TV Guide 43.2     2.
