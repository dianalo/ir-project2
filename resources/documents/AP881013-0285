Analysts said some late buying Wednesday was triggered by arumor, promptly denied by the State Department, that the U.S.embassy in Saudi Arabia had been bombed.   The price for the November contract for West Texas Intermediateoil, the benchmark U.S. crude, climbed 56 cents Wednesday to settleat $14.11 a barrel.   In other trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, theNovember contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 1.87 cent tosettle at 42.66 cents a gallon, while home heating oil rose 1.76cent to 40.84 cents a gallon.   The market has been volatile this week as crude oil pricesbounced back from last week's lows of under $12.30 a barrel.   Reports that several members of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries have been producing well in excess of theirquotas drove prices down to last week's lows.   But prices have moved higher since then, as some traders saysigns have emerged of a more conciliatory attitude among OPECmembers.   ``There is a growing perception that prices had gotten lowenough to force OPEC to do something,'' said Peter Beutel,assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc. inNew York.   Earlier this week, Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oilexporter, reaffirmed it would stick to its production quota ifother members of OPEC did.   Beutel said the approach of the Oct. 20 meeting of the OPECprice monitoring and long-term strategy committees was making sometraders nervous about the risks of agreements they might havepreviously made to sell borrowed oil contracts in expectation thatprices would fall further.   As speculation about production restraint grows, Beutel said,some of those traders are buying contracts to square thosepositions before the committee meetings occur.   He said some traders also believe this weekend's meeting of theGulf Cooperation Council, which includes four nations that are OPECmembers, could give the OPEC members a chance to ``patch somethingtogether'' that could be discussed at the OPEC price and strategycommittee meetings.   Bob Baker, senior energy analyst for Prudential-BacheSecurities, said prices also were supported by an AmericanPetroleum Institute report issued after the close of tradingTuesday that showed crude oil and gasoline supplies fell last week.He said many analysts were expecting rises.   Nauman Barakat, vice president of energy investment atPrudential Bache, said the embassy bombing rumor triggered a lateprice rise because it raised concerns that terrorists could disruptthe oil supply from the Mideast.</TEXT></DOC>
