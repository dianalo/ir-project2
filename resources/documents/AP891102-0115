Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a hard-liner Rafsanjani dropped asinterior minister, will address a rally outside the former embassybuilding, which militants stormed Nov. 4, 1979. He is thepresident's main rival and has close links to Shiite Moslemfundamentalists holding Western hostages in Lebanon.   It will be the first public appearance by Mohtashemi, 43, sincehe was pushed out Rafsanjani, who formed his government in Augustand leads the ``pragmatists'' who seek to end Iran's isolation.   Radicals have whipped up anti-American passion for days,undermining what had appeared to be a government attempt atmoderation on the 10th anniversary of the beginning of 444 days incaptivity for 52 Americans.   Workers strung scores of cloth banners Thursday between themaple trees lining Taleghani, a broad avenue that runs past theembassy's main entrance.   Among the inscriptions were ``No relations with the UnitedStates'' and ``Strike down global arrogance to protect the Islamicrevolution.''   Promoters call Saturday's anniversary ``the national day ofstruggle with global arrogance and the world-devouring UnitedStates.'' Global arrogance, like ``The Great Satan,'' has become asynonym for the United States.   Rafsanjani is trying to revive the moribund economy after atruce last year in the eight-year war with Iraq and has soughtbetter relations with the West, in part to secure help with arebuilding program estimated to cost $400 billion.   Revolutionary hard-liners fear opening up to the world willdilute the ideological purity of the fundamentalist revolutionAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini led from the takeover of Iran inFebruary 1979 until his death June 3.   Rumors had spread that Mohtashemi was under house arrest, but heturned up in Lebanon last month, meeting with Shiite leaders. Thereason for his visit was not clear, but speculation arose that itconcerned the 18 Western hostages, who include eight Americans.   Since becoming president, Rafsanjani has made tentative offersto help obtain their release if the United States met certainconditions.   Diplomats consider the radical attempt to make Saturday'sanniversary a show of anti-Americanism ``a kind of showdown withthe pragmatists.''   That theory was bolstered Wednesday when the Majlis, Iran'sparliament, enacted a law empowering the government to arrestAmericans anywhere in the world for offending Iran and bring themto Tehran for trial.   Officials said the bill responded to a U.S. Justice Departmentruling months ago allowing the FBI to arrest terrorism suspects inother countries without prior approval of the governments involved.The ruling contained no reference to Iran.   Why the response took so long was not clear, but the bill'sswift introduction and passage neatly coincided with theanniversary.   Militants who seized the embassy compound in downtown Tehranapparently had Khomeini's blessing. The crisis, including a rescueattempt that came to disaster in the desert south of Tehran,crippled President Jimmy Carter's administration and helped costhim the 1980 election.   Assadollah Bayat, the radical deputy speaker of parliament,declared Thursday that Iran never will resume the relations brokenby the United States after the embassy seizure.   ``The United States has adopted a hostile, brutal and inhumanattitude against Iran after the success of the Islamicrevolution,'' he declared.   Echoing a speech Wednesday by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, thesupreme political and spiritual leader, Bayat exhorted Iranians to``wage perpetual struggle against arrogant powers headed by theUnited States.''   By contrast, Rafsanjani said last week that Washington had sentmessages to Iran through two neighboring countries, presumablyPakistan and Turkey, seeking better relations.   He avoided outright rejection of the overture, saying: ``Westill have no confidence in what they say. We ask for signs andindications of goodwill on their part.''   Officials said demonstrators would burn 160 American flagsSaturday, 10 for each of 16 Shiites beheaded in Saudi Arabia inSeptember for bombings in the holy city of Mecca during this year'sannual Moslem pilgrimage. The bombs killed one man and wounded 16.   The day's events will begin with a news conference in the formerembassy compound at which Iranians said to have spied for theUnited States will be put on display.</TEXT></DOC>
