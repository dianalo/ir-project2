Scotland Yard said in a statement Wednesday that electroniccodes on the floppy disks that carry information on the deadlyimmune-stripping human virus have destroyed information in at least10 computers in Britain.   At least 10,000 copies of the ``AIDS Information IntroductoryDiskette'' were sent, said a Scotland Yard spokeswoman, who bycustom was not identified.   The London newspaper The Independent reported today that rumorsin the computer world put the figure much higher and that hospitalsystems were among those damaged. It said the disks also turned upin California, Belgium and Zimbabwe but gave no details aboutprecisely where.   Officials and news reports reported that people in Sweden,Norway and Denmark also received the disk on acquired immunedeficiency syndrome.   In California, the Santa Monica-based Rand Corp. warned itsemployees about the disk but said its computers have not beenaffected.   John McAfee, chairman of the Computer Virus Industry Associationin Santa Clara, Calif., said Chase Manhattan Bank was one of thefirst companies to report problems with the software, but he didnot elaborate. The company's office in New York was not immediatelyavailable for comment.   Computer viruses are pieces of software that reproducethemselves and spread from one machine to another through infectedfloppy disks, office networks or telephone lines. They erode acomputer's processing power and storage space, or destroyinformation.   The Guardian newspaper said the disks' program contains ``aTrojan horse computer virus'' that attacks IBM personal computers.International Business Machines is one of the world's biggestmakers of computers.   Among those reported to have received the disks are the LondonStock Exchange; British Telecommunications PLC, which runs most ofthe nation's telephone network; the Midland Bank; Lloyds Bank; theAustralia and New Zealand Bank in London; universities; hospitalsand public health laboratories.   In Sweden, the State Bacteriological Laboratory sent letters toclinics and doctors working with AIDS warning them about the disk.Swedish radio said many of the 6,500 people who attended oninternational conference on AIDS in Stockholm last year arebelieved to have received one.   Five doctors at Ullevaal Hospital in Oslo, Norway, also receivedthe disk, said Dr. Jan Doblough of the infection ward.   The alarm was first raised Tuesday by Dr. Alan Solomon, chairmanof the IBM Personal Computer User Group, who said he received oneof the disks on Monday.   CW Communications, which publishes PC Business World magazine,confirmed that the virus was sent out using a 7,000-name mailinglist which it sold to a company called Ketema Associates.   Martin Durham, managing director of CW Communications,criticized ``the use of our mailing list for this sort of recklesstomfoolery.''   To help its readers, PC Business World said it was offering afree disk to anyone whose programs were affected by the diskette.Called ``AIDSOUT,'' the free disk wipes out extraneous matter puton a computer by the diskette.
