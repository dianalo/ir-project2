Alfonse D'Amato has charged that state Sen.Warren Anderson rigged the Republican primary in New York State sothat Vice President George Bush would be the only candidate in somedistricts.   In a televised interview broadcast Sunday, D'Amato accusedAnderson, the state Senate majority leader, of disenfranchisingRepublican voters.   He said Anderson has refused to loosen a requirement thatRepublican presidential candidates collect 1,250 signatures in eachof the state's 34 congressional districts.   ``Warren Anderson devised a program and a plan that wouldbasically make it impossible for all but George Bush to fieldslates throughout the state,'' said D'Amato, a Republican whosupports Sen. Bob Dole. ``This is not the Soviet Union, where yourun one slate and you say take it or leave it. This is America.''   He said on WNBC's ``Newsmakers'' program that the requirementfavors Bush because he has a larger campaign organization thanDole, Rep. Jack Kemp or Pat Robertson.   A spokesman for Anderson, R-Binghampton, denied that themajority leader had any intention of keeping legitimate candidatesoff the ballot.   ``Of course it's not true,'' said the spokesman, Charles Dumas.``Everyone was given the same amount of time to collect petitionsand put their candidates on the ballot. Now if Mr. Dole's peopledidn't do their job, that's their problem.''</TEXT><HEAD>Tipper Gore Honored For Rock-Records Crusade</HEAD><DATELINE>GATLINBURG, Tenn.
