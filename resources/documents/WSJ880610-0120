They said the proposed merger also requires the approval of both companies' shareholders.    After the merger, Koger, which was spun off from Koger Properties eight years ago, will become a wholly owned unit of Koger Properties. The companies said the merger will give them tax and financing advantages.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Koger Properties, a real-estate developer, closed at $26.75, up 25 cents. In trading on the American Stock Exchange, Koger, a real-estate operating concern, closed at $24.50, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
