(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>As Easy As Pie ChartsandM;A picture isn't always worth a thousand words, but a picture may be the bestway to understand relationships.andP;  Isn't that why we all talk with our hands,sketching make believe images in the air? Whatever your database application,chances are that reports alone don't tell the full story.andP;  Without pictures,vital information will remain buried.andP;  Displayed graphically, data trends andpatterns can be vividly revealed.andP;  That's why I'm happy to recommend severalutility programs designed to turn your database into pictures.andM;Database graphing programs come in several forms.andP;  A standalone graphingutility typically accepts data in ASCII comma-delimited form.andP;  Some offerdirect support for common database file structures such as dBASE and R:BASE.andO;Standalone programs can be used at the DOS level, or RUN from inside anapplication if sufficient memory is available.andP;  Another type of utility isdesigned to be LOADed and CALLed from within such programs as dBASE, FoxBASE+and Quicksilver.andP;  A related type is provided in OBJ file form andspecifically for use with Clipper.andP;  Such add-ins can generate completegraphs, or provide graphics primitives to build your own, or even displayscanned or drawn images.andP;  Choosing the appropriate graphics utilityarchitecture depends on the nature of your application, features, flexibilityand performance desired, memory available, and to some extent, budget.andM;Whether run externally or loaded internally, graphics programs add a widerange of pictures to a database's words.andP;  Pie charts are used to show howparts fit into a whole.andP;  Bar charts compare several items.andP;  Stacked barcharts show how the components of each item compare to the whole, and toother items.andP;  Histograms resemble bar charts but graph distributions, thenumber of elements in each range of values.andP;  Line charts show data trendsover time.andP;  Area fill charts are line charts that emphasize the quantitiesinvolved.andP;  Scatter charts plot two variables to show correlation anddistribution.andP;  Fitted curves produce a clear trend from varying data, usinglinear regression, logarithmic and exponential mathematical models.andP;  Movingaverage charts smooth data variations.andP;  Not all graphics utilities providesuch a wide range of charts (G-Wiz does, for example).andM;PCS imagesandM;In addition to showing data in chart and graph form, many applications canbenefit from the real thing: pictures.andM;A powerful feature shared by many graphics utilities is the ability to usePCX image files.andP;  A PCX image can contain a photograph, drawing, headlinefont, logo, video frame, clip art, or even a graphic generated by anotherprogram and stored in PCX format.andM;PCX is the graphics file format invented by Z-Soft a few years ago for theirPC Paintbrush program (and Microsoft Paintbrush, bundled with the MicrosoftMouse).andP;  The PCX format was expanded with Z-Soft's PC Paintbrush Plus andPublishers Paintbrush products.andP;  The PC Paintbrush family of products usesthe GEM graphics screen interface, so PCX is a GEM-related format.andP;  Becauseof its large user base, PCX is an image file format supported by Ventura,Pagemaker, WordPerfect 5.0, various scanners, video capture programs, and avariety of graphics-oriented utility programs.andM;It's nice to have a widely-supported standard, but like so many other aspectsof computers, just saying &quot;PCX-compatible&quot; isn't saying enough.andP;  A graphicsimage is formed in RAM using the standards of the current video mode.andP;  Whenthe image is saved to a PCX file, it carries the video mode format with it.andO;PCX image files can be large, especially if saved in color.andP;  The majority ofmonitors attached to business computers are monochrome, yet graphics softwareis color-oriented.andP;  Trying to display a PCX image on a different type ofmonitor system can be impossible, unless the display software performs sometype of translation-which some do, some don't, and some do sometimes.andM;The number of PCs with graphics capabilities is growing so rapidly that itwon't be long before database applications routinely include pictures.andP;  Bethe first on your block by adding graphics now.andP;  There are too many graphicsprograms to cover in one article, so what follows is a sampling of severaldifferent types suitable for use with database applications.andM;G-Wiz/G-Run 1.12andM;G-Wiz is a program specifically used to design graphs, which are laterdisplayed by a runtime version, G-Run.andP;  G-Wiz is heavy-artillery graphics.andP;  Acomplex system, installation requires nine disks, is hardware-specific, andplaces four device drivers in the CONFIG.SYS file.andP;  Specifying devices inCONFIG.SYS is generally undesirable, since it forces them into memory at alltimes.andP;  G-Wiz makes this more palatable by swapping the actual drivers in andout, so memory consumed while not running is just 2K.andP;  G-Wiz seems to supportjust about everything, including various printer functions, color ribbons,LaserJet font cartridges, several EGA and VGA resolutions, Herculesmonochrome graphics, and much more.andP;  G-Wiz produces eight types of graphics:pie, bar, line, area fill and scatter charts, histograms, fitted curves, andmoving averages.andP;  Charts can be plotted against one of six data types:numbers, text, dates, times, quarters and months.andP;  G-Wiz automatically scalesthe horizontal axis based upon the data it receives, so a generic chartdesign can properly handle a wide range of data sets at run time.andM;Graphing programs are never simple but, within the genre, G-Wiz is relativelyeasy to use.andP;  First, G-Wiz creates a chart or graph in exactly the style youseek.andP;  You can provide for up to six data sets, since any that don't exist atrun-time will be suppressed.andP;  Save the chart as a file.andP;  Then, to generateand display the graphics image from within a database application, executeG-Run using the RUN command (or ZIP if using R:BASE).andM;G-Run is invoked with a parameter list that specifies the chart name, ASCIIdata file of values to plot, the chart label file, and the desired outputdevice.andP;  Output from G-Run can be sent to the display, printer, plotter,camera and metafile.andP;  Optional parameters can override chart defaults at runtime.andP;  G-Run can't actually read dBASE or R:BASE data files.andP;  An ASCII fileversion of the desired data must be created before G-Run is called.andP;  In dBASEthis might be done with COPY TO filename DELIMITED.andP;  Another ASCII file mustbe created with the various graph titles, legends and labels.andM;Exporting dates from dBASE is always a problem, but G-Wiz's dBDATE data typeautomatically translates YYYYMMDD into MM/DD/YY.andP;  A similar data typetranslates Lotus 1-2-3 dates.andM;One of the more blatant holes in dBASE is the lack of a provision for nulldata.andP;  A blank character field, or zero-value numeric field, should not bethe same as a field containing no value at all, but dBASE doesn't make thisdistinction.andP;  In plotting data, a missing value should be skipped, notplotted as a zero value.andP;  G-Wiz handles nulls correctly, if you care tosomehow preprocess your dBASE data to export nulls (&quot;&quot;) when zero (&quot;0&quot;) isnot correct.andM;G-Wiz is not a multiuser program, but its printing functions are compatiblewith a Novell network.andP;  G-Wiz needs 512K RAM or more and 2M of hard diskspace.andP;  The high memory usage, the complex installation process and therequirement that device drivers be loaded through CONFIG.SYS inhibit the useof G-Wiz/G-Run.andP;  But the program's features and performance make such burdentolerable.andM;The single biggest problem of pairing G-Wiz with dBASE is that you must usedBASE's RUN to access it.andP;  Using the RUN command to call G-Run limits itsusefulness to situations where you can guarantee adequate free memory.andP;  Theextremely thorough manual offers several suggestions for giving G-Run enoughmemory to be run from dBASE (there is no mention of FoxBASE+ or Clipper).andO;When all else fails, G-Run can always be invoked from DOS or through a batchfile.andP;  But G-Wiz offers another solution in this form of ITTYDODA.EXE.andO;Ittydoda, from Synchronicity Research Group is a program that frees up RAM bytemporarily swapping large chunks of the occupied memory to disk.andP;  RUNITTYDODA G-RUN will swap 270K of dBASE to disk, execute G-Run, then put dBASEback together again in RAM.andM;With an incredible array of features, support for a huge number of devices,great versatility and control, superb output quality, and the inclusion ofIttydoda, G-Wiz is a marvelously capable program.andP;  It is also expensive,since a separate copy of G-Run is required for each copy of an applicationdistributed.andM;G-Wiz and one copy of G-Run are $395 from Mightysoft, P.O. Box 51048,Seattle, Wash.andP;  98115, phone (206) 525-3766.andP;  Additional copies of G-Run are$195.andM;Flipper VIandM;Flipper is for Clipper.andP;  Flipper IV is a huge set functions that add graphicsprimitives and full graphics to Clipper Summer'87.andP;  Graph types include bar,line, pie, histogram, and regression.andM;Flipper offers great power, but like similar programs, at a price.andP;  Theprogrammer must perform a series of complex steps to initialize graphics, setup buffers, store data to buffers, customize the graph, display it, addadditional elements to the screen, then loop back to set up buffers for asecond graph, or return to text mode.andP;  You can't avoid the fundamental stepsneeded to produce graphs, but Flipper helps when it can.andP;  The axis isautomatically scaled, and the entire graph can be located just where you wantit on the screen.andM;If Flipper doesn't generate the graph you need, use its graphics primitivesto build one.andP;  Drawing functions create circle, ellipse, arc, line, andpoint, and you can fill an area with color and pattern.andP;  Pictures can besaved to files and restored.andP;  Flipper also opens up Clipper programs to thelarger world of graphics images.andP;  Functions are provided to convert betweenFlipper's PIC and the PCX graphics file format.andM;Flipper graphs can be displayed on almost any type of monitor system.andP;  CGA,EGA, VGA and Hercules graphics are supported.andP;  Multiple graphs can bedisplayed in &quot;viewports&quot; in up to 15 subsections of the screen.andP;  Over twodozen functions provide mouse control.andM;Printing controls include the location, size and color of the graph.andP;  Avariety of fonts are provided for titles, legends and labels-140GEM-compatible character fonts are provided, with a font editor to create oredit Flipper font files.andP;  Functions are provided to send graphs in the formof HPGL commands through a serial port to a Hewlett-Packard Plotter.andP;  Flipperalso supports dot matrix and laser printers.andP;  A Printer Driver system isprovided to solve the problem of matching your graphics application to theuser's hardware.andP;  A large number of printer drivers are included in theprinter table, and an editor is provided to expand and maintain it.andM;To print on-screen Flipper images on most dot matrix and laser printerswithout any programming at all, a utility called GRAFPLUS is provided.andO;GRAFPLUS is a TSR program that does a print-screen type dump to the printerof any on-screen image, whether generated by Flipper or most other programs.andM;The Flipper manual offers solid details on each function, but there isnothing resembling an introduction, overview or tutorial.andP;  A demo program,with source code, covers most Flipper functions.andP;  A series of exampleprograms are provided as a way -- the only way, really -- to learn to useFlipper.andP;  The idea is to compile them, run them, compare the performance tothe source code, and absorb the Flipper concepts.andP;  That's a worthwhilemethod, but it really should be backed up by a few words from the wise.andM;Clipper applications have a way of growing larger than available RAM.andO;Flipper adds 50K to 100K, depending upon the number of functions used.andO;Fortunately, an overlay utility is provided to build a Clipper link file thatproperly overlays Flipper.andM;Clipper programmers who want to add graphics may find everything they need inFlipper.andP;  It performs in impressive fashion, the price is reasonable, and theabsence of runtime or royalty requirements makes it a &quot;best buy.&quot;andM;Flipper IV is $195 from ProWorks, P.O. Box 1635, Hermiston, Oregon 97838,phone (503) 567-1459.andP;  There are no royalty requirements.andM;SilverPaint 1.11andM;SilverPaint is not a graphing -- as in plotting/charting -- program.andO;Instead, it adds graphics flash to applications -- animation, images, soundsand music, even logos.andM;SilverPaint provides over 25 functions to do the following: draw a box,circle, or ellipse with specified coordinates and color; write a characterstring with specified colors; delay activation a specified amount of time;generate sounds, and turn the PC's speaker on/off; more dramatically, createa sound structure that can be passed to an assembler routine (the producedsounds play back quickly enough to perform simple music and impressive soundeffects); draw lines point to point at any angle; set the color palette; readand display a PCX graphics image; and generate a random number.andM;SilverPaint supports CGA, EGA and VGA color graphics, and Hercules monochromegraphics.andP;  The PCX file type is supported in almost all its forms.andP;  Todisplay a PCX image, you tell the software which mode to use, and provide acompatible monitor system.andP;  That's the theory; in reality, a PCX imagegenerated on one system may well be unviewable on another with differentvideo hardware.andP;  As you contemplate adding pictures to your applications, beprepared for problems of image incompatibility.andM;The SilverPaint manual is reasonably complete, with a welcome introductionand summary of functions.andP;  Demo programs with source code provide a way tolearn by imitation.andP;  Missing is any discussion of the issues involved.andP;  Ifyou're not already experienced with PCX graphics, sound generation, and theother advanced functions SilverPaint provides, you'll spend time learning byexperimentation.andP;  I had to dig through a PC Paintbrush manual to fill thegaps in SilverPaint's book.andM;SilverPaint is, in many ways, a modest set of utilities, but the price andperformance are right.andP;  Clipper programmers have many powerful add-ons tochoose from, while SilverPaint is one of the few utility kits that bringsClipper-like expanded abilities to dBASE, FoxBASE+ and dBXL/Quicksilver.andM;Silverpaint 1.11 comes in either Clipper or Programmers Plus editions for$99.95 each from SilverWare, Inc., P.O. Box 781143, Dallas, Texas 75378,phone (214) 902-0227.andP;  An owner of one edition can add the alternate editionfor $29.95.andM;PCX Programmer's Toolkit 3.0andM;The PCX Programmer's Toolkit has a single goal: to add support for PCX-formatgraphics images to applications written in Clipper Summer'87.andP;  (Microsoft C,Turbo C, QuickC, Lattice C, QuickBASIC, and Turbo Pascal are also supported.)andO;The Toolkit is supplied as an OBJ file of functions.andP;  PCX Programmer'sToolkit is chronologically an upgrade to an earlier product called PBUTILS,hence the 3.0 version number; but it is a total rewrite, explaining the newname.andM;The Toolkit supports Hercules monochrome, CGA, EGA and VGA display adapters.andO;It provides more than 35 functions to display, save and manipulate PCXimages, including displaying them within database applications.andP;  Written inassembler, the Toolkit can display images fast enough for reasonableanimation.andP;  The various tools available to programmers through functions areprovided as standalone utility programs, useful in maintaining PCX files andlibraries.andM;PCX Programmer's Toolkit utilities include PcxShow, which displays any PCXimage directly from DOS.andP;  PcxGrab is a memory resident program that grabs anydisplayed graphics screen and stores it in a PCX image file, compatible withother PCX programs.andP;  PcxLib is an image library manager to collect imagesinto a single file and then manipulate them as desired.andP;  PcxCut createscut-outs, or windows, meaning rectangular sections of a full screen image.andO;PcxLoc displays a PCX image with cross-hairs for locating pixel coordinates.andO;When you want to determine an exact screen position, this utility is vital.andO;PcxHdr displays the information contained within the header of a PCX file,including the original display resolution, resolution of the image, width anddepth, color palette and, if possible, the original image type.andM;The Toolkit and its utilities have some limits.andP;  Screen images must be nolarger than the screen size, which some scanned images exceed.andP;  A futurerelease should resolve this.andP;  Images are not clipped at the screen boundaryif they are moved to extend beyond it (use a sub-screen section instead).andO;Because the left side x-coordinate is aligned with byte (rather than bit)boundaries, images can be shifted a few pixels when displayed and saved.andM;Generally, the Toolkit allows direct access to the PCX header structure.andO;But, as the manual explains, this Toolkit function doesn't work in Clipper,and custom C programming is necessary.andP;  A solution is being sought, and mostusers won't need such header access anyway.andP;  Manipulating graphics imagesrequires getting quite close to the hardware.andP;  The Toolkit requires that allsupported display adapters be register-level compatible, not just BIOScompatible.andM;To learn the Toolkit, follow the examples supplied on disk in source codeform and reproduced in the manual.andP;  The procedure for displaying an image inClipper is straightforward, requiring just a few lines of code.andP;  Entergraphics mode, set the palette, and display the image.andP;  A return code isprovided by each Toolkit function so the programmer can verify success aftereach step.andP;  This Toolkit is a professional class product that adds powerfulPCX graphics image manipulation to Clipper, and to the other major compiledprogramming languages, at an absolutely bargain price.andM;PCX Programmer's Toolkit 3.0 is $89.95 from Genus Microprogramming, 11315Meadow Lake, Houston, Texas 77077, phone (800)227-0918.andP;  There are noroyalties for embedding Toolkit functions in an application, but theutilities may not be distributed.andP;  Assembly language source code is availablefor $100.andP;  Technical support is available with a toll call.andM;OmnigrafandM;Omnigraf adds two- and three-dimensional charts to dBASE, FoxBASE+, Clipper,Quicksilver and other programs.andP;  It also runs as a DOS program.andM;The procedure for running Omnigraf is supposed to work like this: StartOMNIGRAF, which automatically loads dBASE, then CALL each Omnigraf function.andO;With a dBASE compatible program, this method is unavailable.andP;  For example,you must start FoxBASE+, then RUN the standalone version of Omnigraf.andM;That's the theory.andP;  When operating on my Novell network, both approachesfailed completely, with a cold boot my only recourse.andP;  I can only concludethat Omnigraf is not compatible with the resident Novell network shell.andP;  On anon-network machine Omnigraf works fine.andM;Omnigraf contains several standard graph types: bar, line, pie, and stackedbar.andP;  Just call them up with specific data, titles and labels.andP;  In addition,Omnigraf provides many commands to create low-level graphics components suchas lines, boxes, circles, ellipses, arcs, and plotted points.andP;  Graphics maybe overlaid on each other, and on standard graph images.andM;Omnigraf seems to support all graphics screen types, although the topic isn'tdiscussed in the manual.andP;  It worked fine in Hercules monochrome.andP;  Becauseprinting is done via screen dump, success is printer-specific.andP;  Aprint-screen driver is supplied for Epson/IBM compatible printers.andP;  You maybe able to use Omnigraf with other printer standards if you can acquire aprint screen driver.andP;  (I wasn't able to print anything on my machines.)andP;  Thislimitation should be removed when printer driver support is added in arelease that's due any time now.andM;Omnigraf runs very well with dBASE III PLUS, although they apparently must bein the same directory, since Omnigraf couldn't find dBASE on my DOS path.andP;  AnOBJ file is supplied for Clipper, but the method required with FoxBASE+ isn'tsatisfactory.andP;  Using the RUN command means losing direct control overexecution, an undesirable compromise.andP;  To make it possible to use theLOAD/CALL version, there should be a way to tell OMNIGRAF to load FoxBASE+,dBXL or Quicksilver instead of the default dBASE (perhaps in a futurerelease?).andM;Omnigraf does a good job.andP;  The built-in standard graphs are attractive andshould meet most needs nicely, making graph programming trivial.andP;  At thepresent time, however, Omnigraf is an immature product.andP;  The manual isbarebones, with issues such as compatibility and network support notmentioned.andP;  Technical support is available in the 714 area code.andP;  Untilprinter support is expanded, Omnigraf is mainly an on-screen graph generator.andO;The problems I encountered on my Novell network limit Omnigraf's use to thevery smallest of business environments.andP;  By directly supporting only dBASE,Omnigraf does not reflect the real world of applications development.andP;  I hopethese limitations are removed soon, since this is a useful product for anyonewho wants to add standard charts to an application with minimal effort.andM;Omnigraf (no version specified) is $150 plus $5 shipping and handling from EZSoft, 9702 E. Watson Drive, Tucson, Arizona 95730, phone (602)298-0296.andM;dPict 1.0andM;Another product that graphs dBASE data, dPict creates a histogram, pie chart,line graph and bar chart.andP;  Taking a completely different tack from the othergraph programs, dPict is interactive.andP;  First, it reads data directly from aspecified DBF file.andP;  Then four different graphs of the data are displayed onthe screen.andP;  The user is asked &quot;which form&quot; to see in full-screen mode.andP;  Oncethe graph is displayed, additional prompts allow you to change the on-screentitles and labels and the graph to be printed.andP;  A final prompt allows thegraph to be saved as a file.andP;  You can then exit, or loop back to select adifferent graph.andM;Once a DBF file has been translated into a graph and saved in that form, itcan be redisplayed at any time without regeneration.andP;  dPict apparentlysupports Hercules monochrome, CGA, EGA and VGA graphics displays.andP;  The DOSGRAPHICS printer driver must be resident in memory, although it doesn'treliably support all printers.andM;Not a programmer's tool, dPict is strictly a standalone utility.andP;  It can berun from DOS, or with the RUN command.andP;  dPict graphs up to four specifiedfields (three dependent variables against a dependent variable), apparentlyusing the first 16 records as data points (no specifications are supplied).andO;In many cases, a larger data file must be summarized, perhaps with the TOTALON command, to create a DBF file with no more than 16 records to be charted.andM;dPict uses the minimalist approach to documentation.andP;  I could easily make itwork, but I don't know much about it.andP;  For example, dPict is supplied withthree sample DBF files for graphing.andP;  Strangely (and without explanation),they are dBASE II files!andP;  By experimentation I determined that dBASE III PLUSfiles are also supported, as are paths to the DBF file.andM;If you're willing to first process (and perhaps condense) your data into aDBF file with up to four fields and 16 records, dPict is a handy way to seerelationships and trends.andP;  With an IBM/Epson compatible printer you canactually get hard copy.andP;  With little technical information, and peculiarsample data, dPict is a commercial product that feels like shareware.andP;  But,for what it does, it can be handy to have around.andM;dPict 1.0 sells for $49.95 and is a product of Paragon Technical Services,1581 Garland Ave., Tustin, California 92680, phone (714) 832-3327.andP;  At presstime, the company announced a new version of dPict (1.1) that, according to apress release, &quot;clears up some minor bugs and displays percentages inside thepie slices.&quot;andP;  The new version will sell for the same price and is availablefree to registered owners of version 1.0.andM;dGE 2.00andM;dGE, the &quot;database graphics extension,&quot; was developed in 1984 to add graphcapabilities to dBASE II.andP;  Of British origin, dGE is well-established in theUnited Kingdom.andP;  Distribution was expanded to cover most of Europe in 1987,and to the U.S.andP;  in 1988.andM;dGE adds (or will soon add) graphics to dBASE III PLUS, dBASE IV, Clipper,FoxBASE+, Quicksilver, dBFast, Eagle, and C.andP;  It produces standard graphslike pie, bar and line charts, but also polar graphs, polyline, polyvectorand time series charts.andP;  You can even draw graphics images withpseudo-animation (on a reasonably fast computer).andP;  dGE includes statisticalfunctions like minimum, maximum, standard deviation and correlationcoefficient.andP;  You can mix and overlay as many graphics as you choose on asingle page.andM;As full of features as dGE is, it's not an exact duplicate of any otherpackage.andP;  One major difference is in PCX support.andP;  dGE can send its output toa PCX file, but it can't read one in.andM;dGE controls the screen through a graphics kernel, SETEDGE, which must beloaded into memory before running a program.andP;  DGE commans and functions areadded to applications by a linkage module, which links the application toSETEDGE.andM;How dGE is implemented varies.andP;  In some situations.andP;  SETEDGE must first beloaded as a 35K TSR program, but it may be readily removed with SETEDGE/F.andO;With dBASE III PLUS, load SETEDGE, load dBASE, then DODGE to run the linkagePRG that defines strings of escape sequences.andP;  These are then sent via &quot;?&quot;andO;statements to the resident SETEDGE.andP;  For Clipper, a linkage file of UDFs inOBJ format is used.andP;  Source code is provided to compile your own OBJ, so youcan keep up with future changes in Clipper.andP;  Contrary to the approach takenby many other programs, dGE does not support FoxBASE+ as simply a clone ofdBASE.andP;  Instead, a procedure file of UDF's (with source code) is used to CALLa LOADed DGE.BIN module.andP;  C language programs are supported by DGEC.C, DGEC.Hand DGECASM.ASM filesandM;All graphics monitors are supported by dGE, from Hercules to standard VGA.andO;CGA-80 column graphics are only supported in non-color mode, and EGA cardsmust have at least 128K on board.andP;  On the coming-soon list are ahigh-resolution VGA driver, mouse support, color printer support, and a dBASEIV interface.andP;  The graphics image on screen can be printed on either a dotmatrix or laser printer.andP;  The dGE printer configuration utility is weak.andO;Only six printers are pre-configured, including a couple of odd-ball models.andO;You can define your own printer by entering control codes, but only one suchprinter can exist, and you can't even name it.andP;  The H-P LaserJet (andcompatibles) is supported by directing an exact dump of the screen rasterimage to the printer.andP;  Unfortunately, laser printers work in a square format,while PC screens use rectangular orientation.andP;  This makes circles on thescreen ovals on the printer.andP;  Many graphics programs have this problem.andP;  dGEoffers a workaround that stretches screen dumps to make the printed versionappear symmetrical.andP;  This requires an occasional doubling of lines, which maybe noticeable in images with regular patterns.andP;  Output can be edirected to afile, and dGE can drive a plotter.andM;dGE works fine on a network, although any file and record locking must bedone by the database manager.andP;  dGE also claims compatibility with MicrosoftWindows.andM;The indexed manual is an excellent technical reference, but it does notmention theory or design issues.andP;  A tiny section on &quot;Programming Hints&quot;explains a sample dBASE listing.andP;  Additional sample programs on diskillustrate proper use of all aspects of dGE.andM;Having a few years head-start on the competition shows throughout the dGEpackage.andP;  It is smooth running, versatile, full-featured, well-documented,and the output is superb.andP;  A README file listing the latest anomalies isincluded, a refreshing bit of honesty.andP;  The manual provides specificinformation for dBASE, FoxBASE+, Clipper and C.andP;  Applications may bedistributed without purchasing additional runtime licenses.andP;  I wish dGE coulddisplay and print PCX images, and printer support needs improvement.andO;Otherwise, as a tool that works with all dBASE-compatibles, dGE is hard tobeat.andM;dGE 2.0 is $195 from Bits Per Second, distributed by Pinnacle Publishing,P.O.
