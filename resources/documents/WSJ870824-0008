The insurance and financial services concern said it expects the sale to result in a $43 million after-tax gain in either the third or the fourth quarter. Transamerica began pulling out of the airline business last year, as part of an effort to trim operations unrelated to its core financial businesses. It now has terminated all flight operations and has sold all but one plane.    Southern Air has been leasing the 11 Lockheed Hercules L-100-30 aircraft from Transamerica Airlines for the past year. Southern Air said it has been using the planes on its domestic and international charter cargo flights, under a lease with option to purchase. Closing on the sale is expected by Nov. 30, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
