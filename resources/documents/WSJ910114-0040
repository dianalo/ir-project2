The deal would be a huge boon to affected Executive Lifepolicyholders who are worried about the survival of thecompany, a principal unit of First Executive Corp., a LosAngeles-based insurance holding company whose fortunes havesagged along with the value of its investments in high-risk,high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds. However, it's less clear how otherExecutive Life policyholders would fare because the structureof the transaction hasn't been worked out.</LP><TEXT>   John P. Ginnetti, a Hartford Life senior vice presidentinvolved in the talks, cautioned that they are still at apreliminary stage. &quot;Any transaction is complicated and itwould be premature for anyone to rely on its taking place.&quot;The talks have been under way for six or seven weeks, hesaid.   So-called reinsurance assumption transactions have becomeincreasingly common in the insurance industry in recentyears. In effect, an insurer takes over the ceding companies'policies. In this case, while Executive Life's name mightremain on the policies, Hartford would assume mostadministrative tasks, including sending out premium noticesand collecting checks.   More importantly, the policies would be backed by HartfordLife, top-ranked for financial strength by various insuranceand credit-rating agencies. Hartford is part of the HartfordGroup owned by New York-based ITT Corp.   &quot;This {would be} a significant transaction for Hartford,&quot;Mr. Ginnetti acknowledged. &quot;It would make us a bigger playerin a business we're already in, but we wouldn't do it if itweren't reasonable and profitable.&quot; The transaction wouldbring about $400 million in annual premiums and a 50%increase in the number of Hartford Life's individual lifepolicies, which Mr. Ginnetti said make up a small part of itsoverall product offerings.   William C. Adams, a First Executive senior vice president,said, &quot;Executive Life is interested if {the deal} were toresult in strengthening of the company's capital position andincreasing the comfort level of policyholders.&quot; The capitalposition is already strong by industry standards, he said.&quot;We wouldn't do this if it weren't for the public concernsthat have been raised.&quot;   Mr. Adams said that First Executive also has talked withunidentified parties about swapping its guaranteed investmentcontracts involving municipal bonds.   A stumbling block in any Hartford-Executive Life dealcould be disagreements over the nature and value of ExecutiveLife assets that Hartford presumably would get to match anyliabilities assumed. Since a substantial part of ExecutiveLife's assets are junk bonds, it seems that the company wouldwant to include them in the package.   Both parties declined to discuss the specifics of anypossible agreement. However, Mr. Ginnetti said that HartfordLife has never purchased or owned a junk bond. &quot;We wouldn'tchange our philosophy as we talk about this proposedtransaction.&quot;   Joseph M. Belth, publisher of the Insurance Forum, a tradepublication, and a frequent critic of First Executive,worries about the impact of any agreement on Executive Life'sremaining policyholders. If the transferred assets areinvestmentgrade securities, &quot;the transaction would severelyweaken Executive Life vis-a-vis the rest of its creditors,&quot;he said.   However, some top Executive Life agents close to the talksare assuring their best clients that a deal would benefit allparties. Any agreement would require approval by theCalifornia insurance department, which is supposed to protectpolicyholders' interests. California and Connecticutinsurance regulators said it was premature to assess themerits of any transaction.   Separately, First Executive said it signed a definitiveagreement with a representative of its banks to restructure$275 million of the company's senior debt obligations. Termsof the pact with Yasuda Trust andamp; Bank Co. are substantiallythe same as in the initial accord reached last month, FirstExecutive said.   The agreement includes a $33.4 million pro-rata cashpayment to holders participating in the restructuring and theissuance of $242 million in new notes, replacing theremaining indebtedness. First Executive said the next step isapproval of the agreement by the company's other 50 or sobanks.</TEXT></DOC>
