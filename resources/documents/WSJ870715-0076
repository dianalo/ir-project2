The low-level investigation by the Transportation Department's National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration follows complaints that Taurus and Sable cars stalled at slow speeds or in stop-and-go traffic. No injuries or accidents have been reported in connection with the alleged problem.    A preliminary, low-level investigation is the first of three stages of a safety administration inquiry. Before ordering a mandatory recall, the agency would have to proceed to an engineering analysis and a formal defect investigation, and then conduct public hearings.    This is the second investigation of the two Ford models launched by the safety administration. The first, which began May 12, involves alleged steering problems.    The Center for Auto Safety, a Washington, D.C.-based consumer group, said the safety administration's latest investigation would cover all 250,000 of the Ford models sold in 1987. A spokesman for the center, which has received 12 complaints about stalling in the vehicles, said the problem may involve the electronic engine controls used in the fuel-injected models made in both 1986 and 1987. According to the consumer group, Ford has issued five notices to its dealers about the problem.    While the safety administration announced the investigation, it wouldn't comment on details.    The Taurus and Sable models have contributed largely to Ford's financial success since last year. Ford has hailed the aerodynamically designed cars as a symbol of a renewed commitment to quality and in fact delayed the models' introduction in 1985 to iron out production problems.    The safety administration also announced a low-level investigation into Ford's Aerostar van, prompted by a report that the sliding door fell off the guide track in one van. The spokesman for the auto safety consumer group said the investigation covers all 200,000 Aerostars sold since mid-1985. A single complaint can spur an investigation if safety administration engineers see a potential hazard.    In Dearborn, Mich., Ford said in a prepared statement that it &quot;does not believe that a safety-related defect is associated with either of NHTSA's preliminary evaluations.&quot; The company added that it nevertheless &quot;is continuing to evaluate all available evidence.&quot;    Ford said that it was aware of customer concerns with Aerostar's door track uniformity and roller breakage on earlier models, but that it had corrected the production problem and instructed dealers to repair defects reported by customers. Regarding the alleged Taurus and Sable stalling problem, which could affect vehicle safety, Ford said it would &quot;correct customer concerns&quot; without charge.    Separately, the safety agency opened an investigation into an alleged welding problem in axles produced by Fruehauf Inc.'s Kelsey Hayes Co. subsidiary. The inquiry involves axles used in heavy trucks. No accidents or injuries have been reported in connection with the alleged problem.    Officials of the Detroit-based company didn't respond to a request for comment on the agency's investigation. </TEXT></DOC>
