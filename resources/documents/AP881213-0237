On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract forwholesale heating oil settled at 50.20 cents a gallon, up 0.70 cent,after having risen 1.42 cents on Friday.   The blast of arctic air _ which set low-temperature records insome areas _ also lent support to crude oil futures, analysts said.   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude, settled at $16.06 a 42-gallon barrel, up 22cents from Friday, when it gained 40 cents.   It was the first time crude prices have closed above $16 sinceOPEC members reached a new production agreement late last month.   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries signed a newagreement in November setting a daily production quota of 18.5million barrels and a benchmark price of $18 a barrel. The newagreement, which would lower the cartel's production from more than22 million barrels, is to go into effect Jan. 1.   Analysts said volume was thin in one of the quietest sessions inmonths.   ``Prices should hold firm until we get more news, or hear morefrom OPEC about how much they're producing or if they're cheating,and we won't know for another month,'' said Dave Kaplan, manager ofenergy options for Elders Futures Inc.   January unleaded gasoline, which gained 0.53 cents on Friday,fell 0.26 to 44.20 cents a gallon Monday.   Analysts said gasoline stocks have risen in the last few weeksand investors expect to see a bigger increase on Tuesday when theAmerican Petroleum Institute releases its weekly statistics onenergy supplies.</TEXT></DOC>
