All the data presentedin the report are retrieved from existing literature or are known tobe used in the field. The compiled data on the alternatives to sedimentionponds are to serve as a basis for identification of the most-suitableerosion and sediment-control technology for individual mining sites.The sediment-control technologies are subdivided into six major groups,each of which addresses one functional element of the overall sedimentand erosion-control framework.</TEXT></DOC>
