The Sandinista government reported renewed fighting in eightprovinces, especially near the Honduran border. A rebel source saidhundreds of rebels were retreating back to Honduras, where they arebased.   The proposed talks at U.N. headquarters in New York would be thefirst between the government and the rebels in more than a year. OnFriday, U.N. officials said the meeting was set for Monday andTuesday.   The rebels, however, said they wouldn't attend because oflogistical problems and proposed a week's postponement until Nov.13.   A rebel spokesman also said the Contras will not disband untilthey are satisfied Nicaragua has moved far enough toward democracy.   President Daniel Ortega, who proposed the meeting when heannounced the end of a 19-month-old cease-fire this week, said hewanted a delay, but only until Thursday and Friday. Ortega iscalling for disbanding the rebels, and he has insisted thatHonduras take part in the meeting.   Honduras, which had declined the invitation Wednesday, refusedagain on Friday.   ``The problem of the anti-Sandinista rebels is Nicaragua's,''Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras said late Friday.``It is a conflict among Nicaraguans.''   In Nicaragua, Soviet-made helicopters airlifted Sandinistatroops into remote mountains and jungles for strikes against therebels. Defense Ministry sources reported fighting in eightprovinces, especially in the north near the Honduran border. AMinistry source said there were about 3,000 rebels in the area.   A rebel source in Costa Rica said hundreds of rebel fighterswere retreating back to camps in Honduras.   ``Our soldiers scarcely have any ammunition and can't confrontan army as powerful as the Sandinistas that is using all of itsforce to annihilate us,'' the source said on condition of anonymity.   He said fighters remaining in Nicaragua had been ordered to takecover.   However, Nicaraguan army Col. Manuel Salvatierra, commander oftroops in the northern provinces of Jinotega and Matagalpa, saidthe rebels ``have all they need to fight.''   ``The Contras ... are not so stupid as to infiltrate the countrywithout weapons and without ammunition,'' Salvatierra said inMatagalpa.   He said rebels had kept weapons sent before the United Statescut off shipments in February 1988. Non-lethal aid, such as bootsand uniforms, continues.   A hospital official in Jinotega, 100 miles northeast of Managua,said 14 soldiers had been treated there for battle wounds this week.   Reporters saw soldiers with wounds from grenade shrapnel andmortars fired by retreating rebels.   Ortega, announcing Wednesday that the government was ending itsunilateral cease-fire, said 1,100 guerrillas had infiltratedNicaragua over the past three weeks.   He asked for the meeting to discuss demobilizing the Contrasunder an Aug. 7 regional peace plan. That plan sets a Dec. 5deadline for the rebels to disband.   The rebels had agreed in principle to attend the meeting. But ina letter Friday to a commission sponsored by the United Nations andthe Organization of American States they said they could not attendnext week because they did ``not have enough time to make thelogistic arrangements.''   The letter to the International Commission for Verification andSupport was released in Honduras.   The Contras also proposed a three-point agenda: a cease-fire byboth sides with verification, an amnesty by the Sandinistagovernment, and rebel visits to Nicaragua to verify steps to allowtheir return.   ``The date proposed by Ortega is a strategy of his politicalparty to take us off guard,'' Wilfredo Montalvan, a Contra rebeldirector, said in San Jose, Costa Rica.   ``And if Ortega thinks the only thing that is going to bediscussed there is the unconditional surrender of our troops, heshould forget that, since he is very wrong,'' he added. ``Ourdemobilization is voluntary and will (occur) when you can observethat Nicaragua is taking true steps toward the route of democracy.''   Ortega, asked if the only topic of the talks would bedemobilization, responded: ``Depending on how the demobilizationagreement progresses, we will be willing to reconsider thecease-fire.''   Officials from the Organization of American States and theUnited Nations are to mediate the meeting, U.N. spokesman FrancoisGiuliani said Friday.   Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo of Nicaragua alsohas agreed to attend.</TEXT></DOC>
