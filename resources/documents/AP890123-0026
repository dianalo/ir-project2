The adviser, Robert C. McFarlane, was quoted in Monday's editionsof The New York Times as saying that although Vice President Bushrarely expressed an opinion at such meetings, he supported McFarlanein urging that the arms shipments be stopped.   ``I was struck that he had intervened,'' McFarlane told TheTimes. ``That seemed a little bit unusual to me, and I was pleasedthat he had.''   McFarlane advised Reagan to end the shipments because theoperation was not fulfilling its original purpose of ``makingcontact with Iranians able to change policy,'' McFarlane told TheTimes.   The former adviser said that later in the meeting, Bush ``noddedand was kind of pensive and looked over toward the president andsaid, `I think Bud's probably right,'' according to The Times.   Bud is McFarlane's nickname.   Bush has acknowledged that he knew of the arms sales to Iran aspart of attempts to gain freedom for American hostages, but said hewas unaware of the diversion of profits from the sales to NicaraguanContras.   His role in the Iran-Contra affair has remained largely amystery, although he has insisted that he expressed ``certainreservations'' about the weapons shipment in private conversationswith Reagan.   Bush, who led a presidential task force on terrorism, has triedto minimize his involvement in the Iran arms sale. He claimed he was``out of the loop'' in making major policy decisions.   McFarlane's statements are not supported by the reports ofCongressional investigators and others who have studied theIran-contra affair, including the diversion of the profits from theweapons sales to help the rebels in Nicaragua. Other sources haveindicated that Bush was not even present at the December meetingdescribed by McFarlane, The Times said.   The reports offer no strong evidence to indicate that Bush urgedReagan to end the arms shipments.   McFarlane, who attempted suicide after his role in theIran-contra affair became known, is awaiting sentencing on hisguilty plea to harges that he withheld information from Congressabout the shipments.   Whatever Bush's reservations, the shipment of American weaponsand spare parts to Iran continued into the fall of 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
