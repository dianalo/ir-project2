Farid Sulaimani, spokesman of the Mujahedeen Khalq, or People'sHoly Warriors, told The Associated Press in a telephone interviewthat the movement's military wing, the National Liberation Army ofIran, was on maximum alert at its bases along the border.   But there was no immediate indication that the rebels, Iran'smain opposition group, planned any military action during thepolitical uncertainty in Iran following Khomeini's death Saturday.   Any military move would have to be with Iraqi approval. It wasnot thought likely that Baghdad would permit any action that wouldjeopardize its 10-month-old truce in the war with Iran.   Sulaimani declined comment on what moves the Mujahedeen may beplanning.   ``We're continuing our vigilance and closely monitoring thesituation in Iran after Khomeini's death,'' he said.   ``Great joy prevailed in our bases along the border, and all ourfighters expressed readiness to move in when the appropriate momentcomes,'' he reported.   Suliamani said the Mujahedeen would have preferred to seeKhomeini live until they overthrew him and put him on trial ``forthe crimes he committed against the Iranian people.   ``But now he's gone, what remains is the overthrow of hisregime,'' he declared.   He said the opposition movement was optimistic Khomeini's deathwill pave the way for ``a free, democratic and stable Iran.''   The rebel army, which has an estimated 20,000 fighters, has beenon alert since Tehran announced Khomeini had undergone surgery tostop intenstinal bleeding.   Mujahedeen leader Massoud Rajavi, in a statement issued Sundayin Baghdad, called on Iranians to ``confront the illegitimateremnants of the Khomeini regime by all available means to prepare ... for the final eradicating blow to the criminal executioners anduntil the appropriate time for the National Liberation Army to movein.''   He said Khomeini's death signals the collapse of the cleric-ledTehran government.   ``This is a very important turning point,'' he said. ``Iran isnow in a state of extreme agitation.''   Military and political analysts do not believe the rebel army isstrong enough to topple the Tehran government alone.   But if a power struggle emerges in the post-Khomeini era, asmany analysts have predicted, the rebels might be able to tip thebalance between the rival factions.   Khomeini's March 28 dismissal of his designated successor,Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri, was largely because of Montazeri'ssympathy for the opposition movement.   The rebel army fought alongside the Iraqis against Iran duringthe eight-year Persian Gulf war, which ended with a tentative trucein August. The two nations still are deadlocked on terms of apermanent peace accord.   Weeks before the cease-fire, the rebel army launched its biggestoperation into western Iran, reaching 90 miles inside the Islamicrepublic before withdrawing.   Iran claimed the rebels were driven back with heavy losses.Still, the raid so deep inside Iran alarmed Tehran.   Mujahedeen officials have said that since the cease-fire, theirarmy's strength has increased considerably and months of intensivetraining in Iraq have forged it into ``a far more effectivemilitary force than it was before.''   The Mujahedeen were allied with Khomeini in the struggle totopple the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.   But radicals turned on the Mujahedeen and other liberal factionsin 1980-81, killing and imprisoning tens of thousands of people.</TEXT></DOC>
