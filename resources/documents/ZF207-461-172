 401 on Reader Service CardandM;When a network consists of PCs and VAXes, it doesn't make sense to buyseparate PC file servers.andP;  Most users find it much more efficient to let theVAXes act as file servers.andP;  That way, PC users can take advantage ofVAX-based disk drives, whose storage capacity is virtually unlimited.andM;Users in the market for file server software for their PCs will find that theRemote Access Facility (RAF) from Datability Software Systems is far moresophisticated than a simple file server: Besides providing file serversoftware, it also integrates the PC and the VAX.andM;With RAF, PC users can execute VAX applications and use VAX printers as ifthey were the PC's own.andP;  RAF also has a remarkable help facility that lets asystem manager input data into a user's PC from another PC, just as if thesystem manager were tackling the problem at the source.andM;OPERATION MODESandM;We evaluated RAF version 2.0 operating over Ethernet.andP;  We used a Micro VAX IIrunning VMS version 4.7 and an IBM PC XT running DOS version 3.30 with 640KBof memory and an EGA video card.andP;  To connect our PC to Ethernet, we used theMicom-Interlan NI5210-16 Ethernet board from Racal Interlan Systems.andM;The Remote Access Facility consists of two basis parts: terminate-and-stayresident software on the PC (called RAF) and software on the VAX (calledRAFPC).andM;Although the VAX and PC software are separate, the PC-based software caninitiate communication with the software on the VAX, join with it and extendthe PC's capabilities to include many features that users find on their VAX.andM;These two pieces of software run in three modes.andM;In Isolated Mode, the two parts of RAF aren't communicating; RAF isessentially inactive.andP;  Here the PC can access only those files stored on itswn hard or floppy disk drives; neither the RAF software on the VAX nor thaton the PC is active.andM;In Direct Access Terminal Mode, the RAF terminal emulator is activated,allowing the PC to emulate a VT52, VT100 or VT220 terminal.andP;  The current PCprocess is suspended.andP;  Activated by a &quot;hot-key&quot; combination (the default isandless;Controlandgt; andless;Shiftandgt; D), RAF's Terminal Mode can be used to activate RAFPC or toallow the PC to do anything that a VAX terminal can do.andM;In Combined Mode, RAFPC and RAF are active and joined, and all of RAF'sfacilities are available.andP;  Combined Mode allows the PC user to access as manyas 16 VAX-based file servers, as many as four of the VAX's printers andnearly all of the VAX's applications.andP;  In Combined Mode, the user's currentPC process remains active.andM;Users can enter RAF's Combined Mode either manually or automatically.andP;  Toenter Combined Mode manually, users invoke the terminal emulator with thehot-key sequence, start RAFPC on the VAX and return to the PC.andP;  Users canalso access Combined Mode automatically, performing all of these stepssimultaneously, right from DOS.andM;Manual access is uncomplicated.andP;  Using a direct Ethernet connection, the usertypes the hot-key sequence to activate the terminal emulator, causing RAF'sTerminal Service screen to appear.andP;  This screen is used to tell RAF whichhost to connect to, because the Ethernet connection allows multipleconnections to multiple hosts.andM;The RAF Terminal Server screen uses commands that will be familiar to usersaccustomed to other Local Area Transport terminal servers: CONNECT,DISCONNECT, SHOW SESSIONS and HELP, to mention a few (Fig.andP;  1).andP;  There is noneed for the SHOW SERVICS and SHOW NODES commands, because the RAF TerminalServer screen displays the available hosts in a box above as prompt wheneverit is active.andM;Because the RAF Terminal Server uses LAT, no special communications softwareis required on the VAX except the file server software.andP;  By typing CONNECTfollowed by the name of one of the available nodes, the PC user can connectto that node just as a VAX user would connect to a node via a DECserverterminal server.andP;  Like the DECserver, RAF allows a user to have as many assix simultaneous sessions.andM;Once the user has logged in to the host, issuing the command RUN RAF:RAFPC atthe DCL prompt will activate RAFPC.andP;  Pressing andless;F9andgt; on the PC keyboard willalso issue this command.andP;  The user then types the hot-key sequence to returnto the PC.andP;  RAF is now fully active and in Combined Mode.andP;  To log outmanually, the user needs to return to the terminal emulator, stop RAFPC bytyping andless;Controlandgt; C six times and then type LOGOUT.andM;Users who access Combined Mode automatically don't have to be familiar withthe workings of the terminal emulator or with any VAX commands.andP;  Instead,users are simply prompted to provide their usernames and passwords.andM;To automate the manual steps, RAF includes two utilities, Login and Logout,which are activated from DOS and then call &quot;conversation files.&quot;andO;Conversation files are scripts containing information that the Login andLogout utilities use to determine what to do.andP;  RAF comes with twoconversation files: RAF-VAX.CNV and RAF-HAYES.CNV.andM;The first conversation file, RAFVAX.CNV, is good for logging directly in to aVAX through a direct Ethernet connection, a Hayes-compatible modem, a directasynchroncus connection or a DEC terminal server.andP;  The second file,RAFHAYES.-CNV, can be used with a Hayes-compatible modem to access, but notfully log in to, a host system.andM;The user can modify these conversation files to suit individual needs or caneven create new conversation files in any editor capable of producing ASCIItext files.andP;  For example, a user could write a conversation file that wouldaccess Dow Jones' on-line news service, extract data to a file and then logout.andM;Both manual access and automatic access make use of the RAF terminalemulator.andP;  When users access Combined Mode automatically, the terminalemulator is hidden.andP;  Manual access brings users into direct contact with theterminal emulator.andM;The terminal emulator offers true 132-column support (with EGA, VGA, Herculesand STB Chauffeur video cards) and support for all VT220 character setsexcept double-high, double-wide and underlined characters.andP;  According toDatability representatives, a new release of RAF, due this summer, shouldinclude support for these characters.andM;Version 2.0 represents double-wide characters by placing an extra spacebetween all letters.andP;  For double-high characters, it ignores the escapecodes, printing two identical lines of text--the two lines of text thatcompose a double-high image--one above the other.andP;  The EGA card in the PCcan't print underlined characters without entering graphics mode, so the RAFTerminal Emulator displays underlining in a different color (Fig.andP;  2).andM;Although RAF provides excellent terminal emulation, its most impressivecapabilities appear in Combined Mode.andP;  This mode offers file servers, remoteprinting capabilities and more.andP;  It is important to note when the PC is inCombined Mode, it receives broadcast messages from the VAX.andP;  Thus, if thesystem is going to be shut down, the PC user will receive a broadcast messagefrom System warning them that this will happen.andM;In Combined Mode, the user can access as many as 16 file servers, whichappear as drives D: through S: (assuming the user's own PC drives are labeledA:, B: and C:).andP;  We found these file servers incredibly fast, sometimesoutperforming the two internal hard drives in our IBM PC XT.andM;At first, all root directories on the remote disks are defined as being inthe current directory on the VAX, but this can be changed very easily.andP;  Toredefine the root directory of a remote drive, users should enter the DOS CDcommand using an RMS path syntax.andP;  For example, the command CD E:DUA0:[SYS$MANAGER.TESTS] sets the root directory of drive E: toDUA0:[SYS$MANAGER.TESTS] on the VAX disk.andM;Using the DOS CD command with DOS syntax on the file servers, users canchange the current directory to a subdirectory but cannot change the currentroot directory.andM;When we began to use RAF's file servers, we immediately noticed how fast theyare (Fig.andP;  3).andP;  To test their speed, we copied two text files and one PCbinary file--the PC word processing program WordPerfect--between the PC'sinternal hard disk and one or the file server volumes.andP;  We then timed howlong it look to boot WordPerfect from the file server.andP;  Finally, we bootedWordPerfect from the PC's hard drive and timed how long it took to read afile off the file server into WordPerfect.andM;We called our file transfer tests Send 1 (sending a 204,317-byte text filefrom our PC to the VAX), Send 2 (doing the same for a 14,595-byte text file)and Receive WP (doing the same for the 244,376-byte PC binary file that isWordPerfect).andP;  The tests that received those three files from the VAX to ourPC we called Receive 1, Receive 2 and Receive WP.andM;The test that involved booting WordPerfect from the VAX we called Start WP,and loading a large document file from the VAX into WordPerfect running onthe PC we called Load WP.andP;  The file we read into WordPerfect was a copy ofthe 204,317-byte text file that had been converted into WordPerfect format.andM;Not only was RAF up to fve times faster than its competitor, Mobius from FelComputing, it was even faster than the PC's internal hard drives for someoperations.andP;  (For a review of Mobius, see &quot;The Zen of Connectivity: JoiningPC to VAX,&quot; Digital Review, June 12, page 33.)andM;For example, on our Receive 1 test, RAF took 6.43 seconds, Mobius took 33.97seconds and the PC took 7.93 seconds to transfer the 204,317-byte text filebetween its two internal hard disks.andP;  That makes RAF not only 5.3 timesfaster than Mobius, but also 1.2 times faster than the PC.andM;Because they are so fast and can be so large, RAF's file servers provide anexcellent place to back up PC files.andP;  RAF includes Dumper, a backup utility,to do just that.andP;  The Dumper utility provides a fast, efficient way to backup from a PC to a file server or between file servers.andM;The utility allows incremental and full (image) backups.andP;  Both theincremental and image backup options allow the user to exclude specificfiles, to log in and log out automatically, and to specify the time when thebackup will start.andM;VAX ACCESSandM;Providing file servers is only one of the benefits that RAF offers inCombined Mode.andP;  In addition, RAF's Remote utility gives the PC access toVAX-based programs and printers.andM;With RAF there are two ways to run VAX programs from the PC.andP;  One way is toenter the terminal emulator, connect to the VAX, then run the programs fromthere.andP;  The Remote utility, on the other hand, allows users to run hostprograms and commands from the DOS prompt while still in Combined Mode.andP;  Theutility enters the terminal emulator, temporarily suspends RAFPC (putting itinto Suspended Access Terminal Mode), executes the command on the VAX,restarts RAFPC and then returns to the PC, all automatically.andM;For example, entering the PC command REMOTE DIR lists the current activedirectory on the VAX.andP;  Entering the command REMOTE WP runs WordPerfect on theVAX.andM;In addition, the Remote utility can be used to create programs on the PC thatexecute host programs or commands.andP;  For example, the command REMOTE MAIL&quot;MAIL&quot; generates the PC program MAIL.COM.andP;  When executed from the DOS prompt,this program invokes the VMS Mail utility on the VAX.andM;The Remote utility also works with qualifiers that extend its usefulnessfurther.andP;  For example, it can be used to define host printers to be used aslocal printers.andM;MS-DOS defines three printers to be available to the user: LPT1:, LPT2: andLPT3:.andP;  RAF adds another, LPT4:.andP;  Using the REMOTE command with the /PRINT =qualifier, the user can define any host printer to be used as one of theseLPT printers.andM;For example, the command REMOTE /PRINT=2 /NOTIFY /QUEUE=LN03 would define thelocal printer LPT2: so that when the user issues the DOS PRINT command andspecifies LTP2:, the file to be printed is copied to a temporary file on theVAX.andP;  This file will then be released to the VAX print queue LN03 when theuser enters REMOTE/CLOSE.andM;Currently, only text files can be printed with any consistency when printingPC-based files on VAX printers, but RAF can print such files on virtually anyVAX printer.andM;The RAF Menu utility can help simplify RAF usage.andP;  Once a user has set up acomfortable working environment, customizing the PC as desired, that user cancreate a menu that will eliminate the need to use any DOS or VMS commands.andM;The utility uses instructions stored in a data file to create a full-screenmenu that can launch remote and local applications, log in to or out of ahost or even print documents.andP;  In terms of the end user's learning speed,this utility places RAF in a league by itself.andP;  A user need no longer learnDOS or VMS; the RAF Menu utility can be loaded at start-up, allowing the userto interact entirely with simple, menu-driven commands.andM;GOT A PROBLEM?andM;RAF's PC Advise utility really sets this software apart from the competition.andO;Like the RAF Menu utility, the PC Advise utility helps make users' lives alittle easier.andM;The PC Advise utility is a RAF facility that allows one PC user to get helpfrom another.andP;  Using this utility is like having two monitors and twokeyboards connected to a single CPU.andP;  The utility can be used any time theuser can reach the RAF terminal server prompt, from either a VAX or a PCapplication.andM;When the utility is activated, the adviser's PC screen is continuouslyupdated over Ethernet to look exactly like the advisee's PC screen.andP;  By thesame token, anything the adviser types is sent to the adviseehs screen asthough the advisee had typed it.andP;  A system manager can thus show a user howto do something without actually having to sit at the user's PC.andM;Because the PC Advise utility allows one user to tamper with another's PC orVAX account, it is protected with certain security measures.andP;  To &quot;advise&quot;another PC, the adviser must know the advisee's network name and password.andO;When the correct network name and password are entered, the PC Advise utilityimmediately forgets them to prevent other users from linking with theadvisee's PC.andM;Two situations can cause problems with the PC Advise utility.andM;The first problem that can occur is if a program reads keyboard inputdirectly from the keyboard instead of through the PC's BIOS, the adviserwon't be able to use the utility to send keyboard input to the advisee's PC.andO;Although the adviser's screen will be updated to reflect the advisee's, inputfrom the adviser will be impossible.andP;  However, it is very rare for anyprogram to read keyboard input directly from the keyboard, so this problemshould not arise too often.andM;The second problem appears in graphics mode.andP;  There are four primary types ofPC graphics cards on the market: EGA, CGA, Hercules and VGA.andP;  When theadvisee's PC enters a graphics mode that isn't supported by the card in theadviser's PC, the screen image on the adviser's PC may not properly reflectthe advisee's screen image.andP;  The PC Advise utility supports black-and-whiteto color conversion.andM;We experienced some trouble owing to a variant of this latter problem.andP;  Inaddition to our first IBM PC XT, we set up another XT running DOS version3.30 with an Excelan EXOS205 Ethernet card, a CGA video card and 640KB ofmemory.andP;  We initiated the PC Advise utility from this second machine, and itworked flawlessly until we exited.andM;To exit the utility, either user must depress both of the keyboard's Shiftkeys simultaneously.andP;  Either user should then be able to answer YES or NO toa confirming prompt.andP;  When we exited the utility by depressing both Shiftkeys on the adviser machine (the IBM PC XT) and answering YES to the prompton the advisee machine (the IBM PC), the XT exited perfectly but the PCdisplayed meaningless color characters and crashed.andP;  Datability officialswere unable to explain the problem, except to suggest that it might have beencaused by our use of different video or Ethernet cards on the two PCs.andM;INSTALLATIONandM;Users install RAF on the VAX using the standard VMSINSTAL command procedure.andO;The entire process takes about 25 minutes.andP;  However, the system manager'spresence is required for only about five of those 25 minutes.andP;  The systemmanager is needed to specify only three things: the target directory forRAFPC; whether asynchronous, Ethernet or both types of communication will beused; and the node name of the host node.andM;RAF's PC installation is more complicated.andP;  Users install RAF on their PCusing INSTALL.EXE, a program that comes on the RAF Master Diskette.andP;  Inaddition to the node names, the user must know their PC's video card type,monitor type, Ethernet card type, the base address of the Ethernet card, theInterrupt level of the Ethernet card and the memory segment that the Ethernetcard occupies.andP;  RAF supports virtually every PC Ethernet card made, includingthose made by Racal Interlan, Ungermann-Bass, Excelan and DEC.andM;The copy protection of RAF system files ensures that they will becomeinoperable if they are copied or moved using standard DOS commands.andP;  In fact,if a hard disk on which RAF is installed is defragmented without first&quot;de-installing&quot; RAF, RAF will cease to function.andM;INSTALL.EXE not only installs RAF on the PC, it also de-installs it.andP;  On topof that, it allows the user to modify virtually all settings that wereestablished during the installation, with the exception of the choice ofEthernet card.andM;If a new version of RAF is released users are spared the hassle ofreinstalling it entirely.andP;  Rather than de-installing RAF and then installingthe new version--re-entering the original installation information--the usercan simply run the Update utility.andM;The Update utility updates the PC files with files that are stored on theVAX.andP;  A system manager can therefore update many PCs from one centralsource--the file server.andP;  To update RAF on the PC, the Update utility firstcompares the RAF files currently on the PC with the files replacing them todetermine whether the replacement files are newer.andP;  It then copies the newfiles from the VAX to the PC.andM;Because RAF can be installed and modified in so many ways, it makes sensethat it can occupy varying amounts of high memory.andP;  We originally installedRAF with four services (nodes), six sessions (the number of times a user canbe connected) and 16 devices (file servers).andM;This configuration took up a whopping 202KB of memory on our test PC,including buffer and file settings from the CONFIG.SYS file.andP;  When we reducedthe number of services, sessions, nodes and devices to one and disabled thePC Advise option entirely, we dropped to 178KB of memory--still quite a largeamount.andP;  A new version of RAF due for release this summer has modificationsthat add support for expanded, extended and high memory.andP;  These modificationswill allow RAF to reside in areas of memory that aren't usually accessed byother PC programs.andM;A FINAL WORDandM;All in all, we were extremely impressed with RAF.andP;  Not only is itfull-featured and fast, it is very easy to set up and use, due largely to theclear explanations in the manual.andP;  RAF can be automated so that a PC userneedn't even know DOS: The RAF Menu utility can be executed at start-up, andusers can interact almost entirely with RAF's menus.andM;RAF is available in a variety of configurations for various VAXes.andP;  RAF forMS-DOS-based PCs is priced at $395 per PC, with a bulk rate of $15,000 for 50copies (bringing the per-PC price down to $300).andP;  Additional copies after thefirst 50 are priced at $125 each.andP;  VAX prices for RAF range from $395 for asingle-user license on any VAX to $15,000 plus $5,000 per processor for a VAX8800.andP;  An unlimited-user license for a MicroVAX II is priced at $3,750.andM;RAF provides an excellent solution for PC-to-VAX connectivity problems.andO;Although it lacks the ability to control the PC from the VAX--a featureoffered by its competitor, Mobius--RAF makes up for this with its greaterspeed and ease of use.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
