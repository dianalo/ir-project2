The purpose of the grant is to revise and condensethe CCMA 1981 <T3>Foundary Engineering Study </T3>and<T3> Workbook </T3>into a single <T3>Foundry Industry Energy Conservation Workbook</T3> reflecting the mostrecent foundry energy conservation technology. The practices and technologydiscussed in this revised workbook will be presented to foundry ownersand managers through a series of workshops to be held at six locationsnationwide.This proposed project management has both an affiliation with and understandingof the foundry industry. The CCMA is privy to both the needs of the foundryindustry and the current innovative practices and technologies developedto meet these industry needs. As the prime sponsor of this project CCMAhas obtained the endorsement of the American Cast Metals Association (ACMA),which is the principle national corporate trade association of the metalcasting industry. The ACMA will assist the CCMA with the workshops anddistribution of this workbook to all the operating firms of the metal castingindustry.The <T3>Foundry Energy Conservation Workbook </T3>which will include the mostrecent available foundry energy conservation technology, will representa significant contribution to improved energy efficiency in the PrimaryMetals Industry, SIC 33. This is consistent with the advancement of thepublic purpose of stimulating energy conservation. The objectives of theproposal have a high probability of success because the techniques andtechnology to be provided are based on past successful material developedby these associations and the most recent processes established by theircorporate membership.The proposed award will be funded in fiscal year 1989. The time requiredfor completion of the project (excluding time required for printing the<T3>Workbook</T3> by the DOTE) is seven (7) months. The resulting <T3>Foundry Industry Conservation Workbook</T3> will be distributed tofoundries nationwide. This notice represents the only official notice ofintent on the part of the DOE.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Request for information regarding the proposed assistanceaward and any written inquiries concerning this notice shall be addressedto: Charles J.
