Thenational team had played a three-game exhibition series in Tennessee.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CANSECO BEFRIENDS CUBAN PROSPECT  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Arocha, from Canseco's hometown of Regla, dreams of pitching in the majorleagues. And Canseco evidently has taken him under his wing. Arocha was at theColiseum on Sunday, hanging out with Canseco and hoping for a tryout with theA's.;    But it seems likely a 1977 baseball rule will prohibit teams fromsigning Arocha until he becomes a resident. And he won't be eligible forresidency until he's in this country a year and a day.;    &quot;Does that extendto even working a Cuban national out? Maybe. We're not interested in crossingthe commissioner,&quot; said A's General Manager Sandy Alderson.;    Canseco'sparents left Cuba when he and his twin, Ozzie, were babies, and he identifieswith Arocha.;    &quot;You never know what position you find yourself in. It couldhave been me coming over, trying to look for some kind of asylum in the UnitedStates,&quot; Canseco said. &quot;Myself as a countryman, knowing where he came from,speaking with him in Spanish, him giving me some thoughts of his country, itkind of hits you in the heart and you want to help out.;    &quot;His grandmotherknew my grandmother. Look at him, he even looks like me. A little longer hair.. .&quot;;    It's unclear who is paying Arocha's way. Canseco said, &quot;Financially,hopefully, we can work something out. We've got a group of people in Miamihelping him out.&quot;;    Arocha left his wife and 8-year-old daughter behind inCuba, where he made about $110 a month as a physical education teacher and $25as a national team member.;    Reports about his ability as a pitcher havevaried widely. Mentor Pedro Ramos, a former major league pitcher who is thepitching coach at Miami Dade Community College, says he has Nolan Ryan-likepotential.;    A's director of scouting Dick Bogard was decidedly lukewarm.;   &quot;He just had a mild report on the guy. I think the reports I've read in thepaper were somewhat exaggerated,&quot; said Walt Jocketty, the A's director ofbaseball administration.;    Wearing one of Canseco's caps, Arocha pitched forseven scouts in Miami on Thursday. His fastball was clocked in the low 80s.;   When or if Arocha becomes eligible, his name could be entered in the Juneamateur draft or a special draft could be held for him.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  KIM BOATMAN, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Oakland  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910722  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  446  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday July 22, 199100204050,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
