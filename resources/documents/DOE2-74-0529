The house planned to adopt a air-cycle system hasheat-collectors attached on the walls on the southwestern sides and insidewalls filled up with concrete blocks as regenerators. The system hasno mechanical power such as fans and can be applied to ordinary woodenhouses. The method of heat storage with such regenerators of blocks isan indirect one and the effect was not distinct. The efficiency of heataccumulation with collectors of natural convection amounts up to about45 percent when insolation is sufficient. Attachment of the system couldcut down 16 percent of heating loads. Heat accumulation by this systemmay become more effective when it has more heat-collectors and more insolation,but it is necessary to consider its efficiency.
