A major biologicalcharacteristic of germ-cell tumours is the fact that they produce tumourmarkers. Meaningful therapy planning is determined by the biologicalbehaviour of the individual tumour entity which is strongly influencedby its intracranial localization. Important risk factors need to be identifiedand weighted according to previous treatment in order to arrive at anadequate therapy with improved curative prospects. Three risk areas canbe defined for tumour extension. Therapy planning is also determinedby the metastatic spread behaviour of germ-cell tumours. Within the twotherapy studies for nontesticular germ-cell tumours MAKEI 83 and 86,a total of 180 germ-cell tumours, 24 of which were localized intercranially,were reported from 46 different clinics. All patients have a survivalprobability according to Kaplan and Meier of 67 +- 10% at an observationduration of 48 months.</TEXT></DOC>
