In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Eugene D. Fanning, chairman of Fanning Cadillac Inc., a Chicago car dealership, said that his lawyer, Albert I. Edelman of New York, had &quot;approached a significant New England financial institution,&quot; and found it had &quot;serious interest in being allowed to explore. . .the prospect of acquisition.&quot; He declined to identify the institution.    Society, in a prepared statement, said that Mr. Fanning appeared to be acting in his own interest and that such actions aren't &quot;in the best interest of the company and its shareholders generally.&quot;    Mr. Fanning said that he was making the disclosure &quot;for the purpose of interesting or persuading management and the board for Society for Savings of the benefits and opportunity for shareholders in the prompt pursuit of such a sale opportunity.&quot;    Mr. Fanning owns 175,100, or 1.62%, of Society's shares. The stock was acquired during the past 18 months at an average cost of $20 a share. Yesterday, Society's shares closed in over-the-counter trading at $18.25, up $1.    Society noted that Mr. Fanning's holdings were &quot;substantially below the 5%&quot; for which an SEC filing is required. &quot;This appears to be an effort by a single shareholder to try to determine for himself the future path of our company,&quot; Society added.    Society, which had $3.5 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, converted in 1984 to stock ownership from mutual ownership. </TEXT></DOC>
