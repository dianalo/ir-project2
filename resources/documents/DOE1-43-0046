Alterations in the chemical composition of the naturalaquatic environment usually effect behavioral and physiological systemsof the inhabitants, particularly of the fish. Although some data areavailable on the effects of different pesticides on the biochemical aspectsof fish gill, data on heptachlor toxicity on T. mossambica kidney arelacking. Therefore, an attempt has been made to observe certain biochemicalparamets of fish, T. mossambica under heptachlor intoxication. Investigationof this nature is useful in understanding the orientation of biochemicalchanges during sublethal toxicity to ascertain the degree of intensityof the toxicity of heptachlor on the kidney.</TEXT></DOC>
