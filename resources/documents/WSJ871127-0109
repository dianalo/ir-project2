Everywhere the company's president looked, gloomy employees were toting up their losses on company stock, which had dropped 26% that day.    But Chairman J.B. Fuqua, who stood to lose the most of all -- about $12 million -- was unperturbed. &quot;Well, the market's having a little downturn,&quot; he told W. Clay Hamner, a company director, as they talked on the phone. &quot;I think I'll go home early.&quot;    But if he initially feigned indifference, Mr. Fuqua and his aides in the next few days were indefatigable. They moved to sell a bank subsidiary. They decided to buy back a big chunk of the company's stock. They began to dust off their files for acquisition targets. J.B. Fuqua, the last of the old-time conglomerateurs, was reinventing his company again.    &quot;The problem with a lot of chief executives today is courage,&quot; says the 69-year-old Mr. Fuqua. &quot;You've got a generation that doesn't have the guts to make a decision.&quot; He, however, has created a quicksilver company, adaptable to very different times. In the 1970s, Mr. Fuqua built a sprawling $2 billion conglomerate. In the '80s, he slimmed it to one-third that size, turning it into a focused consumer products company, and he got out of oil and trucking before those industries were roiled.    That doesn't mean Fuqua Industries is home free. The company's new strategy depends on fetching a good price for the bank and setting the right price for its stock buy-back. Its consumer businesses could suffer if consumer spending slows. Its actions could attract takeover vultures. And Mr. Fuqua had surgery for heart disease in September, raising questions about how long he can keep going.    Not that he's a one-man band. Mr. Fuqua has a guiding principle called &quot;OPBOPM,&quot; which involves using &quot;other people's brains, other people's money.&quot; That means he has surrounded himself with talented executives, top among them being Mr. Klamon, who is also chief operating officer.    Mr. Klamon was out jogging the night after Black Monday, thinking about the calls he had gotten all day from people asking why Fuqua hadn't joined the parade of companies announcing stock buybacks. Most had just been small efforts to prop up stock prices, and it struck him that was what was wrong with them. &quot;I was thinking, 'Instead of nibbling the bullet, let's bite it,'&quot; Mr. Klamon recalls.    He said as much the next day to Mr. Fuqua, who was thinking along the same lines. They had already been considering unloading Georgia Federal Bank, a thrift institution the company had bought only early last year. The bank was doing well, accounting for one-third of profits, but that was the problem: Investors are wary of thrifts, and the market accords their earnings a lower multiple. Further, a new accounting rule would force the parent to consolidate the bank's books with its own. The consolidation would badly skew Fuqua's balance sheet and deepen its identity crisis with investors.    They had thought of spinning off the bank to shareholders. The tax bite would prove too onerous. They had thought of keeping the bank and spinning off all the company's other businesses, though in such a way as to maintain control. &quot;Too cute,&quot; they decided. Or they could simply sell Georgia Federal and put the proceeds into buying something. But, before Black Monday, the question was: &quot;What?&quot; Says Mr. Klamon: &quot;The market drop helped complete the equation.&quot;    In theory, the equation would work like this: Fuqua could sell the bank for $350 million, net $300 million for itself and, if its stock was still selling in the depressed mid-$20 range, use the cash to buy back about 10 million shares at $30 each. That would be about 45% of its shares. With so much less stock outstanding and with good profits from remaining operations, Fuqua could about equal its current per-share earnings. And, as the theory goes, without the bank the same earnings would command a higher stock price.    Two days after Black Monday, Fuqua had a previously scheduled meeting with First Boston Corp. to talk about the possible bank sale. The company doesn't generally use investment bankers because Mr. Fuqua likes to personally eyeball a buyer or seller and do his own dickering. But it wanted to use one this time to create an auction atmosphere, because Georgia's biggest, most profitable thrift would be a plum franchise for an out-of-state bank or cash-laden insurance company. Fuqua retained First Boston on the spot and was ready to roll. &quot;By Thursday morning, we knew what we wanted to do,&quot; Mr. Klamon recalls. &quot;We were going to change the capital structure of the company.&quot;    On the next Monday, Fuqua announced it was considering this &quot;major restructuring.&quot; Mr. Klamon flew to New York to meet with analysts and institutional investors Tuesday and explain the plan. The idea seemed to go over well. &quot;It looks like a no-lose situation, and that's rare these days,&quot; says Sidney Heller, a Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst who was host for one of the meetings.    Fuqua stock had been trading in the $32-to-$36 range shortly before the crash and closed at $21.25 a share Oct. 20, the day after. Wednesday, Fuqua stock closed at $27, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    At Fuqua's annual meeting of the company's operating managers a couple of weeks after the crash, the bad news in the market undercut an otherwise bright picture. Mr. Klamon even congratulated the managers on the heady climb of the company's shares, marked on a chart. &quot;Of course, I adroitly cut this off in the middle of September,&quot; he said to nervous laughter.    Indeed, Fuqua's operating profit rose 23% in the first nine months. And most of the company's executives say they aren't worried about a downturn. &quot;Grass gotta grow,&quot; says Anthony Malizia, chairman of Snapper Power Equipment, who believes his lawn mower and snow blower business is affected more by the weather than the economy. &quot;People keep taking pictures right through any recession,&quot; says D. Carl Hamill, chairman of the Colorcraft Corp. photo-finishing business, whose profit has dropped during only one year since its 1967 acquisition by Fuqua.    But Melvin Marks, who heads one of the sporting goods units, says one of his big retail-chain customers is in a precarious state. Combined with the uncertain state of consumer spending, he says, &quot;That makes us nervous as a long-tailed cat in a roomful of rocking chairs.&quot;    At the meeting, Mr. Klamon asked his managers to pay more attention to 1988 contingency budgets, which project for the effect of any sales drops, and Mr. Fuqua told the managers that if they'll take care of earnings, he'll take care of the balance sheet. He told them, too, not to get down in the mouth about the stock price, though he knows that for many, Fuqua stock accounts for the bulk of their net worth. And he told them he would take time off next year &quot;to charge my batteries.&quot;    Nobody believed the last remark.    From a Virginia farm boy, at the time of the last Great Crash, John Brooks Fuqua grew up to be part-owner of a radio station at age 21 and eventually a full-fledged conglomerateur in the mid-1960s. From his acquisition of a small brick-making company then, he built Fuqua Industries into a conglomerate whose holdings read like the Yellow Pages -- from A (Arizona Valley Development Co.) to Y (Yellow Cab Co. of Louisville). Fuqua reached its apogee as a conglomerate in 1978 by buying an even larger conglomerate.    But Mr. Fuqua saw events moving against two big pieces of the empire. With the advent of trucking deregulation, he spun off the company's trucking unit in 1980. With the energy industry headed for the shoals in 1981, he sold the company's biggest unit, a petroleum distributor. The same year, following an abortive move to take the company private, Fuqua bought back 72% of its shares. That enabled it to reduce itself to its most profitable performers and -- spread, now, over the slimmed-down equity base -- boost per-share earnings. It also gave the company a motto for the '80s: &quot;Less is more.&quot;    Mr. Fuqua was something of a voyeur at the merger-mania orgy. He sold still more companies into the bull market, passed up others as overpriced, and settled for only one major acquisition during the time, Georgia Federal. &quot;Where there's great change, we look at it as opportunity,&quot; says Samuel W. Norwood III, Fuqua's chief acquisitions scout.    Georgia Federal didn't prove an unqualified success. But a business that was bought on the cheap for $220 million may well be sold for at least $350 million, and it's gotten Fuqua back into motion. Mr. Klamon is huddling with First Boston these days, Mr. Norwood is studying acquisition prospects, and Mr. Fuqua himself has little spare time to philosophize. &quot;If you do something, you have a 50-50 chance of being right,&quot; he says. &quot;If you do nothing, the world passes you by.&quot;    ---                       The Slimmer Fuqua                 (Dollar amounts in millions)                                       1980        1987* Operating companies                   18          6 Revenue                               $1,590      $760 Net income                            $31**       $65 Total assets                          $864        $736 Stockholders' equity                  $292        $309 Average number of shares***           51.6        22 (in millions)   *Estimate   **Income from continuing operations   ***Restated for splits</TEXT></DOC>
