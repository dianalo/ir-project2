Learned of the University of Hawaii, the scientificdirector of the project. &quot;That's what makes science exciting.&quot;;    The $10million neutrino telescope, first planned in 1975, only recently receivedconstruction funds from an international consortium.;    Called the DeepUnderwater Muon and Neutrino Detector (DUMAND), it will be built just abovethe ocean floor 18 miles west of the island of Hawaii. This thick sheet ofwater will act as a filter to block unwanted high-energy particles penetratingthe atmosphere that would otherwise mask the neutrino signals of interest.;   Even two miles of water do not offer enough shielding to block all unwantedparticles, and for this reason, DUMAND looks down rather than up, observingonly those particles that manage to fly all the way through the Earth andemerge from the ocean floor. Only neutrinos can do this.;    These ghostlyparticles, which travel at a speed close to that of light, have astonishingpenetration power.;    A typical neutrino might traverse the entire universe,zipping through stars, planets and galaxies without ever encountering anythingto stop or deflect it.;    Learned said that by 1993 DUMAND would be ready tostart compiling a &quot;sky map&quot; of neutrino sources comparable to existing skymaps made by large optical and radio telescopes.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910723  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  323  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday July 23, 199100205214,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
