But most other prices were little changed in moderate trading that masked a continuing market rotation away from shares that benefit from disinflation and into cyclical industry stocks.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, moving little through the day, ended at 2329.68, up 7.08. The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index and the New York Stock Exchange index both rose fractionally, but Big Board decliners outnumbered gainers 838 to 760, as volume rose to 170,970,000 shares from Tuesday's 155,320,000.    Heavy buying of Allegis stock sent its price up 1 7/8 to 69 5/8 on volume of more than 6.7 million shares, tops on the Big Board. There were various reports, all unconfirmed, that a number of corporate raiders were accumulating the stock, in spite of Tuesday's move by Allegis in agreeing to issue a large note to Boeing in connection with a $1.5 billion aircraft order that would be convertible into as much as a 16% stake in Allegis.    Some Wall Street speculators suggested that Boeing might not want to convert the note and that the move to issue amounted to little more than a bluff by Allegis. However &quot;the rumors are proxy fight, not takeover,&quot; said one takeover stock speculator.    The flurry in Allegis, as well as some investors' bets that airlines will be among the first to benefit from a strengthening economy, helped a number of such issues to post strong gains and the Dow Jones Transportation Average to rise 10.62 to a record 967.49, or nearly three points beyond the prior mark of 964.64, set exactly a week before.    Delta Air Lines rose 2 to 53, Northwest Air Lines 2 1/2 to 65 7/8 and Trans World Airlines 1 to 28 1/4. Smaller gains were posted by USAir, up 3/8 to 44 1/8, and AMR, up 5/8 to 57 1/8.    While some traders said they hope that the U.S. trade deficit figures to be released by the government this morning will shed some light on prospects for the dollar and interest rates, nobody was betting against thin, choppy trading conditions continuing indefinitely in the stock market.    &quot;That's about the right environment for investors who haven't already done so to start switching their focus to the long-term,&quot; said Edward P. Nicoski, market strategist at Piper Jaffray andamp; Hopwood in Minneapolis.    &quot;There's been a rotation quietly under way for several months now away from such disinflation stocks as utilities, bank and other financial services issues and food stocks and into cyclical issues,&quot; Mr. Nicoski noted. He said the latter include high-quality oil, lumber, chemical, mining and drug issues and such technology issues as computer hardware and software and semiconductor stocks.    A move into cyclicals seems justified to John R. Groome, who directs investment research at Horizon Trust in Morristown, N.J. Mr. Groome said that first-quarter earnings have met, and often exceeded, analysts' expectations. He added that these earnings are particularly high quality and mainly reflect cost benefits of corporate restructurings, rather than inventory profits from inflation.    A close look at sector trading yesterday seems to confirm the market rotation Messrs. Nicoski and Groome detect, with investors slipping out of electric utility as well as an array of financial services issues and moving in to buy high-quality oil, drug, chemicals, paper and mining issues.    Thus, among oil issues yesterday, Atlantic Richfield rose 2 to 93 3/4, Amoco 3/8 to 87 1/2, Royal Dutch Petroleum 5/8 to 128 1/8 and Exxon 1/4 to 90 1/4, all on strong volume. Drug gainers included Squibb, which rose 3 3/4 to 169 1/4, Upjohn 1 1/8 to 43 7/8 and Eli Lilly 1 5/8 to 89 1/2.    Chemical issues gaining ground yesterday included Air Products, which climbed 3/4 to 45 5/8, Dow Chemical 3/4 to 87 and Rohm andamp; Haas 1/2 to 44 1/4.    Paper stock gainers included International Paper, which rose 1 1/2 to 93 1/4, Kimberly-Clark 1 to 107 3/4, Union Camp 3/4 to 61 1/4 and Westvaco 1 to 44 3/8.    Mining issues, too, were broadly ahead, led by Newmont Mining, up 2 1/8 to 103 7/8, and actively traded Amax, which issued almost 18.3 million new shares through First Boston Corp. at $21 each, and still finished up 1/2 at 21 7/8.    Standout computer sector gainers included Compaq Computer, which rose 2 1/4 to 47 5/8, Digital Equipment advanced 1 to 166 1/4 and Apple Computer, up 3 to 78 1/2 in OTC trading.    Among slipping utility stocks, Pennsylvania Power andamp; Light fell 3/8 to 36 1/2, Niagara Mohawk 1/8 to 16 7/8, Northern States Power 1/8 to 32 7/8, Southern California Edison 1/8 to 30 3/8, Texas Utilities 1/8 to 32 1/4 and Utah Power andamp; Light, which also sold $95 million of bonds yestersday, yielding 9.913%, 1/8 to 23 7/8.    Centerior Energy, the Ohio-based combine of Toledo Edison and Cleveland Electric Illuminating, got regulatory approval for a $43 million emergency rate rise yesterday. But the Ohio Public Utilities Commission questioned its dividend policy and the stock fell 1 7/8 to 17 as investors worried that the company's 64-cent quarterly payout may be in jeopardy.    Food issues bucked the trend yesterday, drawing some speculative play based on the huge spurt in General Mills' stock price, which leapt 6 to 51 on turnover of more than 800,000 shares. Traders cited strong, but unconfirmed, rumors that the company is a takeover target of RJR Industries, or possibly Quaker Oats or Nestle.    A General Mills spokesman said the company had no explanation for the price runup and an RJR spokesman, citing company policy, declined to comment on the rumors.    Thus, although they were lower through much of the day, several food issues were gainers by the close. They included Kellogg, which rose 1 1/8 to 58 3/4, Ralston 1 to 80 5/8 and Pillsbury 3/8 to 37 7/8. Hershey, however, fell 1/2 to 25 1/2.    Banks in the losing column included Citicorp, down 3/4 to 53 5/8, Chase Manhattan 5/8 to 37 and Chemical New York 1 to 42 3/4.    Diversified financial stocks losing ground included Household International, which fell 7/8 to 51, Transamerica 1/8 to 33 and American Express also 1/8 to 33.    Insurance losers included Aetna, which slipped 3/8 to 57 3/8, American General 1/2 to 37 1/4, Cigna 3/4 to 60 3/8 and Lincoln National 1/2 to 48 1/4.    GenCorp rose 1 1/8 to 104 1/2, partly on a European newspaper report that German tire maker Continental Gummi-Werke, is considering making an offer for GenCorp's General Tire subsidiary.    Seagate Technology soared 2 3/4 to 44 as investors continued to react to an unconfirmed report that the company is to supply two new computer disc drive models to International Business Machines. The stock had risen 3 1/8 Tuesday.    The American Stock Exchange index yesterday gained 1.57 to 336.58 and the Nasdaq composite index of OTC stocks rose 1.38 to 421.91. </TEXT></DOC>
