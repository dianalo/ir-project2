Each executive agency shall, to themaximum practicable extent, fulfill its requirements for property by obtainingexcess personal property from other Federal agencies instead of initiatinga new procurement.(b) Agencies receiving or transferring excess personal property shall establishcontrols over the processing of transfer orders and shall establish andmaintain an adequate system of property accountability. Each Federal agencyshall develop and maintain an effective system for the prevention and detectionof situations involving the nonuse, improper use, or unauthorized disposalor destruction of excess personal property received by the agency. Thisrepsonsibility should include compliance reviews, field inspections, audits,and other procedures to monitor the excess personal property controlledby an agency. The system of accountability for excess personal propertyshould be in accordance with agency procedures, and records subject toaudit by an internal audit group of the Federal agency and made availableto the General Accounting Office upon request.(c) GSA will assist agencies in meeting their requirements for propertyof the types excepted by this part from formal reporting as excess.

GSA may takephysical custody of such excess personal property for redistribution ormay direct its transfer to executive agencies instead of procurement ofnew property from commercial sources of supply. Notice of intent to substitutewill be provided to the ordering agency if the excess personal propertyis used, rehabilitated, or differs in some substantial characteristicsfrom the item ordered.

Automatedrequisitions on approved forms may be used for excess personal propertytransfers. However, Federal agencies using automated requisitions shallensure that identifying codes are controlled and records maintained indicatingthe official authorized to approve property transfers. Each transfereeagency shall forward the original and three copies of the transfer orderto the appropriate GSA regional office (see andSection; 101-43.4802) forapproval. An SF 120 is not required in addition to SF 122 for direct transfers.Prior approval by GSA is not required when the property involved in thegiven transaction is:(1) Reportable under andSection; 101-43.304 but has not yet been reportedto GSA, and its total acquistion cost does not exceed $5,000, and the owningagency's regulations relative to internal redistribution have been satisfied;or(2) Nonreportable under andSection; 101-43.305 and has not been reservedat the holding location for special screening by the appropriate GSA regionaloffice, and its total acquisition cost does not exceed $25,000; and(3) The appropriate GSA regional office is furnished an information copyof each direct transfer order by the transferor agency within 10 workdaysfrom receipt of the order.(b) In those cases where a known requirement exists for excess personalproperty which exceeds the acquisition cost limitations for direct transfersin paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, a request for approvalof a prearranged transfer may be made. To effect a prearranged transfer,the requesting Federal agency must contact the appropriate GSA regionaloffice for verbal approval. In considering such requests, GSA may applythe approval factors listed in paragraph (e) of this section, if competingknown requirements exist. Upon approval of the prearranged transfer, therequesting agency must submit an SF 122 or other authorized transfer orderform only. An SF 120 is not required in those cases where the propertyis reportable in accordance with andSection; 101-43.304. Approval for theholding activity to release the property prior to receipt of the transferorder may also be given verbally at the discretion of the GSA regionaloffice. These verbal approvals must be obtained from an authorized representativeof the GSA regional office, and the requesting agency shall annotate theSF 122 with the name of the approving GSA official and the date telephoneapproval was obtained.(c) The SF 122 shall be completed as shown in andSection; 101-43.4901-122.All transfer orders shall be executed by an accountable Federal official,and will not be approved by GSA unless so executed.(1) For wholly owned or mixed-ownership Government corporations, the Senate,the House of Representatives, the Architect of the Capitol and any activitiesunder his direction, and the municipal government of the District of Columbia,transfer orders shall be executed by a responsible official of those organizations.(2) For non-Federal agencies for which GSA procures, transfer orders shallbe executed by a responsible official of the sponsoring Federal agency.(3) For contractors and grantees, transfer orders shall be executed bythe Federal contracting officer administering the contract or other responsibleFederal official who is knowledgeable about the terms of the contract orgrant.(4) For nonappropriated fund activities of Federal agencies, transfer ordersshall be executed by an accountable official of the sponsoring Federalagency. The transfer order shall state that the property will be enteredon the accountable records of the sponsoring Federal agency and shall alsostate that the property will be used only for administrative or operationaluse but not for resale.(d) When property is offered for transportation, the condition of the itemsshall be shown on the bill of lading. In order that the Federal Governmentmay obtain the most economical rates for the movement of excess personalproperty in other than new condition, particular attention shall be givento the use of the appropriate classification decription as required bycarriers' tariffs.(e) While transfers of excess personal property will normally be approvedby GSA on a first-come-first-served basis, consideration will be givento such factors as national defense requirements, emergency needs, preclusionof new procurement, energy conservation, equitable distribution, transportationcosts, and retention of title in the Government. When competing Federalclaims are made for particular items of excess personal property, withor without payment of reimbursement, GSA will give preference to the Federalagency that will retain title in the Government. Transfer requests forthe purpose of cannibalization will be considered, but are normally subordinateto requests for the complete items. The GSA regional office may defer approvalof any transfer request until all pertinent factors are considered. Whencompeting requests are received, the GSA regional office may, at its discretion,request supporting justification from the ordering agencies to assist inmaking the allocation determination, including evidence that new procurementis involved. Placement of a freeze on an item of excess personal propertyby a Federal agency does not constitute an absolute claim on the property.The GSA regional office is responsible for evaluating the above factorsprior to approval of a transfer order for a frozen item subject to competingrequests.(f) A copy of each approved or disapproved transfer order will be returnedto the ordering agency by the GSA regional office with appropriate notation.Two copies of each approved order will be appropriately noted and transmittedby the GSA regional office to the holding agency for transfer action. Anybilling by the holding agency shall be accomplished in accordance withandSection; 101-43.310.(g) If the transfer order does not contain complete shipping instructions,the transferee agency is required to transmit these to the holding agencywithin 15 calendar days after receipt of the transfer order by the holdingactivity in the case of domestic shipments, or 45 calendar days in thecase of export shipments. The holding activity will communicate failureto receive such shipping instructions to the GSA regional office whichapproved the transfer. If the transfer order indicates the property isto be picked up by the transferee agency, the action must be accomplishedwithin 20 calendar days from the time such agency is notified by the holdingactivity that the shipment is ready. The holding activity will communicatewith the GSA regional office concerning the failure of the transferee agencyto pick up property within the allotted time.(1) Holding activities will carry out shipping instructions within 20 calendardays from receipt or make property available for pickup promptly(2) If the holding activity is unable to ship or deliver as required, theordering activity must be advised of the reason for delay and a new scheduledshipping or delivery date.(h) Whenever a transfer order covers excess personal property which hasdeteriorated materially below the reported condition, the holding agencyshall advise the GSA regional office of its current condition. The GSAregional office will so advise the ordering agency. Shipment will not bemade until the ordering agency has advised the GSA regional office thatthe existing condition is acceptable and the GSA regional office has soadvised the holding agency.(i) Whenever an excess item of equipment is transferred, any availableoperating manual, parts list, circuit or wiring diagram, maintenance record,log, or other instructional or informational publication or brochure pertainingto the equipment shall accompany and be transferred with the item of equipment.(j) Use of the SF 97, Certificate of Release of a Motor Vehicle, is restrictedto situations where title to the vehicle leaves the Federal Government(see Subpart 101-38.7).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-43.310</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Costs and proceeds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-43.310-1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Cost of care and handling.</ITAG>Each holding agency shall be responsible for and bear the costs of performingcare and handling of excess property pending disposition.

The request shall statethe applicant's qualifications to screen excess personal property and shallindicate the name, number, and termination date of the specific contract,agreement, or grant to which the screener is to be assigned. Since certificationis normally approved on a regional basis, a request for certification forinterregional screening shall specify the additional regions for whichcertification is requested. The GSA regional office handling the requestwill coordinate as necessary with other GSA regional offices and advisethe requesting agency of actions taken on each request. (c) Sponsoring Federal agencies shall include GSA Form 2946, Screener'sIdentification, with each non-Federal agency screener request. GSA Form2946 must contain the typed names of both the screener's organization andthe sponsoring Federal agency, the signature of the sponsoring Federalagency official, the typed name and signature of the proposed non-Federalagency screener, and an affixed passport-style photograph of the screener.(d) Following approval, the GSA regional office will complete the GSA Form2946 and return it to the sponsoring Federal agency for issuance to thescreener. When the request is for an applicant whose screening activitiesare confined to a single cost-reimbursement contract, cooperative agreement,or project grant, the expiration date on the GSA Form 2946 normally shallcoincide with the expiration date of that specific project. If the organizationemploying the non-Federal agency screener is expected to have a subsequentcontract, agreement, or grant when the current one expires, or if the applicant'sscreening activities cover more than a single project, the sponsoring Federalagency may request an expiration date accordingly. If the services of anapproved non-Federal agency screener are discontinued prior to the expirationdate, the sponsoring Federal agency shall recover the GSA Form 2946. Eachsponsoring Federal agency shall be responsible for maintaining a recordof the number of certified screeners operating under its authority andshall immediately notify the appropriate GSA regional office of any changesin screening assignments. (e) Each non-Federal agency representative of a Federal agency physicallyscreening property at holding installations for the purpose of selectingproperty for transfer shall possess a GSA Form 2946 validated by GSA asprovided in this section. However, non-Federal personnel of eligible organizationsvisiting holding activities in order to participate in onsite screeningsor for the purpose of technical inspection, evaluation, and/or removalof property previously set aside or approved by GSA for transfer shallnot be required to possess a GSA Form 2946. (f) A sponsoring Federal agency may request authorization for a non-Federalagency representative to screen excess personal property at specific holdinginstallations on a one-time basis without formal certification. Such requestsshall be submitted to the GSA regional office serving the area in whichthe holding installations are located. The GSA regional office shall coordinatewith the holding installations and, if the request is approved, issue aletter authorizing the non-Federal agency representative to screen excesspersonal property at the holding installations specified; if possible,on the dates requested. 10.

Situations will occurwhere, in terms of economy, efficiency, and environmental quality, it isin the best interest of the Government to recover precious metals fromarticles of excess and surplus personal property instead of using othermethods of disposal. GSA will determine when Government-wide recovery isappropriate on the basis of an evaluation of the supply-demand factor,the price of the commodity, the cost of recovering the precious metal,and applicable guidelines or regulations on pollution control. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-45.1002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Agency responsibilities. </ITAG>Heads of executive agencies are responsible for establishing, maintaining,and pursuing a program for recovery of precious metals. The provisionsof this andSection; 101-45.1002 provide guidance with respect to surveys,reporting requirements, assignments of program monitors, and internal audits.Precious metals that may be designated for recovery include gold, silver,and metals in the platinum family. Examples of silver bearing scrap andwaste include used photographic fixing (hypo) solution, photographic andX-ray film, silver alloys, and dental scrap. Other examples of preciousmetals bearing materials include electronic scrap, ADPE, welding and brazingwire, annodes, and batteries. Certain strategic and critical materials,lists of which are issued from time to time as provided in andSection; 101-14.106,may also be designated for recovery. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-45.1002-1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Precious metals recovery surveys. </ITAG>Each agency shall identify those activities that generate silver or otherprecious metals (including used hypo solution, scrap film, and other preciousmetals bearing materials). Activities identified as generating preciousmetals bearing materials shall be surveyed to obtain information regardingactual or potential precious metals recovery. Estimates of potential recoverymay be obtained through use of testing papers for hypo solution; variouscharts, tables, and scales for scrap film, assays of samples of preciousmetals bearing materials; or other acceptable methods of estimating potentialprecious metals contents. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-45.1002-2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Agency reporting requirements. </ITAG>(a) Each agency shall submit a consolidated annual report (based on fiscalyear) containing information regarding precious metals recovery to theManager, Federal Precious Metals Recovery Programs, General Services Administration(F), Washington, DC 20406. The consolidated report, Standard Form 291,Report of Activities Generating Precious Metals (interagency report controlnumber 1529-GSA-A), shall be submitted within 45 calendar days after theend of the fiscal year. Agency requests for a waiver to the annual reportingrequirement shall be submitted to the above GSA program manager for approval.(b) Section 101-45.4901-291 illustrates Standard Form 291, Report of ActivitiesGenerating Precious Metals. The report provides for specific informationregarding the types of silver and other precious metals bearing materialsprocessed or generated. The report requires information to be submittedas to the potential amount of precious metals to be recovered from theprecious metals bearing material as well as the actual amount of preciousmetals recovered. Significant differences between the potential and actualamount of precious metals recovered shall be explained on Standard. Form291. When reporting estimated savings use either: the market value on thedate of the transaction for material delivered to the DOD system; or amountof proceeds when material is sold under contract. All sales should be identifiedby contract number. Market value determination should be identified bysource and date. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-45.1002-3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Precious metals recovery program monitor. </ITAG>Each agency should designate an individual to monitor its precious metalsrecovery program. Responsibilities of the precious metals monitor shouldinclude conducting and coordinating surveys, implementing and improvingrecovery procedures; monitoring the agency's recovery program; and submittingthe consolidated annual report to GSA. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-45.1002-4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Internal audits. </ITAG>Each agency should require periodic internal audits of its precious metalsrecovery program. The internal audits should be of such frequency and scopeas to provide for proper control over the recovery, storage, and dispositionof precious metals bearing materials. Primary elements for review shouldinclude document control and record maintenance; storage facilities andsecurity controls; methods of recovery and equipment operation; and proceduresfor recovering precious metals through service contracts or disposal throughsales contracts. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-45.1003</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Recovery of silver from precious metals bearing materials. </ITAG>(a) Each agency should recover silver regardless of the quantity of usedhypo solution or scrap film generated. Installations of a silver recoveryunit consistent with the quantity of used hypo solution generated or storageof used hypo solution or scrap film until a processible quantity is obtainedare two alternatives. If an activity generates small quantities of hyposolution and tests show that there is a minimal amount of silver per gallonof solution, arrangements should be made, to the extent feasible, withanother activity in the area which is using a recovery unit to receiveand process the hypo solution. When the actual amount of silver recoveredis substantially less than the estimated amount potentially recoverable,agencies should fully document the reason for the substantial difference.(b) When recovery by an agency is not economically feasible and consolidationwith other activities is not practical, the regional GSA Federal SupplyService Bureau serving the area or the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) (inaccordance with andSection; 101-45.1004) should be contacted for assistance.If it is determined that silver recovery cannot be accomplished economicallyby Government-owned equipment or by a commercial recovery contractor, thehypo solution, scrap film, or other silver bearing materials should bedisposed of in accordance with Part 101-45 in an environmentally acceptablemanner. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-45.1003-1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Guidelines for the recovery of silver from used hypo solution andscrap film. </ITAG>The basic factors that determine the potential quantity of recoverablesilver are: The amount of used hypo solution or scrap film generated; theamount and type of film processed; and the physical layout and availablerecovery equipment of the photographic facility. Since these factors mayvary for each facility, a single method of recovery cannot be prescribed.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-45.1003-2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Recovery of silver from used hypo solution. </ITAG>Used hypo solution should be processed to recover the maximum amount ofsilver from the solution, consistent with overall economic feasibilityand environmental considerations. Recovery can be effected either by Government-ownedequipment or through use of commercial recovery contracts. Various typesand sizes of equipment using metallic replacement or electrolytic methodsof recovery are available which permit economic silver recovery from bothlarge and small quantities of used hypo solution. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-45.1003-3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Recovery of silver from scrap film. </ITAG>Scrap film, the silver content of which varies according to the type offilm and the degree of exposure, is a major source of recovered silver.One method of recovering silver from scrap film is by burning the filmin specially designed and approved incinerators. The burning reduces thefilm to high content silver bearing ash which can be economically processedto produce fine silver. Recovery onsite by controlled burning should onlybe accomplished at those activities or installations where approved facilitiesexist and the local code on burning permits it. A common alternative methodof recovery is through periodic disposal of accumulated scrap film by salein accordance with Part 101-45. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-45.1004</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Recovery and use of precious metals through the DOD Precious MetalsRecovery Program. </ITAG>Civil agencies may use the DOD Precious Metals Recovery Program as prescribedin andSection; 101-45.1004. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-45.1004-1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Civil agency participation in the DOD Precious Metals Recovery Program.</ITAG>(a) Civil Agencies wishing to participate in the DOD precious metals recoverysystem should contact the Manager, DOD Precious Metals Recovery Program,Attention: DLA-SMP, Cameron Station, Alexandria, VA 22314, for furtherinformation regarding the following plans: (1) <T3>Plan I. </T3>An appraisal or survey of the agency's precious metalsrecovery potential and a recommendation as to appropriate recovery techniquesand equipment; (2) <T3>Plan II. </T3>DLA acceptance of photographic wastes, excess, and otherprecious metals bearing materials at Defense Reutilization and MarketingOffices (DRMO's) or other disposition sites; (3) <T3>Plan III. </T3>Disposition and shipping instructions for recoveredprecious metals bearing materials not authorized for acceptance at localDRMO's; (4) <T3>Plan IV. </T3>Assistance and recommendations as needed in the administrationand operation of the agency's precious metals recovery program includingan appraisal or survey of recovery potential; the furnishing of recoveryand other supporting equipment; and the prescribing of procedures for thesecurity and disposition of precious metals bearing materials.

Any propertyto be sold will be reported for sale to GSA or other authorized agencysales office as provided in Part 101-45. This property will be reportedin the same manner as surplus personal property but identified as replacementproperty subject to the same exemptions and exceptions on reporting asotherwise would be applicable to surplus personal property. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-46.301</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Automatic data processing equipment (ADPE). </ITAG>ADPE equipment that qualifies for exchange or sale in accordance with thispart shall first be reported for possible reutilization among Federal agenciesas provided in FIRMR Part 201-33 (41 CFR Part 201-33). If not transferredfor other reutilization among Federal agencies, ADPE may be exchanged orsold in accordance with this part. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-46.302</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Exchange procedures. </ITAG>(a) Most exchange transactions should occur when a vendor delivers a replacementitem and removes the item replaced. This is the most efficient and costeffective exchange procedure because the item being replaced may remainin use up to the time the replacement item is delivered, when it is immediatelyremoved by the vendor. Exchanges of items which are not in use or whendelivery of the replacement item and removal of the item replaced doesnot coincide generally involve additional storage, handling and administrativecosts, and should be kept to a minimum. (b) An executive agency may internally reassign eligible items no longerneeded by one organizational unit to another for use by the gaining unitfor exchange with the supplier of a replacement item. Physical movementof the reassigned item is unnecessary when the supplier of the replacementitem will accept it at the original location. An item reassigned for exchangepurposes may also be delivered directly to the supplier of the replacementitem to minimize storage and handling. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-46.303</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Sales methods and procedures. </ITAG>(a) The methods of sale, terms and conditions of sale, and forms prescribedin 101-45.304 shall also be used in the sale of replacement property, exceptthat negotiated sales of surplus personal property as prescribed in 101-45.304-2are not applicable to the sale of property being replaced. Section 3709,Revised Statutes, as amended (41 U.S.C. 5), is applicable to such sales.(b) While it is the policy to sell property eligible for exchange or saleafter publicly advertising for bids, such property also may be sold byGSA or the holding agency by negotiation, subject to obtaining such competitionas is feasible, when: (1) The reasonable value involved in any one case does not exceed $500,or(2) Otherwise authorized by law. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-46.304</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Availability of proceeds of sale. </ITAG>Except as otherwise authorized by law, proceeds from sales of personalproperty disposed of pursuant to this part shall be accounted for in accordancewith General Accounting Office Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidanceof Federal Agencies, Title 7, Fiscal Procedures, section 15.4. The requirementsfor a written administrative determination to establish that a bona fidereplacement is involved are set forth in andSection; 101-46.200. Proceduresfor the application of the proceeds from sale of the acquisition of similaritems follow: (a) <T3>Sale of property before the purchase of replacement property. </T3>(1)When the property to be replaced is sold before the acquisition of thereplacement property, the proceeds of such sales will be credited to theagency's account, using Standard Form 1081, Voucher and Schedule of Withdrawals,or Credits, or other approved forms.(2) The proceeds of such sales will be available for obligation for theacquisition of similar replacement items of personal property during thefiscal year in which the sale is made and for one fiscal year thereafter.(3) Proceeds of sales related to personal property for which an obligationfor replacement has not been incurred during the period of availabilityfollowing the date of sale, or sales proceeds which for other reasons anagency elects not to apply to replacement costs, shall be deposited tomiscellaneous receipts account ``2649 Proceeds from sale of equipment andother personal property not otherwise classified,'' unless other dispositionis authorized by law. (4) If it is determined at the time of collection that sales proceeds willnot be applied to replacement acquisitions, the deposit should be madedirectly to the miscellaneous receipts account. (b) <T3>Sale of property after the purchase of replacement property. </T3>Whenthe replaced property is sold after the acquisition of the replacementproperty, the proceeds of such sale may be deposited as a direct reimbursementcredit to the appropriation previously charged for the replacement of similaritems of personal property. (c) <T3>Application of proceeds. </T3>Executive agencies need not reassignproperty among their organizational units in order to apply sales proceedsfrom an eligible item sold from the property account of one organizationalunit to the cost of a similar item acquired by another organizational unitof that agency. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 101-46.305</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Reports. </ITAG>(a) Within 90 calendar days after the close of each fiscal year, executiveagencies shall submit a summary report in letter form on the transactionsmade under this part during the fiscal year except for transactions involvingbooks and periodicals as follows: (1) Total acquisition cost of property exchanged with the exchange allowanceand total acquisition cost for property sold with the proceeds shall befurnished in separate columns and further broken down by two-digit Federalsupply classification groups. (2) Total acquisition cost for property acquired from any source otherthan new procurement which was subsequently exchanged or sold after beingplaced in official use for less than 1 year pursuant to andSection; 101-46.202(c)(10)and for historical items exchanged pursuant to andSection; 101-46.203(b)shall be reflected separately by two-digit Federal supply classificationgroups. (3) These data shall also be separated into two categories by geographiclocation as follows: (i) The States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealthof Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, AmericanSamoa, Guam, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the VirginIslands; and (ii) All other areas of the world. (b) The summaries shall not include any property that was initially designatedfor exchange/sale but which was transferred for further Federal utilizationor was subsequently redesignated as excess or surplus property.
