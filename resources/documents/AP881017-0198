That represents an increase of $258 million in economic andmilitary assistance as part of a complicated arrangement thatpermits the Philippines to use ``a substantial portion'' to reduceits debt and bars American soldiers who test positive for AIDs fromserving in the country.   The successful conclusion of what at times had been difficultnegotiations could foreshadow extension of the U.S. militarypresence in the strategic Asian nation beyond 1991, but the termswill have to be negotiated between the two sides, probablybeginning next year.   Another key provision of the agreement, which was released asSecretary of State George P. Shultz and Foreign Secretary RaulManglapus signed the pact, maintains the U.S. policy of notdisclosing whether ships or planes stopping at the bases or passingthrough carry nuclear weapons.   ``These transits, overflights or visits will be conducted inaccordance with existing procedures, which may be changed ormodified, as necessary, by mutual agreement of both parties,'' thememorandum said.   However, the Philippines government has the power to prohibitstoring nuclear, chemical or other non-conventional weaponry on itsterritory.   The nuclear issue was one of the key items that had to besettled before the United States could be assured continued use ofClark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and four lesser installations.   The accord also deeds to the Philippines all permanentfacilities and improvements on buildings at the bases. The twogovernments pledged, meanwhile, to take steps to ensure a smoothtransition of the bases to Philippine control if the United Statesdecides in the future to abandon them.   In a ceremony in the State Department's Treaty Room, Manglapussaid that once Filipinos realize what the agreement gives them,they ``will accept it as an agreement that is in keeping with theexpectations of our people, not only in the matter of compensation... but also to other issues that we feel to be relevant to thequestion of national dignity.''   The agreement covers only the next two years. A U.S. statementsaid the United States hoped to begin talks with the Philippinesgovernment on use beyond 1991 ``in not too distant future.''   Manglapus said the review does not resolve issues of criminaljurisdiction and military operations, which are likely to come upin the next talks. The Philippines wants jurisdicton over U.S.soldiers who commit crimes and prior notice on any U.S. militaryoperations conducted from the bases.   Manglapus said President Corazon Aquino would be influenced onthe future of the bases by Filipinos' reaction to the agreement butwas ``keeping her options open.''   Shultz quipped: ``Both sides are keeping their options open.''   He said the United States was ``just thrilled'' with the returnof democracy in the Philippines and takes great pleasure andsatisfaction with developments in Manila.   ``I`m bullish on the Phillipines and this is a continuation ofthat effort,'' Shultz said.   The agreement set the terms for U.S. use of the bases through1991. Technically, the negotiations were a review of an existingbases agreement that the Aquino government never hinted atcanceling, but the bargaining over the U.S. aid package, thenuclear issue and other key features contributed to a dramatic andpolitically tense chapter in U.S. relations with the formerAmerican colony.   President Reagan on Monday wrote Mrs. Aquino in a three-pageletter released at the ceremony that the agreement confirmed thatthe bases arrangement ``continues to meet our mutual needs andinterests.''   But he reminded the Philippine president that Congress has theauthority to appropriate the aid covered in the accord.   Military and economic aid to the Philippines is to be boosted to$481 million a year. That is more than 2{ times the $180 million ayear Reagan pledged in 1983 over a five-year period to formerPresident Ferdinand Marcos and $129 million above the $352 millionthe United States is providing this year to the Aquino government.   Manglapus said Sunday that the pact also includes an agreementon nuclear weapons and U.S. backing for a bond program aimed atreducing the Philippines' $28 billion debt.   Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base are considered vital toregional and Western security interests across a wide part of theworld stretching from the Pacific to the Persian Gulf.   The terms fall short of the $1.2 billion that Philippine sourcessaid Manglapus originally wanted. He said, however, that U.S. andPhilippine officials were never far apart on actual cashcompensation in talks that began April 5 in Manila. He said thedisagreements were over U.S. failure to approve benefits andconcessions that would not require congressional approval.   Apart from the U.S. military and economic aid, the agreementcalls for U.S. underwriting of the cost of Philippine securitymeasures up to $4 million a year if funds can be found.   The pact is expected to lead to talks next year on the long-termfuture of the bases, which many Filipinos want removed after thelease lapses in 1991. Mrs. Aquino has not said whether she supportsU.S. use of the bases after 1991. Any new treaty would have to beapproved by a two-thirds vote of the Philippine Senate and apossible referendum.   Failure to conclude the bases review, originally scheduled forJuly, has delayed Reagan administration endorsement of a $5 billionmultilateral aid program proposed by two Republican and twoDemocratic members of Congress. White House sources have said thepresident backs the plan, but it could not be set up until theamount of the base compensation was set.   The debt relief plan linked to the bases accord is complex. Itcalls for the United States to put up U.S. Treasury bonds thatwould back a Philippine bond issue that initially would beexchanged for outstanding debts at 50 cents on the dollar,Manglapus said.   Philippine officials previously said they would ask that theUnited States put up $100 million in U.S. Treasury bonds to back aPhilippine bond issue.   Manglapus said U.S. officials agreed that the money would comefrom stepped-up payments of delayed fiscal 1988 and 1989 aid thatpreviously could not be used to pay off the debt.</TEXT></DOC>
