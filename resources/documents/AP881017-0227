Here is a report on the slash-and-burn land clearing thathas destroyed 240,000 square miles of rain forest in the past 10years.</TEXT><BYLINE>By STAN LEHMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PORTO VELHO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Acrid smoke rises two miles high fromthe slash-and-burn fires ravaging the Amazon rain forest as peasantfarmers and big cattle ranchers alike try to tame the jungle forfood and profit.   With tens of thousands of square miles of lush green vegetationput to the torch each year, many scientists and environmentalistsview it as an ecological disaster, not only destroying the forestbut poisoning the earth's atmosphere.   The World Bank has estimated that since 1978 this type of landclearing has destroyed 240,000 square miles of rain forest cover,an area larger than California.   ``At this rate, the Amazon jungle could become an immense desertwithin 100 years,'' says Alberto Setzer, an environmental engineerwith the Brazilian government's Space Research Institute.   Further, a report by the institute said the amount of smoke fromthe burnings is 1,000 times more than that emitted by the 1982eruption of Mexico's El Chichon volcano, which caused ``seriousalterations in the chemical composition of the earth's atmosphere.''   Critics charge that Brazil has allowed haphazard and destructivesettlement of the Amazon Basin, which covers an area roughlytwo-thirds the size of the continental United States andencompasses 30 percent of the world's tropical rain forests.   Saying he was alerted by the disclosure that scientists hadfound more than 6,000 man-made fires in the Amazon in a single day,President Jose Sarney on Oct. 12 announced a newenvironmental-protection program.   The program, called ``Our Nature,'' calls for a temporary end togovernment tax and financing benefits for large-scale cattleranching in the northern Amazon and a ban on exports of unprocessedtropical timber.   ``We must create nationwide consciousness that we are allpassengers in the adventure of Man on Earth,'' Sarney said inannouncing the program. ``The era of unlimited natural resources isover.''   The ``Our Nature'' program also contains a recommendation toBrazil's Congress to cut mercury imports. Free-lance goldprospectors throughout the Amazon use the highly toxic element toseparate gold from river silt and then throw the waste into thewater.   ``This program is going to shake up powerful economicinterests,'' said Antonio Jose Guimaraes, president of Brazil'sfederal Forest Service. ``But the government is resolved to carryit out.''   Earlier laws designed to colonize and develop the poor AmazonBasin permitted land developers to burn off 50 percent of theirproperties _ the fastest and cheapest way to open up clear areas _and then gave them tax deductions for doing so.   Brazil already had some environmental-protection laws in place,but because of the country's vast size, deteriorating economicsituation and scarcity of real enforcement power, the laws werelargely ignored.   Scientists at the Space Research Institute say that jungle fireslast year released nearly 500 million tons of carbonic gases intothe atmosphere, making Brazil one of the chief contributors to the``greenhouse effect'' that is dangerously warming the earth'sclimate.   Scientific studies warn that rising global temperatures couldeventually cause the inundation of major U.S. and European coastalcities and the parching of prime heartland farm areas in NorthAmerica, Europe and the Soviet Union.   In Porto Velho, capital of the jungle state of Rondonia in farwestern Brazil, Compton Tucker, a physical scientist with the U.S.space agency, said the burnings in the Amazon were responsible for10 percent of the carbon dioxide existing in the earth's atmospheretoday. Carbon dioxide is ``the major greenhouse gas,'' he said.   The fires in Brazil also are responsible for large quantities ofcarbon monoxide, methane and nitrogen oxides, scientists say.   Tucker works for NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center inGreenbelt, Md., and his main task is to trace emissions in theatmosphere from tropical forest burnings.   The state with the largest percentage of its Amazon forest coverdestroyed by fire is Rondonia, roughly the size of Oregon, whichhas become a mecca for hundreds of thousands of down-and-outpeasant farmers and free-lance gold prospectors, along with somebig-scale farmers and ranchers.   Luiz Alberto Catanhede, Rondonia director of the BrazilianForest Service, says than 26,000 square miles of jungle, or closeto 28 percent of the state's territory, has been burned over thepast 13 years.   During the May-to-October dry season, the burning Amazon casts acloud of smoke over Porto Velho, partially blocking out the sun.Drivers have to switch on their headlights during the day, and theairport is frequently shut down because of lack of visibility.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
