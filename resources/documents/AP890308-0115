The guerrilla government's leader said in a radio broadast fromPakistan the Moslem insurgents were ``on the verge of finalvictory'' over the Marxist government of Afghanistan three weeksafter the Soviet military withdrawal.   Pakistani officials could not be reached for comment about thecharges of military interference, but Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttodismissed similar charges last month.   Jalalabad, capital of Nangarhar province, is 75 mites east ofKabul on the highway to Pakistan, about 45 miles from the border.   One guerrilla source said the Jalalabad airport also had beencaptured, but another spokesman, known only as Satultah, said inPeshawar, Pakistan, that fighting continued there.   Satullah said guerrillas bombarded the Samarkhiel fortress onJalalabad's outskirts with long-range artiltery late Tuesday and itfell early Wednesday. Kabul radio said the garrison was attacked,but reported only one soldier killed and did not say it had fallen.   Several other Afghan sources confirmed Satullah's claim, butthere was no independent confirmation.   Kabul radio said ``Pakistan forces are using their helicoptergunships and heavy artillery'' to attack government positions ineastern Nangarhar province and in Kandahar, the southeasternprovince.   Ms. Bhutto said last month the Pakistan military had notparticipated in Afghanistan's decade-old civil war and would not doso.   About 3.5 million Afghan refugees live just inside Pakistan, inborder camps and cities the insurgents use as bases and supplypoints.   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April1978 and Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979. Anestimated 115,000 were there at outset of the U.N.-sponsoredwithdrawal, which was completed Feb. 15.   Afghanistan's official radio also said four Pakistan armyhelicopters flew Afghan guerrilla leaders and field commandersWednesday to Ghazi Abad, about 10 miles east of Jalalabad.   Insurgents destroyed a military transport plane at the Jalalabadairport Tuesday. Kabul radio, in a report confirmed by guerrillasources, said two people were killed.   Satullah said insurgent positions around the city, particularlyto the south, were bombed in retaliation for the capture of theSamarkhiel fortress. Another guerrilla source reported``indiscriminate bombing last night and this morning.''   Insurgents near Jalalabad shot down an Afghan helicopter gunshipand a Soviet-made MiG-25 jet with U.S.-made missiles Wednesday andthere were no survivors, Satullah said.   Stinger missiles are credited with inflicting costly losses onthe Soviet air force since Washington began supplying them to theinsurgents two years ago. The United States and Pakistan have beenthe main suppliers of arms and financial backing to the guerrillas.   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, presisent of the new government-in-exile,told Afghans in a 16-minute radio address from insurgentheadquarters in Peshawar:   ``We have no doubt at all that the puppet ... government which isresponsible for the killing, the destruction and the displacement ofmillions of Afghan refugees will never be able to stand againstAfghanistan again.''   He said his priority is ``complete removal of the government inKabul, the return of peace and security to the whole country andpreparations for the suitable conditions for the return ofrefugees.''   Mojaddidi asked the United Nations and the Islamic Conferenceorganization to recognize his government, which he said would holdits first Cabinet meeting Friday inside Afghanistan.
