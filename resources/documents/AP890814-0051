A police spokesman said many of those involved in thedisturbances were young and he urged parents to keep their childrenindoors.   ``Their parents have a responsibility to keep them off thestreets and out of trouble,'' he said, speaking anonymously inkeeping with British custom.   There were no reported injuries in disturbances that startedabout 6:15 a.m., said a spokesman for the Royal UlsterConstabulary, Northern Ireland's police force.   Two buses and a truck were hijacked and set on fire, said thespokesman. Bus service to the area was cut off for two hours toprevent more hijackings, he said.   Chief Constable Hugh Annesley appealed Sunday for calm acrossNorthern Ireland during events today marking the day British troopsentered Londonderry two decades ago to separate rebelliousCatholics from charging police. Troops moved into Belfast a daylater.   ``I would like to see parents keep their children in,'' saidAnnesley. ``I would like community leaders, church leaders,politicians of all persuasions, to encourage those in the communityfrom one side to the other to please keep calm, to avoid beingprovoked and to let this very difficult time pass by.''   Protestants marched Saturday in a parade in Londonderry to markthe 300th anniversary of a defeat over the Catholic King James II,and Catholics marched Sunday up the Falls Road in west Belfast.   Republicans planned to gather in Londonderry tonight to marchthrough Waterloo Place where British soldiers first arrived at 5p.m. on Aug. 14, 1969, after sectarian riots had engulfed the cityfor two days and nights.   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the legal political wing ofthe outlawed Irish Republican Army, told Sunday's marchers:   ``We have a lot to be proud of because we have come a long wayin 20 years. Our opponents have failed to defeat us.''   Adams praised the IRA as ``the real freedom fighters.''   Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, a leader in the Catholic civilrights marches of the 1960's, told the cheering crowd:   ``The British army came in 19 and 69 not because we were beingattacked, but because for the first time since the beginning ofthis state _ this misbegotten tuppence ha'penny bastardized state _we were fighting back.''   ``The reasons they are still here 20 years after is because weare still fighting back,'' she said.   Looking back over 20 years, Mrs. McAliskey complained thatCatholics still suffer more unemployment than Protestants, localgovernment was powerless and the rights of criminal defendants,including the right to silence, have been eroded.   ``Everything we got out of them we squeezed out of them,'' Mrs.McAliskey said. ``Yet it was nothing, because every time we gainedsomething they clawed it back.''   The thousands who marched up the Falls Road to Andersonstown onSunday represent only a minority within Northern Ireland's RomanCatholic community. In election after election, Sinn Fein haspulled about half as many votes as the Social Democratic and LaborParty, which is committed to peaceful change.   Security was strict along the parade route. Annesley, appointedlast year to head the Royal Ulster Constabulary, surprised SinnFein by coming in person. Later, he complimented the organizers fora well-run parade.   On Saturday, Annesley's men discovered an IRA bomb inLondonderry that exploded before it could be defused. No one wasinjured but a building was destroyed.   More than 2,700 people, two-thirds of them civilians, have diedin 20 years of violence in Northern Ireland, which is dividedbetween Catholics who generally favor a united Ireland, andProtestants who support continued British rule.</TEXT></DOC>
