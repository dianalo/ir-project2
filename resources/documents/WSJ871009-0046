The Senate Finance Committee met to begin drafting a tax increase for fiscal 1988, but the meeting was adjourned after Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, the panel's ranking Republican, said GOP members weren't willing to vote for any tax increases.    &quot;I know the president will veto any new taxes -- period,&quot; Sen. Packwood said after meeting with Treasury Secretary James Baker. Sen. Packwood predicted that President Reagan, rather than accepting higher taxes, would be willing to accept automatic spending cuts mandated under the newly revised budget-balancing law, including $11.5 billion of cuts in defense.    &quot;We are wise to postpone for the moment any decision about taxes and cuts&quot; until congressional experts spell out how the automatic cuts would be made, Sen. Packwood said. The staff experts are to report Oct. 20 on how these automatic cuts will affect the various federal programs. Sen. Packwood says then would be the appropriate time to begin the effort to head them off before they take effect a month later, if that's what Congress wants.    Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) said he was &quot;very disappointed&quot; with the Republican response, and adjourned without scheduling another meeting. &quot;I frankly doubt it can be done without bipartisan support,&quot; Sen. Bentsen said.    The scene was a replay of what happened last week in the House Ways and Means Committee, where the 13 Republicans said too much emphasis was being placed on raising taxes and declined to participate. The 23 Democrats on the panel yesterday continued writing their own bill.    The Democrats, in a closed session, considered and rejected nearly all of the revenue-raising measures that were proposed by the Treasury as part of tax-overhaul legislation in 1984 and 1985. They are scheduled to meet next week to try to find about $6 billion in revenue for fiscal 1988, which began Oct. 1. They agreed Wednesday on $6.3 billion of revenue increases, a little more than half the $12 billion Democratic leaders want to raise as part of a $23 billion deficit reduction.    Ways and Means Democrats plan to reconsider a few of the administration's proposals, including repeal of the cash-accounting method for farms.    They also will take up proposals for tougher tax treatment of so-called cafeteria employee benefit plans, which allow employees to choose among different options. The Democrats will consider repealing the provision that effectively allows U.S. companies to count export profits as foreign rather than domestic income.    While the administration doesn't endorse these proposals as ways of cutting the deficit, the Democrats have seized on them as possible means of producing revenue.    Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) said that after Democrats consider these proposals, they will look to loophole-closing measures before considering excise taxes or tampering with income tax rates -- ideas Rep. Rostenkowski says he opposes.    &quot;I'm still hoping to get a bill the president will sign,&quot; Rep. Rostenkowski said. Yet, acknowledging the Republican resistance so far, the chairman said, &quot;I imagine you'll see a Democratic flavor to the legislation we'll bring to the committee on Thursday.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
