The chamber voted 57-39 to kill the proposed ban as it workedthrough a Pentagon budget bill.   ``We must maintain unquestionable confidence in our nucleardeterrent and our experts tell us that this requires continuedtesting,'' said Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-N.C., a chief opponent.   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., the sponsor of the ban, said, ``noother issue addresses so clearly the runaway technology which isthe lifeblood of the arms race.''   The House has approved an underground test ban in its version ofthe defense bill, meaning the issue will have to be resolved by aHouse-Senate conference committee that will resolve differencesbetween the two measures.   The House passed its defense bill Wednesday and the chairman ofthe House Armed Services Committee said the U.S. military is``stronger and more capable'' now than when President Reagan tookoffice, despite Reagan's recurring complaints about not gettingenough money for the Pentagon.   ``By almost any measure, our armed services are better than theywere in 1981,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis. ``The most dramaticincrease is the quality of people, which is much, much better.''   Aspin commented shortly after the House voted 252-172 for aPentagon budget, which will be the last defense budget of Reagan'seight-year presidency.   House approval split along party lines, with majority Democratssupporting the bill and Republicans opposing it. Reagan didn't likeit either, joining complaints by House Republicans that the billunfairly restricts his arms control policies and Star Wars program.   The House measure bans Star Wars tests that violate theso-called ``narrow'' interpretation of the 1972 Anti-BallisticMissile treaty, and bars the purchase of any nuclear weapons thatviolate the numerical limits in the unratified 1979 SALT II nucleararms treaty.   The Senate, by a 51-45 margin, rejected an attempt Wednesday toadd the SALT II restriction to its defense bill.   Reagan opposes both restrictions and is also unhappy with the$3.5 billion approved by the House for the Strategic DefenseInitiative, as Star Wars is formally known. The Senate votedWednesday for $4.6 billion.   Reagan wanted $4.8 billion for Star Wars next year, comparedwith the current SDI budget of $3.9 billion.   Aspin said he couldn't understand the presidential complaints.``I don't believe the president has any reason to be upset. I thinkit's a good bill. We gave the president a lot of what he wanted.''   Both the House and Senate bills authorize $299.5 billion worthof defense spending in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, a slightreduction from the current $300 billion Pentagon budget.   The measures would essentially freeze defense spending for afourth straight year, following four large annual increases inReagan's first term.   No increases are likely in the future, Aspin predicted. ``Iwould guess that you're looking at perhaps a freeze, or maybe adecline of 1 or 2 percent, for the foreseeable future, which is thenext three or four years, no matter who is elected president.''   Several factors will contribute to the reluctance to increasedefense budgets, said Aspin. ``First, there are the worries aboutthe federal budget deficit. Then second, you have the fact that theSoviets appear to the American public to be less threatening underMikhail Gorbachev, so there's less a push because of fear.   ``You also have the fact that there are other fears, likedrugs,'' he said, noting that the House bill orders Reagan to usethe U.S. military in the fight against illegal drug smuggling.   ``In addition, there is a growing perception that nationalsecurity depends on other things than simply military might, thatit needs to include economic strength,'' he said.   While the House measure restricts Reagan's arms control policiesand Star Wars, it granted his proposals for a vast variety ofweapons.   That total includes 180 F-16 jet fighter planes, 84 F-A-18 jets,42 F-15 jets, a dozen F-14 jets, three new Navy destroyers, twomore attack submarines, one Trident missile-firing sub, the firstof the new ``Seawolf'' class subs and 611 M-1 tanks.   The Senate decision on Star Wars came as the chamber voted 50-48against a deep reduction in the 5-year-old program.   That vote defeated a proposal by Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La.,to reduce the SDI budget to about $3.8 billion and devote the extra$750 million to the space shuttle and a space station.</TEXT></DOC>
