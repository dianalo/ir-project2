Juan Ponce Enrile be charged withrebellion for an alleged role in this month's attempt to topplePresident Corazon Aquino, an official said.   Enrile denied involvement and said the accusations were meant toharass the opposition.   Fernando de Leon, the chief state prosecutor, said witnessesclaimed to have seen Enrile with mutiny leaders on Dec. 1, whenthousands of troops launched the sixth and strongest attempt totopple Mrs. Aquino.   De Leon said the recommendation would be referred to a panel ofprosecutors to decide whether charges would be filed. Enrile wasfired as defense minister in November 1986 after a failed coup byhis followers.   ``The statement of the witnesses points to the fact that at theheight of the coup on Dec. 1, many soldiers with white patches ontheir shoulders were seen at the residence of Sen. Enrile and someguests there inside the house were conferring with him,'' said deLeon.   De Leon said those reportedly seen with Enrile included formerLt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, believed to have been a keyleader in the failed putsch.   De Leon said the witnesses were hotel waiters who were cateringa meal at Enrile's Makati residence on the first day of thenine-day coup attempt, which claimed the lives of 113 people andleft more than 500 wounded.   Enrile said there were no soldiers at his residence. He said``not more than 20'' bodyguards in civilian clothes were presentthat day along with some guests who attended a Mass traditionallyheld every first Friday of the month at his house.   ``I welcome the opportunity to face them ... in the courts,''Enrile said. ``I know that I have not done anything that iscriminal under our laws. I am not part of the rebellion.   ``They want to seal the lips of the opposition in the countryand to threaten them, but I will tell them now ... that they cannotsilence me,'' he said. ``This government is like a wounded tigerflailing its paws.''   Early today, panic-selling swept the country's major stockexchange after a senior general warned of a possible new coupattempt. Government institutions bought stocks to ease sellingpressure.   Dealers blamed the decline on a statement Wednesday by Maj. Gen.Ramon Montano, chief of the Philippine Constabulary, that a newcoup may be launched after Jan. 17.   Montano warned the new attempt could be launched by renegadeleaders of this month's coup attempt. Many of the key ringleaders,including Honasan, remain at large.   ``Our intelligence data tell us that the next possible timetablefor a coup could be between Jan. 17 and 30,'' Montano toldreporters.   In a related development, the newspaper Malaya today publishedwhat it said was a secret government ``watchlist'' of 55 peopleallegedly linked to the failed coup. The list included VicePresident Salvador Laurel and Enrile.   Laurel, a longtime political rival of Mrs. Aquino, demanded thatthe government confirm whether the report was true and if so,explain the basis for the allegations. There was no immediatecomment from the presidential staff.</TEXT></DOC>
