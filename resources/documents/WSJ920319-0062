In a turnout of 85% in the whites-only referendum, 69% ofthe voters supported the reforms.</LP><TEXT>   In Johannesburg, the All-Share index rose 1.3% to 3573points, dealers said. Industrial stocks were much strongerthan gold-mining issues because gold prices are falling,dealers said.   The most exciting action took place on foreign markets,dealers said.   The financial rand, South Africa's investment currencythat foreigners must use to buy and sell securities in thecountry, soared by 8% to 27 U.S. cents Wednesday, dealerssaid.   Aided by the surge in the currency, De Beers Centenary AGand Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd., South Africa'sleading international shares, soared, dealers said. SouthAfrican gold stocks quoted abroad surged by about 7%, despitethe weak bullion price.   Bonds were also boosted by the stronger financial rand andrising domestic quotes, dealers said. Prices of Eskom 168, alongterm bond issued by South Africa's electricity utility,rose 8%, dealers said. Despite the rally, however, its yieldis still 20.5% because the financial rand is trading at asteep 22% discount to the commercial rand, which is thecurrency used within South Africa, dealers said.   &quot;I am delighted because South Africa now has such a goodchance,&quot; said John Taylor, South African specialist at JamesCapel andamp; Co. in London.   &quot;In the bleak days before the referendum, there was somuch gloom that our sell orders outnumbered purchases bythree to one,&quot; Mr. Taylor said. Investors from Hong Kongbraved the market ahead of the vote, he said.   Soon after the results were out, Scandinavian, German andSwiss investors were keen to buy South African securities,Mr. Taylor said. Investors from those nations were interestedbecause Denmark and Sweden announced that they were scrappingsanctions Wednesday, analysts said.   U.S. investors also began buying bonds and stocks directlythrough South African brokers, dealers said.   &quot;It is a tremendous relief, excellent news,&quot; said RayDavis, head of the South African Department at Smith NewCourt Ltd., London market makers in South African securities.&quot;It is a rocky road ahead, but at least South Africa is onthe road.&quot;   Foreign trade and investment decisions that &quot;were put onhold&quot; before the referendum are now likely to be approved,added Patrick Quarmby, an executive director at StandardLondon Ltd., specialists in South African securities andforeign debt.   &quot;One shouldn't be too euphoric,&quot; cautioned a German bankerwith close ties to South Africa. &quot;Inflation is high, thecurrency is weak and the government needs to borrow morefunds to boost the living standards of disadvantaged people.&quot;   He continued: &quot;Obviously, South Africa isn't a triple-Aborrower, but it is certainly isn't a high-risk country,either.&quot; He rates South Africa on a par with the strongerSouth American countries and with Australia.</TEXT></DOC>
