Various platinum-rhodiumand palladium-rhodium catalysts with different precious metal loadingsand increasing ratios as well as catalysts containing no rhodium, i.e.only platinum-palladium were evaluated. Engine dynamometer sweep dataand vehicle tests (US FTP 75) indicated that several catalyst formulationsexhibit three-way catalyst performance even after high temperature engineaging and severe laboratory oven air treatment. Thus, the applicationof three-way catalysts with improved alumina washcoat technology andreduced loadings of rhodium and platinum seems to be possible.</TEXT></DOC>
