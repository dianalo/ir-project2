NewZealand protested the explosion and said it could not have happenedat a worse time.   The 50-kiloton device, equivalent to 50,000 tons of dynamite,went off at 5 a.m. at a nuclear test site on the French-controlledMururua Atoll, about one-third of the way between New Zealand andthe Central American coast.   The explosion was the 92nd underground test there since Franceabandoned atmospheric testing in 1975, said to Warwick Smith,director of the New Zealand Seismological Observatory in Wellington.   ``The New Zealand government will keep expressing its strongconcern about French nuclear testing whenever it occurs,'' said NewZealand Foreign Mnister Russell Marshall. ``The timing could not beworse.''   The testing has strained France's relations with countries ofthe South Pacific, which have declared the region a nuclear-freezone.   The French government in 1985 ordered the bombing of theGreenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior to prevent the vessel fromleading a protest flotilla from the New Zealand harbor of Aucklandto the Mururua nuclear test site.   French relations with New Zealand were severely strained by thebombing, in which one crew member died. The two French agentsresponsible for the attack were sentenced to exile on the Hao Atollin the South Pacific, but since have returned to France despite ofstrong objections from New Zealand.</TEXT></DOC>
