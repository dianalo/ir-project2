Consider this: in response to one hacker foray, the DefenseAdvanced Research Projects Agency formed a SWAT team to police such assaults.andO;On first blush, it seems like a reasonable response.andP;  But it contains ahidden virus of sorts: how long will it be before such SWAT teams don'tmerely react to incursions but take preemptive actions-such as surveillanceof &quot;potential&quot; hackers? In a world where microchips and software, rather thanpeople, have become the guardians of our national defense, it seems a logicalstep.andP;  And it wouldn't be the first time that government agencies chargedwith national security went beyond the bounds of their charter during acrisis, as anyone who remembers the FBI and CIA scandals of the 1970s canattest.andM;In another case, the Department of Defense forcibly severed communicationsbetween two of the country's top research networks when a defense contractorfound a hacker gamboling through its computers.andP;  At the time, researcherscomplained that the military had overreacted.andP;  In itself, the event was notparticularly alarming.andP;  But it may forebode a time when communications amongnetworks are regularly curtailed in the name of computer safety.andM;The government isn't alone.andP;  Private industry has overreacted as well.andP;  Somecompanies, for example, won't allow employees to bring personal software fromtheir homes to the office, fearing it may somehow &quot;infect&quot; the rest of thecorporation.andP;  And some firms have banned use of public domain and sharewareprograms downloaded from bulletin boards.andM;Today this kind of thinking isn't confirned to the computer world; we seesimilar insular reasoning everywhere.andP;  Recently, for example, severalcongressmen savaged an MIT program that gives corporations access to advancedresearch.andP;  The House members complained that Japanese firms are using itbetter than American businesses are.andP;  What should be done, of course, is topromote American companies' use of the program-not to shut it downaltogether.andM;These situations add up to a potentially dangerous climate of xenophobia.andO;And if we're not careful, extreme solutions to the hacking problem may be putforth the next time a particularly damaging attack takes place.andM;A free society, after all, carries an unfortunate price-inefficiency, crime,and occasional chaos.andP;  Not all countries are willing to pay it, China beingthe most recent example.andP;  You won't find many hackers there.andP;  Indeed, thehead of a Chinese computer consulting firm told me years ago that he couldn'tget a clean line out of the country with his modem; he suspected thatjamming, not poor phone lines, was the culprit.andM;If we're not careful, we could end up walking down a similar path.andP;  Indevising ways to stop hacker attacks, we should remember a medicalchestnut-the cure should do less harm than the disease itself.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
