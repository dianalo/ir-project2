HOSTETLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court threw out thenation's first damage award in a smoker-death case and ordered anew trial, leaving lawyers for both sides haggling over who emergedthe winner.   The ruling by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Fridayset the stage for new and expanded litigation against cigarettemanufacturers, anti-smoking forces claimed.   The appeals court overturned a lower court's damage judgment,which would have made Liggett Group Inc. pay the family of smokerwho died of cancer $400,000. The lower court found that Liggett _which makes Chesterfield and Landamp;M cigarettes _ had advertised itscigarettes as safe.   Attorneys for three cigarette manufacturers claimed victory,citing the reversal of the award, which restored their 35-yearno-loss record in such cases. But their opponents stressed a partof the ruling in which the court reinstated broader claims thatweren't fully considered in the first trial.   Rose Cipollone of Little Ferry, N.J., a smoker for 42 years,originally filed the case against Liggett and two other cigarettemanufacturers, Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris Inc. Mrs. Cipollonedied of lung cancer at age 58 in 1984, but her husband, Antonio,has carried on the case.   ``Plaintiff's attorneys are back to square one after havingspent nearly six years and nearly $3 million in lawyer and legalfees,'' said Josiah Murray, Liggett's general counsel.   He said he was ``extremely gratified'' with the reversal, butdeclined to comment further on the decision.   Charles Wall, an attorney representing Philip Morris andLorillard, also was pleased with the court ruling.   Cipollone was out of town and unavailable to comment, accordingto his current wife, Dorothy. His lawyers said they had been unableto reach him.   Marc Edell, Cipollone's attorney, said the decision ``is a bigwin for us'' because he can now seek damages from all threecompanies.   ``I'm looking forward to retrying the case,'' he said.   The ruling said Cipollone has ``live claims'' against the threecompanies on grounds they marketed the product knowing the risks ofcigarette smoking. The district court had barred Cipollone frommaking such a claim.   One law professor with ties to anti-smoking forces said thecourt's ruling on that issue strengthens a plaintiff's ability toseek judgment against the tobacco companies.   Richard Daynard, a Northeastern University law professor whoheads a center supporting lawyers suing the tobacco industry, saidthe opinion ``really put tobacco litigation back on the track,where it was a couple of years ago.''   ``That is far more important than getting the $400,000 reversed.This makes the cases actually very easy to win,'' Daynard said.   Cipollone's lower court victory was on his contention that thetobacco companies promised through advertising that their productswere safe.   The appeals court said District Court Judge H. Lee Sarokin erredon that point, by preventing Liggett from trying to prove that Mrs.Cipollone didn't believe the companies' advertisements in the firstplace.   The court said Cipollone could pursue other points denied inDistrict Court such as a general failure-to-warn claim.   But the court said Cipollone could pursue the failure-to-warnclaim against Liggett because his wife smoked its cigarettes before1965, when a federal law took effect requiring cigarette makers toput health warnings on packages.</TEXT></DOC>
