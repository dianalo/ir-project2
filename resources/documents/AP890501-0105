While the Warsaw march was generally peaceful, troops usedclubs, water cannons and tear gas to crush other demonstrations inGdansk and Wroclaw, dissident sources said. A minor clash wasreported in Warsaw later Monday.   An estimated 100,000 people took part in the Solidarity marchfrom northern Warsaw and the rally afterward. The Communist Party'sofficial May Day rally nearby was more subdued and drew about20,000 people.   Red-and-white Solidarity banners vied for attention with the redflags displayed by Communist Party faithful.   Union supporters marched in a procession that took nearly anhour to pass a single point. Chants of ``Down with communism!''``Soviets go home!'' ``Free elections!'' and ``Solidarity mustwin!'' echoed off the buildings of narrow streets.   The march began with about 30,000 people and was tripled in sizeby the time it reached a park on the banks of the Vistula Rivernear Warsaw's center.   Participants trumpeted last month's accord with the government,which resulted in Solidarity's legalization after an eight-year banand provisions allowing non-communists to participate in comingparliamentary elections.   Warsaw Solidarity leader Zbigniew Bujak introduced the union'scandidates to the two legislative houses.   ``We not only can organize uprisings ... We can also build anormal democratic order,'' he told the crowd.   The Solidarity gathering was by far the union's biggest since itregained legal status on April 17. Participants signed nominatingpetitions for union-backed candidates to the two chambers of thecongress, the Senate and the Seijm.   Some radical factions of Solidarity that joined the rally calledfor boycotting the June elections. ``The Sejm and Senate Are Yours,the Factories Are Ours,'' read one banner.   But the crowd loudly booed Seweryn Jaworkski, a leader of asplinter faction supporting a boycott, when he was allowed tospeak. The crowd instead began to chant the name of Solidarityleader Lech Walesa.   The government, faced with a crumbling economy, agreed to givethe Solidarity-led opposition a greater voice in order to winworkers' cooperation on economic reforms.   ``We have entered a path of substantial reforms. We have daredto do an extraordinary thing,'' Polish leader Gen. WojciechJaruzelski told the participants in the official May Day rally inVictory Square.   ``Let's therefore close the Polish book of sorrows andbitterness,'' he said. ``What the country needs most is peace andjoint action.''   Police used tear gas, water cannons and clubs to crush a rallyin Wroclaw organized by the splinter group Fighting Solidarity andthe banned Polish Socialist Party-Democratic Revolution, saidopposition spokeswoman Maria Pinior.   In Gdansk, riot police with batons attacked participants in arally that included several banned groups, said Solidarityspokeswoman Joanna Wojciechowicz. The street fighting lasted forseveral hours, she said.   There was no information available on arrests or injuries.   Earlier, at a rally of about 1,000 people in Gdanski, Walesa wasaccused of betraying the movement he founded by Anna Walentynowicz,a woman whose firing from the Gdansk shipyard caused the strikethat led to Solidarity's formation in 1980.   Ms. Walentynowicz denounced Walesa's agreement with authoritieson social and economic reform.   Warsaw's main Solidarity events were peaceful, but later in theday at least one small clash took place between police and about100 militant young marchers in central Warsaw. Police charged therock-throwing demonstrators and dispersed them.</TEXT></DOC>
