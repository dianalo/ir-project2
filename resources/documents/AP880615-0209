Dukakis' presidential campaign signaled that Jesse Jackson is onthe list of those being considered for the vice presidential spoton the Democratic ticket.   Jackson met in Washington with Paul Brountas, Dukakis campaignchairman and head of the search for a running mate for theMassachusetts governor.   ``It was a very meaningful preliminary discussion,'' Jacksonsaid in revealing the meeting.   Dukakis aides say Brountas is meeting with a wide variety ofDemocratic leaders in the search, not just possible vicepresidential candidates. But Brountas has met with most of theDemocrats mentioned for the No. 2 spot on this trip.   Dukakis spent a third day in a row at anti-crime events in hishome state Wednesday, while Bush went to Capitol Hill for a newsconference on the war against drugs.   ``How can we possibly be serious about fighting a war on drugswhen we're cutting Coast Guard patrols by 55 percent?'' Dukakissaid at the Massachusetts state police academy in Framingham.``It's that kind of thing _ one of the reasons I'm running for thepresidency.''   He rejected suggestions that Bush and the Republicans couldportray him as soft on crime, noting that the Massachusetts crimerate has dropped 14 percent in the past four years.   ``Anyone who's been familiar with me for the past 5{ years knowshow strongly I feel on this...eternal vigilance is what's needed,''he said after meeting with state police recruits.   Dukakis said Bush and Reagan's actions over two terms suggestthe GOP might be vulnerable to such a charge.   ``They've got lots of answering to do for what's been happeningover the past eight years,'' he said, but did not elaborate beyondthe Coast Guard budget cuts.   On Capitol Hill, Bush accused the Democrats of making anti-drugprograms a ``shrill political issue'' and said congressionalDemocrats were responsible for a $72 million cut in the Coast Guardbudget for drug patrols.   ``I'm sick and tired ... in hearing the Democrats do nothing buttear down and criticize. I'm talking about Jesse Jackson andMichael Dukakis the last two months,'' Bush said at a newsconference where he endorsed a package of anti-drug measuressponsored by House Republicans.   In an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, Bushblamed his high negative ratings in the polls on Democratic attacksand a fuzzy image the voters have of him.   ``When you're sitting out there in a primary process with twocandidates shooting at you every single day...I think it would besurprising if things were any different,'' Bush said. ``I feelfairly relaxed about that...We have time to be sure that a positiveimage is out on who I am and what I feel and where I'll take thecountry. And I'll readily concede that some of that's not thatclear yet.''   That sentiment was echoed by a group of 15 GOP state chairmenwho met with Bush and Reagan on Wednesday.   ``Voters in the Midwest know nothing at all about MichaelDukakis. When they find out, they won't vote for him,'' saidIndiana party chief Gordon Durnil.   With Dukakis and Bush trading general election jibes, Jacksonrejected suggestions he should follow the lead of other vanquishedDemocratic hopefuls and endorse Dukakis. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. ofTennessee will endorse Dukakis on Thursday.   ``They lost and surrendered. I did not. We're not in the samecategory,'' Jackson said after a meeting in Washington with civilrights leaders. ``They surrendered their constituencies becausethey lost. My constituency continues to grow...So we're still inthe process.''   Jackson also said he would step up pressure on Dukakis to swingthe Democratic Party platform in line with his ideas.   ``The most critical becomes this budget, a commitment to investin people, a commitment to reinvest in America,'' Jackson said.   Jackson forces want the platform to include a freeze on militaryspending and higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations to payfor his social programs. Dukakis aides reject those ideas, sayingthe Massachusetts governor is for stable defense budgets and wouldraise taxes only as a last resort.</TEXT></DOC>
