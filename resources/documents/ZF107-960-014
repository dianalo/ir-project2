(portrait)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Basis Helps Some Agencies Manage Big DatabasesandM;To manage their large volumes of textual and numeric data, some agencies havestandarized on Information Dimensions Inc.'s Basis text informationmanagement system.andM;Agencies such as the Air-Force, the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration (OSHA) and the Energy Department rely on the Dublin, Ohio,company's Basis software to store, retrieve and manipulate large volumes ofdata in their minicomputer and mainframe environments.andM;Essentially a relational database management system for text and numericdata, Basis lets users retrieve documents based on any word or numberoccurring in structured and unstructured fields.andM;At Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, the Air Force uses Basis in itscentral database service organization, known as the Information CentralDivision or Infocen.andP;  Infocen, a clearinghouse for information on hundreds ofsubjects, supports 3,000 users across the country and abroad, said BillWalker, a Wright-Patterson computer analyst.andM;Infocen maintains about 50 databases with more than 200 database files.andP;  WithBasis, the database files run on a Digital Equipment Corp. VAXclustercomprising of four VAX 11/780s, two VAX 8650s and a VAX 8700.andP;  Infocenspecializes in handling databases that go beyond the ability of fixed-field,keyword search data file managers, agency officials said.andM;Basis lets users conduct single-and multiple-term, hierarchical and numericrange, word stem, word proximity.andP;  Boolean logic and other searches on everyindexed field.andM;&quot;Basis gives us a means for centralized resources sharing for our legal,technical and administrative users.andP;  The system lets us take advantage ofeconomies of scale in building numerous databases for our customers,&quot; saidMaj.andP;  Robert R. Massarini, chief of Wright-Patterson's Information CentralDivision.andP;  Infocen's clients are in such areas as legal, library, publicaffairs and defense systems engineering.andM;With Basis, Infocen maintains a series of databases that tack service reportsfor aircraft, aircraft engines and weapons systems during testing, evaluationand operational transition.andP;  These databases have several variable-lengthfields that contain descriptive information; a longer field generallycontains information describing the problem and recommending a solution.andM;The Defense Automated Visual Information System, another database usingBasis, maintains a catalog of the audiovisual products produced by theDefense Department.andP;  Others include Docket, a database that tracks legalcases involving the Air Force; Cantrac, a catalog of naval training coursesand corresponding training equipment inventory; and NATO, for tracking U.S.andO;involvement with NATO international standards, agency officials said.andM;Information Dimensions recently released a new version of Basis, calledBasisplus.andP;  It offers an enhanced user interface and support for multimediainformation, said William G. Griffith, president of Information Dimensions.andM;Griffith said that while the text information management system market standsat about $100 million, his company will earn $30 million this year.andM;The company does 25 percent of its business with the government.andP;  Currentusers who wish to continue to use the Basis product line likely will migrateto Basisplus, company officials said.andM;OSHA, at its Salt Lake City Analytical Laboratory in Utah, uses Basis on theOSHA Computerized Information System (OCIS).andP;  OCIS serves hundreds of OSHAindustrial hygienits, safety professionals, and managerial and administrativestaff.andM;The OCIS system consists of 12 databases with 300,000 Basis records residingon a VAX 11/750 in Salt Lake City.andP;  The 12 databases contain informationranging from chemical profiles to interpretations of OSHA standards.andP;  One ofthe newer databases stores multiple-page generic material safety data sheetsfor more than 5,000 chemicals and trade names, OSHA officials said.andM;A Chemical Information file features a current OSHA compliance sampling andanalytical methods for more than 800 chemicals for monitoring exposure inworkplace air.andP;  The information also includes health effects and a carcinogenstatus.andM;A Standards Interpretation file contains long-text documents, includingletters and memos of interpretations of OSHA, standards and policy changes.andO;The file also includes an index to agency directive distributed to fieldoffices.andM;&quot;Basis has lived up to its expectations, allowing us to enhance a system ofdatabases and make updated information quickly available to OSHA on a dailybasis,&quot; said Marty Childress, an OSHA database administrator.andM;The Energy Department's Office of Scientific and Technical Information at OakRidge, Tenn., also has used Basis to create a group of energy-relatedbibliographic databases containing more than 2.8 million data records, agencyofficials said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
