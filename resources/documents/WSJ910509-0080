Barrett and David Rogers   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/09/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A16</SO><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- In a victory for gun-control proponents, theHouse approved a bill that would impose a national seven-daywaiting period for handgun purchases.   The so-called Brady Bill passed yesterday by a 239-186vote, underscoring that concern about the country's risingmurder rate has eroded the influence of the pro-gun lobby ledby the National Rifle Association.</LP><TEXT>   The legislation, named for former White House spokesmanJames Brady, now goes to the Senate, where it is expected toface stiffer opposition because of the greater influence ofrural and western lawmakers in that chamber. In addition,President Bush has threatened to veto the Brady Bill unlessit reaches his desk as part of a larger anti-crime packagethat includes an expanded federal death penalty and limits onappeals by death-row inmates.   Both sides in the passionate gun-control debate haveacknowledged that the Brady Bill won't have much immediateimpact on the crime rate. But approval of a waiting periodthat would give police time to check gun-buyers' backgroundswas viewed by all concerned as an important symbolic defeatfor the influential gun lobby and possibly the first steptoward stiffer regulation of gun sales.   Rep. Charles Wilson (D., Texas) acknowledged thatyesterday's vote &quot;is a major setback&quot; for the NRA and pro-gunforces. &quot;But it's not over until it's over,&quot; he added.Several lawmakers, including Mr. Wilson, cited formerPresident Reagan's recent conversion to a Brady Bill backeras crucial to the measure's success. Mr. Brady waspermanently disabled in the 1981 assassination attempt thatalso injured Mr. Reagan.   Approval of the Brady Bill came after lawmakers defeated,234-193, an NRA-backed substitute that would have required acomputerized &quot;instant check&quot; at the time of purchase as towhether a prospective handgun buyer has a criminal record.   Gun-control advocates branded the alternative, introducedby Rep. Harley Staggers (D., W.Va.), a &quot;ruse&quot; designed onlyto kill the Brady Bill. Instant checks won't be possible forat least five years, according to this argument, because thefederal government and most states lack complete automatedcriminal records.   Gun-control backers have admitted privately that the samedeficiencies in record-keeping would limit the effect of awaiting period. Moreover, law enforcement officials, most ofwhom backed the Brady Bill, acknowledge that most criminalsacquire their guns on the black market, not from legitimategun dealers.</TEXT></DOC>
