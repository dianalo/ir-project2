(612-476-4400), announced on June14th that they acquired Cheetah International.andP;  Northgate, a supplier of PCsvia mail order, agreed to purchase the company and will market the CheetahGold Personal Computer line, expansion memory boards, and other Cheetahsystems and products through their existing VAR and dealer channels.andP;  Thismove gives Northgate a nice entry into channels different from those theyhave been able to penetrate.andM;Two companies, Intel PCEO and Dayna Communications, have both announcedproducts to work with printers on Local Area Networks.andP;  Both of theseproducts provide LAN users with better printer solutions than are currentlyavailable.andM;The Intel PCEO product (Intel Personal Computer Enhancement Operation (CO3-7,5200 N. E. Elam Young Parkway, Hillsboro, OR97124; 800-538-3373) is calledthe NetPort and is a complete print server for Novell and Ethernet networks.andM;Actually, I still prefer the product's code name, &quot;Velcro,&quot; since the idea ofthis little box is to attach it to a printer, connect it to the network, andbingo-no dedicated PC next to the printer, only this little $695 box, andaway you go.andP;  Actually, the NetPort supports up to two printers per box.andM;The unit contains its own microprocessor, memory, and LAN interface circuit.andO;It has one parallel port and one serial, and permits simultaneous datacommunications.andP;  Plotters can also be used with NetPort since it providessupport for both spooled data and virtual circuit (peer-to-peer)communications.andM;Installation is termed &quot;plug-and-play&quot; by Intel.andP;  If a LAN is already usingNetware Print Server VAP or NLM, NetPort links in directly as a remoteprinter, and set-up is accomplished using standard Novell NetWare commandsand menus.andM;This product is a neat idea and should free up some of the PCs which havebeen delegated to act as print servers, as well as to permit more flexibleremote printer installations in companies where desk space is at a premium.andM;Next in fine with network printer magic is the EtherPrint from DaynaCommunications (50 S. Main St., 5th Floor, Salt Lake City, UT 84144;801-531-0600).andP;  This $499 printer solution is an Ethernet-to-LocalTalkconverter.andP;  It is very easy to install-just connect your thin-Ethernet cableto the built-in transceiver and plug any LocalTalk equipped printer into theLocalTalk connector and you are off and running.andM;A second connector lets you attach to thick-Ethernet, twisted-pair, orfiber-optic cable systems through an external transceiver.andP;  Again, a veryinexpensive, yet elegant solution for moving your LocalTalk equipped printersonto the faster Ethernet networking environment.andM;GRID systems Corporation on June 12th announced the first Notebook computerequipped with a removable hard drive.andP;  The GRID 1810, powered by a V-20 NECCPU running at 10 MHz, comes standard with 1 MB of RAM, EGA display, MS-DOS3.3, and LapLink software in ROM.andP;  The removable hard disk drive is a 20 MBunit and the screen is either a backlit or reflective EGA, high-contrastdisplay, depending on the choice of the user and battery life trade-offs.andM;The unit sports a retail price of $2895, and will be available in July ofthis year.andP;  Along with the Notebook unit, GRID also announced a Desktopreceiver made by Tandy which permits the Notebook user to insert the harddrive cartridge into a desk mounted unit attached to a PC.andM;Compaq Computer Corporation also was very busy in June with severalannouncements.andP;  The first was the introduction of the SLT386s/20, a 20 MHz386SX powered laptop in the same design model as their existing SLT286portable unit.andP;  Housed in a 14 pound case which measures 4 inches high, by13.5 inches wide by 8.5 inches deep, this system has been designed for themobile professional who wants all the power he can get in a portable package.andM;The SLT386/20 is available with either a 120 MB hard disk or a 60 MB unit.andO;Both come standard with a 3.5 inch 1.44 MB floppy drive, two MB of RAM, and aone year warranty.andP;  The Model 120 carries a retail price of $7499 while theModel 60 starts at $6799.andM;Next out of the shoot from Compaq is their new 386SX based desktop unit, the386s/20.andP;  Built around the 386SX running at 20 MHz, this unit comes in threeflavors.andP;  First is the 120 MB hard disk unit (the Model 120), followed by theModel 60 with a 60 MB fixed disk, and the basic model 1 with a floppy driveonly.andP;  All units ship standard with 2 MB of RAM and a single 3.5 inch 1.44 MBfloppy drive.andM;Pricing of the models is in line with the balance of the Compaq line ofproducts.andP;  The Model 120 retails for $5299, the Model 60 for $4499, and theModel 1 for $3299.andP;  Compaq shares our belief that the desktop systems ofchoice for the coming few years will be the 386SX based systems, and theyhave added a significant number of products to their SX based line in recentmonths.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
