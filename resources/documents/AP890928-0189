Savimbi, who is to visit Washington next week, said neither hisNational Union for the Total Independence of Angola, called UNITA,nor troops of the Soviet-backed Marxist government are making anyeffort to observe a cease-fire declared in June.   He spoke to reporters at the end of a four-day emergencycongress of guerrilla officials at his bush headquarters.   In a secret ballot, delegates voted 2,985-to-1 in favor ofcalling for a new cease-fire and 15-month transition with acoalition government, followed by free elections, Savimbi said.   He also said President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and severalother African leaders have aggravated the situation by asserting ata summit in Zimbabwe that Savimbi had agreed to temporary exile andto his guerrillas being integrated into the Angolan army.   These proposals never have been accepted by his movement andwere introduced by the Angolan government, said Savimbi. Hewithdrew a previous offer to stay out of a possible temporarycoalition government, saying his movement reserves the right topick its own members of such a government.   ``UNITA calls for elections and nothing else,'' Savimbi said.``If democracy and elections are good for Namibia and good forPoland, why not for Angola?''   The guerrillas never have had a chance to test their popularityat the polls. They have been at war since Portuguese colonizershastily withdrew, granting independence in 1975 and leaving rivalblack factions to fight it out for power. The victory went to thePopular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, led by PresidentJose Eduardo dos Santos.   Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko mediated talks leading to aJune 24 truce. Savimbi said Thursday this attempt was unrealisticbecause neither side had time to notify their combatants.   Heavy fighting broke out shortly afterward, and both sidesaccused the other of mounting attacks. Guerrilla officers said twoAngolan government offensives have been repulsed, but a thirdcontinues.   Savimbi said his movement seeks new talks, and he proposed a newtruce monitored by a multinational African force, possiblyincluding Nigeria, Togo and Morocco.   The cease-fire would lead the way to a coalition government, andthen elections supervised by the United Nations and Organization ofAfrican Unity, he said. But Savimbi noted this cannot happen unlessthe government agrees to rewrite its constitution, whichestablishes a one-party political system.   ``We cannot join a Marxist-Leninist party,'' Savimbi said.``They have to make room for us.''   The guerrillas are prepared to make ``real concessions'' innegotiations, he said, but also are willing to risk a cutoff offoreign aid rather than agree to unacceptable terms.   Savimbi voiced confidence that U.S. aid will continue, but saidmany Americans are not well-informed about Angola.   ``We want the U.S. to be more active,'' he said, suggestingAmerican officials convince the Soviet Union to join a push for anegotiated settlement.   Moscow still backs the Luanda government. South Africa providedmilitary aid to the rebels during much of the war, but agreed tohalt it as part of a regional accord in exchange for a phasedwithdrawal of the 50,000 Cuban troops fighting on the governmentside in Angola.   Savimbi said he believes Cuba is honoring its withdrawaltimetable.</TEXT></DOC>
