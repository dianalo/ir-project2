Bayamon-based Federal Savings, which has about 4.7 million shares outstanding, said its board approved in principle the proposed transaction and that both sides are negotiating to draft a definitive agreement.    Rogelio Guzman, legal counsel and corporate secretary, said that Federal Savings received the offer Monday and that its board approved the proposal the same day.    In addition to reaching a definitive agreement, the parties would have to obtain regulatory and shareholder approval before the acquisition could be completed.    An earlier agreement in February, under which Federal Savings was to be acquired by Caguas Central Federal Savings Bank of Puerto Rico at $28 a share, expired Sept. 30. Mr. Guzman said Caguas wasn't able to resolve a dispute with regulators over capitalization.    Banco Santander, a commercial bank that is 98%-owned by Banco Santander in Spain, has assets of more than $1.4 billion and 22 offices.    Federal Savings had assets of $1.14 billion as of Sept. 30 and 18 offices. For the nine months ended Sept. 3, Federal Savings, formerly known as Bayamon Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association of Puerto Rico, reported profit of $14.8 million or $3.13 a share, compared with $11.4 million, or $2.43 a share, a year earlier.    Federal Savings' common stock rose $1.50 to close at $17.50 a share yesterday in national over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
