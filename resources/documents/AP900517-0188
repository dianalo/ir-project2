Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider ruled in January thatParamount must pay Buchwald $250,000 and 19 percent of the film'snet profits. Paramount has said it will appeal the decision.   Buchwald claimed the studio stole his script idea titled ``KingFor A Day,'' which dealt with an African prince who comes to livein the United States. The film's credits attributed the idea toMurphy.   In papers filed Wednesday, the humorist's attorney PierceO'Donnell said the share of the net profit due his client andproducer Alan Bernheim should range between $6.9 million and $14.6million.   ``The studio's reaction is that their claims are baseless andunfounded,'' said Robert Schwartz, an attorney for Paramount.   Paramount has claimed it lost $18 million on ``Coming toAmerica,'' even though the 1988 film has grossed $275 millionworldwide.   Buchwald's audit, which covers the period up to December of lastyear, states that producing ``Coming to America'' cost Paramount$22.9 million. A Paramount audit put the figure at $58.5 million.   Papers filed by O'Donnell said several items that Paramountlisted in the cost of making the movie should not have beenincluded.   Among them were $1 million for Murphy's entourage; $900,000 forexcessive fringe benefits and a 15 percent ``overhead'' charge thatamounted to $8 million of the costs all by itself.   The brief said $1.65 million of the $8 million overhead ``wasmerely for writing gross participation checks to Eddie Murphy and(director) John Landis.''</TEXT></DOC>
