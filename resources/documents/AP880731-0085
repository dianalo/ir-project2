Erich Riedl, parlimentary state secretary for the EconomicsMinistry, said in a radio interview that Bonn also would push forthe naming of a West German as financial director to oversee theconsortium's expenses.   The other Airbus nations are Britain, France and Spain.   Riedl said reforms were necessary ``to ensure that aircraftproduction also remains competitive.''   Riedl's comments came a day after West German Finance MinisterGerhard Stoltenberg and Economics Minister Martin Bangemann met todiscuss subsidies to the Airbus program in the context of theproposed sale of aerospace holdings to industrial giantDaimler-Benz. Details of Saturday's talks were not released.   Daimler wants to acquire a 30 percent holding in theMesserschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm aerospace group.   Goverment officials said before the meeting that the talks wereaimed at reducing the government's involvement in Messerschmitt'sDeutsche Airbus division and to increase private industry'scommitment to the national aerospace industry.   Deutsche Airbus is the West German participant in the AirbusIndustrie consortium.   The West German government already has committed billions ofdollars to Airbus already and wants to limit the amount of futuresubsidies. Stoltenberg, facing budget constraints, is eager toprevent additional costs.   Furthermore, U.S. officials and aircraft makers have complainedthat the subsidies to Airbus amount to unfair competition and hurtU.S. manufacturers, and are pressuring Airbus nations to limittheir subsidies.   Daimler-Benz is interested in expanding its aerospaceactivities, but wants protection against Airbus risks.</TEXT></DOC>
