Dunkelberg, economist for the National Federation of Independent Business. &quot;It's not Houston. It's not the Midwest. New England is dynamite.&quot; He adds: &quot;When sales are coming through the door, the market is more forgiving of your mistakes.&quot;    Other experts say to go west. Or south. Or southwest. Or even to Minnesota.    &quot;I don't believe in any single place,&quot; says Jeffrey Timmons, a professor at Babson College's Center for Entreprenurial Studies. &quot;The key is good opportunities, and these you find in the craziest of places.&quot; He mentions Minneapolis; Portland, Ore.; Austin, Texas; Atlanta; Boulder, Colo.; and the Washington-Baltimore Beltway area.    Logically enough, where to start a business depends a lot on the kind of business being started. Contracting companies, for instance, continue to spring up in New York City, where the lure of a building boom more than offsets steep wage rates, regulatory red tape and racketeers. High-tech businesses often start near universities and research departments of big corporations, which act as incubators for these concerns.    Universities especially create the skilled labor pools necessary for high-tech entrepreneurs. &quot;Places that lack quality in the labor force, good telecommunications and a good university are at an enormous disadvantage,&quot; says David L. Birch, president of Cognetics Inc., a market research firm based in Cambridge, Mass.    For some entrepreneurs, a &quot;quality of life&quot; quotient outweighs traditional factors such as cheap labor.    &quot;A few states have a big advantage because of life style,&quot; says economist James F. Smith, director of the Bureau of Business Research at the University of Texas. &quot;That's the new wave. Figure out where you want to live, and find a business that allows you to do it.&quot; He says Austin, to which he moved recently, is one such place; he calls it a &quot;town Peter Pan would love.&quot;    Thanks to technology, it's easier these days for businesses to be out in the sticks. Witness the success of Great Plains Software Inc., a leading maker of accounting software based, somewhat incongruously, in Fargo, N.D.    To be in the national computer-software business, David Burgum, the company's president, says, all he needs is good express mail service, good telecommunications and a good pool of computer programmers and software designers -- the latter being plentiful at three nearby colleges and universities.    One problem, he says, has been educating local bankers about high-technology business. &quot;It's different from walking around and kicking a tractor,&quot; he says. A scarcity of local financing is &quot;a shortcoming,&quot; but not insurmountable, he says.    Picking a state with a strong economy as a place to start a company means betting on the business cycle. Areas hot today can be tomorrow's basket case. Not too long ago, New England was reeling from declines in everything from shipbuilding to textiles. Today, the region's economy is the most robust in the U.S.; its six states posted a 21% increase in business starts last year, Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp. reports, and a 9% drop in business failures.    But oil-producing states, where the streets once seemed to be paved with gold, remain in the doldrums. And much of the Farm Belt, so prosperous after the big Soviet grain sales in the early 1970s, now appears to be mired in permanent recession.    Here, then, are some states a would-be entrepreneur might want to consider, for better or for worse:    Massachusetts   Although Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire outpaced Massachusetts in business starts last year, their economies are relatively small, and the Bay State remains the hub of the region. According to Dun andamp; Bradstreet, business starts there rose nearly 20% in 1986. The state's economic growth is fueled by defense spending, a core of high-tech businesses based on Boston's Route 128 and an increase in import-related services and financial services.    A study conducted by Mr. Birch for Inc. magazine found that from January 1982 to January 1986, Massachusetts had the country's highest percentage of rapidly growing companies, measured by number of employees. Another survey, by the Washington-based Corporation for Enterprise Development, said the state's &quot;excellent education system, well-developed public infrastructure and wealthy . . . financial institutions&quot; helped put it at the top of the list.    California   Business starts grew only 3.2% last year, but its 29,851 new businesses nonetheless accounted for more than 10% of the U.S. total. California's basic strength and diversified economy make it &quot;a world of its own,&quot; Dun andamp; Bradstreet chief economist Joseph W. Duncan says. California received top ranking from the Corporation for Enterprise Development for business vitality, performance and future capacity.    Arizona   Although its business starts declined 9.6% last year, Arizona was first in Inc. magazine's ranking of &quot;dynamic state economies,&quot; with the nation's highest &quot;birth rate&quot; of new businesses from January 1982 to January 1986. In addition, it along with New Hampshire had the third highest rate of rapidly growing new companies, as a percentage of total new companies.    Florida   Dun andamp; Bradstreet says business starts declined 4.2% last year to 17,709; still, the state had more business starts than all of New England. It placed seventh in the Inc. magazine rankings. One of the fastest-growing states, Florida has relatively low taxes and labor costs and a rapidly expanding service sector. The outlook, by most accounts, is for more growth.    One potential problem, Mr. Birch warns, is Florida's lack of first-rate universities. He cites one company whose manufacturing plant is in Orlando but whose research and development is done in Massachusetts. That company &quot;uses Orlando like a Third World country,&quot; he says. If the trend continues, he says, Florida &quot;will have something to worry about.&quot;    Georgia   It continues to boom, but most of the boom is in the Atlanta area; there's growing talk of &quot;two Georgias&quot; -- robust Atlanta, and everything else. In 1986, Georgia was ranked fifth by Inc. magazine for business climate. Dun andamp; Bradstreet's Mr. Duncan calls the state &quot;a strong area on the upside of mixed.&quot; On the downside, according to the Corporation for Enterprise Development, is its labor pool's relatively low educational level, among other things.    Texas   Dun andamp; Bradstreet says business starts fell 16% last year -- to 21,913 from 26,073 -- while business failures soared 56% to 7,674. But no one is counting Texas out. &quot;Texas may well be an ideal place to start up a business,&quot; Mr. Birch says. &quot;The very problems of the economy may offer an opportunity to a person who wants to start a business, especially if they are going to sell outside the state.&quot;    Or, as Mr. Dunkelberg, the independent business federation economist, says: &quot;If you want to sell diamonds and fur coats, forget it. But if you are going to sell a new chip program where all you need is an airport, then cheap office space and cheap labor provide an advantage.&quot;    That has been the case for Michael S. Dell, the 22-year-old chairman of PC's Limited Inc., a computer maker in Austin. While a student at the University of Texas three years ago, he started the company with $1,000 in capital. Last year, the company had sales of $70 million, and today it employs 325 people. Mr. Dell says he has been able to get &quot;outrageous&quot; low lease rates, low-cost services and &quot;wide availability&quot; of highly qualified personnel because of the oil-industry bust.    Louisiana   A long shot by most measures. The state's economy has been hurt both by declining oil prices and by the decline in agricultural exports shipped through New Orleans. Business starts fell 5.9% last year, while failures rose 32%. The state has one of the most poorly educated work forces in the country, and its infrastructure of roads, bridges and utilities, never strong, has been weakened by its economic problems.    Iowa   Things can't get much worse here in the heart of the Farm Belt, so maybe they'll get better. According to Inc., Iowa had the country's lowest rate of business formation between 1982 and 1986. Business starts fell 13% last year. However, Iowa does rank high in venture capital per capita, according to the Corporation for Enterprise Development.    ---   Mr. de Cordoba is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Miami bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
