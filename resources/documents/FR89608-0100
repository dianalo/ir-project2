The data also indicate that these emergingtechnologies will demand the efficiency and flexibility of a well-trainedwork force. High technology training can be conducted most effectively with the activeinvolvement and cooperation of the private sector. Effective partnershipsbetween the private sector and public agencies in vocational educationare an important aspect of the Cooperative Demonstration Program whichis designed, in part, to demonstrate ways in which public agencies in vocationaleducation and the private sector can work together to assist students toattain the advanced level of skills neaded to make the transition fromschool to work. On February 14, 1989, the Secretary published a notice of proposed priority,required activities, and selection criteria for the Cooperative DemonstrationProgram (High Technology) in the<T4> Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 6846). There are no changes between the proposed notice and this final notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes </ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the notice of proposed priority,required activities, and selection criteria, eight parties submitted commentson the proposed notice. An analysis of the comments follows: Cost-Sharing Requirement <T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter stated that under some Federal legislationschools are prohibited from using industry contributions in the form ofequipment, curriculum material, and staff time as a match for Federal dollars.The commenter urged the Department to allow industry contributions to beused as a match. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Although some Federal statutes contain the prohibitiondescribed by the commenter, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Actdoes not impose such a prohibition on the Cooperative Demonstration Program.Further, the regulations for the Cooperative Demonstration Program (34CFR 412.40) permit the use of cash or in-kind contributions (includingthird party in-kind contributions), i.e., the fair market value of facilities,overhead, personnel, and equipment. While the notice of proposed priority,required activities, and selection criteria proposed prohibiting the useof <T3>Federal </T3>funds to cover the cost of equipment used for projectactivities, the notice specifically proposed allowing any necessary equipmentcosts (including those contributed by industry) to be counted toward thecost-sharing requirement for this program. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. Prohibition on Using Federal Funds for Equipment <T3>Comments: </T3>Four commenters argued against the proposal to prohibitthe use of Federal funds to cover the costs of equipment used for projectactivities. Three of the commenters noted that such a prohibition seemedinconsistent with the priority for training persons for high technologyoccupations. Two of the commenters suggested that the proposal might discouragesmaller institutions or those that have not already made investments inhigh technology equipment from submitting applications to the program.Two of the commenters proposed alternatives to the total ban on using Federalfunds for equipment within the following limitations: (1) That Federal funds for equipment be limited to a percentage of totalproject costs; and (2) That proposed Federal funds for equipment be matched at least fifty-fiftywith in-kind contributions of equipment by the training institution orthe private sector. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary does not believe that prohibiting theuse of Federal funds to purchase (or lease) equipment is inconsistent withthe priority to conduct high technology training projects. Since the primary purpose of this competition is to focus on training,the most efficient and effective use of these funds is to promote trainingthat will help students enter the job market. If Federal funds were tobe used to purchase (or lease) equipment, the intended purpose of the competitionwould be diminished. This priority notice will help ensure that the fundsavailable are used where they are most needed_to train students. It is not the intent of the priority notice to exclude smaller institutionsor those that have not already made investments in high technology equipmentfrom submitting applications. Nor is it the intent of the priority noticeto help institutions develop their own capabilities to work in an areaof high technology. The intended purpose, rather, is to demonstrate thetraining of students to become skilled workers or technicians in high technologyoccupations. One of the responsibilities of a partnership under this priority noticeis to address the needs of new and changing technologies in the work placeby sharing resources and searching for ways to improve training to meettheir needs. Purchasing (or leasing), maintaining, and upgrading of hightechnology equipment is an ongoing commitment and responsibility that isbest met by the local partnership rather than the Federal Government.The Secretary feels the use of Federal funds for equipment purchases (orleases) based on a percent of the total project cost and on in-kind matchingcontributions as suggested by two commenters is not a feasible alternative.Cooperative Demonstration projects must be capable of wide replication.If Federal funds are used to purchase (or lease) equipment, the possibilitiesfor replication become somewhat limited. The Secretary believes it is thereforenecessary to prohibit the use of Federal funds for equipment purchase (orlease) if project replication is to be more widely possible and if thereis to be improved accountability for the use of Federal funds for the directtraining of students. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. Scope of ``High Technology Occupations'' <T3>Comments:</T3> Two commenters suggested that the intended areas ofhigh technology be expanded to include: (1) Crafts (specifically thosein the construction field that are traditional in nature but changing dueto technological advances), and (2) emerging high technology areas suchas health care, retailing, and the food service industry. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The term ``high technology,'' as defined in 34 CFR400.4(b) of the regulations, means ``state-of-the-art computer, microelectronic,hydraulic, pneumatic, laser, nuclear, chemical, telecommunication, andother technologies being used to enhance productivity in manufacturing,communication, transportation, agriculture, mining, energy, commercial,and similiar economic activity, and to improve the provision of healthcare.'' The Secretary believes that this definition is broad enough to includemost of the areas specified by the commenters. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. High Technology Priority will Discourage Small, Rural Educational Institutionsfrom Applying <T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter asserted that high technology businessesare concentrated in large population areas of the country and that thiswould exclude small, rural educational institutions from the opportunityto submit applications under this competition. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary agrees that high technology businessestend to be concentrated in urban areas, but does not agree that this wouldexclude rural educational institutions from applying for program funds.Of the thirty-six grants awarded under last year's competition under thisprogram, at least four are conducting high technology projects in ruralareas. Two of these grantees are small community colleges. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. Designating the Military and Publicly Funded Institutions as ``PrivateSector'' is Inappropriate <T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter was concerned that designating the militaryand publicly funded institutions as ``private sector'' would work to thedisadvantage of applicants who are not located near those installations.The commenter wants consideration given to projects that could demonstrateeffective use of small to mid-size employment sites. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The priority calling for cooperation between the privatesector and public agencies in vocational education is intended to be viewednot so much as a partnership between private and public sector entitiesas it is a partnership between employers and educational agencies, institutionsand organizations. Although the military and other publicly funded institutionswould not ordinarily be considered ``private sector'' entities, they aremajor employers and, in some areas, particularly where high technologytraining is concerned, are the only employers with whom a public sectorentity could form a suitable partnership for the purposes of this competition.While the designation of the military and publicly funded institutionsas ``private sector'' makes the priority more inclusive than exclusive,it in no way provides an advantage to applicants involved in partnershipswith large employers. Rather, the designation only makes provision fortreating the military and publicly funded institutions as partners in aproposed project. The Secretary is interested in funding a variety of approaches,and therefore encourages applications involving partnerships with large,mid-size, and small employers. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. Selection Criteria <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter was concerned that no apparent specialconsideration is given to areas that have a critical economic developmentneed or to populations to be served or retrained. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary feels that the components of the evaluationcriterion ``Need'' adequately address these concerns. Item (a), (2), (iii)addresses the area of critical economic need as it relates to activitiesregarding local, regional or State economic development. Item (a), (2),(iv) addresses the vocational training, services/re-training to be providedto individuals to meet occupational needs. Since specific populations arenot part of the priority, it is not necessary for them to be identifiedin the evaluation criteria. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. Emphasize Certain Industries <T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter suggested that the high technology priorityshould give special emphasis to industries that are significantly affectedby foreign competition. <T3>Discussion:</T3> Although the Secretary recognizes that some industriesthat are significantly affected by foreign competition are experiencingdifficulties, he feels that there are other major problem areas of equalconcern. Because of the varied problems affecting the workplace, the Secretarybelieves that this priority should remain broad enough to address as manyproblems as possible, including the problems of industries affected byforeign competition. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. Priority In accordance with the Education Department General Administrative Regulations(EDGAR) at 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3), the Secretary establishes an absolute priorityfor the fiscal year 1990 grant competition under the Cooperative DemonstrationProgram for projects that focus on high technology training efforts thatare also models of cooperation between the private sector and public agenciesin vocational education. In order to maximize the use of Federal fundsfor the direct training of students and to enhance project replicability,the Secretary prohibits the use of Federal funds to purchase or lease equipmentto conduct project activities. Any necessary equipment costs may be countedtoward the cost-sharing requirement for this program. Specifically, the Secretary supports projects that_(1) Train persons to become skilled workers or technicians in high technologyoccupations (including providing related instruction to individuals undergoingapprenticeship training) or to become skilled workers or technicians involvedin the production, installation, operation, and maintenance of high technologyequipment, systems, and processes:(2) Are examples of successful cooperation between the private sector (includingemployers, consortia of employers, labor organizations, building tradecouncils, and other private agencies, organizations, and institutions)and public agencies in vocational education (including State and localeducational agencies, public postsecondary educational institutions, publicinstitutions of higher education, and other public agencies, organizations,and institutions). For the purpose of this competition the military andpublicly funded laboratories are considered employers that could be usedas private sector partners in a proposed project; <T3>and </T3>(3) Expend no Federal funds for equipment, as defined in 34 CFR 74.132.<ITAG tagnum="84">Activities </ITAG>In support of this priority, an applicant is required to submit, as partof its application, a written assurance that it will cooperate, if selected,with a planned national evaluation study of projects funded under thiscompetition. An applicant is also required to submit, as part of its application, writtenassurances from each public agency in vocational education and each privatesector entity that they will participate in the planning and operationof the proposed project as described in the application. <ITAG tagnum="84">Criteria for Evaluation of Applications </ITAG>For the Fiscal Year 1990 grant competition under the Cooperative DemonstrationProgram, the Secretary will use the following selection criteria and assignpoints to the selection criteria as indicated: (a) <T3>Need. </T3>(15 points) (1) The Secretary reviews each application forinformation that shows the need for and the soundness of the rationalefor the project.
