The case is the latest in a widening crackdown on computercrime that has led to searches, computer seizures and arrestsin a dozen states. Federal agents have targeted such groupsas the &quot;Legion of Doom,&quot; a loose-knit band of mostly younghackers who made a sport of breaking into others' systems butinsisted they caused no damage.</LP><TEXT>   Leonard Rose Jr., 32 years old, of Middletown, Md., agreedto plead guilty to two charges against him in Chicago andBaltimore and will serve two concurrent, one-year prisonterms. He'll be eligible for parole in 10 months.   The hacker cases have been closely watched because someraise constitutional issues of free speech, attorneys said.Mr. Rose, for example, wasn't charged with breaking intocomputers or engaging in a conspiracy to do so -- he wasaccused of possessing programs that could have been used byothers to break into computers. Because he pleaded guilty tonarrower charges, however, such issues weren't addressed.   Indeed, in the plea agreement, Mr. Rose agreed only tocharges that he misappropriated, shared and modified parts ofa program called Unix, licensed by American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. While a commercial license costs $77,000, Unixhas been widely available at nominal cost for years oncollege campuses and among programmers.   Mitchell Kapor, founder and former chairman of LotusDevelopment Corp., who paid for Mr. Rose's defense,questioned the severity of Mr. Rose's sentencing. &quot;If theysent to prison everyone with some unlicensed Unix code, thejails would overflow,&quot; Mr. Kapor said.   He suggested that Mr. Rose was being made an example tofrighten other hackers. &quot;He didn't profit from this. He usedpoor judgment copying the program, but you don't send peopleto prison for that.&quot;   In a statement late Friday, Fred Foreman, the U.S.Attorney in Chicago, made it clear the government wasn'tabout to back off on its efforts. &quot;People who invade ourtelecommunications and related computer systems for profit orpersonal amusement create immediate and serious consequencesfor the public,&quot; he said. &quot;Those who choose to use theirintelligence and talent in an attempt to disrupt these vitalnetworks will find themselves vigorously prosecuted.&quot;   Mr. Rose -- who went by the name &quot;Terminus&quot; whencommunicating with other computer users on electronicnetworks -- was a &quot;Legion of Doom&quot; member, prosecutorsalleged. But his attorney, Jane Macht, said Mr. Rose didn'tbelong to the group. Mr. Rose couldn't be reached forcomment.   In the government's statement, Mr. Rose is alleged to haveput a hidden &quot;trojan horse&quot; program into a portion of theUnix software that secretly stored the personal passwords ofpeople on the system.</TEXT></DOC>
