Judge, (617) 565-3248;FTS 835-3248.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On June 29, 1987, the MassachusettsDepartment of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE) submitted proposedrevisions to EPA including a proposed Plan Approval between the DEQE andDuro for incorporation into Massachusetts' SIP. The proposed Plan Approvalestablishes and imposes RACT to control VOC emissions from Duro. RACT mustbe defined for Duro under Massachusetts SIP Rule 310 CMR 7.18(17), ``ReasonablyAvailable Control Technology (RACT).'' Massachusetts Rule 310 CMR 7.18(17)requires the DEQE to impose RACT requirements on otherwise unregulatedstationary sources of VOC with potential emissions greater than 100 tonsper year. EPA approved Rule 310 CMR 7.18(17) on November 9, 1983 (48 FR51480) as part of Massachusetts' Ozone Attainment Plan. That approval stipulatedthat all RACT determinations made under this rule would be submitted toEPA as source-specific SIP revisions.Massachusetts does not have a regulation specifically for Duro's fabricprinting operations. The Massachusetts regulation for fabric coating onlyapplies to facilities that apply a uniform layer of material across theentire width of the fabric substrate. Duro prints fabric by applying itsprint pastes with a series of application rolls, each with partial coverage.Therefore, the SIP's fabric coating regulation does not apply. Additionally,the SIP's regulation for graphics arts sources does not apply to Duro becausethe regulation applies specifically to flexographic, packaging rotogravure,and publication rotogravure printing. The processes that Duro utilizes,roller printing and rotary screen printing, are significantly differentfrom those processes.The DEQE has proposed emission limitations in its proposed Plan Approvalwhich enforceably reduce Duro's VOC emissions by 74 percent. In 1980, thebaseline year of the design of Massachusetts ozone attainment plan, Duro'semissions were 149 tons per year (TPY). The proposed Plan Approval enforceablylimits Duro's VOC emissions to 0.156 tons per day (39 TPY). In addition,prior to final rulemaking by EPA, the DEQE must amend its Plan Approvalto limit the VOC content of Duro's coating inks to a level no higher thanthose coating inks currently used by the company (at the time of the proposedPlan Approval). Consequently, this Plan Approval will then include a poundsof VOC per unit of volume of ink as well as a limit on overall emissionsof VOC.In order to determine if a 74 percent reduction in VOC emissions representsa reasonable level of control for Duro, EPA's Control Technology Guideline(CTG) Documents for source categories whose VOC emitting processes arecomparable to that of fabric printing were consulted. The main differencebetween graphics arts printing and fabric printing is in the substratesactually printed. For this reason, the emission limits suggested in theEPA publication entitled, ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions fromExisting Stationary Sources_Volume VIII: Graphic Arts_Rotogravure and Flexography,''(EPA-450/2-78-033) could be reasonable for some types of fabric printing.The fabric printing done by rollers at Duro would be most similar to rotogravureprinting because, as in the definition of rotogravure'', the images beingprinted are recessed, rather than raised, as in flexographic printing.The CTG for graphic arts identifies two types of rotogravure printing,packaging rotogravure and publication rotogravure. These two types differas to the type of substrates printed. While neither type of rotogravureprinting specifically includes fabric printing, packaging rotogravure products(detergent cartons, etc.) are slightly more similar in function to printedfabrics than are publication rotogravure products (magazines, etc.) TheCTG recommends a 65 percent overall reduction in VOC emissions from packagingrotogravure and a 75 percent overall reduction for publication rotogravurewhen using add-on controls. In addition to roller printers, Duro uses rotaryscreen printers for the majority of its printing operations. Rotary screenprinting is not similar to the processes covered by the graphics arts CTG.Despite this fact, it is instructive that none of the Graphic Arts CTGsuggests greater than a 75 percent overall reduction for any printing operation.Therefore in light of reductions recommended in CTG's for other printingprocesses. A reduction on the order of 75 percent would be reasonable forrotary screen printing operations.The DEQE has determined that a 74 percent reduction for Duro's entire facilityconstitutes RACT. This is consistent with the CTG anticipated reductionsfrom graphic arts sources. To achieve this reduction on a daily basis,the DEQE has limited Duro's emissions to 0.156 tons per day for each dayof its 250 days of operation per year (39 TPY total). In addition, priorto final rulemaking by EPA, the DEQE must amend its Plan Approval to includea VOC emission limit for each of Duro's inks (i.e., pounds of VOC per poundof solids). Each of these inks must be limited to a specific VOC contentno higher than its current VOC content (at the time of the proposed PlanApproval). The DEQE's formal SIP submittal must also include justificationthat the emission limit in pounds of VOC per pound of solids for each inkrepresents RACT (e.g., present Duro's attempts at reformulation or substitutionto inks with a lower VOC content). The DEQE submitted its proposed PlanApproval as a source-specific SIP revision to fulfill the commitment madein the Massachusetts ozone attainment plan to determine and impose RACTon non-CTG sources with the potential emissions greater than 100 TPY.EPA is proposing to approve this Massachusetts State Implementation Planrevision for Duro, which was submitted on June 29, 1987, and is solicitingpublic comments on issues discussed in this notice. These comments willbe considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participatein the Federal rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to theaddress above.These revisions are being proposed under a procedure called ``parallelprocessing'' (47 FR 27073). If the proposed revisions are substantiallychanged, EPA will evaluate those changes and may publish a revised NPR.If no substantial changes are made in areas other than those areas citedin this notice, EPA will publish a Final Rulemaking Notice on the revisions.The final rulemaking action by EPA will occur only after the SIP revisionshave been adopted by Massachusetts and submitted to EPA for incorporationinto the SIP. ``Parallel processing,'' it is estimated, will reduce thetime necessary for final approval of these SIP revisions by 3 to 4 months.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve a proposed Plan Approval submitted by the DEQEas a SIP revision request for Duro Textile Printing in Fall River, Massachusetts.The proposed Plan Approval limits Duro's emissions to 0.156 tons VOC perday to be met on each day of its 250 days of operation (a total of 39 tonsper year). EPA's final approval is contingent upon DEQE's amending thePlan Approval to require that Duro use coating inks with a VOC contentno higher than those inks currently in use at the facility.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (See46 FR 8709).The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the plan revisionswill be based on whether it meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(A)-(K)and 110(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in40 CFR Part 51.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations, Ozone,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: September 16, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Michael R.
