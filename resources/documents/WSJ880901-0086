This thesis was much heard during the Democratic Convention as an argument that the country needs a change.    Certainly the country needs better ways of addressing poverty, but social, not economic, policies are the ones at fault. &quot;Pro-family&quot; has become a political catch phrase but it aptly defines family disintegration as central to the pathology of the poor.    Census Bureau statistics, arbitrarily defining the poverty level as anything below $11,611 in annual cash income for a family of four, also deserve scrutiny. For starters, the numbers made public yesterday are out of date. They don't reflect benefits to the poor from this year's economic resurgence and the 2.3 million new jobs it has created. And cash income, while important, doesn't tell everything about a family's economic status.    Kate Walsh O'Beirne, a former deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, concludes in a Heritage Foundation study that the Census data &quot;systematically underestimate income (and) give an unduly pessimistic impression of poverty in America.&quot; By the latest Census measure, 32.5 million Americans, or 13.5% of the population, live in poverty. But Miss O'Beirne notes that 70% of the poor receive in-kind income, such as medical benefits, subsidized housing and food stamps. Depending on how these benefits are counted, the poverty rate could fall to anywhere between 8.5% and 11%, according to Census Bureau analysis. The effect is especially large for elderly Americans, whose poverty rate could drop to 2.1% from the official 12.2%.    Census acknowledges a &quot;tendency in household surveys for respondents to underreport their income.&quot; If only 10% of the unreported &quot;underground&quot; income that has been variously estimated by economists trickled down to the poor, it could add anything from $17 billion to $50 billion a year.    As to actual standards of living, Census doesn't take into account sharp regional differences in living costs. An $11,000 cash income for a rural homeowner in a Midwest town might stretch reasonably well, whereas it would be totally inadequate in Washington, D.C. Census uses the Consumer Price Index in adjusting its poverty threshold, but the CPI market-basket approach doesn't take into account the possibilities all consumers have for substituting less expensive items when prices rise on some market-basket items.    None of this would be especially significant if it were not for the fact that the poverty numbers are so widely misused in political debate. As a result the debate often misses the core issue: that better social policies are the key to giving more Americans a decent living standard. If properly used, Census numbers could guide the debate along constructive lines.    For example, in 1986 only 6.1% of the 51.5 million &quot;intact families,&quot; those with husband and wife present, were classified as poor. But among the 10.4 million female-headed families, the rate was 34.6%, a percentage that remains roughly constant in the latest study. This suggests that the U.S. problem with poverty is in large degree traceable to the problem of family structure.    Yet even though this should be well-known by now, government persists in welfare policies inimical to family cohesiveness. In the past quarter-century, as government has greatly expanded its role as social provider, the number of intact families has declined in inverse proportion.    Consider if a poor, unmarried woman gets pregnant. She does not turn to the father of her child for financial support (as she might have done, say, 30 years ago), but to the federal government. With the government a surrogate for the father, he is rendered insignificant. There is little incentive for the father and mother to marry and raise a family, or for the father to seek steady work. If there were, that family would have an excellent chance of lifting itself out of poverty.    The obvious conclusion is that the best way to fight lingering poverty is to reverse those policies that had such deleterious effects on family structure among the poor. But that issue won't be addressed so long as politicians who profess concern about poverty run around trying to prove that two and two make one and an economic boom is not an economic boom. </TEXT></DOC>
