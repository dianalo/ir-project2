Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani also said theinsurgents' fight to take the strategic eastern city of Jalalabadhas slackened. The heavy rocket and artillery attack has dwindledto sporadic gunfire, he said.   Amani said the anti-communist fighters have blocked the SalangHighway at two towns north of the capital, Olang and Jabalassanaa,cutting off Kabul's only land link with the Soviet border.   Security forces have launched an extensive mopping-up operationand hope to reopen the highway Friday, he said.   Diplomats in Kabul said the blockade has nearly 140,000 tons offood piled up at the Soviet border. Amani said the last convoybrought food on April 6.   But diplomats say the highway has been closed for at least twoweeks and is severely damaged in some places. They credit theclosure to guerrilla commander Ahmed Shah Masood and his group,Jamati-I-Islami. The insurgents say they control 20 miles of thehighway.   A Soviet airlift of food and military equipment continues toKabul. But it carries less than half the 650 tons of flour thatresidents need each day.   In the east, Amani said, only military convoys have traveled inthe past two weeks on the highway to Jalalabad, the key route toPakistan.   ``People are afraid and don't want to travel,'' but conditionshave improved, he said.   ``The severity of the situation in Jalalabad has decreased inthe past 24 hours,'' Amani said.   One government soldier was killed in sporadic gunfire, and thetroops killed 35 insurgents and wounded 38 others, he said.   The fight for Jalalabad is the first guerrilla offensive sincethe Soviet Union completed its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan onFeb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated accord.   If Jalalabad fell, it would be the biggest city the insurgentshave captured and would give them momentum to advance on Kabul, 70miles to the west.   The capital has been relatively quiet this week, with fewincoming rockets.   Elsewhere, Amani said, guerrillas continued attacks on thesouthern towns of Khost and Ghazni.   In Khost, soldiers killed 185 guerrillas and lost nine troops.Nine civilians were wounded and two houses destroyed, he said.There were no casualties in Ghazni, he said.   It is impossible to verify government or guerrilla reports onthe state of the war. Both sides sometimes exaggerate.   Amani said government troops foiled a guerrilla attempt to moveweapons and ammunition through the mountains of Paghamn region eastof Kabul. Soldiers fired on the guerrillas, who were carrying theweapons on donkeys and mules to fellow fighters in northernAfghanistan, he said without mentioning casualties.   Government troops had another success on Tuesday, he said, whenthey forced guerrillas to retreat from Sarobi town, halfway betweenKabul and Jalalabad and the site of a power station that supplieselectricity to Kabul.   The insurgents, who call themselves mujahedeen or Islamic holywarriors, have been fighting nearly 11 years to topple theMarxists, who seized power in a coup.   Moscow backs the Afghan government, while Saudi Arabia, theUnited States, Pakistan and China support the mujahedeen.</TEXT></DOC>
