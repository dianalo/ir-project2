The device consistsof a set of two focusing electrodes and 24 measurement electrodes arrangedin a circle. The current emitted by each of them is the parameter whichis to be analysed. The exploration is made at a rate of 24 measurementsper second. The resolution at the borehole wall is at present 8 x 10cm. The closer the electrodes are to the wall, the better is the resolutionand it is optimal when the device is directly pressed against the rock.Several versions of the detector are currently being perfected, amongwhich an instrument giving an electrical image of the wall in real timewhile the tool is being moved up and down into the borehole.</TEXT></DOC>
