Speaking at a White House news conference, Bush said, ``... Therewas a period of time when we had excellent relations with Iran.''   At one pont, Bush said he wanted to make ``a broad appeal,transcending Iran, to anybody that can be helpful to get thehostages out.''   Bush was queried about comments from Iran's president AliKhamenei, who criticized him for saying in his inaugural addressthat Bush would appreciate help in gaining the release of the nineAmericans held hostage in Lebanon.   ``It was America which expressed interest in resuming ties withIran; Iran does not need America,'' Tehran radio quoted Khamenei assaying.   Bush said he was unaware of the remarks.   But stopping short of listing specific conditions for a renewalof the diplomatic relations that were severed in early 1980, Bushsaid Iran could make progress with the United States through ``therenunciation of terror in any form, and facilitating to the degreethey can the release of the hostages.''   Bush, when queried, said Iran was not holding the hostages,adding that ``different groups'' were involved in their fate.   But to the question of whether Iran exercised control over them,Bush said the United States has ``varying degrees of intelligence onthat, various assessments as to how much control they have overHezbollah or these families or whoever it is.''   Hezbollah is a pro-Iranian Moslem fundamentalist group thatoperates in Lebanon, where the hostages are believed to be held.   ``I would just reiterate my view that the way to improverelations is to let them go, give these people their freedom _ theydidn't do anything wrong,'' Bush said.   Asked if Iran could affect the hostages' release, he responded,``I think they can have influence.''   Ties between the United States and Iran were severed soon afterthe 1979 Islamic revolution, when militant Iranian students tookover the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for444 days.   Fifteen foreigners, including the nine Americans, are believedheld hostage in west Beirut by pro-Iranian factions.   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
