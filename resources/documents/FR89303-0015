The authority to approveratification actions may not be redelegated.(b) <T3>Procedures. </T3>(1) Generally, the Government is not bound by agreementsor contractual commitments made by persons to whom contracting authorityhas not been delegated. Such unauthorized acts may be in violation of theFederal Property and Administrative Services Act, other Federal laws, theFAR, the GSAR, and good acquisition practice. Therefore, such unauthorizedcontractual commitments should be considered as serious deviations fromauthorized conduct and consideration given to initiating disciplinary actionin appropriate cases. In any instances where suspected irregularities mayinvolve fraud against the Government, or any type of misconduct that mightbe punishable as a criminal offense, either the employee's supervisor orthe contracting officer should immediately report the matter to the Officeof the Inspector General with a request for a complete investigation.(2) The individual who made the unauthorized commitment shall furnish theappropriate contracting director all records and documents concerning thecommitment and a complete written statement of facts, including, but notlimited to, a statement as to why normal acquisition procedures were notfollowed, why the contractor was selected and a list of other sources considered,description of work or products, estimated or agreed upon contract price,citation of appropriation available, and a statement regarding the statusof the performance. Under exceptional circumstances, such as when the personwho made the unauthorized commitment is no longer available to attest tothe circumstances of the unauthorized commitment, the contracting directormay waive the requirement that the responsible employee initiate and documentthe request for ratification, provided that a written determination ismade stating that a commitment was in fact made by an employee who shallbe identified in the determination.(3) The appropriate contracting director will assign the request for ratificationaction to an individual contracting officer for processing. The contractingofficer assigned the action will be responsible for preparing a summarystatement of facts addressing the limitations in FAR 1.602-3(c) and makinga recommendation as to whether the transaction should be ratified and statingthe reasons therefore. Advice against express ratification should includea recommendation for other appropriate disposition. When ratification isnot permissible due to legal improprieties in the procurement, the contractingofficer may recommend that payment be made for services rendered on a quantummeruit basis (the reasonable value of work or labor) or for goods furnishedon a quantum valebant basis (the reasonable value of goods sold and delivered)provided there is a showing that the Government has received a benefit.(See FAR 1.602-3(d).)(4) The request for ratification, the information required by paragraph3, above, and a recommendation for corrective action to preclude recurrence,must be forwarded, through appropriate channels, to the HCA for consideration.(5) The HCA, upon receipt and review of the complete file, may approvethe ratification if determined to be in the Government's best interest,or direct other disposition as appropriate. Acquisitions that have beenapproved for ratification shall be forwarded to the appropriate contractingofficer for issuance of the necessary contractual documents. If the requestfor ratification is not justified, the HCA shall return the request withoutapproval and provide an explanation for the decision not to approve ratification.(6) Each HCA shall maintain a separate file containing a copy of each requestfor approval to ratify an unauthorized contractual commitment. This fileshall be made available for review by the Office of Acquisition Policyand the Inspector General.<ITAG tagnum="80">501.675, 501.675-1, 501.675-2 and 501.674-3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Removed]</ITAG>3.
