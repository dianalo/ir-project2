<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-15-0853 </DOCNO><TEXT>A detailed cost study of the ESPRESSO blanket concept for the tandem mirrorfusion reactor (TMR) has been performed to complement the thermal-hydraulicparametric study and to help narrow down the choice of parameters forthe final design. The ESPRESSO blanket consists of a number of structurallyindependent ring modules. Each ring module is made up of a number ofmutually pressure-supporting canisters containing arrays of breeder tubes.Two separate helium coolant flows are used: a main flow to cool the tubebank and a cooler first-wall flow.</TEXT></DOC>
