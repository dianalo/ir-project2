But some analysts say the yields have to get higher to make itworth investing in municipalities that face severe budget deficits,particularly those in the slumping Northeast.   For cities and states already strapped, higher yields raise thecost of borrowing money.   Massachusetts on Thursday had to offer yields as high as 7.97percent for a $1.3 billion package of revenue bonds. That was about1.5 percentage points higher than a Maryland offering earlier inthe week.   The Massachusetts bonds were rated BBB by Standard andamp; Poor'sCorp., while the Maryland issue got the highest AAA rating.Massachusetts is running a budget deficit only two months into itsfiscal year.   The so-called quality spread, which compares yields oflower-rated municipal bonds to the highest rated, has been verynarrow recently, but is begining to widen, analysts say.   Yields on 30-year A-rated revenue bonds are running 45 to 55hundredths of a percentage point higher than the yields forAAA-rated general obligation bonds, according to Municipal MarketData Inc. The quality spreads are narrower for shorter-term issues.   Investors ``concerns are legitimate in that quality spreads arestill so narrow that they're not getting paid for their creditrisk,'' said George Friedlander, municipal market analyst at SmithBarney, Upham andamp; Co.   Philadelphia's inability to sell about $375 million inshort-term notes and officials' predictions that the city will runout of cash around Dec. 1, have prompted municipal bond investorsto begin focusing on credit quality.   While the market continues to be driven by developments in theMiddle East, concern has been growing since early summer over howbudget deficits and recession, which cuts into tax revenues, wouldaffect the ability of cities and states to make debt payments.   ``We have been concerned about the trend in a lot of state andlocal governments asked to bear a larger share of entitlements andother programs required by the federal government, while at sametime revenue counted on to pay for the programs is not there,''said Neal Atterman, municipal research director at Kidder, Peabodyandamp; Co.   The stock price of MBIA, a major municipal bond insurer, hasbeen particularly hard hit by the worries over credit quality. Thestock last week sunk to around $25 from about $37 the week before.   Many investors feel MBIA is heavily exposed to Philadelphia'sdebt and could suffer if Philadelphia defaults. However, thecompany said exposure to Philadelphia debt is not excessive andStandard andamp; Poor's affirmed MBIA's AAA rating.   Standard andamp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service Inc., havelowered their ratings on Philadelphia's general obligation bonds,which are backed by the city's faith and credit. Sandamp;P ranks thebonds at CCC and Moody's puts them at B, giving the debt junk-bondstatus.   General obligation bonds are usually viewed as more secure thanrevenue bonds, which depend on user fees such as bridge tolls tomake payments.   However, some are beginning to look at selected revenue bonds asmore recession-proof since it has been Philadelphia's generalobligation bonds that are considered to be the larger credit risk.   ``We've been of the philosophy that some are better off with aset revenue stream. People are still going to pay tolls in arecession,'' said Nicole Anderes, head of municipal research at NewYork-based Roosevelt andamp; Cross Inc., an investment firm that focuseson Northeast municipalities.   Some see the chances of Pennsylvania allowing its largest cityto default as slim and point out that investors who held on totheir bonds during the fiscal crises in New York and Clevelandduring the 1970s survived intact.   For the investor who could survive a long period of illiquidity,it might be worth the risk, some say.   Steven J. Hueglin, executive vice president at Gabriele, Hueglinandamp; Cashman Inc., says Philadelphia's bonds are a good speculativeinvestment, particularly the general obigation issue.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Monday, Oct. 1</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
