The bulk of new selling space will go to the Columbus, Ohio-based company's Limited Express, Victoria's Secrets and Limited stores, Chairman Leslie Wexner told securities analysts in New York.    &quot;They haven't significantly changed their spending budget in recent months, but they are still trying to digest Lane Bryant,&quot; the large-sized clothing division where sales have been weak, said Robert Corea, a retail analyst with the Ohio Co.    The specialty retailer, whose profit growth has been slowed by the current sluggishness in consumer spending, also said December sales are consistent with November's. Limited has said that November sales were 2% above last year, but that comparable store sales declined 5% from November 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
