Among the possible reasons put forward by experts: attempts bythe Soviets to trigger eavesdropping devices, to interfere withU.S. intelligence-gathering operations or to affect the health,minds or behavior of Americans working in the embassy.   Low-power microwave signals ``continue to be detected'' at theembassy, according to the State Department's Bureau of DiplomaticSecurity.   However, the department has ceased special efforts to monitorthe health of U.S. personnel exposed to the mysterious Soviet beams.   Over the years, several studies to investigate potential effectsof the Moscow radiation led to controversial results. In somecases, the projects were terminated over the objections ofresearchers.   The United States has made a series of diplomatic protests tothe Kremlin over the microwave situation, beginning at least asearly as the Glassboro summit in June 1967.   The Associated Press examined 5,000 pages of declassifieddocuments from the State Department, the Central IntelligenceAgency, and the Pentagon under the Freedom of Information Act andinterviewed dozens of current and former U.S. officials, scientificresearchers, medical specialists and attorneys.   Many questions remain about the microwave bombardment, which hasinvolved a variety of transmitter sites, frequency ranges,modulations and power levels over a time span stretching from justafter Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's death in 1953 to Mikhail S.Gorbachev's current reform drive.   Nonetheless, these key facts emerge:   _The Moscow microwaves affair has had broader implications inseveral areas, including U.S.-Soviet political relations, researchinto the biological effects of non-ionizing radiation, electronicintelligence-gathering operations and employee-management relationsat the State Department.   _The U.S. government apparently has succeeded in fighting backlawsuits and administrative claims totalling about $250 millionbrought by employees who were exposed to the Moscow radiation ortheir dependents.   _Some American scientists and medical specialists investigatingthe problem have been seriously concerned about a possible Sovietbloc lead in research on the use of radio-frequency and microwaveradiation for ``mind control'' and other weapons applications.   _Significant questions remain over the validity of anepidemiological study of Moscow embassy personnel carried out in1976-78 by Johns Hopkins University under contract to the StateDepartment. The study found no adverse health effects among embassyworkers.   _Shielding of the embassy against the Soviet beams was firstrecommended 11 years before protective screening was finallyinstalled.   _Certain U.S. personnel in Moscow apparently were exposed tosignificant amounts of electromagnetic radiation from sourceswithin the embassy, posing the risk of possible ``synergistic''effects from combined exposure to such radiation and the Sovietmicrowaves.   Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with afrequency range from 300 megahertz (300 million cycles per second)up to 300 gigahertz (300 billion cycles per second). The main usesof microwaves are in radar, UHF (ultra-high frequency) television,long-distance telephone links, satellite communications, cooking,medical treatment and a variety of industrial processes.   The State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security said in arecent statement that ``microwave signals ... continue to bedetected at the Moscow embassy chancery.'' It said the Sovietsignals cover a broad frequency range, from 5 to 11 gigahertz; are``usually on for a couple of hours a day'' and typically have apower level of 0.1 microwatt per square centimeter outside thebuilding.   Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said: ``We are, of course,concerned about this situation. In the past, we've protested when(microwave power) levels have exceeded those we consider safe.We're prepared to do so again, should we determine that they poseany threat whatsoever to our staff, however remote.''   The declassified documents disclose that the bombardment of theMoscow embassy drew expressions of serious concern in the mid-1970sfrom two CIA directors _ William E. Colby and George Bush.   They also reveal that this concern came years after experts hadinitially recommended installing shielding to protect Americansworking inside the embassy from the radiation being beamed by theSoviets.   Eleven years passed between when scientific advisers proposedshielding of the embassy and when the protective screening actuallywas installed.   In an April 3, 1965 memorandum, a CIA scientific consultant,whose name was deleted from the document, called for ``selection ofsuitable copper screening and mandatory coverage of all windowopenings'' at the 10-story embassy.   Installation of aluminum screening was finally started on Feb.6, 1976 _ at the same time that special briefings were held toinform embassy personnel about the microwave radiation, which untilthen had been kept secret from all except a handful of seniorofficials.   Ten days later, the CIA's concern over the Moscow problem wasreflected in a ``Dear Larry'' letter from Bush to Lawrence S.Eagleburger, deputy undersecretary of state for management.   Bush wrote that while he had been told by a CIA expert that datafrom biomedical research were insufficient to prove that the Sovietbeams posed a health hazard, ``the clinical evidence pertaining toseveral embassy staff members, recently obtained by the State(Department) Medical Services, makes it prudent in our judgment toconsider MUTS signal emanations as potentially hazardous.''   ``MUTS'' was the code name for the Soviet beams.   Colby's expression of concern, in a Nov. 26, 1975 letter toEagleburger, came five weeks after the Soviets put into operation asecond microwave transmitter _ code-named MUTS-2 _ atop a buildingjust south of the embassy. This was in addition to a microwave beam_ known as MUTS or MUTS-1 _ aimed at the chancery from the roof ofan apartment building east of the embassy, across TchaikovskyStreet.   Colby wrote that ``the increased probability of health injuriesto personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow ... (CIA deletion) ...warrant our immediate attention.''   ``I have been briefed on the implication that the MUTS andMUTS-2 signals are a possible cause of recent serious healthproblems of the embassy,'' the CIA chief said.   Colby told Eagleburger that Donald A. Myers, a CIA specialist onbiological and health effects of non-ionizing radiation, would beavailable to assist the State Department in evaluating microwaveradiation levels in Moscow.   Myers already had spent a week in Moscow in July 1975 workingwith State Department security officers. He returned to the Sovietcapital for a 16-day visit in December 1975 to re-analyze thesituation in the wake of MUTS-2 going into operation.   Three days after Myers arrived in Moscow, a CIA memorandumsummmarized Myers' initial observations: ``The CW (continuous wave)signals which were active during October and then again since 30November are a cause for increased concern, because the powerdensity of the emanations is often concentrated within one orseveral narrow bandwidths at frequencies that can produceundesirable biological effects.''   ``Perhaps the most distressing observation is that the signalcomposition and orientation continue to change, and that thegeneral trend of such change since July would appear to be in thedirection of an increased health risk,'' it said.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
