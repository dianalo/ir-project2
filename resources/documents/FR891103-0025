McKinney Homeless Assistance Act(the McKinney Act) (42 U.S.C. 11361) establishes requirements for the ComprehensiveHomeless Assistance Plan (the Plan). The Plan requirements govern the provisionof assistance under the four homeless assistance authorities administeredby HUD under title IV of the McKinney Act. These are:(1) The Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) program under subtitle B of titleIV of the Act (42 U.S.C. 11371 <T3>et seq.</T3>) (24 CFR part 576); (2) The Supportive Housing Demonstration program under subtitle C of titleIV of the Act (42 U.S.C. 11381 <T3>et seq.</T3>) (24 CFR part 577 (Transitional Housing) and part 578(Permanent Housing for Handicapped Homeless Persons));(3) The Supplemental Assistance for Facilities to Assist the Homeless (SAFAH)program under subtitle D of title IV of the Act (42 U.S.C. 11391 <T3>et seq.</T3>); and(4) The Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments program for the ModerateRehabilitation of Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Units for the Homeless undersection 441 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 11401). Under subtitle A of the McKinney Act, HUD may not make assistance availableunder any of these authorities to, or within the jurisdiction of, Statesor certain larger metropolitan cities or urban counties (ESG formula citiesor counties), unless the jurisdiction has a HUD-approved Plan. In addition,applications for assistance under these programs must include a certificationfrom the State or ESG formula city or county that the proposed activitiesare consistent with the Plan.Subtitle A of title IV of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance AmendmentsAct of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-628, approved November 7, 1988) (the 1988 Amendments)made a number of changes to the Plan requirements originally enacted inthe McKinney Act. These changes provide for:(1) Annual submission of the Plan;(2) Sharing of information copies of the Plan among States and ESG formulacities and counties;(3) Consideration of available facilities to assist the homeless in preparingthe Plan;(4) Identification of a contact point for information on the contents ofthe jurisdiction's Plan;(5) An assurance in the Plan that the State or ESG formula city or countywill carry out a policy to ensure that facilities assisted under the Actare free from the illegal use, possession, or distribution of drugs andalcohol;(6) A substantive response by the State or ESG formula city or county totimely HUD recommendations on the annual Plan performance report; and(7) Information from Federal agencies to help coordinate State homelessefforts. Section 485 of the 1988 Amendments required the Department to publish aNotice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> by January 9, 1989 to implement the revisionsmade to the Plan by the 1988 Amendments. The provisions of the Notice wouldgovern the Plan's requirements until publication of a final rule basedon the Notice_required by section 485 to be published no later than November7, 1989.On December 28, 1988, the Department published the required Notice in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 52600). The Notice stated that it hadtwo purposes: to announce the Plan requirements, as amended by the 1988Amendments; and to request public comments on the requirements. This finalrule completes the Department's implementation of section 485 of the 1988Amendments, and codifies the Plan's requirements.Readers should be aware that the Department is reviewing the Plan requirementscontained in this final rule, and intends to undertake notice and commentrule making in the near future to revise the Plan requirements in thisfinal rule. The proposed rule will address a number of areas, includingthe content, timing, and review/approval of the Plan and the annual performancereport.<ITAG tagnum="84">Job Training for the Homeless</ITAG>For the job training for the homeless provisions administered by the Departmentof Labor (Title VII, subtitle C of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless AssistanceAct) the public is advised to contact: John D. Heinberg, Office of StrategicPlanning and Policy Development; Employment and Training Administration;Room N-5629; Frances Perkins Building; 200 Constitution Avenue; Washington,DC 20210; telephone (202) 535-0682.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Public Comments </ITAG>The Department received two public comments on the December 28, 1988 Notice:One from a State Department of Social Services, the other from a handicappedadvocacy group. A summary of the comments follows, along with the Department'sdisposition of them. The State Department of Social Services suggested that the performancereport required by section 401(d)(2) of the McKinney Act be included inthe annual CHAP submission, instead of being a separate submission. Underthe December 28, 1988 Notice, HUD must receive all CHAP submissions forthe upcoming year by Octobr 1. Performance reports are due by May 31 ofeach year, and must cover the one-year period ending on April 30 of theyear in question. The commenter stated that this change would significantlyreduce the administrative burden on CHAP jurisdictions. As noted above, the Department intends to issue a proposed rule revisingthe Plan requirements, including the content and timing of the annual performancereport, its review by the Department, and its relationship to the Plan.The commenter's concerns will be addressed in the proposed rule. The same commenter urged that each CHAP submission after the initial approvedCHAP include only information relevant to the period ending with the lastCHAP submission. Under the December 28, 1988 Notice, annual CHAP submissionsmust include a complete CHAP that addresses each of the required elements.Submissions in the nature of amendments to existing CHAPS are permittedonly after approval of the entire CHAP. The commenter argued that movingto an ``amendment'' approach after the initial CHAP approval would clearlydelineate the most current information and activities, and would ease thetime required to prepare, review, and approve CHAP submissions. The Department does not believe that the McKinney Act authorizes the ``amendment''approach suggested by the commenter. Section 401(a)(1) of the McKinneyAct requires the annual submission of a ``comprehensive homeless assistanceplan.'' Section 401(b) specifies that each Plan must contain all the requiredelements. Section 401(c)(2) of the McKinney Act refers to Plan ``amendments,''but only if the Department has disapproved a Plan submission. The Departmentbelieves that these provisions make clear that the Plan submission requirementcan only be met if the Plan addresses each of the required elements. In addition, the Plan is designed to reflect a comprehensive approach tothe jurisdiction's homelessness problem, by setting forth its homelessneeds and resources, and a strategy for addressing its unmet needs. The``amendment'' process suggested by the commenter would tend to fragmentthe Plan's elements, thereby undercutting the Plan's comprehensive nature.Finally, section 401(a)(2) of the McKinney Act requires Plan jurisdictionsto share their Plans with other Plan jurisdictions. The ``amendment'' approachwould make it difficult for the receiving jurisdictions to integrate the``amendments'' into a complete Plan. This would tend to frustrate the statute'svery purpose in requiring the sharing of Plans. The commenter also requested HUD guidance as to the level of detail necessaryto comply with the statutory requirement that the CHAP contain a briefinventory of facilities and services that assist the homeless populationwithin the jurisdiction. The commenter argued that given the large numberof shelter and service providers in its State, HUD's policy of requiringan ``itemized listing'' of the services and facilities places an unnecessaryadministrative burden on the State. It also noted that because of the changingpopulation of providers, an ``itemized listing'' at best affords a snapshotof the provider universe at only one time, and urged that the inventoryprovided not be treated as the total universe of entities eligible to receiveMcKinney Act funds. The Department intends to address in the proposed rulereferred to earlier, the level of detail that the required inventory ofhomeless facilities and services will have to provide. Finally, the commenter requested clarification on two points. First, section401(b)(6) of the McKinney Act requires that each recipient and projectsponsor administer, in good faith, a policy designed to ensure that assistedhomeless facilities are free from the illegal use, possession, or distributionof drugs or alcohol by its beneficiaries. The commenter expressed supportfor this requirement, but asked HUD to make clear that it does not precludeserving or sheltering individuals and family members who demonstrate analcohol or substance abuse problem. The commenter stated that these individualsare in critical need of intensive, specialized services in order to bestabilized. Unless shelters are allowed to accept these persons into theirfacilities, the commenter contended that the most logical point of crisisintervention would be lost. The Department agrees with the commenter. The mere demonstration of a drugor alcohol problem does not, in and of itself, preclude the person fromparticipating in the McKinney Act programs administered by the Department.Second, the commenter asked clarification of section 103(c) of the McKinneyAct. This provision excludes from the terms ``homeless'' or ``homelessindividual''<ITAG tagnum="20">an individual imprisoned or otherwise detained pursuant to an Actof Congress or a State law.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The commenter asked the Department to make clear that this exclusiondoes not apply to former prison inmates who are otherwise ``homeless persons''under section 103.Again, the Department agrees with the commenter. Former prison inmateswho otherwise meet the definition of a ``homeless person'' are eligibleto participate in the McKinney Act programs administered by the Department.The handicapped advocacy organization made two recommendations. The firstconcerned section 401(b)(3)(B) of the McKinney Act. This provision requiresCHAPs to contain a strategy to recognize the special needs of the varioustypes of homeless individuals, particularly families with children, theelderly, the mentally ill, and veterans. The commenter suggested that becauseof their special needs, severely mobility-impaired individuals be addedto the provision's preferred categories.Section 401(b)(3)(B) of the McKinney Act requires Plan jurisdictions toformulate a strategy that recognizes ``the special needs of the varioustypes of homeless individuals,'' and lists several areas of special needto be accorded particular recognition. The Department shares the commenter'sbelief that Plan jurisdictions should consider and, as appropriate, includethe special needs of the severely mobility impaired in their homeless strategies,and strongly encourages them to do so. However, given the fact that thestatute does not require that the severely mobility impaired be providedspecial recognition, the Department is reluctant to alter the congressionallymandated system of priority areas by imposing such a requirement on Planjurisdictions in the final rule.Second, the commenter expressed concern over the pace of existing effortsto ensure the accessibility of emergency shelters for the homeless. Asa way of focusing additional attention on this need, the commenter suggestedthat the CHAP contain an assessment of the accessibility problems in thefacilities covered by the CHAP, and set forth a transition plan to makeall assisted facilities barrier-free.It should be noted that each of the homeless authorities contained in TitleIV of the McKinney Act is subject to section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973 and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8. Part 8 containsthe rules governing the steps to be taken to ensure that facilities fundedunder Title IV are accessible to the handicapped. The Department believesthat part 8 sets forth a reasoned approach to the accessibility of federallyassisted structures, and that accessibility issues for facilities fundedunder Title IV should be governed solely by part 8. Accessibility questionsfor facilities beyond the reach of part 8 are best addressed by the jurisdictioninvolved.In addition, each of the authorities contained in title IV of the McKinneyAct is subject to provisions of the Fair Housing Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C.3601-19, and the implementing regulations published on January 23, 1989at 54 FR 3283 (to be codified at 24 CFR part 100). For the benefit of handicappedpersons, these provisions include reasonable modification and accommodationrequirements for existing premises and design and construction requirementsfor accessibility in certain new dwellings.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters</ITAG>The final rule sets the following Plan submission dates:<ITAG tagnum="15">_July 15 of each year, beginning with July 15, 1990, for ESG formulacities and counties; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_August 30 of each year, beginning with August 30, 1990, for States.This reflects the changed Plan submission dates announced in a Notice inthe </ITAG><T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 35436, published August 25, 1989).<ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Certifications</ITAG>Environmental RequirementsA Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42U.S.C. 4332). The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for publicinspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of theRules Docket Clerk; Office of the General Counsel; Department of Housingand Urban Development; Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW.; Washington,DC 20410.Regulatory ImpactThis rule does not constitute a major rule as that term is defined in Section1(b) of Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation. Analysis of the ruleindicates that it does not (1) have an annual impact on the economy of$100 million or more; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices forconsumers; individual industries; Federal, State, or local government agencies;or geographic regions; or (3) have a significant adverse impact on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of UnitedStates-based enterprises to compete in domestic or export markets.Regulatory Flexibility ActUnder section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601),HUD certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. The rule's requirements do notimpose significant burdens on any covered jurisdiction, and in any event,the rule is based almost exclusively on statutory requirements.Semiannual Agenda of RegulationsThis rule was listed as item number 902 in the Department's SemiannualAgenda of Regulations published on April 24, 1989 (54 FR 16708, 16709)under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.Information Collection RequirementsThe collection of information requirements contained in this rule havebeen submitted to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980, and have been assigned OMB control number 2506-0093.The following provisions of the rule have been determined by the Departmentto contain collection of information requirements.
