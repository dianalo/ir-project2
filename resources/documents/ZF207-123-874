 Or you couldtalk to kids, who have some strong ideas about what makes a good startersystem.andP;  Basically, kids want what you want: a machine that makes their livesa little easier and knows how to have fun once in a while.andM;Anxious parents push for more technology than is appropriate, in the apparentfear that if their ten-year-old doesn't have an AT or a Mac II, he'll wind upsweeping floors.andP;  But the young computer-users themselves may serve as morerealistic guides.andM;Many kids, for example, want the same kind of computer they have atschool--which often means an Apple II.andP;  Such compatibility &quot;isn't essential,but it's a good idea,&quot; says Tim Kniveton, 13, of Brookline, Massachusetts,who uses an Apple IIGS in school and has an Apple IIc at home.andP;  &quot;You can typeat home and bring work in, and some schools let you take disks home.&quot;andM;Tim speaks from experience: &quot;I've been using computers since I was six orseven,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;I still have my first computer--a little Tomy Tutor youplug into the TV.andP;  I used to come into my father's office when I was eight ornine and use his computer for hours.andP;  I basically taught myself by readingthe manuals.&quot;andP;  Tim's system now includes an Epson printer (which he shareswith his father, who has an IBM compatible), a joystick, a mouse, and a2,400-bit-per-second Hayes modem.andM;Like Parent, Like ChildandM;Often, the parents' needs govern the kind of computer a child first uses.andO;Two-computer households are still uncommon, so if Mom or Dad needs an IBMcompatible for the home office, that's probably what the child will use aswell.andM;Devon Leslie, 13, of Durham, Ontario, lucked out on that score.andP;  His motherneeded an IBM compatible for takehome work from her job, and his father alsorequired one, for his work toward an advanced degree.andP;  As a result, lastsummer Devon's system got the ultimate upgrade: from a Commodore 64 to an XTturbo clone, with a 30MB hard disk, a printer, and a color monitor.andM;After five years with the Commodore, Devon is in PC heaven.andP;  &quot;DOS makes iteasy,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;With the Commodore, you have to know a little BASIC just toload a program.&quot;andP;  Devon uses the XT mainly for school reports and essays.andP;  Heuses WordPerfect for text and dresses up some of his work with graphics fromNewsMaster II, a desktop publishing program.andP;  He hopes that soon he will beable to add a modem to gain access to public-domain software and a joystickfor him self and his ten-year-old sister.andM;Devon offers sensible advice on buying a kid's first PC.andP;  &quot;You have to knowwhat you want it for,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;If you're only going to use it for typing,you don't need a graphics card.andP;  If you'd rather just play games, you don'tneed a hard drive or a modem.&quot;andM;Bargain-hunting parents may want to follow the lead of kids who have to payfor their own computers.andP;  When Chris Van Vliet of Rahway, New Jersey, set outto buy a computer two years ago, he knew the money would have to come fromhis own savings.andP;  Chris, now 14, built up his system gradually.andP;  He startedwith a basic Commodore 64 for $200, later adding a monitor ($200) and a diskdrive ($200).andP;  &quot;Then my homework started building up,&quot; he says.andP;  Frequentwriting assignments drove him to buy a Seikosha printer for $175, bringingthe total for the system to $775.andM;Chris does all his school reports on his Commodore using Bank Street Writer.andO;He also plans to use the computer to help him prepare for the college boards.andO;Mostly, however, he uses the computer as a game machine.andP;  After a hard day atschool, he says, he's looking for a &quot;source of entertainment, rather thananother teacher.&quot;andM;When &quot;OK&quot; Isn't Good EnoughandM;If you're looking for a cheap way out of buying your kid a computer, beforewarned--young people can lust for power, too.andP;  Indeed, patience withlow-end systems tends to run out soon after the existence of brawniermachines becomes known.andP;  Chris's complaint about the Commodore illustratesthe point.andP;  &quot;When you have to wait five minutes every time you load a gamedisk, it can get annoying,&quot; he says.andP;  And Tim Kniveton refers with disdain tothe display on his Apple IIc, calling the 16-color screen merely &quot;OK.&quot;andP;  He'snow shooting for a Macintosh II--starting price around $6,000.andM;Indeed, the Macintosh represents the ultimate in computing for many youngpeople.andP;  Karen Sneider, 14, of Wayland, Massachusetts, is already a computerveteran, having begun at the age of four with a vintage tape-loaded Apple.andO;She got her first Mac when she was ten, and now she owns a Mac SE with 1MB ofRAM and a hard disk, plus a printer, modem, mouse, and stylus.andM;Karen expects the machine to carry a heavy academic load.andP;  Right now, sheuses a spelling checker and a thesaurus program; she plans to add geometryand biology software to her collection as soon as her class load warrants it.andO;For fun, she draws.andP;  &quot;It's a really nice graphics system,&quot; she says, thoughshe admits that at times she gets frustrated with its lack of color.andM;Cost ContainmentandM;If you want to get a high-quality machine and still pay your mortgage, lookinto the secondhand market.andP;  Local computer user groups, classifieds, anduniversity bulletin boards are good sources of information.andM;For intrepid young PC enthusiasts, there's another low-cost option: buildingtheir own.andP;  That's what 11-year-old Liza Gardner did--with help from hermother.andP;  Liza, who lives in Portland, Oregon, needed to replace her 64K AppleII Plus.andP;  &quot;We ordered the pieces from a catalog and put it together: themotherboard, the power supply, chips, and cards.andP;  It was easy,&quot; she says.andM;When the dust had settled, Liza was the proud owner of an XT clone completewith printer, monitor, modem, and 20MB hard disk--all for around $1,600.andO;&quot;The Apple was a wimp,&quot; she says.andP;  By comparison, &quot;this one's incredible.&quot;andM;Some words of caution for parents beleaguered by pressure to keep up with thelittle hackers next door come from David Grady, publisher of The GradyReport: Personal Computers in American Education.andP;  Even though some childrenwill insist on a high-end system, parents need not indulge them--at least notright away.andP;  &quot;I would have a tendency to fold my arms and make the kidsconvince me&quot; that their interest in computers was more than just a passingfancy, says Grady.andM;And there's no need to hurry, Grady adds.andP;  &quot;Parents should not feel they haveto buy computers for their two-year-olds,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;You should probablyfeel guilty if your four-year-old hasn't played with Legos--but not if hehasn't played with a computer.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
