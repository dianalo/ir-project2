Seib (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> IBP OXY </CO><DATELINE> MANCHESTER, Iowa  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bruce Babbitt is running for president as the candidate of ideas, and he's trying out another new one on a frigid night in this small Iowa farm community.    While most candidates routinely support the building of new factories and plants, Mr. Babbitt has shown up at a citizens' meeting to speak out against a company proposing to build a big meatpacking plant here. The company, IBP Inc., a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp., is a &quot;corporate outlaw,&quot; Mr. Babbitt charges, with a record of bad labor relations, low wage scales and violations of safety and environmental standards.    More important, the Arizona Democrat asserts, IBP represents everything in corporate-employee relations he is trying to change with his ideas for &quot;workplace democracy.&quot; That is a plan to increase American productivity by guaranteeing workers profit sharing, equity stakes in their companies and day care for their children. &quot;We must make changes in the American workplace,&quot; he tells the Iowans, most of whom are wearing flannel shirts and work boots. &quot;But we don't do it by exploiting people. We do it by bringing them into the process.&quot;    Mr. Babbitt's appearance is an attempt to take on big IBP, formerly known as Iowa Beef Processors, in its own back yard, and the effort seems to work. &quot;Thanks for coming,&quot; a middle-aged man in the audience yells out to the politician as he finishes.    In a campaign dominated by vague discussions of character, such a relentless focus on issues has made Mr. Babbitt the candidate with the best record for introducing ideas. He has a detailed plan to cut the federal budget deficit, including proposals for a national &quot;consumption&quot; tax and new taxes on the Social Security benefits of the affluent; an initiative on children that runs to four single-spaced typewritten pages; and a proposal to alter 40 years of nuclear defense strategy in Europe.    Despite cries for more leadership and bold thinking by politicians, few people have been listening. Mr. Babbitt, a former Arizona governor, remains at the bottom of the polls and runs a shoestring campaign that must pinch pennies by enrolling him in airline frequent-flier programs.    Mr. Babbitt is starting to attract more attention, however, and his crowds in Iowa, site of important caucuses on Feb. 8, are growing slightly. &quot;Overall, the fact that he has confronted tough issues with credible proposals is finally beginning to benefit him,&quot; says Kirk O'Donnell, president of the Center for National Policy, a Democratic think tank.    Mr. O'Donnell suspects the Babbitt campaign actually may have been helped by the Oct. 19 stock market crash, a sobering event that made voters more interested in detailed economic ideas. The lanky Mr. Babbitt, crammed shivering into the seat of a small commuter plane between campaign stops, agrees. &quot;I think we're crossing a divide into 1988,&quot; he says. &quot;I think what Oct. 19 did was awake a lot of interest in the press and among the political leadership that there ought to be a real debate.&quot;    Of course, as Mr. Babbitt's ideas attract more attention they will attract more criticism too. Critics charge that his consumption tax would hurt lower-income Americans more than those in higher-income brackets, and that it could turn into a &quot;money machine&quot; simply used to finance more federal programs. Elderly groups oppose his politically risky plan to tax more Social Security benefits, some analysts think his children's program might actually drive up the cost of day care, and national-security experts worry that his nuclear strategy would scare Western Europe.    More than any substantive shortcomings, however, Mr. Babbitt's major difficulty in getting his ideas across involves style. He was hurt by his frenetic appearance at an early televised debate, and has begun an effort to improve his television performances.    But there isn't any disputing that Mr. Babbitt has a keen and active mind that has produced stacks of detailed position papers. He can talk knowledgeably about the theories of economists Lester Thurow and Martin Weitzman -- he is a fan of both -- and the practical lessons in labor relations he learned as a mediator in negotiations between copper companies and miners in Arizona.    His studies have helped produce a comprehensive plan to cut the federal deficit by trimming benefits for the rich, businesses and the military while instituting some new taxes. The Babbitt budget plan would reduce the deficit $40 billion this year and $404 billion over the next five years.    A key component is Mr. Babbitt's proposal for a national consumption tax. He suggests structuring such a tax either as a 5% national sales tax or as a value-added tax imposed at various stages of production of goods and services. To ease the burden of such a tax on the poor, who must spend a far greater portion of their income than do the wealthy, Mr. Babbitt has proposed exempting products like food and medicine and giving the poor rebates through income-tax credits. Even after such credits, he estimates, a tax could raise $50 billion a year to cut the deficit.    Still, critics maintain that a national sales tax inevitably would hit the poor and middle classes relatively more than the rich. Robert McIntyre, director of the labor-backed Citizens for Taxpayer Justice, argues that many poor Americans simply don't file income-tax returns, so they don't have a way to get the tax credits Mr. Babbitt proposes to offset the sales tax. And Mr. McIntyre estimates that, even after exemptions for food and other items, the poorest one-fifth of Americans would spend close to 5% of their income on the sales tax, while the richest 1% would spend just 1% of theirs.    Mr. Babbitt thinks the tax could be made far more progressive than that, and that Americans would far prefer to cut the deficit by taxing spending than further taxing income.    At the same time, Mr. Babbitt would cut funds for military programs like the MX missile and slow down the big Trident submarine program. More broadly, he proposes introducing a &quot;universal needs test&quot; requiring that every federal expenditure be targeted to some demonstrated area of need. Under that concept, he would eliminate agricultural subsidies to corporate farms and end tax deductions for interest paid on second homes.    One of the most controversial changes he would make in federal benefits would be to begin taxing all Social Security benefits of individuals earning more than $25,000 a year and couples earning more than $32,000. Half of such benefits are taxed today. &quot;I don't think the Vanderbilts and the Mellons need exactly the same tax-free Social Security benefits as a widow in a cold-water flat,&quot; he argues. Still, the American Association of Retired Persons opposes such a change, officials say, arguing that Social Security is designed to be a program in which Americans contribute equally and benefit equally.    Perhaps Mr. Babbitt's most far-reaching ideas are those designed to give workers a more direct stake in the productivity of their companies. He proposes banning companies from deducting executive bonuses as busineses expenses unless they offer performance pay for all workers, and prohibiting &quot;golden parachute&quot; severance packages for executives unless &quot;equivalent&quot; plans are offered all departing workers.    And, to make work easier for two-career families, he proposes a &quot;national child-care voucher,&quot; scaled to income and funded jointly by federal and state governments, to pay for day care. But the plan would allow the vouchers to be used only at government-licensed day-care centers, so critics argue it would usher in unnecessary regulations that might drive up day-care costs. Mr. Babbitt responds that day-care centers are so important to families that they must meet some standards. &quot;The idea that day care should be free of regulation is just nonsense,&quot; he says.    In foreign policy, Mr. Babbitt proposes a Western military policy that assumes &quot;we will never be the first to use nuclear weapons in any conflict.&quot; The West now explicitly declares it might respond with nuclear weapons to an attack on Western Europe by the Soviets' superior conventional army, and former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft worries that a policy change would &quot;utterly panic the Europeans.&quot;    But Mr. Babbitt proposes big improvements in Western conventional defenses, and, typically, isn't worried that his idea would change 40 years of strategy. &quot;There's a fallacy in relying on 40 years of history,&quot; he says. &quot;In history, 40 years is a short amount of time.&quot;    ---                  Bruce Babbitt's Ideas                  Budget and the economy   -- Institute a &quot;progressive national consumption tax,&quot; structured as a 5% sales tax or a value-added tax, with offsets to ease the impact on the poor.

Revenue: Average of $4 billion annually over the next five years.   -- Phase out deductibilty of mortgage interest on second homes. Revenue: Average of $260 million annually over the next five years.               The workplace and education   -- Prohibit companies from deducting an executive bonus as a business expense unless they offer performance pay for all employees.   -- Require that companies receiving government loans or or guarantees restructure to create partial ownership and partial control by employees.   -- Create a universal child-care voucher to help working parents pay for day care.   -- Initate full federal funding of Medicaid, provided states devote the resulting windfall to education.
