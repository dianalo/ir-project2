Other loan files from Transamerica Financial Services'Scottsdale office will be reviewed, but any problems are likely tobe local, said Arthur Van Leuven, chief executive officer ofTransamerica Financial Group and executive vice president of itsparent, Transamerica Corp.   Transcripts of court testimony by a former loan officerpersuaded Transamerica to drop its fight with 77-year-old LennieWilliams, Van Leuven said in a recent telephone interview.   ``It was really not a hard decision,'' he said. ``It was aslam-dunk.''   The battle began after Mrs. Williams allowed her small,42-year-old home to be used as security for a loan her son-in-lawtook out from Transamerica Financial Services Inc., thecorporation's Arizona operation.   The son-in-law disappeared with the money, according to courtrecords, and Transamerica began foreclosure on the home after Mrs.Williams, who supports herself on pensions of $438 a month, wasunable to keep up with monthly loan payments of $499 a month.   Volunteer lawyers fought back. The loan officer who handled Mrs.Williams' loan testified that he doubted whether she understoodwhat she was doing, and a doctor who was treating her at the timetestified that she wasn't capable of remembering which pill totake, much less of understanding loan agreements.   Even after a Maricopa County Superior Court judge in Januaryordered a temporary halt to the foreclosure and said it was likelyTransamerica ``knew or should have known'' something was wrong whenit made the loan, the company's lawyers pursued the case anddemanded that Mrs. Williams post bond of $450 a month pending trial.   Last month, an Associated Press story detailed Mrs. Williams'plight. At about the same time, senior officials at TransamericaFinancial Group received a transcript of the loan officer'stestimony, according to Van Leuven.   ``It became apparent from that transcript that two parties hadbeen victimized,'' he said. ``Lennie Williams is one of them, andTransamerica is the other.''   The company decided to drop all proceedings against Mrs.Williams and proceed only against the son-in-law because it is``far easier for us to stand the victimization than for LennieWilliams,'' Van Leuven said.   The company will return payments Mrs. Williams made to the courtand will review other loans by its Scottsdale office to ensurethere aren't any similar cases, he said.   The review will be difficult, because there was nothing in Mrs.Williams' file to indicate an unusual transaction until her lawyersbegan complaining, he said.   Mrs. Williams' attorney, Michael Curran, said a tentativeagreement had been reached in her case.   ``She was just completely relieved when we finally were able toget it through to her that she was never going to have to worryabout someone taking her house again,'' said another of herlawyers, Douglas Erickson.</TEXT><NOTE>End advance for April 5</NOTE></DOC>
