Attorney Prakash Diar said an appeal for clemency was denied andthe five men and one woman were notified they will be executedFriday morning.   The six were convicted in connection with the killing of blacktownship councilor Jacob Dlamini in Sharpeville, about 40 milessouth of Johannesburg, on Sept. 3, 1984.   Evidence at their trial showed the six were not among those whoactually hacked and burned Dlamini to death.   They were convicted under the doctrine of ``common purpose,''which holds they were responsible for the killing by being part ofthe mob that gathered outside Dlamini's home with the intent tokill him.   Human rights groups and government officials, both in SouthAfrica and internationally, have called for clemency.   Theresa Ramashamola, 26, is the only woman on death row in SouthAfrica for what activists consider a politically motivated offense.   Britain's Conservative Party government expressed hope Mondaynight that South Africa will call off the hangings.   Lynda Chalker, minister of state at the Foreign Office, told theHouse of Commons, ``Even at this late stage we sincerely andearnestly hope that the South African government will heed theunited call of everyone for clemency in these cases.''   She said Britain backed a United Nations Security Council callfor the sentences to be commuted.   About 100 lawmakers of Britain's opposition Labor Party signed astatement expressing ``total condemnation'' of the plannedexecutions.   Amnesty International, the London-based human rightsorganization, appealed to South African President P.W. Botha tospare the lives of the six.   Dlamini's killing came during riots which began a two-yearoutbreak of nationwide anti-apartheid protests that left more than2,000 blacks dead.   Black activists frequently targeted black township councilors,considering them collaborators with the white-led government.   The Media Workers Association of South Africa appealed to thegovernment Monday to ``demonstrate good will to the people of SouthAfrica in particular and mankind at large by sparing the lives ofthe Sharpeville Six.''   The scheduled execution date is three days before theanniversary of the Sharpeville riots of March 21, 1960.   Sixty-nine blacks were killed when police fired on peacefulprotesters demonstrating against the pass laws, which requiredblacks to carry identification documents while in white areas. Thelaws have since been repealed.   The 1960 shootings raised an international storm of protest.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
