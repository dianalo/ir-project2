This avoidabilityproblem occurs primarily in jurisdictions that base their propoerty taxon a so-called ``unit'' method of assessment. The Commission proposes requiringthe abandoning carrier to submit evidence substantiating the actual taxsavings it will experience in affected unitary jurisdictions if the railroadargues that savings would occur. Without sufficient proof, the Commissionwould decline to accept as avoidable the property taxes the carrier hasassigned to the line.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments are due October 17, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Send pleadings (original and 10 copies) referring toEx Parte No. 274 (Sub-No. 20) to: Office of the Secretary, Case ControlBranch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2><ITAG tagnum="15">Joseph H.

In reviewing the merits of an abandonmentapplication, the Commission uses avoidable costs to determine the financialburden the carrier would incur from continued operation of the line. Thisburden is relevant to our ultimate determination of whether the publicconvenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment under 49 U.S.C.10903. Avoidable costs are also relevant to subsidy and purchase calculationsunder 49 U.S.C. 10905.The Commission's regulations at 49 CFR 1152.32 address the caculation ofavoidable costs and define the eligible costs elements. Under andSection;andSection;1152.32(j),property taxes are deemed attributable costs of the rail properties tobe abandoned if the applicant-carrier intends to sell or otherwise disposeof those properties after abandonment. In several recent proceedings, however,protestants have contended that property taxes on a line are not avoidablewhen the State imposing the tax uses a ``unit'' method of railroad assessment.The unit method of valuing railroad property is based on the premise thatthe railroad is an integrated economic entity. Each State using the unitmethod determines an assessment for the entire railroad system, using atraditional imcome, market, or cost-base valuation standard.Under the income approach the valuation, the net railway operating income(NROI) is capitalized to predict the captial value under the theory thatanticipated future income translates into present market value. The market approach uses an analysis of stocks and debt to determine marketvalue. This approach assumes that future stock prices will depend on theanticipated NROI from future operationsUnder the cost approach, original cost or reproduction cost with depreciationis used to determine the market value of the system's properties.The State then determines its proportion of the total system value fromstatistical units that may include track miles, gross ton-miles, car miles,and locomotive miles. The ratio of statistical units in the State to systemtotal units is applied against the total system value to determine theState-wide assessment.Abandonment of any given line withint a State will lower that State's ratioby reducing equally the in-State (numerator) and system-wide (denominator)statistical units. On the other hand, abandonment will generally increasesystem-wide valuation. Under the income and market approaches, the abandonmentcould increase NROI and, therefore, the valuation. The increase reflectsthat an unprofitable operation is being terminated. The possibility thatthe system-wide valuation will increase creates some uncertainty as towhether any one abandonment will result in an overall tax reduction inthe State or States where the line is located.Ordinarily this methodology will result in a tax reduction in the Stateor States where an abandonment is to occur. If it does, however, this doesnot necessarily mean that the abandoning carrier's total tax expense willbe reduced. As a result of the abandonment, each State's proportion ofthe total system valuation will change. Those States that are outside thescope of the abandonment should experience an increase in their allocatedvaluation, and this should result in more taxes being assessed on the abandoningrailroad by that State's local taxing entities. Those States in which theabandonment will occur ordinarily should experience a reduction in theirallocated valuation, and this should result in a lesser amount being assessedon the abandoning railroad by their local taxing entities. The net effectof this is that, while the abandoning railroad will no longer pay taxeson the track being abandoned, it may as a direct result of the abandonmentpay more taxes overall. This is because each of the local jurisdictionsassesses taxes at a different rate level, and because a greater portionof the remaining allocated valuation may be in jurisdictions with highertax rates.Because there is no fixed relationship between the decrease in a State'sstatistical ratio and the likely increase in system-wide valuation, andbecause the tax rates applied to the final assessment by the various jurisdictionsin which the abandoning railroad operates are not uniform, there can beno blanket conclusion that property taxes calculated under the unit methodare avoidable. Consequently, when the issue is raised, we propose to decidethe issue of avoidability on a case-by-case basis. Our proposed rule placesthe burden of proving avoidability on the carrier seeking to claim localproperty taxes as an avoidable cost of operations. In the absence of proof,we will decline to accept as avoidable the property taxes the carrier hasassigned to the line.Our proposed rule is set forth below. Comments on all the foregoing mattersare invited.The Commission preliminarily certifies that the revised regulations proposedin this proceeding, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. The general purpose of the proposedchanges is to permit a more accurate determination of the costs of railoperations in connection with rail abandonment and subsidy/purchase proceedings.Small entities will be least affected because they typically operate withinthe fewest number of taxing jurisdictions. However, comments regardingsmall entities, if any, should be included in the statements filed withthe Commission.This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the humanenvironment or energy conservation. Similarly, any comments regarding environmentaland energy issues should be included in the statement filed with the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 1152</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Railroads.This notice is issued under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 10321, 10362, 10903,10904, and 10905, and 5 U.S.C. 553.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 6, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission, Chairman Gradison, Vice Chairman Andre, CommissionersSimmons, Lamboley, and Phillips.
