Butconspicuously absent from the 1991 fall lineup is one of themost anticipated shows of the year: this season's only newoffering from Steven Bochco.   Mr. Bochco is hands-down the most successful televisionproducer of the past decade, managing to produce dramas thatare both intelligent and popular. The gritty realism of his1981 hit &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; made it one of the firstprime-time dramas to woo large numbers of educated babyboomers back to their TV sets, while &quot;L.A. Law,&quot; which makestens of millions a year for NBC, practically defined thedecade's yuppie careerism. The secret of his success, saysMr. Bochco, is simple: &quot;Push the limits.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But this season, Mr. Bochco may have pushed theincreasingly shaky networks too far. After paying him therichest deal in television to develop new shows, ABC hasdeemed his latest effort, a drama about two divorce lawyers,not yet ready for prime time.   Instead of premiering in the fall, when millions ofdollars are poured into promotion and viewers are abuzz aboutthe new season, ABC sent the show, called &quot;Civil Wars,&quot; backto the shop for repairs. Now, even if Mr. Bochco can fix itto the network's liking, it will have to wait till mid-seasonto take over a time slot from a show that fails. Meanwhile,though, the polite power struggle that has shaped up betweenABC executives and Mr. Bochco may actually rank as the mostcompelling drama of the new television season.   It has been a humbling setback for Mr. Bochco, who iswidely viewed as one of the most talented TV producers inHollywood. Tall, silver-haired and handsome at 47 years ofage, he is a creature of television, seldom out of touch withthe American audience. He grew up on Manhattan's Upper WestSide, one of two children in an artistic family. Although hewatched little television then -- music was his first love --by the age of 20 he was already a scriptwriter, sharing hisfirst credit with Rod Serling of &quot;The Twilight Zone.&quot;   No stranger to the central theme of &quot;Civil Wars,&quot; Mr.Bochco married at age 20 and was divorced three years later.He has been happily married to his second wife, actressBarbara Bosson, for 22 years. At least one aspect of theirunion is highly public: Over the years he has cast her andseveral other relatives, including his sister andbrother-in-law, in his shows. &quot;Bochco&quot; he saysgood-naturedly, &quot;is Polish for nepotism.&quot;   Almost as renowned as his shows, though, is his reputationin television circles for intransigence, willfulness and anego that looms large even on the grand scale of Hollywood.His disdain for network executives and their censors islegendary. The license tag on his black Mercedes 500SL -- atag he says he was given in sheer coincidence -- says it all:&quot;2TV666&quot; (to hell with television).   This attitude hasn't made network relations with Mr.Bochco easy. Last season, his refusal to heed pleas fromnetwork brass to change a show culminated in a belly-flop ofunforgettable proportions: &quot;Cop Rock&quot; offered riveting crimedrama, but Mr. Bochco insisted on the bizarre complement ofBroadway-style song and dance numbers. ABC executives beggedhim to take out the rock and leave in the cops, arguing thatthe show could be a hit.   He didn't disagree with this assessment, but refusedanyway. &quot;I've done that show before,&quot; Mr. Bochco says,alluding to &quot;Hill Street Blues.&quot; &quot;Cop Rock&quot; died in 11episodes. Nos. 12 and 13 cost the network $3.6 million -- butnever aired. (The flop made Mr. Bochco one-for-two with ABC.&quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.,&quot; a comedy about a teen-age surgeon, isa success in its second season.)   In such confrontations with ABC, Mr. Bochco would seem tohave the edge. In 1987 he signed an exclusive contract withABC, deeding it his next 10 series. Valued at $50 million, itis the most expensive such agreement in television, payinghim a $5 million bonus on signing and bankrolling him informing his own company, Steven Bochco Productions.   It was a deal that ABC badly needed. It was aimed not onlyat blocking the rival networks from hiring him, but also atletting Hollywood know it was open to new creative talent.   But for the cost-conscious Capital Cities/ABC Inc., ABC'sparent, the contract is unusually generous. It requires ABCto pay Mr. Bochco millions even when he fails. If he pitchesan idea for a new show and ABC says no, he gets a kill fee ofmore than $1 million. If ABC says yes, it must commit to 13episodes for $20 million. And unlike most producers inHollywood, Mr. Bochco doesn't have to film so much as a testpilot.   The proliferation of such exclusive, long-term deals hasfed a multimillion-dollar bidding frenzy by the networks inrecent years, as each tries to lock up hot talent. It hasalso fueled much internal debate. Such deals have yet toproduce any big successes justifying the fortunes they cost.And some critics say they give top producers too much moneyand power. &quot;It's a velvet handcuff,&quot; says Earle H. (Kim)LeMasters III, a producer who was president of CBSEntertainment from 1987 to 1989. &quot;It's too early to tellwhether these deals are good for the networks. It could be adisaster, because they're putting all their eggs in onebasket.&quot;   No project is a more closely watched test of the newbalance of power between networks and their highly paidsuper-producers than Mr. Bochco's latest effort. &quot;Civil Wars&quot;was first pitched to ABC Entertainment president Robert A.Iger and a top lieutenant, Stuart Bloomberg, over lunch oneday at Lunaria, a trendy establishment near the ABCEntertainment Center in Los Angeles. It seemed simple enough:Mr. Bochco told them he loved the nasty divorce stories on&quot;L.A. Law,&quot; spun out through Arnold Becker, the slick, PeterPan divorce lawyer. He would have done more Becker-drivenstories, but California is a &quot;no-fault&quot; state, and theconflicts were limited. &quot;Civil Wars&quot; would be set in NewYork, so the fur could really fly.   The show was to be shepherded by William M. Finkelstein,39, an affable, streetwise former divorce lawyer who hailsfrom the borough of Queens and has the accent to prove it. Hehad written episodes of &quot;L.A. Law&quot; and, with Mr. Bochco, hadco-created &quot;Cop Rock.&quot; His mother, Miriam Robinson, is aprominent divorce lawyer in New York and would serve astechnical adviser.   Why focus on divorce in what is ostensibly a decade offamily values? &quot;Everyone has divorce in their background,&quot;Mr. Bochco says. &quot;A show like this gives people a way tovent, to recognize their experience. It's also a good excuseto explore the best and worst of all of us.&quot; And besides,&quot;the subject could be funny,&quot; he says. &quot;A lot of youngAmericans don't bring a lot of moral trepidation {to divorce}that many older Americans do.&quot;   But from the start, Mr. Iger voiced some trepidation.Divorce, he pointed out, isn't generally an upbeat subject.He says he urged the creators to include some &quot;upliftingqualities with stories ending happily.&quot; Mix in some humor,have some couples get back together, provide a little romancebetween lead divorce lawyer Mariel Hemingway and her partner,the ABC men advised.   Mr. Bochco left matters to Mr. Finkelstein, who spent thenext month writing the first script, getting sole credit ascreator and executive producer in the premiere episode. InMay, with high expectations, Mr. Iger and his ABC teamgathered in the 50-seat theater at the ABC EntertainmentCenter in Century City here to review the first show. Theywere rudely disappointed. Instead of trademark Bochco --scenes with irony, humor and a pervasive sense of the absurd-- &quot;Civil Wars&quot; was relentlessly depressing.   Traditionally the first episode of a new series must beimmediately likable to coax viewers into coming back nextweek. But &quot;Civil Wars&quot; opened with the disturbing breakdownof a lawyer who couldn't stand his job anymore. As a husbandand wife bickered bitterly, the lawyer cried, foamed at themouth, and stripped off his suit. &quot;But I can't take off myskin,&quot; he bleated. &quot;I want to, you know, but I can't]&quot;   Then came the opening credits, woeful music and the firstwords, &quot;Would you like to know just how much I hate you atthis moment?&quot; Next scene: the witness stand, featuring awoman who has humiliated her husband by posing nude for theartist with whom she is having an affair. Ms. Hemingway,often cast as a blonde and bubbly character, plays a divorceattorney who is subdued and humorless. Her hair is an opaqueshade of brown.   Mr. Bochco was insistent that &quot;Civil Wars&quot; had to bestarkly different from &quot;L.A. Law.&quot; But in the network's view,he had made exactly the kind of show it didn't want. In fact,ABC had just decided to cancel four dramas that, while lovedby critics, were too intense and draining to ever grow intomainstream hits: &quot;Thirtysomething,&quot; &quot;Equal Justice,&quot; &quot;ChinaBeach&quot; and &quot;Twin Peaks.&quot; ABC wanted a lighter show.   So after screening the pilot, Mr. Iger met with itsproducer and director. But apparently he was too gentle inhis criticism, as they were unalarmed. &quot;ABC seemed sanguine.It wasn't a disaster,&quot; the producer, Mr. Finkelstein,recalls.   Mr. Iger, in fact, had serious doubts that the serieswould ever get on the air. &quot;We weren't sure the show could befixed,&quot; he says. Even if it could, persuading Mr. Bochco,with his hugely protective contract, was another matter. ABCresorted to wielding the single form of leverage it had left:the right to hold back access to the airwaves.   Mr. Iger urged Mr. Bochco in mid-May to fly to New Yorkand try to sell the show to executives of Capital Cities/ABC,who were meeting to pick the fall lineup. &quot;He asked me toplead my case,&quot; Mr. Bochco recalls. He was stung by the extrahurdle. His contract with ABC, after all, didn't even requirea pilot. He had filmed the first episode early just as acourtesy -- and now top ABC executives were using it againsthim. &quot;I was being penalized for being a nice guy,&quot; hecontends.   But he came to New York. For two hours Mr. Bochco, dressedcasually, faced the roomful of &quot;suits,&quot; including Mr. Iger,parent-company Chairman Thomas S. Murphy and President DanielB. Burke, assuring everyone he could fix &quot;Civil Wars&quot; in timefor a September premiere.   He understood their reluctance: &quot;Cop Rock&quot; was anexpensive failure at $1.8 million for each hour. &quot;Everyonetook a serious bath on that show. That leaves a crease inyour corporate gray matter. So ABC was real, real, realnervous.&quot; But he didn't understand what happened next.   Two days later, still waiting for a verdict in his hotelroom at the Ritz-Carlton on Central Park South, Mr. Bochcogot a call from Mr. Iger, who told him he hadn't made thefall schedule.   Mr. Bochco was disappointed. He believed that, based onhis record, if he told ABC brass he could fix a show theyshould have banked on it.   Miffed, he returned to his adobe-style office building onthe 20th Century Fox studio lot to rework the show. Thistime, instead of leaving things to Mr. Finkelstein, heco-wrote the second script.   What emerged in the ensuing months were scripts thatreflected more of ABC's vision, although Mr. Bochco and hisassociates say it was how they had planned it all along. Thestories were richer in character and humor, as well asgenuine sadness. There were reconciliations andtongue-in-cheek conflicts. A husband challenges his wife'slover to a duel. A whippet is at the center of a custodyfight. A central character is recruited for a lucrativecareer in telephone sex.   By the second episode, the divorce lawyer Sydney Guilford,played by Ms. Hemingway, is miraculously blonde, a changeoverthat is noted by everyone from a bicycle messenger to ajudge. The darker hair &quot;was a different look for me, it mademe look older and more serious,&quot; she says. &quot;I guess they likeblondes out here.&quot;   ABC ordered four more episodes, committing another $6million. But it still worried about the first episode. SaysMr. Burke: &quot;I don't think we can get people back if theydon't like it right away.&quot;   Mr. Bochco was annoyed by the concern and was unrepentant-- at first. &quot;Look,&quot; he says evenly, &quot;I think we made aneffective hour of television. My company's name is on thisthing. If I didn't have faith in the hour, I wouldn't havedelivered it.&quot;   But within weeks, he began filming major changes to beinserted into the premiere episode, at a cost he and ABCsplit. ABC's Mr. Iger is quick to stress that he neverdemanded the changes; he just made sure Mr. Bochco was awareof &quot;certain things about the first episode that we weren'thappy with.&quot;   Whatever the case, the re-shooting was a significantalteration. The opening scene of the attorney's painfulbreakdown stayed in. But the mean-spirited story line aboutthe woman who belittles her husband by posing nude for herartistic lover vanished, replaced by a humorous subplotinvolving Elvis Presley.   Now the saga surrounding the series also seems to have ahappy ending. Mr. Iger and ABC have nothing but great thingsto say about &quot;Civil Wars&quot; and what a brilliant storytellerSteven Bochco is. Mr. Bochco waits to inherit a time period,hoping that a couple of turkeys die soon. He calls Mr. Igeroften to ask when &quot;Civil Wars&quot; can air, with the greeting:&quot;Hi, this is the buzzard calling.&quot;   &quot;I'm thrilled they love it&quot; at ABC, Mr. Bochco says. Butstay tuned. No Bochco character, least of all his own, staysmeek and grateful for long. &quot;When this show goes on andbecomes a hit,&quot; he promises, &quot;you'll finally know thefullness of what an ass I can be.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
