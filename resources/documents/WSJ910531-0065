It was the world's second, after theone in the U.S., but it would be short-lived. Poland'sconstitution was soon abolished and so was the country --carved up by three empires.   Throughout Poland's stays in limbo, the one force that haskept the nation whole also kept the constitution alive. TheRoman Catholic Church made May 3 a holy day, sheltering theanniversary much as it sheltered Solidarity until communismkeeled over. Now that Poland has freedom again, the Polishchurch has begun to seek what it sees as just reward for itstroubles: a place in a new constitution for the teachings ofCatholicism.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Exceptional emphasis,&quot; the nation's bishops said in astatement in late April, &quot;should be laid on the need forcooperation between the state and the Catholic Church,cooperation rooted in the good of individuals, who in thePolish situation are predominantly members of both thesecommunities at the same time.&quot;   The episcopate insists that it isn't advocating theocracy.It hasn't drawn up specific proposals for putting its notionof constitutional &quot;cooperation&quot; to work. Expecting every actof parliament to pass a test of Catholic morality would, atthe least, create a catacomb of legal ambiguity.   The suggestion of it is already raising objections evenamong committed Catholics. But if the church hierarchy'sprayers are answered in any form, it could gain anextraordinary hold on the Polish state.   Poland's bishops probably would have preferred to retirefrom politics. But now their country is hellbent forcapitalism, a system that many of them -- none more so thanthe Polish bishop of Rome, Pope John Paul II -- believe is asdangerous as the one it supplanted. As the pope travels thiscountry next week on his first visit home since freedom'sadvent, &quot;the great theme of his sermons will be that we don'twant to swap one form of enslavement for another,&quot; saysJonathan Luxmoore, a British student of the Polish church.   Hurrying the end of communism, it seems, was only thefirst mission of John Paul II's pontificate. Thataccomplished, he has seen a historic chance to sow, on theleveled ground of Poland and other Catholic nations ofEastern Europe, a spiritual renewal that could extend to anirreligious and consumer-crazed West.   The &quot;new capitalism&quot; and its &quot;idolatry of the market&quot;didn't win East Europe's revolutions of 1989, the pope arguesin a recent encyclical. Capitalism of that kind breedsexploitation, and, like Marxism, reduces man &quot;to the sphereof economics and the satisfaction of material needs.&quot;   For economists and politicians working to set marketforces free in Poland, this doesn't sound like a benediction.And even Polish Catholics who strongly sympathize with thisencyclical say its message, not only on capitalism but alsoon such tender matters as abortion, may be blunted byresentment against local bishops' staking claims tooforcefully on secular territory. Yet in a country where 90%of the citizens say they are believers, the state won'teasily separate itself from the church.   Without a mature media to chart their choices, thechurch's imprimatur is the one political guide for mostPoles. They took the pulpit's advice in the vote thatfinished communism two years ago, and took it again inDecember when an upstart emigre, Stanislaw Tyminski, almostsnatched the presidency from Lech Walesa, a founder ofSolidarity. Now, the Poles are getting an earful ontelevision and in school as well, as the bishops press theirmoral agenda.   They won their first objective, the classroom, last fall.In a deal never debated in public, the government allowed thechurch to ease religious instruction into the state'sschools. Teachers and students fussed when the priestsarrived, but soon settled down. The bishops then moved on tothe next item on their list: abortion.   Under the communists, who couldn't perfect the pill orsupply the condom, doctors aborted 500,000 pregnancies ayear. The bishops simply want it banned.   A bill made to measure for them was sent to parliamentthis year. It outlawed abortion without exception. Doctorswho performed abortions could go to prison, and so couldwomen who had them.   But in polls, more than half of the public called the billtoo harsh. When it came to a vote this month, leftists andex-Communists in parliament buried the draft in committee fora rewrite.   So the pope won't get the &quot;gift&quot; promised for this visit,but that is far from the end of the matter. Indeed, CardinalGlemp recently reiterated his call for an abortion ban. &quot;Itis paradoxical that the fight for power and influence focusesaround a moral issue such as the aborting of conceived life,&quot;he said in a sermon. The question of legalized abortionshould be settled &quot;by the larger elements of society,&quot; as itwas too sensitive to be handled by politicians, alone, hesaid.   Given such pronouncements, it isn't surprising that thedeputies who dissented on the abortion bill did soanonymously. Next fall, in a critical election, Poland willannul the devil's compact that removed the Communists frompower yet gave them 65% of parliament's lower house. Thatcould upend the power balance on every issue from Soviettroops to foreign investment. But no candidate who crossesthe church on abortion will gain its blessing.   Politicians are lining up for church backing. SeveralChristian Democratic parties have formed, including theCenter Alliance, President Walesa's major backer. After theelection, it could pull together a ruling church-orientedcoalition. If so, the bishops stand a good chance of havingtheir wishes fulfilled, not only on abortion but on a newconstitution.   &quot;We believe it is necessary for the constitution to referto the values most precious for the Polish nation,&quot; they saidin April, &quot;values closely connected with the history ofevangelizing Polish society.&quot; Catholic values, in otherwords, suffusing the state's approach to everything fromfamily life to exchange rates.   Church and state won't integrate, the bishops say. Butthey won't separate.   &quot;The term `separation of church and state' has adisgraceful history in Poland,&quot; says Justice Minister WieslawChrzanowski, chairman of the Christian National Union,another churchly party. Under communism, &quot;it was the churchthat was separated from the state, not the other way around,&quot;he says. &quot;The state interfered wherever it could.&quot;   Plenty of Poles worry that the church is intent on doingthe same today. Two-thirds, in a recent survey, thought italready had too big a say in public affairs. Former primeminister Tadeusz Mazowiecki calls its campaign a &quot;source ofanxiety&quot; and fears a backlash of &quot;militant anti-clericalism.&quot;   The government would like to commune quietly with thebishops about their ambitions. &quot;We can't go from a statefighting religion to one dominated by the power of thechurch,&quot; says one official. As communism's dismemberment goeson, he fears, priests might take too literally papal lessonson the evils of capitalism.   &quot;The question is whether the Catholic Church is capable ofcooperating in the creation of a free market,&quot; the officialadds. &quot;It would be the worst possible thing if the nationstarted hearing from the pulpit that there exists a betterway.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
