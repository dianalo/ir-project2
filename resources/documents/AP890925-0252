Algerian Mines Minister Sadek Boussena, one of the mediators inthe discussions of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries, left early to return to Algiers for a legislativemeeting.   Hurrying to his car, he said he had no statement to make butwished his colleagues ``much success.''   ``We haven't agreed on anything yet,'' Ecuador's oil minister,Diego Tamariz, told reporters. ``We're still analyzing thesituation.''   Boussena has been pressing the ministers to maintain theirproduction ceiling at the current level in an effort to lift crudeprices by a dollar, up to the cartel's target of $18 a barrel.   But a senior Algerian delegate, who demanded anonymity, said,``We are willing to consider an increase in the ceiling if thatdoesn't mean a decline in the price. That is our basic position.''   Other countries want to raise the supply cap from the current19.5 million barrels a day in the last three months of the year.They argue demand is strong enough to absorb the increase withoutupsetting prices.   Ministers of the 13-nation cartel met for several hours Sundayevening before breaking up to try to resolve their differencesprivately. One official leaving the meeting said the meeting was``going badly.''   ``It seems that the ceiling is the imminent problem,'' saidIraqi Oil Minister Issam al-Chalabi.   According to an OPEC official who did not want to be identifiedby name, a majority of the countries, including Iraq, Nigeria,Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, want an increase in theceiling. They are at odds, though, over how to divide up theadditional supply.   Chalabi said he favors an increase in the supply cap, with theextra amount shared proportionately among all 13. Each would get acertain amount added to its individual supply quota.   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates already are pumping beyondthe quotas assigned them in June.   A smaller group, including Algeria and Libya, wants to maintainthe ceiling at the current level to ensure that the group reachesits price target.   The ministers are described as very insistent on _ and lockedinto _ their positions.   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto told reporters, ``We are stilldeliberating about the best way to achieve (our) goal.''   He likened the oil ministers to hikers carrying maps andcompasses.   ``But there seems to be some discussion about the route to reachthat objective,'' he said. ``The pro, con and the handicap of theterrain are (being) evaluated.''   He said the objective is ``Point X ... Everybody agrees the onegoal is Point X.''   He declined to say more, but the goal is certain to be thebenchmark price.   Subroto has predicted demand for the cartel's oil would reach 22million barrels a day in the October-December period.   The cartel's executive body, according to sources, has saidprices could reach $18 a barrel even if the cap were lifted to asmuch as 21.5 million barrels a day _ but only if everyone agreed toabide by his quota.   Chalabi suggested the ministers had given up any attempt tosolve the problem of finding a more acceptable way to divvy upproduction shares and set individual quotas.   ``We should address the problem of the quotas if we can,'' hesaid. ``We will continue (the discussions) in the meantime from nowuntil November.'' Their next meeting is scheduled for late November.   In June, some ministers said they would try to settle the quotaissue at this meeting. There was no indication when the meetingwould end.   Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said he wouldleave Tuesday for Japan.   The talks are officially held by a monitoring panel made up ofAlgeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia andVenezuela.   The other members _ Gabon, Ecuador, Libya, Qatar and the UnitedArab Emirates _ were invited to attend.</TEXT></DOC>
