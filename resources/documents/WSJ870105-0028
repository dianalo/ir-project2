Most of the proposed terminations, which were disclosed by administration officials, are politically sensitive and underscore the difficulties the president faces in persuading Congress to accept his spending blueprint for the year starting Oct. 1. The White House will submit its budget to Congress today.    But the administration is retreating in its new budget from some previous proposals to kill individual programs and agencies. For example, instead of abolishing the Travel and Tourism Administration, the president's budget would impose a fee of $1 per ticket for international travel to and from the U.S. to offset the cost of the agency. Last year's budget urged Congress to end more than 40 programs.    Among programs that the new budget would eliminate are Amtrak subsidies, the Interstate Commerce Commission, subsidies for the training of health professionals, the Legal Services Corp., library grants, and grants for rural water and waste-disposal projects.    At the same time, the budget proposes a 30% increase in funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission, an agency that many lawmakers believe needs additional resources to pursue insider-trading cases. The budget also proposes $523 million for acquired immune deficiency syndrome research in fiscal 1988, 27% more than in 1987.    The administration also will announce today proposed pay raises for members of Congress, cabinet officers, and circuit and district court judges. Although large, the proposed raises will hold pay levels for all of those officials below $100,000. The pay increases are far smaller than those proposed last month by a special governmental commission.    The commission had recommended boosting the annual pay for cabinet officers to $160,000 from $88,800, for members of Congress to $135,000 from $77,400, and for district court judges to $130,000 from $81,100.    But the president decided to trim those proposals substantially. Salaries for cabinet officers will be held to less than $100,000, according to administration sources. Pay for members of Congress and district court judges will be kept below $95,000.    Separately, the Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate budget committees both indicated yesterday that some sort of tax increase is needed to get the deficit under control.    Appearing on NBC-TV's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Sen. Lawton Chiles of Florida and Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania dismissed the president's proposals as inadequate and called on the president to meet with them to negotiate a package of both spending cuts and tax increases. &quot;If you are going to balance&quot; the budget, Sen. Chiles said, &quot;it means you're going to have to have a combination of some revenues to go with spending cuts.&quot;    Many details of the budget, which envisions $1.024 trillion in fiscal 1988 outlays and a deficit of $107.8 billion, have been disclosed in recent weeks.    Over the weekend, officials revealed some additional proposals that haven't been widely publicized. Among them:    --The budget would reduce by 10% a year the &quot;target&quot; prices that are set by Congress as the basis for calculating farmers' income-protection subsidies. And it would limit to $50,000 a year the amount of federal assistance an individual farmer may receive. Both proposals are expected to encounter fierce resistance in Congress.    --In defense, the budget would stretch out procurement for the Abrams tank, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and the Blackhawk helicopter. It would delay ship procurement, funding 16 ships rather than the 24 envisioned in last year's budget. The administration's goal of achieving 40 Air Force tactical wings has been reduced to 37 wings.    --The budget would cut to 35,000 barrels a day the rate at which the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is filled. The current rate is 75,000 barrels a day.    --The budget would expand and overhaul a number of federal programs as part of a White House initiative to enhance U.S. competitiveness in global markets through the improvement of American research and development.    The White House is proposing an increase of 16% in funding for the National Science Foundation, a 20% boost for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and a 15% increase for the general science programs of the Energy Department.    Through the National Science Foundation, the administration proposes to establish between five and 10 new basic science and technology centers, which would focus on basic research and the transfer of new knowledge from the laboratory to the marketplace.    The budget also would expand the various programs now providing job search, job training and cash benefits for dislocated workers, while placing them under a new, umbrella program. The program would assist such workers regardless of whether their jobs were displaced because of imports, or whether they lost their farms or were recipients of long-term unemployment insurance.    The program would be operated by the states, with local oversight responsibilities given to the private industry councils formed under the Job Partnership Training Act, part of which would be folded into the new program. For fiscal 1988, the new program would receive $980 million, compared with $310 million appropriated for comparable programs in the current fiscal year.    According to administration projections, the budget would shrink the deficit to $93 billion in fiscal 1989, $60 billion in fiscal 1990, and $21 billion in fiscal 1991 before producing a surplus of $12 billion in fiscal 1992.    Officials disclosed that in fiscal 1988 the budget would save $6.7 billion from the current projected cost of major medical programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and would raise $3.2 billion from imposing user fees on federal services such as meat inspection.    Among the proposals is a new insurance fee on guaranteed student loans, intended to cover the cost of defaults. The fee would be 9% of the loan amount for regular guaranteed student loans, and it would replace the current 5% origination fee that is intended to cover a portion of the interest subsidy provided by the government.    In a related development, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the deficit would decline to $174 billion in fiscal 1987 from the $220.7 billion recorded last year. The administration's projected deficit for fiscal 1987 is $173 billion.    Thus the deficit for this year appears almost certain to be well above the $144 billion target set by the Gramm-Rudman law. Congress enacted sufficient budget cuts and other savings last year to bring the projected deficit close to the target. But in recent weeks estimated costs have risen for federal farm programs and bank bailouts, while projected receipts have fallen.    The CBO forecasts that under current spending and tax policies, the deficit will be $169 billion in fiscal 1988 and will narrow in subsequent years, reaching $85 billion in fiscal 1992. The agency bases its prediction on the assumption that the economy will grow at about 3% annually, after adjustment for inflation, between the fourth quarter of 1986 and the fourth quarter of 1988, and then at a slightly slower pace in the following three years.    The administration, using a more optimistic set of assumptions for the economy, projects that the deficit under current spending and tax trends will be $150 billion in fiscal 1988, narrowing to $78 billion in fiscal 1992. </TEXT></DOC>
