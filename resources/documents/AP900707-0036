Jackson told about 600 mourners that Snyder was a man who heardand answered a ``moral call'' to help the homeless.   ``The fact that birds have a home, foxes have a home, and yetmen and women, veterans of foreign wars, mothers and fathers,working poor people, have no place to lay their head _ he foundthat to be a moral disgrace,'' Jackson said.</TEXT></DOC>
