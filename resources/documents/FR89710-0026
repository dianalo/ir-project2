As a result, security has become an even greaterconcern of the aviation community. In recent years, sophisticated explosivedevices have been used to damage or destroy civilian airliners resultingin the loss of many lives. For example, 259 people on board Pan AmericanWorld Airways (Pan Am) Flight 103 plus 11 persons on the ground in Lockerbie,Scotland, were killed by the explosion and subsequent crash of that airliner.The attack against Pan Am 103, as well as other similar incidents, demonstratethe increasing need to protect the safety and security of passengers, aircraft,and crewmembers aboard U.S. air carriers. Effective explosives detectionequipment would help address this need.HistoryThe FAA's Civil Aviation Security Program, initiated in 1973, requirescertain U.S. air carriers to conduct security screening of passengers andtheir carry-on baggage to prevent or deter the carriage aboard aircraftof any explosive, incendiary, or deadly or dangerous weapon on or aboutany individual's person or accessible property. Part 108 of the FederalAviation Regulations (FAR) (14 CFR Part 108), which pertains to U.S. aircarriers, was promulgated in 1981 (46 FR 3782; January 15, 1981).For many years, the passenger screening system was very effective in counteringthe threat to domestic and international civil aviation, which primarilycame from hijackers. In recent years, this threat has expanded to includeaircraft bombings. To meet this threat, new methods of detection are requiredto detect explosive devices.The U.S. Government has actively supported research and development effortsin explosives detection. For example, over the last 4 years, the FAA hasspent over $30 million on research and development related to explosivesdetection. The need for more effective explosives detection equipment alsohas received worldwide attention. In February 1989, the International CivilAviation Organization (ICAO), convened a special session of its Councilto discuss acts of sabotage directed against international civil aviationand the need to expedite research and development on the detection of explosives.In March, ICAO held a meeting of world experts in explosives detectionto address the issue. Similar discussions have taken place in Europeanorganizations. There have been significant technological advancements made in explosivesdetection equipment. The FAA has tested several of these systems, and hasdecided to purchasse six Thermal Neutron Analysis (TNA) units for initialinstallation at selected airports. The TNA equipment was tested at SanFrancisco International and Los Angeles International Airports and wasshown to have the highest degree of explosives detection capability currentlypossible for detecting known civilian and military explosives, manufacturedhere and abroad.On March 24, 1989, the Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, an unincorporatedassociation of 300 persons whose relatives were killed on that flight,petitioned the FAA to, among other things, require ``that all checked baggagebe examined by physical inspection, a TNA device, or a colorized electronicx-ray.'' While the notice addresses that aspect of the petition, it doesnot address other issues raised by the Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 petition.Hence, this action is not intended to dispose of that petition, a summaryof which has been published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for comment so that all issues can be thoroughlydiscussed by interested commenters [54 FR 24354; June 7, 1989].Related ActivitiesThe tragedy of Pan Am Flight 103 is a global reminder that civil aviation,despite detailed and sophisticated security procedures, is still vulnerableto criminal or terrorist acts. A comprehensive review of security procedureshas been conducted to determine where existing procedures may be improvedand where new procedures may be warranted. On April 3, 1989, Secretaryof Transportation Samuel K. Skinner announced a number of aviation securityinitiatives to ensure protection of travelers at airports in the UnitedStates and other countries. Most significant among these initiatives wasthe commitment to propose requiring the widespread deployment of explosivesdetection systems (EDS). A second major initiative, the establishment ofa mandatory security bulletin system, is the subject of a separate rulemakingaction.Congressional ActivityOn June 30, 1989, the President signed legislation that included a provisionrelating to the installation and use of explosive detection equipment [sic].The legislation, Pub. L. 101-45, provided that ``Not later than thirtydays after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Federal AviationAdministrator shall initiate action, including such rulemaking or otheractions as necessary, to require the use of explosive detection equipmentthat meets minimum performance standards requiring application of technologyequivalent to or better than thermal neutron analysis technology at suchairports (whether located within or outside the United States) as the Administratordetermines that the installation and use of such equipment is necessaryto ensure the safety of air commerce. The Administrator shall completethese actions within sixty days of enactment of this Act[.]'' As a resultof the Congressionally-mandated timeframe for final action, the commentperiod in this rulemaking is shorter than usually provided.Current RequirementsPresently, Part 108 requires each holder of an FAA air carrier operatingcertificate required to conduct screening to use the procedures, facilities,and equipment described in its approved security program to prevent ordeter carriage aboard airplanes of any explosives, incendiaries, or deadlyor dangerous weapons.General Discussion of the ProposalsThe FAA is proposing to amend Part 108 to require air carriers conductingscheduled or public charter operations in international service with aircrafthaving a passenger seating configuration of more than 60 seats to use anEDS that meets performance criteria and standards developed by the Administratorto screen checked baggage under the certificate holder's approved securityprogram. Although not part of the current proposal, the FAA is consideringthe advisability of extending EDS screening to domestic flights as well.Therefore, the FAA asks commenters to address this issue. Any final ruleadopted in this proceeding could include EDS on domestic flights. However,the current proposal, if adopted, would require air carriers to use anEDS to detect explosives only in international operations.If adopted, the following minimum performance criteria would be establishedfor the system:1. The system must be automated. 2. It must detect defined quantities and configurations of FAA-definedexplosives. 3. It must be safe for operators and baggage. More detailed information about the capabilities and use of the systemwould be incorporated into each air carrier's approved security program.In accordance with 14 CFR andSection;191.5, the FAA will not publish thefull performance criteria or detailed operational information in any documentgenerally available to the public. The Director of Civil Aviation Securityhas determined that disclosure of this information would be detrimentalto the safety of persons traveling in air transportation or intrastateair transportation. For the same reasons, the specific locations and numbers of the units wouldnot be available to the public. It is the FAA's intent to require deploymentinitially at the busiest international airports in the United States andat designated airports outside the United States that are served by U.S.air carriers. This would potentially require installation of EDS at approximately40 airports located in the United States and abroad. The specific compliancedates, locations, and phase-in schedule would be described in each aircarrier's approved security program. The FAA and the Department of Transportationhave initiated discussions with foreign governments and will continue toconsult with foreign governments to facilitate implementation of theseprocedures. No matter which alternative is selected, the FAA expects to phase-in theimplementation of this proposed rule, with 100 percent screening of internationalchecked baggage at designated airports as the goal for the initial implementationperiod. Following the initial implementation, the FAA foresees extendingthe applicability of explosives detection screening under an air carrier'sapproved security program to all checked baggage on all international flightsunless a more limited installation alternative is selected, in which caseEDS screening would apply to additional flights on a threat-driven basis.Although not part of the current proposal, the FAA is also seeking commentson the advisability of extending the EDS requirements to all checked baggageon all domestic flights as well. The proposed rule is a broad enablementfor the FAA to require air carriers to use an EDS. If this proposed ruleis issued without change as a final rule, the FAA would have authorityto require U.S. air carriers, by amending each air carrier's approved securityprogram, to use an EDS to screen all checked baggage on all internationalflights for which screening is required. In determining whether and when to require the installation of EDS unitsat particular airports beyond the initial deployment described above, theFAA would consider a variety of factors. These factors would include wherenecessary the successful consultation with affected foreign governments,as well as the level of vulnerability at the particular location and theprojected level of usage of the EDS equipment. The level of usage is afunction of the number of passengers enplaned and is therefore relatedto the cost per passenger of EDS screening for flights from that location.In order to elicit public participation and to get the broadest spectrumof response regarding the economic costs and benefits involved in acquiringand using state-of-the-art EDS, the FAA has initiated this rulemaking action.State-of-the-art EDS are expensive to acquire and to operate. The use ofsuch systems may have other effects as well; for example, their use ondomestic flights may require earlier check-in times than currently required.However, the FAA analysis projects that the number of EDS at affected airportswould be sufficient to minimize passenger delay and avoid disruptions.The FAA requests comments on the degree to which EDS should be used forvarious types of flights. Section 108.7New paragraph (b)(8) of this section would require certificate holdersto describe in their approved security program the procedures, facilities,and equipment used by the certificate holder to comply with the new EDSrequirements. Section 108.20This new section would mandate that certificate holders required to conductscreening under an approved security program use an approved EDS to detectexplosives in checked baggage on international flights under the air carrier'sapproved security program. Because of the costs involved and the fact thatdifferent categories of airports would require varying numbers of thesesystems, this proposal would not require each individual certificate holderto own an EDS, and would not preclude use of each EDS by several air carriers.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation Summary</ITAG>This section summarizes the preliminary cost and benefit assessment ofa proposed revision to Part 108 of the Federal Aviation Regulations thatwould require U.S. air carriers required to conduct screening under anapproved security program to use an explosives detection system (EDS) approvedby the Administrator, to screen checked baggage on international flights.The proposed addition of new paragraph 108.7(b) would require affectedair carriers to use explosives detection systems in accordance with theprovisions established by the Administrator and contained in their approvedsecurity programs. Since the FAA is also requesting comment in broadeningthe scope of coverage to include screening domestic baggage with EDS, apreliminary evaluation of the cost and benefit of such an extension isincluded. In addition, the evaluation considers the cost and benefits ofa narrower EDS system, in which screening would be conducted only for internationaloperations at airports selected on a threat-driven basis.The primary objective of this proposed rule is the prevention of criminalacts or acts of terrorism against U.S. air carriers by individuals usingexplosive devices. Toward this end, the FAA has conducted extensive researchaimed at detecting explosives. This research has concentrated on EDS devices,including the Thermal Neutron Analysis (TNA) system and vapor detectionsystems, as well as advanced x-ray systems. The TNA device is the mostadvanced explosives detection system now available. Therefore, the FAAhas elected to analyze three alternative solutions for explosives detectionusing TNA systems over the 10-year period of 1990 to 1999. These are:I. <T3>Domestic and International Alternative.</T3> Install EDS at 427 airportsin the U.S. and at airports in 95 foreign countries over a 10-year phase-inperiod. (100% checked baggage screening of U.S. domestic and internationalflights, eventally requiring 1,250 DES by 1999.)II. <T3>International Alternative (The Current Proposal).</T3> Install onlyenough EDS to screen U.S. carrier international flights at domestic andforeign airports over a three year phase-in period. (100% checked baggagescreening of all U.S. international flights, eventually requiring 400 EDSby 1999.)III. <T3>Threat-Driven Alternative.</T3> Install 200 EDS at an unspecified numberof domestic and foreign airports over a three year phase-in period, basedon a threat-driven approach. (100% checked baggage screening of all internationalflights at selected airports, eventually requiring 270 EDS to be installedby 1999.)Alternative II is the Alternative being proposed. The costs and numberof machines being proposed in Alternative III are a subset of those inAlternative II. Alternative I is presented to provide information aboutand to invite comment on extending the EDS requirement to domestic flights.The methods and assumptions used in the analyses for the alternatives revisionsaffecting Part 108 have been developed by the FAA. A major considerationguiding the conduct of this analysis is the assumption that 100% screeningof checked baggage on flights where passenger screening is currently requiredwould be conducted under all three scenarios at those airports where EDSare to be installed. The analyses assume enough machines to take into accountpeak hour travel and the projected growth in travel; this would ensureminimal delays. Preliminary cost factors were obtained from manufacturersand research organizations. Information for the formulation of benefitswas obtained from the safety records of the International Civil AviationOrganization and the FAA. The costs and benefits of each of these Alternativeshave been analyzed over the 10-year span of 1990 to 1999.To estimate the potential benefits of the proposal and the Alternatives,the FAA reviewed the safety record for the 10 year period between 1979and 1988. This review reveals that 19 separate criminal acts and incidentsof terrorism using explosives were perpetrated against U.S. air carriersduring this period. The FAA has classified these incidents into Class Iand Class II categories. The Class I category includes those incidents,such as the explosion aboard Pan American Flight 103 that involve the lossof an entire aircraft and a large number of fatalities. Class II accountsfor all other incidents in which airplanes were only partially damagedor the incident was partially averted such as explosions that occurredoutside the aircraft (usually somewhere in the airport itself). These twotypes of incidents vary significantly both in terms of costs and theirfrequency. The FAA estimates that those Class II incidents that would occurover the 10 years from 1990 to 1999 would result in a discounted cost of$31.0 million.The losses associated with Class I or major incidents would, of course,be substantially greater. For example, the loss on human life and property,and lost revenues for the loss of U.S. carriers' market share associatedwith Pan American Flight 103 are estimated to have a present value rangeof $411.0 million to $520.0 million depending on the extent of market reduction.It is difficult to predict the extent to which international terrorismwould increase. Nevertheless, the FAA believes that in the absence of additionalpreventive measures, terrorists attacks against U.S. air carriers wouldcontinue. The FAA cannot predict the number and severity of future incidents.The frequency of such incidents would depend on several factors, including,but not limited to, the world-wide political climate, the skill and technicalsophistication of terrorist organizations, and the success of efforts toavert these incidents. However, in this case, the present value of thebenefit associated with the prevention of these incidents would be as highas $1.071 billion. Table I of this summary shows the estimated costs andbenefits of these Alternatives:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table I._Summary of Costs and Benefits</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Net present value in millions of dollars]</ITAG><H1>Options</H1><H1>Estimated costs</H1><H1>Percentage of total incidents avoided for breakeven*</H1><H1>Calculations</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Alternative I (Domestic and international alternative)<D>$1,004</D><D>94</D><D>$1,004/$1,071=94%</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alternative II (International alternative_the current proposal)<D>$476</D><D>45</D><D>$476/$1,071=45%</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alternative III (Threat-driven alternative)<D>$346</D><D>33</D><D>$346/$1,071=33%</D><F>* Total incidents is equal to two Class I incidents and all Class IIincidents avoided. The discounted present value of these incidents avoidedis $1,071 million. The percentages do not represent a judgment of the relativeeffectiveness of each Alternative.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Table I examines how many Class I and Class II incidents would have tobe prevented by each Alternative for the Alternatives to be cost beneficial.The percentages in the table do not represent a judgment of the relativeeffectiveness of each Alternative; they show the percentage of total incidentswhereby each of the three Alternatives will have different breakeven pointsso as to become cost beneficial. The costs associated with each Alternativeare compared with those benefits projected from avoiding two Class I incidentsand a discounted present value of the $31 million worth of projected costsfrom Class II incidents. For the purposes of this analysis, this is theprojected universe of incidents.For the current proposal, Alternative II, to be cost beneficial, it wouldhave to prevent nearly one-half (45 percent) of this projected set of ClassI and Class II incidents. If EDS coverage is expanded to include domesticoperations (Alternative I), this option would have to prevent nearly theentire set of Class I and Class II incidents to be cost effective. And,the costs associated with limiting installation of EDS to those internationaloperations at airports selected on a threat-driven basis (Alternative III)is roughly one-third of the assumed set of incidents.Because the number and potential severity of future attacks and the scopeand location of international threats are difficult to predict and dueto the sensitive nature of this proposal, the FAA has elected not to attemptto quantify which Alternative would be the most cost effective in reducingthe risk of future terrorist attacks. For similar reasons, the FAA willnot assign values to the probabilities of a Class I or Class II event foreach Alternative scenario.In addition to these quantifiable benefits, the FAA expects further significantunquantifiable benefits. The rule would result in public recognition ofadditional safety factors implemented by U.S. air carriers. The public'ssubsequent higher confidence levels should result in more passengers andhigher revenues.The deterrence of terrorist attacks against U.S. civil aviation also hasvery significant public and foreign policy benefits. An attack on an Americanaircraft disrupts the lives and plans of great numbers of people who havesuffered no direct loss in the incident. (Indeed, this is presumably oneof the goals of those who perpetrate acts of terrorism.) The FAA cannotcalculate the cost of uncompleted business, disrupted education, and deferredvacations. Nevertheless, that cost is unquestionably significant, and itwill be avoided if the public retains a high level of confidence in thesafety of the air transportation system. Maintaining and improving thepublic's confidence is a central goal in this rulemaking.The costs of compliance with the three Alternatives subject to this analysisare constructed on the assumption that EDS would be placed within the shelteredconfines of affected airports in accordance with the configuration of theterminal and the needs of air carriers. There is uncertainty concerningthe number of EDS that would require placement outdoors. The FAA has beenunable to estimate the cost associated with protecting these systems fromthe effects of weather. Therefore, the FAA solicits information relatingto the cost of sheltering EDS from the elements. In addition to commentson expanding the scope of EDS screening to domestic operations, or narrowingit to cover only operations selected on a threat-driven basis, specificcomments are requested on the following issues:1. The number of airports that would need to place EDS machines outdoors.2. Estimates of costs associated with the construction of shelters.The FAA requests information and comment about the technologies and systemsfor explosives detection. This information should address the maturityof the technology, the general capabilities of the system, the cost ofthe system, and the commercial availability of the system. Detailed, securitysensitive information about the capabilities of various technologies shouldnot be sent to the public docket, rather such security-sensitive informationshould be sent directly to the Director of Civil Aviation Security, FAA,800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591, ATTENTION: ExplosivesDetection System for Checked Baggage Rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress toinsure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionatelyburdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires Federal agencies toreview rules that may have a ``significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities''. Issuance of the proposed revision of Part 108of the FAR would affect some small air carriers. The FAA's Order prescribingsmall entity size standards identifies a small air carrier as one withnine or fewer operating aircraft. According to the FAA data for the periodending December 31, 1988, there were 54 air carriers subject to the rulesof Part 121 that operated nine or fewer airplanes. These 54 carriers arethe entities affected by the proposed rule. The criteria for a ``substantial number of small entities'' is one-thirdof the small firms subject to the proposed rules, but no fewer than 11firms. A review of the 54 small carriers engaged in scheduled and unscheduledservice shows that only 10 firms would be subject to the proposal. Therefore,the proposed amendments to Part 108 would not affect a substantial numberof small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Trade Impact Statement</ITAG>The FAA finds that this rule would only impact Part 121 operators and thusit is not likely to affect international trade. This proposed rule is expectedto have no impact on trade opportunities for either U.S. firms doing businessoverseas or foreign firms doing business in the United States. While therewould be an increased cost to U.S. air carriers as a consequence of thisproposed rule, these increased costs would be offset by the increase ofpublic confidence, the avoidance of incidents, and by the ability to reducethe use of certain costly security procedures now required by U.S. aircarriers. <ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications </ITAG>The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings inthe Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade ImpactAnalysis, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is majorunder Executive Order 12291. In addition, the FAA certifies that this proposal,if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. This proposal is considered significant under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979).
