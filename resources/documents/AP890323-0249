But the Commerce Department said the increase in the grossnational product, the broadest measure of economic health, wasaccompanied by a pickup in inflation, reflecting higher food costsand rising import prices.   The 2.4 percent increase represented an upward revision from lastmonth, when the government estimated that the GNP had grown at anannual rate of just 2 percent in the October-December quarter.   The economy's momentum would have been an even stronger 3.5percent except for the lingering effects of last summer's drought,which subtracted more than 1 percentage point from growth.   However, the strong growth, propelled by high consumer demand,has economists and the Federal Reserve Board worried, given thetight labor markets and high factory operating rates.   The Fed last month embarked on a renewed drive to push interestrates higher in an effort to dampen demand and cool off growinginflationary pressures.   But the Bush administration and some private economists havecomplained that the Fed may be in danger of overdoing that effortand end up pushing the country into a recession.   Despite some alarming reports on inflation in January andFebruary that sent the stock market plunging, many analysts believethat growth is slowing and the central bank does not need to do morein its anti-inflation efforts.   First word on the GNP performance for the first three months of1989 will be released in April.   An inflation index tied to the GNP rose at a sharp annual rate of5.3 percent in the October-December quarter, up from a 4.7 percentrate of increase in the third quarter.   Since the index, known as the GNP deflator, has been rising atannual rate of 3.8 percent or less for the past three years,analysts said the uptick over the 5 percent mark indicated thatinflationary pressures have increased.   In a look at how U.S. businesses performed, the CommerceDepartment said corporate profits after taxes shot up 14.6 percentin 1988, aided by a 2.8 percent rise in the fourth quarter. Theannual increase was the best performance for corporate profits sincea huge 22.4 percent jump in 1983, the year after the end of thesteep 1981-82 recession.   The upward revision in the GNP for the fourth quarter made growthfor the entire year look slightly better. The government said theGNP rose 3.9 percent in 1988, the best performance since a 6.8percent increase in 1984. The yearly GNP increase had been put at3.8 percent earlier.   The 2.4 percent GNP growth in the fourth quarter followed a 2.5percent rise in the July-September quarter.   While it was the slowest advance since a 1.4 percent rise in thefourth quarter of 1986, analysts said the pace was still too strongbecause the overall rate was held back by the drought.   The government has said it expects growth in the first quarter of1989 will be boosted by 2.5 percentage points, reflecting a bounceback from the drought.   The upward revision for the fourth quarter reflected highergovernment spending than previously estimated and a smaller declinein business investment.   The positive factors were offset somewhat by a larger tradedeficit. The government said the gap between imports and exportsshot up at an annual rate of $11.5 billion in the fourth quarter,the sharpest widening of the trade imbalance since the third quarterof 1986.   While exports climbed by 6.5 percent, this improvement wasswamped by a 13.5 percent rise in imports. Many analysts are fearfulthat the improvement in the trade deficit, which contributed almosthalf of total growth last year in the economy, has stalled out.   These analysts predict that the combination of a worsening tradepicture and the credit-tightening by the Fed will translate intomuch more sluggish growth this year.   That possibility has the administration worried because PresidentBush is counting on economic growth remaining robust as a way oflowering the budget deficit without resorting to a tax increase.   The administration's economic forecast, upon which it based itsassumption that the budget deficit would decline below $100 billionnext year, called for the GNP to expand at a healthy clip of 3.2percent.   However, private economists, even those who think the country canescape without a recession, are much more pessimistic.   The latest consensus forecast from Blue Chip Economic Indicators,a financial newsletter which surveys 50 top economists each month,puts growth for 1989 at 2.7 percent, based on a belief that consumerspending, business investment and U.S. exports will all show lessstrength than in 1988.   Many analysts believe there is plenty of evidence that theslowdown is already occurring in weaker consumer spending and slowerbusiness investment.   On Wednesday, the government reported that orders to U.S.factories for ``big ticket'' durable goods declined for a secondstraight month in February, the first back-to-back monthly declinesin three years.   Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association ofManufacturers, said the decline in factory orders provided ``solidevidence that the economy is slowing down.''   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington,Mass., said he believed the slowdown would not snowball into anoutright recession even though he said the worse-than-expectedinflation reports so far this year did increase the possibility of aslump.</TEXT></DOC>
