<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-55-1099 </DOCNO><TEXT>This paper describes design and operation of a 300 t/h (db) spiral concentratorplant as an extension to an existing 900 t/h (db) dense medium and frothflotation preparation plant to wash a prime quality metallurgical coal.Initial pilot scale test work and reasons for the circuit selection arediscussed. Relationships between separating density DSO, volumetric flowrate,feed solids loading and feed particle size are identified and controlstrategies discussed. Planned improvements for optimisation of the totalplant circuit are described.</TEXT></DOC>
