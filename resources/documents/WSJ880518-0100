The National Association of Purchasing Management's semiannual economic poll found that members predict a &quot;better&quot; economy in 1988 than in 1987 by a margin of more than 7-to-1.    Members expect the economy to grow in the current quarter largely because of increasing capital outlays and significantly expanding exports, the report says. And they expect the second half will show even stronger growth than the first half.    But along with that growth, the purchasing managers predict price increases averaging about 5.8% in 1988. Prices already have risen an average 3.8% this year, more than the 3.6% increase the group envisioned for the full year when it was polled last December.    The new forecast comes at a time when the Federal Reserve Board has been raising interest rates in hopes of curbing inflation that could be sparked by too robust an economy.    &quot;There's no question that the price increases we've experienced are more than anybody thought,&quot; said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the group's business survey committee. Mr. Bretz added that the price increases will eventually filter down to the consumer level. &quot;Whether it be three months or six months or nine months, we'll see signs of higher consumer prices,&quot; said Mr. Bretz, who is also director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc.    &quot;The good news is that we've probably absorbed the bulk (of price increases) for this year,&quot; added Mr. Bretz. Depending on where manufacturers are in the production chain, they may experience only moderate additional increases for the rest of 1988, he said.    The purchasing group, with 30,000 members, said manufacturers it represents are operating at the highest capacity rate since May 1979. About 58% of the companies are running at 90% or higher capacity, compared with only half who were operating at that rate in December, according to the survey released at the group's annual conference in Nashville, Tenn.    Export business is expected to continue growing for the rest of the year, the report says. But it also indicates that imports have increased slightly and that that trend is expected to continue for the rest of 1988.    Mr. Bretz said rising imports could slow some of the progress the U.S. is making on reducing the trade deficit. The March deficit figures, released yesterday, showed a surprisingly sharp narrowing of the trade gap.    While Mr. Bretz expects the deficit to narrow in 1988, he doesn't necessarily see the stunning March numbers being repeated. &quot;It's like watching your home team score 10 runs in the second inning,&quot; he said. &quot;You wouldn't expect them to score 10 runs every inning for the rest of the game.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
