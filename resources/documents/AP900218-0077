Authorities are re-examining the case of Luan Van Hoang, whosaid he told police his name was Michael Nguyen and that he was 17to avoid being returned to a California home for juvenileoffenders, The Dallas Morning News said.   The boy, who'd lived in the United States for four years and hadlimited knowledge of the legal system when arrested, said hebelieved Vietnamese friends who told him that lying about his agewould result in probation.   Dallas County authorities said they accepted Luan's story andtried him as an adult.   But after reviewing records obtained by the Morning News thatshow Luan was a juvenile, District Attorney John Vance on Fridaytook steps to return the boy to Dallas to determine whether heshould remain in prison.   ``We're happy to know this,'' Vance said. ``If he is in fact ajuvenile, he has no business being in our prison as an adult.''   Luan, now 17, is at the maximum-security Wynne prison inHuntsville with men, many of them twice his age, serving time formurder and other violent crimes.   He said some of the men have tried to attack him sexually.   ``I looked young,'' Luan said. ``If you are weak, they will try.They did try. They see I am different. I was scared. They tried tohurt me. I tried to protect myself.''   Texas prisons are limited to adult convicts and juvenileconvicts 15 and older who are certified to stand trial as adults.Offenders under 15 are supposed to be tried in juvenile courts and,if found delinquent, sent to Texas Youth Commission centers.   Luan's father, Tien Van Hoang, wrote state District Judge JackHampton, who presided over Luan's trial, that his son was underage.   ``Nobody answer,'' said the Moreno Valley, Calif., man. ``Nobodywrite to me anything.''   Texas Department of Corrections officials know Luan only asMichael Nguyen. Department spokesman Charles Brown said Nguyen'sfile shows a birth date of Jan. 8, 1968, and identifies his fatheras Tien Van Hoang.   ``There are errors all the time,'' Brown said. ``If there's anerror, we're not opposed to correcting it. I don't think it's ourerror, though.''   Neither the boy nor his family has a copy of his birthcertificate.   ``When I escape from Vietnam by boat, everything was lost,''said Tien, who was in the South Vietnamese Army and was imprisonedby the communists after the fall of Saigon in 1975.   He escaped from prison. In 1982, he and his family sailed to theUnited States.   According to U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Servicedocuments, Luan was born on Oct. 10, 1972, in South Vietnam.California public school records give the same date.   ``It would appear to me ... that this person has been illegallysentenced and should be released if you can prove his age,'' saidRon Jackson, executive director of the Texas Youth Commission.   Juvenile court records are confidential, but Luan said he wassent to a California halfway house for boys after arrests forjoyriding and auto theft.   He said he fled after serving eight months of a nine-monthsentence. He hitched a ride to Texas, and joined a band ofVietnamese youths who police said were involved in robbing Asianrefugees in the Dallas area.   Luan admitted being present during the robbery of a man atgunpoint on Jan. 29, 1986.   Police say they eventually linked Luan to several robberies inthe area. Before his trial, Dallas County Assistant DistrictAttorney Lana McDaniel offered Luan a plea bargain, but he refused.He was convicted, and sentenced to 38 years.   Luan's girlfriend testified at the trial that the youth was 17.Ms. McDaniel said she relied upon the police determination ofLuan's age.   ``What am I supposed to do?'' she said. ``I can't investigate(the age of) every kid who tells us he's 17. He needs to learn notto lie when his life is on the line.''</TEXT></DOC>
