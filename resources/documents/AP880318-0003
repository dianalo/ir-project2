In northern Nicaragua, warplanes dropped bombs near a Sandinistamilitary headquarters Thursday, but no casualties or damageresulted. Reporters at the scene said the explosives fell on theHonduran side of the border.   Nicaragua and a U.S. official said earlier that the raid wasaimed at the military post.   The American troops were to engage in joint exercises with theHondurans. But the U.S. airlift was so hastily arranged thatAmerican commanders were left scrambling to develop trainingexercises to keep the men busy.   Hundreds of soldiers bedded down in dusty fields near theairstrip awaiting orders for training missions which normally arearranged months in advance.   The American troops were told to expect to spend about 10 daysin Honduras, but spokesmen said there was no official timetable yetfor them to leave.   Two battalions from the renowned 82nd Airborne Division of FortBragg, N.C., and two battalions from the 7th Light InfantryDivision of Fort Ord, Calif., were combined into a task force of3,000 troops.   A Honduran official said his government had given theSandinistas 24 hours to get out of the country, which they enteredin pursuit of Contra rebels.   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua responded that his army was``ready to combat and liquidate the famous forces of the 82ndAirborne Division.''   Maj. Gen. Carl W. Stiner, commander of the 82nd Airborne, saidhe knew of no plan to have U.S. troops enter into the battlebetween the Sandinistas and the U.S.-backed -Contras.   ``We have not been told to do so,'' he said before leaving FortBragg. He said the force was capable of that, if needed.   Stiner also said there was no plan to use the troops if moretrouble broke out in nearby Panama.   The American forces began arriving at Palmerola at 10:15 a.m. aspart of what the Pentagon called operation ``Golden Pheasant.''   The 26 C-141 transport planes landed in the intense heat at30-minute intervals at this air base, headquarters of U.S. militaryoperations in Honduras, 40 miles northwest of Tegucigalpa.   The deployment was about 125 miles west of the area where Reaganadministration officials say the Nicaraguan Sandinista army haschased rebel Contra forces over the border into Honduras.   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, a Honduran armed forces spokesman,said the deadline for the Sandinistas to leave was final.   He said 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers had crossed the border andpenetrated about six miles in pursuit of Contra rebels. A militaryintelligence source said earlier the Nicaraguans were surrounded byabout 4,000 Honduran troopers.   Suarez Benavides would not comment on Pentagon reports of newNicaraguan attacks inside Honduras.   The Sandinista movements did not appear to be a full-fledgedinvasion, Stiner said, adding that he saw the U.S. operation as adeterrent.   Ortega would not say whether his soldiers had crossed the borderin pursuit of the U.S.-supported rebels.   ``Here the question is not if army troops penetrated Honduranterritory or not, but that we have dozens of camps of mercenaryforces in Honduran territory, in view of and tolerated by theHonduran government,'' he said at a news conference in Managua.   He said Nicaraguan soldiers would not withdraw from the borderarea. Ortega called the U.S. troop deployment ``a dangerous act''and demanded a meeting of the U.N. Security Council.   A spokesman for the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry said before thenews conference that Nicaragua had begun pulling its troops backfrom the frontier region after driving about 2,000 Contra rebelsback into Honduras. The Defense and Foreign ministries denied thatNicaraguan troops entered Honduras.   Nicaraguan presidential spokesman Manuel Espinoza Enriquez latersaid that air attackers fired at least five rockets Thursday at theNicaraguan military headquarters at Bocay, near the Hondurasborder. Sandinista gunfire forced the planes to turn back, he said.   Reporters saw two planes entering Nicaraguan air space fromHonduras. They saw nothing to support a report from a U.S. officialin Washington that a Soviet-built helicopter had been destroyed.   Manuel Suarez, a Honduran spokesman in Tegucigalpa, denied theHonduran air force crossed the border, and said it dropped at leastfive bombs inside Honduras along the border near Bocay.   Heavy fighting was reported Wednesday in the Olancho borderprovince about 125 miles east of Palmerola.   Included in the American forces are two battalions from the 82ndAirborne and two from a new division organized for quick movementaround the world. The 82nd Airborne and 7th Light Infantry arebased at opposite ends of the country.   The final 800 U.S. troops are to arrive Friday by parachute,weather permitting.   In addition to the C-141 aircraft, a giant C-5A transport wasloaded with helicopter gunships for the exercise.   The Honduran intelligence source, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said: ``We will not allow the Sandinistas to movefarther into the interior of our territory. We want to avoid alarge conflict, but if it isn't possible, we will have to face theinvading troops.''   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said in Washington thesoldiers were being sent to ``get people's attention to what ishappening in Central America'' and say to the Honduran government:``We are your friends.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the completedeployment would take about 27 hours. The Defense Department saidnine helicopters and two light tanks were also sent.   It was the the most dramatic show of U.S. force since theContras began fighting in Nicaragua six years ago, and it came inresponse to a request for help from President Jose Azcona Hoyo ofHonduras.   Since 1981, Honduras has been a key U.S. ally in Central Americaand a major element in Reagan administration policy of fightingNicaragua's leftist government.   About 1,100 American soldiers normally are stationed at severalmilitary installations in Honduras. In addition, other nationalguard and army troops rotate through for joint exercises,road-building and other projects.</TEXT></DOC>
