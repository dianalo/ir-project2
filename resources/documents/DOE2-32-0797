Fromthe first of April through the end of June in 1988, net generation fromnuclear-powered units continued to be a major source of energy. Nuclearunits produced 124,796 gigawatthours of electricity, a total of 20,398gigawatthours (20% ) more than during the second quarter of 1987. Netgeneration from nuclear plants represented 19.6% of the total electricityproduced during the second quarter of 1988. During this period, one nuclearunit, the Braidwood Plant (Unit 2) became operable; it has a net summercapability of 1107 megawatts. This unit, located in Illinois, is operatedby the Commonwealth Edison Company, which owns and operates 12 nuclearunits (more than any other electric utility in the United States). Thisunit represented 40% of the total net summer capability (2797 megawatts)that become operable during the second quarter in 1988. Output from coal-firedplants during the second quarter of 1988 was 355,693 gigawatthours, 2%more than the amount generated for the second quarter of 1987. In Apriland May of 1988, two new coal-fired units became operable, providingan additional 1030 megawatts of net summer capabilities. 9 refs., 1 fig.,15 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
