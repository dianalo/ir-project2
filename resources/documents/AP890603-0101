Eyptian and Israeli officials gave differing accounts of theincident.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Allon Liel said Israel asked Egyptfor a ``clarification'' of the incident, which occurred in the Gulfof Aqaba, near Israel's Red Sea resort of Eilat and Egypt's Tababeach.   An Egyptian Coast Guard official told the state-run Middle EastNew Agency the boat violated Egyptian territory and that Egypt hadprotested to Israel. The report said Coast Guard officials firedwarning shots, but it did not mention any casualties.   Israel's Southern Police District spokesman Shalom Ben Himo saidShlomo Yisraeli, 42, a resident of Eilat, was fishing in his motorboat when an Egyptian patrol demanded he stop for identification.   ``He continued to move,'' Ben Himo said. ``The Egyptians shot afew warning shots in the air and he was struck by a bullet in theleg.''   Israel radio said Yisraeli was on the boat with his two childrenand a guest. He refused to stop because he was in Egyptian watersand his guest did not have a passport, the radio reported.   It said Yisraeli was shot in the leg and stomach and beganlosing large amounts of blood.   He was treated on the spot by an Egyptian medic. The patrol thenlet the boat dock at Taba and Yisraeli was transfered to an Israelihospital, where he was in serious condition, the radio reported.   The Egyptian Coast Guard official said a patrol vessel wasobliged to fire warning shots when an Israeli fishing boat camewithin 20 yards of the Egyptian coast and ignored a radio warningto clear the area.   He said the Israeli boat fled toward Eilat after getting rid ofsome of its catch. The report gave no further details.   Egyptian patrols have chased away several boatloads of Israeliswho have tried in recent months to visit popular Egyptian fishingand diving waters without the necessary visas.   The last major shooting incident between Egyptian troops andIsraelis was in October 1985, when a paramilitary Egyptian policeofficer went berserk and killed seven Israeli tourists at the RedSea resort of Ras Burka.   Israel captured the 250-acre resort of Taba, along with the restof the Sinai desert, in the 1967 Middle East war. The area isadjacent to the Israeli town of Eilat.   Israel returned Taba to Egypt in March after a bitter seven-yearborder dispute.</TEXT></DOC>
