Among uraniumminers, lung cancer induced by long term exposure to elevated levelsof radon progeny is well established. The epidemiological evidence providedby such miners is the principal basis for determining the numerical relationshipbetween environmental levels of radon exposure and lung cancer incidence.A number of lung cancer risk models have been published. All of thesemodels are based on an intensity of radon or radon progeny exposure,referring to an average exposure over time, and on an assumed percentageof occupancy. However, the differences in life-styles among individualsor the seasonal variation in radon levels found in a home, which mayinfluence the level of radon exposure, have not been considered in thepublished risk models. An assessment of the possible lifetime lung cancerrisk from exposure to environmental levels of radon is presented.</TEXT></DOC>
