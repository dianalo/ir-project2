Van NameandM;Though Ethernet is a stable and well-understood protocol that many LAN boardssupport, it is far from static.andM;The IEEE LAN-standards committee is hammering out the specification for aversion of Ethernet that will run over fiber-optic cable.andP;  In addition, somevendors, not willing to wait for that committee, already market fiberEthernet products.andM;Vendors are eager for a fiber-optic version of Ethernet because of the manyadvantages of fiber over coaxial and twisted-pair cable.andM;According to Ed Schulz, director of hardware engineering for LAN vendor 10NetCommunications in Dayton, Ohio, ''Fiber is a lot more reliable.andP;  Once it'sinstalled you hardly ever have to worry about it again.andP;  There are nointerference problems from external sources or problems with yourtransmission interfering with anyone else's.''andM;Fiber also offers the potential for networks that span very large distances,said Schulz.andP;  ''There's a significant advantage with greater distance.andP;  Youcan have three kilometers between components, with a total length of ninekilometers.''andM;One of the biggest benefits of fiber is its increased security.andP;  ''Thesecurity,'' said Schulz, ''is due to the fact that there is no radiation fromthe fiber.'' The added security is particularly important to the governmentand other organizations that need to protect their data, Schulz said.andM;''That's where we're selling our fiber networks -- government, the militaryand banks.''andM;Frank Fuller, product manager for the fiber-optic product line of ChipComCorp. in Waltham, Mass., agrees that the government was a potentially majorfiber customer, but said that many other organizations will find fiberuseful.andM;''We're finding changes in the commercial market,'' he said.andP;  ''Many[companies] are interested in large fiber networks of 200 to 500 nodes, maybemore.'' Fuller noted that in such networks, fiber can serve not only as areplacement for other direct connections but also as a backbone of a largecommunications network.andP;  ''If you look at the two domains of fiber, it's abackbone and now [a connection] to the desk [PC] as well.''andM;While fiber Ethernet offers many advantages, today it runs at only thestandard Ethernet speed of 10M bits per second.andP;  Its potential transmissionspeeds are much higher, however, as it sets the stage for such high-speedprotocols as fiber-distributed data interface (FDDI).andM;''You need fiber to go to the next standard in speed,'' said Ed Murray, salesprogram manager for Novell Inc. in Provo, Utah.andP;  ''It would make sense forcompanies to run fiber today [in preparation] for when speeds go to 50M and100M bps.''andM;Despite the many reasons to offer fiber Ethernet products, the standards forthese products are still under development.andM;One of the issues slowing the implementation of standards is the desire ofthe standards committee to make fiber products compatible with existingEthernet products, said Geoff Thompson.andP;  Thompson is an engineer withSynoptics Communications Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., and a member of theIEEE 802.3 10Base-F committee.andM;The committee is working on a few different approaches to a fiber-opticversion of Ethernet, Thompson said.andP;  ''There are two major divisions -- onewhich is a passive star, and one which is an active star.andP;  Already, astandard is in place for part of [the active star] -- the Fiber-Optic InterRepeater Link (FOIRL) standard.andP;  It specifies what happens betweenrepeaters.''andM;The passive-star approach uses central hubs that only pass signals along.andO;Because the passive hub is unpowered, it cannot support the logic necessaryto detect signal collisions.andP;  The collision-detection logic resides in eachnode's transceiver.andM;The active-star system centralizes the collision-detection logic in the hubs.andO;The IEEE committee is considering two active-star standards -- synchronousand asynchronous.andM;ChipCom's Fuller said the asynchronous and synchronous approaches differprimarily in their need for repeaters.andP;  ''In async there is the FOIRLstandard.andP;  It requires a repeater between stars.andP;  This is unnecessary insynchronous.andP;  You eliminate some hardware,'' he said.andM;Because the committee will draft specifications for all three methods, itappears that ''the final [standard] is 12 to 18 months away,'' said Fuller.andM;Synoptics Communications' Thompson agreed with that estimate.andP;  ''It will be1990 by the time standards are completed.''andM;Rather than waiting around for that standard, some vendors offer fiberEthernet products today.andP;  Those products differ in their technique ofimplementing Ethernet on fiber.andM;''A significant number of vendors sell FOIRL-based products,'' said Thompson.andO;''Synoptics is one of those vendors.andP;  This compromise assures backwardcompatibility with the existing fiber standard.'' Synoptics implements itsfiber Ethernet products using active asynchronous hubs that follow theexisting FOIRL standard, according to Thompson.andM;These products can work with customers' existing Ethernet boards, but theyreplace the transceivers and coaxial cable between those transceivers withSynoptics' fiber equivalents.andM;Buyers can use ChipCom's fiber Ethernet products similarly, said Fuller.andO;''Any [standard Ethernet 15-pin] transceiver cable can be used.andP;  If you hadan Ethernet board, you could run transceiver cable to our transceiver andthen fiber to our fiber star.''andM;ChipCom, however, does not use active asynchronous hubs like Synoptics.andO;''Our [product] is active synchronous,'' said Fuller.andP;  ''This is a technologythat we've had from the start, and the technology we recommend to the IEEEstandards committee.''andM;10Net uses still another approach to fiber Ethernet.andP;  ''Basically, [ourproduct] is Ethernet with a fiber interface.andP;  The fiber interface is a set ofHP [Hewlett-Packard] equipment, including a transmitter and a receiver,''said Schulz.andM;MANUFACTURERS OFandM;ETHERNET BOARDSandM;ATandamp;TandM;295 N.
