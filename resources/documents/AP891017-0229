A study released Monday by the American Bankers Associationconcludes that credit unions, which as non-profit organizations aretax-exempt, serve members who are economically better off than mostAmericans.   ``It is ironic that credit union members have higher incomes ...yet banks are subject to federal income taxes,'' said Thomas P.Rideout, outgoing president of the ABA and vice chairman of FirstUnion National Bank of North Carolina.   The report, prepared by The Secura Group, a consulting firmheaded by former bank regulator William Issac, said 49 percent ofcredit union members had annual incomes between $30,000 and$80,000, compared with 32 percent of non-members in the U.S.population.   Moreover, by loosely interpreting membership requirements,credit unions have grown from $69 billion in assets in 1980 to $196billion at the end of last year, it said. Their membership reached60 million this year (34 percent of all adults in the country), upfrom 40 million 20 years ago.   A spokeswoman for a credit union trade group, Susan Broaddus ofthe National Association of Federal Credit Unions, denounced thebankers' survey, saying credit unions ``are a whole differentanimal'' from banks.   ``They serve a wide spectrum of income levels. ... They're notfor profit. ... And they operate with a lot of volunteer support,''she said. ``The whole (ABA) effort was not to get objective data oncredit unions, but an attempt to bolster their case.''   The banking trade group has made the imposition of taxes oncredit unions one of the key parts in its fight to persuadeCongress to permit it to compete more effectively.   But, at a panel discussion featuring members of Congress, thebankers were told they were fighting an uphill battle againstcredit unions, which can muster strong grassroots lobbying.   ``If I wanted to tax credit unions, I would do so the day afterI announced by retirement,'' said Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va.</TEXT></DOC>
