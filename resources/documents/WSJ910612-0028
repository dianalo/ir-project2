The proposals would compel oil refiners to follow agovernment formula for making gasoline, give a big boost toproducers of ethanol and other fuel additives, and forcemajor changes in gasoline production and marketing.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time, motorists would see higher prices at thegas pump as companies pass on the multibillion-dollar cost ofchanging over refineries and storage facilities. But industryofficials wouldn't hazard any estimates, saying theper-gallon price rise would depend on regulatory details yetto be thrashed out in negotiations among government, industryand environmental officials.   The rules, announced by EPA Administrator William Reilly,would carry out the 1990 Clean Air Act's requirement thatoxygenated gasoline -- blended with such oxygenates asethanol or MTBE, a derivative of methanol -- be sold in 41U.S. cities with carbon monoxide problems by November 1992.   The rules also would carry out the requirement thatreformulated gas go on sale by January 1995 to reduce theemission of ozone-forming hydrocarbons in the nation's ninesmoggiest cities. They are Baltimore, Chicago, Hartford,Houston, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, New York, Philadelphia andSan Diego; together they account for almost 25% of U.S.gasoline consumption. Under the law, 89 other cities may optfor reformulated gas as well.   But a survey of 20 leading oil-refining companies raisesserious doubts about whether there will be enough oxygenatedgasoline to meet demand in the winter of 1992-93. Mostcompanies predict shortages ranging from 15% to 50%,according to the National Petroleum Council.   &quot;Getting the production of MTBE in the Gulf Coast andethanol in the Midwest to the large demands of the East andWest coasts may represent an insurmountable logisticchallenge, especially for the winter of 1992-93, the tradegroup said.   Result: Some cities are likely to seek waivers from theEPA. The law provides for one-year or two-year exemptions forcities that can show inadequate supplies or distributionproblems. But EPA officials said yesterday that the agencyhasn't yet received any waiver requests.   At the same time, oil refiners are &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot;about meeting demand for reformulated gasoline in 1995, butonly if the EPA doesn't allow cities other than the ninesmoggiest to opt into the reformulated gas program. &quot;Asevents unfold, the EPA needs to develop a workable plan tophase in requested opt-ins,&quot; the group said.   As for the ethanol industry, which mostly uses Midwestcorn as feedstock, it anticipates no problems in meetingdemand for oxygenates, a spokesman for the Renewable FuelsAssociation said.   The 700-page package of proposals, coupled with theagency's new fuel-volatility standards, &quot;will significantlyreduce air pollution in most of the country's largermetropolitan areas,&quot; Mr. Reilly said. It is the product ofprolonged EPA negotiating sessions with industry andenvironmental groups. A spokeswoman for the AmericanPetroleum Institute said that the trade group will commentafter it has reviewed the proposals.   The impact on the industry would be far-reaching. For onething, the proposed rules would reduce its dependence onpetroleum. For another, the government would dictate torefiners the specific composition of fuel. Under the proposedrules, gasoline must contain at least 2% oxygen and no morethan 1% benzene, a cancer-causing compound. Oxygen is addedto gasoline by blending it with ethanol or other oxygenates.What's more, refiners would be barred from using lead andother heavy metal additives and would have to reduce toxicand volatile organic compounds in gasoline by 15% initiallyand as much as 25% by the year 2000.   Extra oxygen in gasoline improves engine combustion,lowering emissions of carbon monoxide, particularly in coldweather. Under the proposed rules, to attain clean-airstandards, cities would be allowed to balance sales ofgasoline with lower-than-required oxygen content against thesales of gasoline that exceeds the proposed requirement of2.7% oxygen by weight.   Most cities would be required to impose so-called oxyfuelcontrols during November, December, January and February,when urban carbon-monoxide levels tend to be highest. Carbonmonoxide inhibits the bloodstream's capacity to carry oxygento organs and tissues, and high levels can trigger chest painin people with heart disease.   Several cities in the Southwest, including Phoenix, Ariz.,and Las Vegas, Nev., have adopted oxygenated gasolineprograms, as has the state of Colorado.   The EPA will hold public hearings on the proposed rulesJuly 15-16 in Washington. Under the law, the final rule mustbe issued by Nov. 1.</TEXT></DOC>
