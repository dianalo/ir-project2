Last week, the group's announcement that it was unable tofinance its planned $6.75 billion buyout triggered a nosedive bythe New York Stock Exchange that roiled markets worldwide.   Since then, the group and its advisers have been seekingfinancial backing for a revised offer at a lower price.   UAL stock, which has taken a pounding since the group's Oct. 13announcement, took another dive in early trading today on the NewYork Stock Exchange. UAL was down $21.12{ a share at $169 atmidday, bringing its decline so far this week to about $110.   British Airways as late as last weekend indicated it wasconfident a revised buyout plan could be arranged. But in recentdays company officials have indicated that British Air was notnecessarily wedded to a deal.   British Airways issued a brief statement today saying it ``doesnot intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition ofUAL in the foreseeable future.''   After banks refused to back the original UAL deal, the buyoutgroup led by management and United pilots scaled down its original$300 a share offer to $5.62 billion, or $250 a share. UAL officialshave been in Tokyo this week, trying to win support for the revisedoffer from big Japanese banks.   United is the second-largest U.S. airline after AmericanAirlines. The deal, if successful, would be the largestemployee-led buyout of a U.S. company.   Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for Chicago-based UAL, said the companyhad no comment on the action by British Airways.   Last weekend, British Airways issued a statement saying it wasconfident a revised financing package would be arranged and the bidwould be allowed to proceed. On Monday, the company confirmed itwas pursuing the bid with Airlines Acquisition Corp., themanagement-led group that also includes United pilots.   A British Airways spokesman, who was not identified, inaccordance with British custom, said he could not comment beyondthe prepared statement, which gave no indication of why BritishAirways backed out or when the decision was made.   Under the original offer, British Airways would have provided$750 million, or about three-quarters of the equity, for theleveraged buyout and would have received a 15 percent stake in theairline.</TEXT></DOC>
