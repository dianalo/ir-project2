Part of the reason is that much of Europe has yet to feelthe effects of the widespread economic slowdown. Inparticular, consumers in the former East Germany, enjoying anew-found purchasing power since German monetary union inJuly, have accounted for the bulk of the increase in HongKong exports to Europe in recent months. At the same time,Hong Kong manufacturers have been stepping up marketingefforts on the Continent to offset an anticipated decline inshipments to the U.S., the No. 1 market for the colony'sdomestic exports.</LP><TEXT>   Figures for the first 11 months of 1990 illustrate the newprominence of Europe in Hong Kong trade. During the period,Hong Kong's domestic exports to Western Europe increased 2%to HK$48.8 billion (US$6.26 billion), while re-exports to theregion (mostly from China) jumped 33% to HK$66.3 billion.Domestic exports to Germany alone increased 13% in the sameperiod to HK$15.8 billion, while re-exports grew 69% toHK$20.6 billion. Germany ranks as Hong Kong's third-largestexport market, after China and the U.S.   The 2% increase in domestic exports to Europe during theperiod reflects a decline in shipments to some countries, butthis was more than offset by the gain in re-exports, the bulkof which are goods produced by Hong Kong-owned factories inChina.   The colony's exports to Eastern Europe and the SovietUnion, though small in absolute terms, have surged as well.Hong Kong's total exports (domestic exports plus re-exports)to the region in the first 10 months of 1990 jumped 69% froma year earlier to HK$2.37 billion. That increase reflects thebroadening of economic ties between Hong Kong and the formerEast bloc since the major social and political changes in theregion in 1989 and 1990.   Meanwhile, domestic exports to the U.S. in the first 11months of 1990 shrank 8% from a year earlier to HK$60.87billion, while re-exports grew 22% to HK$80.75 billion.   For Hong Kong exporters, &quot;the U.S., European and Chinamarkets' (shares of Hong Kong exports) have grown to nearlyequal proportions, whereas three years ago the U.S. marketwas double that of Europe and China,&quot; says C. Suan Tan, chiefresident economist of the Pacific Rim Institute ofComparative Economic Studies Ltd., a think tank jointlyoperated by the University of Hong Kong and Germany's KielInstitute of World Economics.   Analysts attribute much of the European export surge toGerman monetary union. Since that move, eastern Germans haverushed to buy color television sets, stereo systems andmodern refrigerators. &quot;For years, East bloc governmentsoverlooked consumer goods in favor of capital goods,&quot; says O.George Oleksyn, senior manager of operations for the HongKong Trade Development Council.   Economists say the eastern German buying frenzy could besustained through the first half of 1991. They note, however,that possible disruptions because of war in the Middle Eastcould create enough widespread economic damage to cut thetrend short. One Hong Kong exporter working for a Germantrading company believes exports to Europe, particularlyGermany, will begin to taper off by the end of the year, onceeastern Germans &quot;satiate those pent-up consumer desires.&quot;   Mr. Oleksyn of the Trade Development Council says futuregrowth in trade between Hong Kong and Eastern Europeancountries will be limited as long as those countries' severeforeign-exchange shortages persist. Still, Hong Kong tradeofficials are encouraging exporters to develop inroads intothe region so that they are well-positioned when restrictionson trade, both official and unofficial, ease.   To be sure, the value of Hong Kong's direct trade with theformer East bloc is unremarkable when compared with the morethan HK$100 billion of goods Hong Kong ships to the U.S. eachyear. However, officials are quick to note that if figures onindirect trade with the region were available, they woulddwarf the official numbers. &quot;Official trade figures are justthe tip of the iceberg,&quot; says Mr. Oleksyn. Germany,Switzerland and Austria are the three major entrepot centersfor goods bound for Eastern Europe.   In addition to simply filling European orders, Hong Kongmanufacturers see long-term advantages in seeking out newmarket opportunities in the region, though Western Europe isgenerally viewed as a relatively difficult market topenetrate. &quot;I think the European market is more selectivethan the U.S.,&quot; says the Pacific Rim Institute's Ms. Tan.   Economists say Hong Kong manufacturers have long beenaware of the dangers of over-reliance on the U.S. market.Even so, many manufacturers and distributors say they areunfamiliar with European markets outside Britain. Thosecompanies that have geared their products toward Europe saythe complexities and costs of marketing tonon-English-speaking consumers have limited their exportsuccess, though shipments to Europe have increased steadilysince 1985 as a result of currency fluctuations.</TEXT></DOC>
