Think twice, or maybe threetimes, before you accept.   More and more companies are offering such choices thesedays in response to soaring medical costs and the growingnumber of two-income families with overlappinghealth-insurance plans.</LP><TEXT>   The idea is that some of those with duplicate coverage mayprefer to drop out of one of the plans in return for cash orsome alternative benefit. Companies, meanwhile, get to paretheir soaring medical costs.   But although that can seem appealing, benefits consultantssay a careful comparison of what you'd be giving up and whatyou'd be getting is essential. Employees, they say, shouldpay special attention to details such as deductibles andlimitations on coverage. It's also important to know what itwould take to get back into the plan if you decide you wantto later.   &quot;It's something we hope {employees} don't take lightly,&quot;says Earl W. Hunt, director of employee benefits at Buffalo,N.Y.-based Marine Midland Bank. About 20% of the bank's12,000 full-time employees choose not to take medicalinsurance every year, opting instead for as much as $400 incash or credits for other benefits, such as increased life ordisability insurance or extra vacation days.   A recent survey of the 5,000 largest U.S. employers byconsultants William M. Mercer Inc. showed that 47% offer orplan to offer &quot;flexible benefits,&quot; compared with 23% justfive years ago. Most of these companies allow employees toopt out of health coverage. Between 5% and 20% of workers do,generally getting between $300 and $800 a year in cash orother benefits.   &quot;It's partly financial, partly philosophical,&quot; says StevenFein of Towers Perrin, the New York-based consulting firm.Employers are saying, &quot;Who are we to tell employees what kindof coverage they need?&quot;   Still, many companies require that employees have othermedical insurance before they can opt out of their own plan.They &quot;don't want someone {who didn't have insurance} sittingoutside corporate headquarters in a wheelchair&quot; after anaccident, says Mr. Fein.   But it isn't just a question of taking a $70-a-monthpayment from one spouse's employer and paying $20 a month forcoverage from the other's. One policy may have a $150deductible, another $300. One may pay 80% of most medicalexpenses, the other 75%. Some plans pay for outpatientpsychological and psychiatric care, others don't.   Employees have to determine &quot;what coverage is availableand what level of coverage is important to them,&quot; says JoanGianico, first vice president, benefits compensation, of NewYork's Republic National Bank. &quot;We try to remind them of whattheir individual circumstances are.&quot;   Whether a plan covers prescription drugs, for instance,can be important to someone taking regular medication for aheart condition or asthma. A family with children might notwant to give up a plan that covers well-child care.   Benefits professionals say the two key questions foremployees before opting out of a medical plan are how wellthey would be covered in case of a catastrophe and how easyit would be to get back into the plan if their circumstanceschange.   Limits on out-of-pocket expenses can vary from one plan toanother. Some plans set a lifetime maximum on payments, whichcould have a severe impact on someone permanently injured inan auto accident, for instance, who might require full-timecare for life. There are plans that would pay for 365 days ofhospitalization, while others only cover 120. Cancer, heartdisease or a premature birth can easily become a financialdisaster without adequate insurance coverage.   Companies can be tough if someone wants to get back into amedical plan. Most allow immediate re-enrollment if othercoverage is lost, as in the case of divorce or because thespouse loses a job. But sometimes the deductible is higher orpre-existing conditions aren't covered for some period oftime.   Employees who just change their minds about coveragegenerally have to wait for the annual re-enrollment period,usually in the fall, to take effect the following Jan. 1.Pre-existing conditions often aren't covered for the firstyear, and some companies require proof of insurability,usually based on a medical examination. &quot;You may find thatyou're not covered for just what you need {insurance} for,&quot;says Douglas Carey of Hewitt Associates, a Lincolnshire,Ill., consulting firm.   Few companies require actual proof of other coverage. Insuch cases, the employee generally is required to sign a formstating the name of the company providing the alternatecoverage. Mr. Hunt of Marine Midland says a recent survey ofemployees did turn up a few who were going without medicalinsurance, despite having signed a statement that they hadcoverage.   As tempting as the extra vacation days or cash may be tothe young and healthy, &quot;it's real dangerous&quot; not to havemedical insurance, says Mr. Carey of Hewitt Associates. &quot;Younever know when you're going to be in an accident, whensomething serious is going to happen. The fact is thathospitals in this country treat you better if you havecoverage than if you don't.&quot;   Companies surveyed last year by Towers Perrin said thateven in the event of a catastrophe, employees would have tolive with their decision to turn down medical coverage. A fewcompanies said they would help the employee find otherassistance, such as welfare. Mr. Fein, the consultant, says,&quot;If word got out that you could take the {cash payment} andstill be covered, everyone would take the cash.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
