Terms weren't disclosed.    Control Data said it had planned to continue operating its South African unit as long as it remained &quot;economically successful&quot; and contributed to social change. However, the company said it recently concluded that uncertainty in South Africa over &quot;the ability or willingness&quot; of U.S. companies to continue doing business there was creating &quot;a situation of instability for our customers and employees.&quot;    Twice in the past the company rejected shareholder proposals critical of its operations in a country that practices apartheid, or separation of the races. Control Data has been doing business in South Africa since 1964.    Former employees of Control Data's South African unit will retain 15% ownership of the company. Unidev will continue the affirmative-action hiring practices in place when Control Data operated the unit, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
