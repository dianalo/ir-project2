Both methane and ethylene were found as reductionproducts. At a current density of 8.3mA/sq. cm. the cumulative yieldfor those two species was essentially Faradaic, and at 25mA/sq. cm. 79%.Carbon dioxide reduction did not appear to be a direct electrochemicalprocess, but proceeded through the reaction of weakly adsorbed carbondioxide with electrochemically generated chemisorbed hydrogen at thein situ deposited copper surface. Subsequent hydrogenation of this reducedspecies by chemisorbed hydrogen probably led to bridged CO groups whichcould either desorb to give carbon monoxide or become further reducedto give carbidic carbon available for subsequent hydrogenation to yieldmethane and ethylene. Carbon dioxide reduction to gaseous hydrocarbonswas also promoted using solid polymer electrolyte cells, where the reactionoccurred at less cathodic potentials than found in aqueous electrolyte.</TEXT></DOC>
