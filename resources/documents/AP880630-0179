The theory is that AZT _ now known as zidovudine _ if takenearly after exposure might prevent the AIDS virus from installingitself in the genetic material of the cell, thus preventinginfection.   Interest is so high that Burroughs Wellcome Co., maker of thedrug, launched its own nationwide study last month of healthworkers exposed on the job.   Company spokeswoman Karen Collins said Thursday that only ``ahandful'' of subjects have enrolled in the study so far, but thecompany expects 5,000 to 7,000 participants within the next fewyears.   Health workers are required to enroll within five days of theexposure; half will receive a six-week series of the drug free ofcharge and half will receive a placebo, Collins said in a telephoneinterview from Research Triangle Park, N.C., where the company isbased.   ``I've been bombarded with calls from health care workers aroundthe country,'' said Dr. Julie Gerberding, director of an AIDShealth care worker study at San Franciso General Hospital and theUniversity of California at San Francisco. Her study examines therisk of AIDS infection among health workers, but does not involveparticipants taking AZT.   Gerberding said the callers want to know whether the possibletoxic effects of zidovudine outweigh the 1-in-200 chance ofinfection after a worker is stuck by an AIDS-tainted needle.   The toxic and experimental drug can cause muscle aches, nausea,headaches, and severe anemia. Since it works by impeding cellreplication, it cannot be given to pregnant women.   No one knows the number of health workers taking the treatmentunder the guidance of their private physicians. A six-week supplyof the drug costs about $800.   ``Like everything else with AIDS, it's quasi-underground,'' saidDr. June Fisher, who runs the city's Center of MunicipalOccupational Safety and Health.   Gerberding said she knew of two workers at San Francisco Generalwho had taken the drug after they were exposed through taintedblood.   William Owen, a private doctor who treats AIDS patients, said heprescribed the drug to a surgeon who cut his hand with a scalpelwhile operating on an AIDS patient.   Preventive use of the drug is gaining credence among AIDSauthorities, including Dr. Paul Volberding of San FranciscoGeneral. Volberding said he has enough faith in the drug'seffectiveness that he cannot in good conscience advise any workerto enroll in the Burroughs study for fear they will be among thosereceiving the placebo.   Volberding said 22 health workers worldwide have become infectedwith the virus. He also said that with a deep cut the odds ofinfection may run as high as one in 100.</TEXT></DOC>
