Wallace Booth, chairman, president and chief executive officer of the electronic-parts distributor and aerospace concern, declined to estimate the second-quarter operating loss or results for the full year at the annual meeting.    Booth also said the company expects to post an operating profit in the second half.    In the first quarter, Ducommun had net income of $6.4 million, or $1.96 a share, after a $8.7 million gain from the sale of two businesses. In the year-earlier period, the company had net of $221,000, or seven cents a share, on sales of $116.2 million.    For all of 1986, Ducommun had a net loss of $19.2 million on revenue of $455.2 million.    Ducommun attributed the recent operating losses to the downturn in the electronics industry and the explosion last year of the space shuttle Challenger. Ducommun said a significant amount of its business came from making electronic parts for the space shuttles. </TEXT></DOC>
