HughesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/29/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   Phew! What a rough year. Things were so busy at the office that you only took a fraction of your vacation.    But did the boss even notice the sacrifice -- or care?    Probably not.    At least that's the conclusion from querying more than a dozen executives about the amount of vacation time they have taken this year, then asking their bosses how much vacation time they thought their subordinates had taken. The result: The bosses often didn't know or guessed high.    Consider Jay Wilpolt, a senior buyer for Bercor Inc., a consumer-products distributor in La Mirada, Calif. Mr. Wilpolt is taking only six of his 10 allotted vacation days. &quot;I didn't take more because I was trying to meet corporate goal objectives,&quot; Mr. Wilpolt says.    Is his boss impressed? &quot;I don't view that as positive. I think it's crazy,&quot; says David Weisenberg, a vice president at Bercor, who didn't know how many days Mr. Wilpolt had taken. &quot;He works with a lot of numbers and he needs the time away.&quot; Mr. Weisenberg himself, a new employee, has taken his full week of vacation.    Mr. Wilpolt's sacrifice wasn't noticed at the top echelon of the company either. Bercor's chairman, Richard Berger, says of Mr. Wilpolt, &quot;I'm sure he took a week, maybe two weeks.&quot;    Most bosses claim they want subordinates to take their vacations in order to avoid burnout -- as long as the vacation isn't taken at a bad time for the business. But some also admit they prefer employees not to take three or four weeks of vacation at a stretch.    There aren't any government statistics on how many executives don't take their full vacations. But it is clear that executives are taking shorter vacations than several years ago. A recent Korn/Ferry International study of nearly 1,400 executives showed they had taken, on average, 14 vacation days in 1985, compared with 16 in 1979.    &quot;It's a perversion of the work ethic that gets translated into, 'Oh, gosh, I couldn't take four weeks. That would be looked on as not being part of the team,'&quot; says Dennis F. Hightower, a managing director in Los Angeles for Russell Reynolds Associates Inc., an executive-search firm.    John Telford, a principal at the accounting and consulting firm Peat, Marwick, Mitchell andamp; Co. in Orange County, Calif., was allowed five weeks of vacation this year but he took only a week and a half. He says he didn't take more because, &quot;I love to work so much.&quot; But he adds, &quot;My great fear is that they would be critical of me for taking too much and that may be one of the reasons I don't.&quot;    Did anyone notice? His boss, Robert E. Buce, the partner in charge of management consulting, estimated that Mr. Telford took a whopping three to four weeks of vacation this year -- at least twice the actual amount. &quot;He might have pushed the top end,&quot; Mr. Buce adds.    When told the actual tally, Mr. Buce responded: &quot;He's a hard, productive worker. If someone always takes just one or two weeks, I'm concerned. People need the time to pull themselves away from their professional lives.&quot; Mr. Buce says he has taken about four of his allotted five weeks of vacation, and adds, &quot;Vacations are healthy.&quot;    Another high guess comes from Terry Hartshorn, the chief executive officer at PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. in Cypress, Calif. Mr. Hartshorn estimates that Richard Lipeles, a senior vice president, took two weeks of vacation this year.    Wrong. Mr. Lipeles says he took one week, although entitled to three. He spent the week in Houston and attended a family wedding. He says he decided not to take more time away, except for two days at Christmas, because of &quot;the level of activity at PacifiCare&quot; and because he has four young children.    Mr. Hartshorn, the boss, was closer to the mark when it came to estimating the vacation of Alan Hoops, an executive vice president. He guessed 13 days and Mr. Hoops says he has taken 15 days, mostly at a camp in California and skiing in Utah.    Mr. Hartshorn, who has used only half of his own four weeks of vacation, says he encourages employees to take their full vacation. But he adds, &quot;I don't encourage them to take four weeks in a row, because that tends to hurt the company.&quot; And he adds, &quot;I appreciate the executive who (schedules) vacation around company things.&quot;    Most of the bosses say they don't consider the amount of vacation time taken when judging an employee's performance -- although they may track hours worked per week or the total hours worked in a year. They also say those who skip vacations aren't necessarily those who get the most done. &quot;Some people spend long hours and don't get the job done,&quot; says Mr. Berger, Bercor's chairman.    There are bosses who admit they're glad their employees kept their noses to the grindstone. Top executives at smaller companies and particularly troubled companies appear more likely to applaud subordinates who skipped most of their vacations. They also seem better at estimating the number of vacation days taken, perhaps because they don't take much vacation themselves.    Linda Carter, the corporate secretary of Newbery Corp., an electrical contracting firm in Tempe, Ariz., was entitled to 15 vacation days but took only five. She went to a rodeo in Colorado and a state fair.    Her boss, Warnock Davies, Newbery's president and chairman, knew that and says he's glad she didn't take more. &quot;We're in a crisis situation. We're in a turnaround. I'm pleased she hasn't taken vacation. We've needed her.&quot; Mr. Davies says he is taking only three days of his own allotted four weeks of vacation.    The greatest vacation sacrifice came from Gerry Hermogino, the controller of Newport Electronics Inc. in Santa Ana, Calif. Mr. Hermogino was entitled to two weeks vacation but didn't take a single day. &quot;There was just too much work,&quot; he says. &quot;You become part of a team and you have to work. You feel guilty if you don't do that.&quot;    His boss, Francis Shinsato, a vice president, said he is glad that Mr. Hermogino took &quot;one or two days at the most.&quot; He adds: &quot;We had a lot of things to do. I didn't pressure him and I did say I appreciated the fact that he didn't take his full vacation.&quot; Mr. Shinsato himself took four days of his allotted two-week vacation.    But more often, it seems, the boss of a workaholic thinks the workaholic should find time to relax. Norman Abramson, the president and chief operating officer of Clothestime Inc. in Anaheim, Calif., is taking just two of his five allotted weeks of vacation. &quot;It's a very competitive world. The only way to stay ahead is to be constantly working,&quot; he says.    His boss, Michael DeAngelo, the chairman and chief executive officer, took three weeks of vacation. He went to Hawaii and also managed a cruise to Mexico. &quot;It was beautiful and very relaxing and serene,&quot; he says of the cruise.    What does he think of Mr. Abramson's sacrifice? &quot;He's a hard-working gentleman. He's a 60- to 80-hours-a-week guy. But he couldn't continue to keep that pace up. Nor would we want him to. He would burn himself out. We would like for him to take a couple weeks of vacation to keep his head clear.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
