And the towns, development companies and even amusement parks -- in the tried tradition of Florida promoters -- are offering free land, sometimes even free stadiums, to induce teams to move their winter headquarters.    &quot;I have six or seven bona fide offers,&quot; says George Steinbrenner, principal owner of the New York -- and Fort Lauderdale -- Yankees. &quot;Some of the offers are unbelievable.&quot;    Mr. Steinbrenner, whose club won its season opener against the Detroit Tigers Monday, has been talking to, among others, the Disney World amusement park outside Orlando. He is bargaining hard for improvements in Fort Lauderdale, where the Yankees have trained for 26 years, and he could well decide to remain there.    But two teams, the Houston Astros and the Texas Rangers, recently moved their spring-training sites, and three others are expected to by next spring.    &quot;Every county in Florida would like to have spring training,&quot; says Tom Kenny, chairman of the board of commissioners in Martin County. &quot;Baseball teams can almost name their terms.&quot;    The Kansas City Royals are moving their major- and minor-league camp to &quot;Boardwalk and Baseball,&quot; an amusement park south of Orlando operated by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.    The New York Mets, in return for moving to Port St. Lucie, a growth town in a sparsely populated area, are getting a stadium, five practice diamonds, and valuable options on local real estate. And Marge Schott, owner of the Cincinnati Reds, which are planning to move but haven't signed on a site, has been wined and dined and shown the state in blimps, helicopters and yachts by eager promoters.    &quot;As long as there are 1,000-acre development sites in Florida there will be musical chairs among the major-league teams and their affiliates,&quot; says Rick Horrow, a Miami sports lawyer. Eighteen of the 26 major-league teams hold spring training in Florida, with the rest in Arizona and California.    One reason for the spate of activity is that attendance records have been broken for six consecutive springs. The total has soared to 1,850,395 last year from 1,409,267 in 1981. The average crowd per game has surged to 4,193 from 3,220.    Four people were arrested this spring for scalping tickets at a Yankees-Boston Red Sox game. &quot;It's unbelievable,&quot; says a businessman in Fort Lauderdale. &quot;When did you ever hear about scalping tickets in pre-season?&quot;    Rick Dodge, assistant city manager in St. Petersburg, which is losing the Mets and looking for a replacement, says: &quot;The whole complexion of spring training has changed. What was once viewed as a nice addition now is seen as a very strong magnet for attracting tourists.&quot;    At the annual governor's baseball dinner, Gov. Bob Martinez told the major-league general managers that baseball brings in $500 million to $1 billion annually in tourism.    And in a state where nearly every hamlet purports to be a growth town, baseball can lure new residents. &quot;It's given the community the feeling of being on the map,&quot; says Mike McKinley, a lawyer in Port Charlotte (pop. 45,000), the new winter home of the Texas Rangers.    Many clubs are eager to move, partly because stadiums have become run down, and partly because teams are taking a less laid-back approach to spring training. It is no longer a matter of a baseball diamond and a backstop; clubs now speak of &quot;state-of-the-art amenities.&quot;    These include comfortable clubhouses; weight, training and exercise rooms; and indoor hitting facilities. And for reasons having to do with both player development and economics, teams want expanded facilities so that their major- and minor-league teams can train together. &quot;It's the only time you can watch your minor leaguers,&quot; says Astros owner John McMullen.    The Rangers use their new Port Charlotte camp 10 months a year -- for spring training, minor-league games in summer, and instructional games in fall. &quot;It's sort of the heartbeat of the organization,&quot; says Mike Stone, the general manager. &quot;If (manager) Bobby Valentine can bump into minor league kids and work with them, there's a great spinoff.&quot;    There is also an economic spinoff. The Rangers stadium was built by Charlotte County on 80 acres of land -- valued at several million dollars -- that was donated by General Development Corp., the big developer of Florida communities. In addition, the Rangers got about five acres from General Development to develop as they see fit. Tentative plans include a joint-venture hotel -- possibly with Marriott Corp.and a for-profit sports-medicine center.    The Mets may have received the sweetest deal. St. Lucie County, a remote but quickly growing area with a population of roughly 120,000, passed a 2% hotel-bed tax in 1984 to finance a $7 million stadium. Thos. J. White Development Corp., which is building a planned community in the area, has agreed to build a 7,000-seat stadium and to absorb any funding shortage. The company also threw in 100 acres of land to attract the Mets.    The Mets will be able to train on both grass and artificial turf, and their coaches will be able to observe five fields at once from a central observation tower.    The Mets owners get 85% of ticket revenue, with the rest going to pay stadium costs. They also get five home lots on the golf course at half price, which they will make available to the team's management. In addition, the club gets options at favorable prices on 254 acres of land.    James Brown, president of Thos. White, says the package is worthwhile, both because the champion Mets are a big draw and because getting the Mets was a public-relations coup. &quot;I'm used to going in front of planning and zoning boards wearing a flak jacket,&quot; he says. In Port St. Lucie, where the company is developing 15,000 homes along with retail, office and educational sites, &quot;we went through the whole approval process without a single dissenting vote.&quot;    Fred Wilpon, a co-owner of the Mets and a developer in his own right, says: &quot;There are new technologies in what I call the Randamp;D of the sport. We want to be state-of-the-art. The other aspect is: We were able to structure a very favorable real-estate transaction for the Mets. This is a fast-growing area and we want to be part of it.&quot;    Not incidentally, some suggest, Mr. Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday, the Mets' other co-owner, both have homes nearby. &quot;That was whipped cream,&quot; Mr. Wilpon says. &quot;It wasn't the deciding factor.&quot;    Not all towns are head over heels for baseball. In Fort Myers, the Royals asked for new facilities, but the notion of spending tax money on &quot;millionaire ballplayers&quot; was roundly denounced at public hearings. Mary Ann Wallace, a county commissioner who voted against a bond issue for a new stadium, says, &quot;We have major infrastructure needs. I can't put baseball as a No. 1 priority.&quot;    However, since the Royals announced their departure, some residents have had second thoughts. The county now is offering to refurbish the stadium if it can attract a team.    &quot;The community hates to see 'em go,&quot; says Joe Tomaino, general manager of the Sheraton Harbor Place. &quot;We had 100 boosters from Kansas City with us for 10 days. Next year they'll probably be staying in Orlando.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
