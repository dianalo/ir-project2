EIA can be viewed as an information-gathering exercisewith an emphasis on substance, or as a decision-making process whichinvolves open debate, thereby creating the opportunity to question thevalues and policies that underlie existing approaches to development.The way in which EIA is perceived defines the type and scope of problemsaddressed. Using the Beaufort Sea Environmental Assessment Review Process(EARP) as a case study, this paper examines three sets of limitationson EIA as a tool for balanced Northern Canadian development. One limitationwas the lack of a planning context, in which assessment of a major hydrocarbondevelopment proposal was being undertaken in spite of the absence ofa policy and planning framework. Another was that despite EIA's groundingin the application of scientific principles, the lack of a sufficientdata base and methodological deficiencies, including an inadequate analyticframework, meant that there were considerable constraints on scientificprediction and assessment. Finally, the context for public participationwas set by the EARP panel, whose mandate did not include a number ofcritical long-term issues, and who operated under the implicit assumptionthat the question under review was not whether hydrocarbon developmentshould proceed, but how. 21 refs., 1 fig., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
