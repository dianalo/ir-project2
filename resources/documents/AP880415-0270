The March increase more than erased a 0.2 percent drop inFeburary.If the March rate held for 12 months, the full-yearwholesale inflation rate would be 7 percent, compared with 2.2percent for all of 1987.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue-chip industrialstocks, which staged its fifth biggest loss and dropped more than101 points Thursday in reaction to disappointing trade figures,fell 22 points to 1983.75 in the first 90 minutes of trading today.   The Labor Department said in today's report on wholesale priceactivity that energy prices, which had been falling at an annualrate of 17 percent, rose 0.9 percent last month, their firstincrease since August.   Food prices, after dropping 1.1 percent in February, advanced by0.7 percent last month. For the first three months of the year,beef and veal prices climbed 43.6 percent.   Overall, wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 3.1 percentfrom January through March.   ``The widespread nature of these price changes suggests thatinflation pressures may be intensifying,'' said Donald Ratajczak, aGeorgia State University economist who specializes in wholesaleprice trends.   Ratajczak and other economists anticiated that today's pricereport would add to the havoc evident Thursday following thegovernment's announcement that the nation's trade deficit worsenedsignificantly in February.   ``Yesterday's news and the flailings of the lemmings on WallStreet combined with today's price numbers are going to create avolatile climate for a while,'' said Dirk Van Dongen, president ofthe National Association of Wholesalers. ``Again, they were asurprise and above the predictions of all the experts.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Reaganadministration was ``disappointed'' with the increase in wholesaleprices today as well as the trade figures Thursday.   ``We think the market has overreacted to a one-time report, andwe hope this thing will stabilize,'' Fitzwater said.   Reflecting the broad nature of March's price gains, the LaborDepartment said that its index of wholesale prices for consumergoods other than food and energy rose 0.4 percent, compared with a0.3 percent increase in February.   Because food and energy prices can fluctuate greatly from monthto month, analysts look to the calculation that excludes them asproviding a good underlying indication of inflationary pressures.For the first three months of 1988, wholesale prices for goodsother than food and energy rose at an annual rate of 5.7 percent.   Automobile prices were up 1 percent last month, restoring themto the level they had been at in November before manufacturersbegan offering dealers rebates and other incentives.   Prescription drug prices rose 1.3 percent and over-the-counterdrug costs advanced 2 percent in March. Newspaper prices rose 1.4percent.   Wholesale gasoline prices rose 1.5 percent after dropping about9 percent since November. Home heating oil prices jumped 2.6percent.   Costs rose for a variety of food products that had dropped inprice in February. Among them were eggs, fresh fruits, coffee,poultry, fish and pasta products.   Other goods showing 1 percent or greater price increases onestep short of the retail level included carpeting, draperies andjewelry.   Capital equipment prices rose 0.4 percent, double the increasesof January and February. The biggest price gains _ above 1 percent_ were in metal-cutting machine tools and office and storeequipment.   Prices dropped slightly, however, for other goods, includingwomen's clothing, shoes, cosmetics, glassware and home electronicequipment.   March's overall gain brought the wholesale price index to 106.2.That means a selection of good costing $100 at the wholesale levelin 1982 would have cost $106.20 last month, or 30 cents more thanin February.   Wholesale prices rose only 2.2 percent for all of 1987. Theindex, however, does not include two categories where priceincreases have been more pronounced in recent months _ services andimports.   Those two categories are included in the consumer price index,which rose 4.4 percent last year.   Consumer prices for the first two months of 1988 were running atan annual rate of 3.2 percent. Figures on retail price activity inMarch will not be out until later this month.</TEXT></DOC>
