(products).andO;Product:   Perfect Menu 2.0 (Computer network software).andO;Topic:     EvaluationMenusSoftware PackagesElectronic Mail Systems.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Perfect MenuandM;Menus can be used to enhance a network by shielding users from the cold worldof batch files and by offering additional security to ensure that users don'tpoke around in places they don't belong.andP;  Perfect Menu goes beyond the basicbenefits of typical menu systems by offering a variety of functions includingelectronic mail, group forums, calendar, clock, and calculator functions.andM;Perfect Menu is entirely menu driven, from the installation, to editingmenus, to executing customized menus.andP;  The user need only familiarize himselfwith the menu structure to accomplish tasks.andM;Installation andandM;DemonstrationandM;When I opened my Perfect Menu package, I discovered four diskettes, thePerfect Menu Newsletter and a congratulatory letter.andP;  The letter said thatall I needed to do to install the package was to run the installationprogram.andP;  After installing it, I was able to access the menus associated witha default user for a demonstration of the program's capabilities.andP;  Accordingto the letter, all documentation for Perfect Menu was contained on onediskette in the form of an online manual that could be either accessedthrough the menu application or printed out by executing a command to installthe manual on the hard disk.andM;The installation program requires that the current drive in which theexecution be the drive in which the Perfect Menu diskette was inserted.andP;  Theprogram defaults to installing on the local hard drive, but recognizes thenetwork drives in the system.andP;  I changed the defaults to specify a networkdrive and was prompted for the type of installation standalone or one of alist of network environments.andP;  The program then copied the software from eachof the four files and the installation process was complete.andM;I followed the directions in the letter and logged into the demonstrationmenus as a default user.andP;  With the first demonstration menu screen, one tiledmenu appears with several options, and available function keys are definedbelow the menu.andP;  The first function key offers help.andP;  I thought it would beeasy to find my way around as long as I knew how to access help, so Icontinued to poke around the system.andP;  I accepted the first menu option, whichagain prompted me for a password and then entered me into a section of themenu tree that offered pull-down rather than tiled menus.andM;Pull-down menus are those that appear with a menu title at the top of yourscreen from which you may pull down the associated menu.andP;  Tiled menus arethose that appear as a block of menu text on the screen; selecting an optionfrom these may result in an overlapping menu.andM;I viewed the options available within the pull-down menus and found that manyinteresting administration functions were available, including reports onPerfect Menu activities for each user.andP;  When I tried to exit this section, Iwas presented with the same password prompt that I received before enteringthe administration menus.andP;  I entered the password again: It was the onlypassword supplied in the letter and so the only password I knew, but thisonly entered me into the administration menus again.andP;  After trying the andless;F10andgt;function key, which exits Perfect Menu, and the andless;Escapeandgt; key, which backs upto previous menus, I decided I was stuck.andP;  The andless;F1andgt; help key didn't offer meany help on how to exit this section, so it seemed that printing out themanual would offer my only solution.andM;The manual turned out to be 85 pages and took quite a while to print on mylaser printer.andP;  Since the manual is not contained in an ASCII file, I had toexecute a command GUIDE to access and print the online manual.andP;  This alsopresented some problems since my printer was on LPT2: and the programinsisted on printing to LPT1:.andP;  I reconfigured the system and found that thegraphics in the online manual didn't print properly, so I found myselfwishing that the folks at International Computer Group (ICG) had provided mewith a nice printed and bound manual.andM;Since the manual included neither an index nor a table of contents, theredidn't appear to be an easy way to find the answer to my problem of exitingthe demonstration administration menus.andP;  When I called the technical supportnumber, the representative explained that I must not have properly set mypath command and suggested that I log in as the default system administratorand execute the verify command.andP;  He turned out to be correct.andM;Defining Menus and UsersandM;When defining a user, you must enter a unique user ID.andP;  Perfect Menu employsthe user ID to create a home directory unless you specify another directoryon the server or a local hard drive.andP;  Menus for each individual user arestored in a file in that user's home directory.andM;Since the Perfect Menu logon screen cannot replace the NetWare LOGIN command,you may want to set up the system so that users can bypass the menu systemlogon.andP;  I did this by setting up Perfect Menu users to use their NetWare homedirectories.andP;  Perfect Menu copied the appropriate files into thesedirectories.andP;  I then copied the file MENU.BAT in each home directory to thefile MEN.BAT so that it could be invoked through the users' login scriptswith the command EXIT &quot;COMMAND /C MEN&quot;.andP;  This way, as soon as the user logsonto the network server the appropriate opening menu appears on his screen.andM;You may create menus only through the Perfect Menu application, and they arestored in a proprietary format for quick access.andP;  Menu options can call othermenus within a user's menu definition file, a Perfect Menu program residingon a local hard drive, DOS commands, or applications.andP;  Applications, DOScommands, and DOS shells may be invoked with Perfect Menu in resident ornonresident mode.andM;In resident mode, the menu program requires up to 20KB of memory, but themenus reload very quickly.andP;  In nonresident mode, Perfect Menu claims to clearitself completely from memory.andP;  Running CHKDSK from a batch file with themenu system in nonresident mode showed that an additional 3.8KB or so ofmemory was unavailable.andP;  This was due to the additional overhead that PerfectMenu has placed in the operating system kernel.andM;I should also mention that to execute a batch file from a menu item, it mustbe executed as a nested batch file with either the DOS CALL command or aspecial Perfect Menu command BATCH.andP;  When I created a nested batch file toexecute the CHKDSK batch from a DOS prompt without having Perfect Menuloaded, I discovered only 80 bytes of memory were not available.andM;ICG recommends that you don't use batch files to invoke programs becausemultiple commands can be executed when a single menu item is selected, andthese commands are stored in the menu file.andP;  When you define a menu item, youcan enter each command line that you would normally execute in a batch fileto invoke an application.andM;For example, commands to change the current directory or set an environmentvariable may be required to properly invoke an application.andP;  By avoidingbatch files, you won't have a lot of little files taking up room on theserver's disk.andM;Though the number of commands associated with each menu item will increasethe amount of disk spaced used, the commands are stored in a single file thatis more compact than multiple files.andM;Since menus are stored on an individual basis, Perfect Menu offers a globalupdate capability so that if you need to change the series of commands usedto invoke any application, you can update all users or groups of users atonce.andM;In addition to the ability to access DOS commands and applications, menuitems can offer a variety of built-in functions, including an editor, groupforum, electronic mail system, and desktop tools.andP;  These are availablethrough Perfect Menu's extensive programming language.andP;  Other commandsavailable through this programming language can evaluate an environmentvariable, offer a help screen, manipulate communications ports and printers,execute either a warmboot or coldboot on the local computer, parse a textstring, and many other functions.andP;  The extensive list of commands allows youto design flexible, powerful menus.andM;I decided that it would be easiest to add users to the default system andthen edit the default menus.andP;  The menu editor offers commands for adding,deleting, and editing menu options.andP;  To select the option to delete, I simplypositioned the cursor over the corresponding item and pressed andless;ENTERandgt;.andP;  Theprogram then prompted whether I was certain I wanted to delete the item.andO;Adding items through the EDIT command did not go as smoothly.andP;  When you areediting menus, the items appear one to a line and are preceded by a letterfor easy access.andP;  The third item in the default menu, &quot;Database,&quot; isassociated with the letter &quot;c&quot;.andP;  This does make for easy access, but if youhave used the menus previously, you will be accustomed to typing a &quot;d&quot; toaccess this option since Perfect Menu supports the first character of theentry for quick reference.andP;  Also, when I positioned the cursor over anavailable item and forgot to press enter, the first character I typed sentthe cursor to another menu item.andP;  When I realized I had inadvertently editedthe text for a previously occupied entry, I could not figure out how to abortthe edit.andP;  Again, the andless;F1andgt; help key offered no specific help.andP;  I ended upretyping the entry, and was pleased to find the execution commands originallyassociated with it were still intact.andM;One of the menu items I created invoked a terminate-stay-resident programwith Perfect Menu in nonresident mode.andP;  The two programs behaved very welltogether, and I was able to continue accessing my TSR without crashing themenus.andM;Administration FunctionsandM;Perfect Menu offers an administration utility from within the menu sysstemthat can also be accessed directly from the command line.andP;  This utilitydisplays menus in pull-down format.andP;  Along with options to define users andedit menus for any user, the system administrator can also access a varietyof system reports and diagnose the system.andP;  To perform system diagnostics,the system administrator need only select the option for file verificationand the program will inspect the environment and check all files, includingPerfect Menu files in each user's home directory.andP;  I executed this command toconfirm that the Perfect Menu directory was not specified in my PATH when theICG technical support representative recommended this.andP;  System reportsprovide for any specified time frame a record of user activity within themenu system, file statistics, and project tracking information.andP;  Thesereports can be saved to a dBase III+ compatible file format or sent to aprint.andP;  You can also request a report of current user activity.andM;Many menu systems provide application metering, but Perfect Menu provides amore general resource metering function.andP;  With this function, you can createa m eter and associate it with any menu item.andP;  It, for example, you wereinterested in restricting the system so that only one copy of any moderncommunications software could be accessed at a given time, you could assign ameter called &quot;modem&quot; to all menu items that access the modem and restrict themeter to one user at a time.andM;What Does the User KnowandM;Most network users will never become aware of any of the options available tothe system administrator.andP;  They will just be impressed with their newcolorful menus and the ease with which they can access their applications.andO;If the system administrator chooses to install the extra functions availablethrough Perfect Menu, users will also be impressed with the assortment of newtools they have at their disposal.andM;One neat tool users may want is the graphical file management utility.andP;  Withthis utility, users can view directory trees, change directories, edit files,and search for and select applications to execute.andP;  Files may be markedindividually or in groups for copying, deleting, and moving.andP;  Since theutility makes use of the mouse, even flat directory trees with many entrieson a single level can quickly reviewed.andP;  The user also has access to a DOSshell through this function.andP;  Other desktop tools include a calendar,calculator, and clock.andP;  Unfortunately, these don't make good use of the mouseand aren't quite as useful as the file management tool.andP;  I did find theelectronic mail and group forum features especially tempting though.andP;  Theseenable users to send messages to other users and to participate in real-timecomputerized conversations with other users, respectively.andM;With the e-mail function, users can compose messages and send them directlyto one user or group of users.andP;  Which users belong to what group is definedby the system administrator when users are added to the system.andP;  To create amail message, I entered the CREATE command and was offered a selection ofmail categories.andP;  I couldn't locate any documentation discussing thedifferences between these types, so I just selected &quot;letter&quot;.andP;  Since mail canbe sorted by category, it would make sense for the system administrator toprovide some directions on how to choose a category.andP;  That way, users couldbe more certain that when they view their messages in the telephone category,they will be viewing telephone messages rather than someone's comments aboutthe company's telephone system.andM;After I chose a category for the mail message I was composing, a screenappeared in which I could enter text for three fields and the message body.andO;The fields describe who the message is from and to who the being sent, aswell as the subject of the letter.andP;  The e-mail program requires that the&quot;from&quot; field be completed.andP;  Unfortunately, the text entered in the &quot;to&quot; and&quot;from&quot; fields is not verified against the list of existin gusers and groups.andO;I entered the editor's name, Patricia, in the &quot;from&quot; field and sent a letterto the publisher requesting that everyone on the magazine staff be given asubstantial raise.andM;Too bad the publisher didn't log onto the network in our lab and check hismessages because he would not have been able to tell that the message was notfrom Patricia without requesting a log of user activities from the systemadministrator.andP;  Aside from the fact that users can send bogus messagesthrough this e-mail program, the fact that the &quot;to&quot; field isn't limited toexisting users and groups is annoying.andP;  After I entered a real user's name ora real group name in the &quot;to&quot; field, I did not expect to be prompted to againselect mail recipients at the time the mail was sent.andM;The e-mail program offers users the ability to save messages to a file and tosend attachments with messages.andP;  These two functions combined can provideusers with a means of forwarding mail.andP;  I saved a message I received toFILE.TXT and then specified that file as an attachment for a message Icomposed.andP;  Any number of attachments may be sent with a message, but if therecipient already has a file with the same name as the attachment, hisoriginal file will be overwritten.andP;  Similarly, if a user tries to save amessage to a file that already exists, the original file will be lost.andM;There is no reason why an attachment file has to be written to therecipient's directory with the sender's file name.andP;  It would seem morereasonable to name the attachment file according to the date and time of itsarrival in the form MMDDHHMM.SS.andP;  Of course a simple check could be executedto see if the file name already exists.andP;  If the file name did exist, the newname of the new attachment could be incremented to reflect the time lost inchecking, and the check could be performed again until an unused name wasfound.andP;  It is even easier to fix the problem of saving messages to existingfile names--if the name exists, you can simply prompt the user either toenter a new one or to appena or overwrite the existing file.andP;  Maybe I shouldrequest a consulting fee for my programming advice.andM;Users may access forums within the e-mail section as well.andP;  Forums may beprivate or public.andP;  With private forums, only specified users will be able tojoin an online conversation, but all users will be able to know that theforum is available.andP;  Forums are available even when no one has entered them.andO;This may sound like the old tree falling in the forest with no one to hearit, but by having forums available constantly, users can arrange to meet onan established forum at a specific time.andP;  I couldn't find a way to page usersinto a forum othe rthan by sending them an e-mail message.andP;  Since e-mailbeeps at the recipient whenever he has unread mail, it is a useful method forrequesting a user to participate in a forum.andM;By default, Perfect Menu gives users a screen blank utility.andP;  After some timeof inactivity, the system will clear the screen and display an occasionalmessage that the screen has been blanked to prevent burn-in.andP;  The system canalso be set up to provide a keyboard lock so that when a user leaves hisworkstation, he doesn't have to log off the network for security.andM;A Little of EverythingandM;Perfect Menus seems to offer a little of everything, and while it isn'tperfect, it is extremely useful.andP;  That is, the program is useful.andP;  I foundthe documentation to be poorly organized and full of typographical andgrammatical errors to the point that it was impossible to use in its printedform.andP;  (Four errors in the first five pages of documentation is not a verygood record, and the situation never really improved.)andP;  The online manual issomewhat more usable since it offers flexible text search capabilities, butthis is no way to expect users to familiarize themselves with a package.andP;  Howcan you ever find those neat tricks that you would never have thought oftrying if you don't have a manual to eventually peruse?andP;  Given the variety offunctions offered by the software, good documentation would certainly be abenefit.andP;  But even without it, you can accomplish a lot with someexperimentation in this application.andM;The next release of Perfect Menu, scheduled to begin shipping at press time,will offer a bound copy of documentation that, according to ICG, has beenmore thoroughly checked for errors.andP;  It will also offer new communicationsfunctions for modem control.andP;  Later this year, a 3.0 release is scheduled tosupport multiple video modes and to provide enhancements to the e-mailfunction.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
