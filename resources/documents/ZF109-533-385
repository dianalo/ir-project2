Austin.andP;  &quot;We have been in recent contact with theLabor Department to encourage them to take action to recognize the type ofnecessary services that systems integrators provide.&quot;andM;Last year, Francis A. McDonough, assistant commissioner of GSA's IRM Service,told the House Government Operations Committee that he suspected some $5billion in annually awarded systems integration contracts violatedWalsh-Healey.andP;  The law is designed to keep the government from paying higherprices for goods or services bought from brokers.andM;But at a more recent hearing of the Goverment Operations Subcommittee onLegislation and National Security, Austin contradicted McDonough'sstatements.andM;During the committee's investigation last year into alleged improper federalbias toward IBM Corp. mainframe products, the Government Operations staffraised questions about whether systems integrators qualify as legitimatecontractors under Walsh-Healey's provisions.andM;Congress passed Walsh-Healey in 1936 to protect the government from middlemenand friends of federal officials who were acting as brokers of goods andservices.andP;  The brokers made a profit but provided nothing of value throughtheir involvement.andM;Since its passage, the government has clarified and provided exemptions toWalsh-Healey almost a dozen times to include products or services that on thesurface would appear to violate the law.andP;  After the McDonough testomony lastyear, the Labor Department, which oversees Walsh-Healey compliance, haltedthen ongoing work to provide a clarification for systems integrators.andM;Labor officials have revived these efforts.andP;  The department and the Office ofManagement and Budget are reviewing the need to bring systems integratorsunder the Walsh-Healey umbrella.andM;Observers said OMB is expected to open a comment period shortly to determinehow the industry and agencies view the issue.andP;  Vendors have been lobbying fora change for several years.andM;&quot;We've got all our fingers and toes crossed that we'll see a notice in theFederal Register real soon,&quot; said Olga Grkavac, director of governmentrelations for Adapso, the computer software and service industry association.andM;Under the law, two criteria can establish a dealer's eligibility as agovernment supplier.andP;  The dealer must either manufacture the product he sellsor must maintain an inventory of the product.andP;  In most cases, systemsintegrators do neither.andM;But, as Austin and McDonough pointed out, sustems integrators often provide acrucial value-added service through their involvement in installing a systemfor the government.andP;  At the time of his eyebrow-raising statement last year,McDonough also said systems integrators are essential to government ADPbecause they can provide expertise not necessarily found within the agenciesthemselves.andM;Despite GSA's shift about whether the integrators are working outsideWalsh-Healey, Austin and many others in government still think the definitionof systems integrator needs to be improved to avoid misunderstandings.andM;That agencies find the issue troubling is reflected in a report the Navyprovided to Government Operations last month as part of the committee's biasinvestigation.andM;&quot;The requirement to stock supplies of the same general character as the itemsbeing supplied under the contract has little relevance to large mainframes,since stocks of these are rarely, if ever, maintained,&quot; the report cited asone example of conflict.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
