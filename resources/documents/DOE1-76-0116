<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-76-0116 </DOCNO><TEXT>The aqueous corrosion of Magnox fuel element grade uranium has been studiedby the Central Electricity Generating Board to ensure safe storage andtransport of Magnox fuel. The corrosion rate of irradiated uranium isrelated to temperature and to the degree of irradiation swelling. Informationon the spallation of the corrosion product, the formation of uraniumhydride and the release of fission and activation products is reported.The current understanding of the corrosion mechanism of uranium in pondand transport flask environments is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
