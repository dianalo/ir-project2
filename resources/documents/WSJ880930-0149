It would have been hard for anyone not to be moved by yesterday's launch of the spacecraft. This accomplishment, however, by necessity must live within the context of the Challenger disaster. It remains to be seen if the U.S. political system, circa 1988, can allow manned space travel to proceed in a rational and efficient manner.    NASA faces a hard dilemma. It stages these dramatic events, with melodramatic TV coverage, to build public support in Congress for its budget. Without the coverage, or with a program of unmanned flights, NASA's appropriation would suffer. But with an accident broadcast to the nation on live television, NASA reaps the whirlwind in saturation coverage and investigation of its mistake. Fearing both Congress and the media, the manned-spaceflight program becomes hyper-cautious, an attitude incompatible with continued progress of any leading-edge technology.    Given this technical/political/media reality, questions about the program's future gain legitimacy and deserve to be addressed. Does the original hype detract from other less-dramatic programs -- the use of ordinary missiles for launching satellites, or military-satellite-launching systems without the vulnerability of only two launch sites, or the possibilities of private rather than socialized exploitation of space technologies. And what of the undoubtedly inevitable human disaster; if the political system must periodically undergo a drawn-out catharsis as it did after the Challenger, might the U.S. unlock the secrets of space faster with machines rather than men?    Scientists in general must come to terms with their reliance on Congress for financial support. Space scientists now compete for attention with other big-science projects such as mapping the human genome or the super collider. In the process, already-established scientists in basic research feel slighted. Witness the recent dispute over continuing NIH's artificial-heart program.    The courage of the five Discovery astronauts and the work of the shuttle's engineers deserve the admiration most Americans felt in watching the launch. But when they return, there will still be a need to address questions of how best to continue U.S. achievements in science. </TEXT></DOC>
