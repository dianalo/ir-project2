Background</ITAG>Although sec. 5(a)(1) of the Act assigns a general duty to each employerto furnish each employee ``employment and a place of employment which arefree from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause deathor serious physical harm to his employees,'' OSHA's major focus has beenon setting standards for specific hazards and enforcing compliance withthem. In recent years, however, OSHA has become increasingly convincedof the relationship between superior management of safety and health programs_whichaddress all safety and health hazards, whether or not covered by OSHA standards_andlow incidence and severity of employee injuries. The application of managementtechniques in these programs also appears to be essential to the eliminationor adequate control of employee exposure to toxic substances and otherunhealthful conditions.As a result of this awareness, OSHA has increased emphasis on managementpractices in several of the Agency's programs. Some of the Agency's standardscontain requirements for management practices, such as the standards onHazard Communication (29 CFR 1910.1200) and Hazardous Waste Operations(29 CFR 1910.120). In addition, subpart C of the construction standards,29 CFR 1926, specifically requires management programs for accident preventionand employee training and education in the recognition, avoidance and preventionof unsafe conditions. In 1987, these construction standards were clarifiedwith the issuance of OSHA Instruction STD 3-1.1. OSHA has also institutedprograms to encourage voluntary improvement of safety and health managementand prepared informational pamphlets describing the elements of healthmanagement. In spite of this variety of activities, most employers arenot fully aware of OSHA's emphasis on the value and importance of effectivemanagement in worker safety and health protection.The purpose of this Request for Comments and Information is to stimulatepublic participation and comment by suggesting rationale and language toprovide adequate guidance. OSHA invites ideas, data and opinions aboutthe need, practicability and prospective effectiveness of such guidancein general industry, shipyard employment and longshoring in reducing workplaceinjuries and illnesses.Over the years, OSHA field staff have seen many examples of exemplary workplaceswhere safety and health programs were well-managed and where injury rateswere exceptionally low. The common characteristic observed at these siteswas the use of organized and systematic methods to assign appropriate responsibilityto all managers, supervisors and employees, to inspect regularly for andcontrol existing or potential hazards, and to orient and train all employeesin the ways and means to eliminate or avoid those hazards.The fundamental importance of such methods has been reflected in decisionsof the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission and the U.S. Courtsof Appeals, especially in cases involving an employer claim that a violativeworkplace condition or action resulted from unpreventable employee misconduct.Such misconduct has been recognized as a defense against citation onlywhen an employer had a work rule prohibiting the conduct, had providedtraining to ensure that the rule was understood, and had supplied adequatesupervision (including regular inspections and work rule enforcement) toensure that the work rule was followed. These criteria have applied incases involving the citation of OSHA standards as well as the general dutyclause. The implication of these cases is that the employer has the dutyto establish and maintain such management practices, to the extent thatthey are necessary to ensure that safe and healthful working conditionsare maintained and that safe and healthful work practices are followed.OSHA inspection checklists provide information as to whether worksiteshave a safety and health program, and some regions (OSHA's Region III inparticular) have established protocols for making determinations as tothe quality of the programs. In some cases, these findings have been afactor in ``general duty'' citations; in others they have prompted recommendationsfor safety and health program improvements which employers have agreedto as part of citation settlement agreements. In addition, a chemical industryspecial emphasis enforcement program, which included the review of managementsystems needed to lower the risk of catastrophic releases of toxic chemicals,resulted in an unusually high number of general-duty citations being issuedfor system problems not covered by standards.To encourage employers and employees to adopt and improve existing safetyand health programs, OSHA announced a plan to approve worksites with exemplaryprograms for participation in the Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) beginningJuly 2, 1982 (47 FR 29025). The participation requirements embodied inthe VPP are a distillation of the means, methods and processes alreadyin use at worksites where safety and health conditions are exceptionallygood.Because VPP participating worksites are officially recognized and are excludedfrom routine programmed OSHA inspections, the quality of the safety andhealth programs at these sites must be maintained as models of effectiveness.Currently, 60 sites are participating in VPP, and several have been inthe program for five or more years. Collectively, during their participationin the VPP, these sites have experienced lost-time injuries that are approximatelyone-fourth of the average for their industrial classifications. In addition,employers at these sites have reported improved morale and productivitybenefits, as well as significantly reduced workers' compensation and othercosts.For injuries alone, costs can be considerable. According to Frank E. Bird,Jr.'s <T3>Management Guide to Loss Control </T3>(Ex. 2-1), for every $1 in medicalor insurance compensation costs for a worker injury, $5-50 more are likelyto be spent to repair building, tool or equipment damage; to replace damagedproducts or materials; or to make up for losses from production delaysand interruptions. An additional $1-3 will be spent for hiring and trainingreplacements and for time to investigate the incident.Mr. Bird goes on to point out that if a company's profit margin is fiveper cent, it will have to sell $20,000 worth of its product to pay for$1,000 of injury costs. If the profit margin is one per cent, sales wouldhave to reach $100,000. The incentive to reduce injuries as much as possibleis very clear. The fact that VPP participants have injury rates which areone-quarter of their industry averages not only demonstrates that significantreduction is possible; it also strongly indicates that the guidance proposedby OSHA is a major means to achieve the reduction.By using a formula developed by David R. Bell and published in his article``Gauging Safety Outlays and Objectives'' in <T3>Occupational Hazards, </T3>June, 1987, (Ex. 2-2), the number of lostworkday cases avoided can be calculated for each worksite with a lost workdaycase rate (LWCR) below the national average for the industry to which itbelongs. This formula is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,0,0),tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,i1,34,59</C> <H1>Industry LWCR x Employment at the site</H1><H2>100</H2><H1>=Expected LWCases^Actual LWCases=Number of injuries avoided</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>The use of this formula provides OSHA with the information that VPP participantsin 1986 avoided 75 per cent of the lost-workday injuries that could havebeen expected by average industry performance for the same industrial classificationsand employment sizes. That means that 1,478 lost-workday cases were avoidedas a result of effective safety and health management. Management at eachsite within the VPP can objectively project the number of injuries thatthey could expect if their site were average for the next year, and thencompare their projection to their actual experience as a means of evaluatingtheir performance. This formula can also be used to demonstrate the valueof investing in and of upgrading the site safety and health program, basedon the site's determination of the average cost of a lost workday injury.Although OSHA recognizes that the VPP worksites are exceptional in providingsafe and healthful working conditions, their successes have highlightedthe importance of effective safety and health management in reducing occupationalinjuries and illnesses and have demonstrated that such protection can beachieved by other employers with the commitment to provide a safe and healthfulworkplace.In addition, both employer and employee representatives have encouragedOSHA to consider alternative regulatory approaches for safety and healthprograms. In comments before the National Advisory Committee on OccupationalSafety and Health (NACOSH), Ms. Margaret Seminario, AFL-CIO, stated that``* * * one of the problems with OSHA has always been * * * that OSHA hasfocused on particular hazards rather than health and safety programs inthe workplaces.'' (See Ex. 2-3.) Joe A. Adam, United Association of Journeymanand Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry, while addressingthe OSHA Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH),stated that ``* * * employers, in some cases, completely disregard * ** [their] responsibility to train, instruct and set up a program, leadingto a very unsafe situation on some jobs.'' (See Ex. 2-4.) At the April30, 1986 meeting, ACCSH approved a motion commending OSHA for developingprogram guidelines for Secs. 1926.20 and 21 which require constructionindustry employers to maintain safety and health programs for frequentand regular inspections, and for education and training of constructionpersonnel (Ex. 2-5.).In 1981, Robert A. Hanson, Chairman of the Board for Deere and Company,said that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Deere has been committed to strong occupational health and safetyprograms for many years preceding the passage of the Occupational Safetyand Health Act * * * By supplementing our OSHA compliance efforts withour own objective-oriented accident analysis and prevention program, since1974 our total injury and illness incidence rate has been reduced by 82percent. (See Ex. 2-6.)</ITAG>In light of the absence of comprehensive, positive guidance from OSHA onthe management methods needed to lower injury rates and of the evidencefrom the VPP and other sources that systematic management policies, proceduresand practices can have a major impact on the incidence of injuries andillnesses, OSHA is inclined to believe that a guideline is both reasonableand advisable. OSHA is requesting comment on this issue, as well as adviceas to the language of the guidance. In addition, OSHA would appreciatecomments on what methods should be used to maximize employer understandingof the guideline and of the benefits of following it. Finally, OSHA isrequesting comments on possible incentives which may increase employerattention to the benefits of effective safety and health management.Following is suggested language, segmented for the purpose of analysis,that such a guideline might contain. Each part is followed by discussionof the reasoning behind the language outlined. The suggested language hasevolved out of general industry and construction experience. Employersin shipbuilding and longshoring may want to suggest other language to addressthe employee protection issues of their industry. On the other hand, thislanguage relates to essential functions in all organizations and may beadequate as general guidance for general industry, shipbuilding and longshoring.The suggested guideline in its entirety has been repeated at the end ofthe notice for easy reference.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Possible Language for Safety and Health Program Guidelines_Providedfor Discussion Purposes</ITAG>(a) <T3>General</T3>. Employers are advised to institute and maintain in theirestablishments a program which provides policies, procedures and practicesthat are adequate to recognize and protect their employees from occupationalsafety and health hazards. An effective program will include provisionsfor the identification, evaluation and control or prevention of generalworkplace hazards, specific job hazards and potential hazards arising fromforeseeable conditions. The degree of formality and complexity of an effectiveprogram will vary with the size of the establishment and the complexityof the worksite hazards. Especially in smaller sites, the extent to whichthe program is described in writing is less important than how effectiveit is in practice.Paragraph (a)_General. This paragraph would describe the overall objectivesof effective safety and health management, and indicate the principal motivesfor meeting them. Although compliance with the law, including the generalduty clause and OSHA standards, is an important objective of an effectiveprogram and a motive for an employer to implement such a program, OSHAhas found that the most successful programs look beyond the legal requirementsto address all hazards. Their purpose is to prevent injuries and illnessesand the attendant human and economic costs, whether or not compliance withthe law is at issue. This approach is essential in view of the difficultythat regulatory agencies have in moving quickly to set standards for everypossible hazard in the workplace and to revise them when new informationbecomes available.An effective program will anticipate and guard against the possibilityof injury or illness, not only in relation to existing hazards which arecommon to the general workplace or unique to specific jobs, but also inrelation to conditions or practices which might change in a way which createsa hazard. To avoid falling victim to a hazard, it is essential to stayahead of it.The statement concerning formality and complexity is intended to stressOSHA's recognition that relatively simple, unwritten policies, practicesand procedures are adequate to address the hazards in many smaller andless hazardous establishments. The more complex and hazardous an operationis, the more formal and complex the program will probably need to be.(b) <T3>Specific Elements. </T3>An effective occupational safety and healthprogram will include each of the following actions in an appropriate form:Paragraph (b)_Specific Elements. The intent of this section is to set forththe areas of managerial practice which are essential to effective safetyand health protection. These practices, means and methods are consistentwith those used by employers to achieve other organizational objectives,such as cost control, quality and productivity. Giving safety and healthequal organizational priority with these other objectives is fundamentalto the protection of individual employees <T3>and </T3>to the effectiveness of the organization itself.These elements consist of methods historically used to accomplish managementobjectives for safety and health. They are generic in that they are generallyapplicable regardless of unique operations or conditions of particularfirms. Though at points they are expressed in the terms of the ``hierarchical''organizations most common in American industry (i.e., by reference to ``managers,''``supervisors,'' ``employees''), they can easily be adapted to other organizationalforms or styles of operation. They relate to essential concerns and activitiesof any organization. It is on this basis that OSHA proposes considerationof their application in shipyard employment and longshoring as well asgeneral industry.Four principal elements of effective safety and health management are listed.They are: Management commitment, worksite analysis, hazard prevention andcontrol, and safety and health training.Management commitment provides the central means for organizing and controllingactivities within organizations. These central means include establishinggoals and objectives; assigning responsibility to perform specific actionsand to accomplish prescribed objectives; providing adequate authority andresources to meet the responsibility; and, using systems of accountabilityto ensure that the responsibility is met. Equally important is the comprehensiveperiodic review of operations to see if they are meeting the objectivesand whether the objectives are adequate to meet the goals. This sectionrecommends that these means be used in safety and health protection withat least as much vigro as for other organizational purposes.Worksite analysis involves and active examination of the workplace to identifynot only existing hazards but also conditions and operations in which changesmight occur to create hazards. Passive unawareness of a hazard is bothan insufficient reason for failure to recognize a hazard under the generalduty clause of the Act and a sure sign that safety and health policiesand/or practices are ineffective.In Congressional deliberations on the general duty clause of the Act, aproposal to use the term ``readily apparent'' hazards, rather than ``recognized''hazards, was debated. In describing the language that congress finallyadopted, Congressman Daniels (NJ) stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">A recognized hazard is a condition that is known to be hazardous,and is known not necessarily by each and every individual employer butis known taking into account the standard of knowledge in the industry.In other words, it does not depend on whether the particular employer isaware of it.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I am afraid that ``readily apparent'' as used in the substitute, meansapparent without investigation, even though a prudent employer would investigateunder the circumstances. A danger, in other words, may be recognized assuch in the industry, but may not be apparent to an employer who is ill-informedand does not choose to investigate the danger of the situation. That isnot sufficient protection for employees. (See Legislative History of theOccupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (S. 2193, Pub. L. 91-5596) p.1007.)</ITAG>Identifying at a worksite those hazards which are recognized in a particularindustry is a critical foundation for safety and health protection. Aneffective program will not stop at this point, however. It will continuallyreview working conditions and operations to identify hazards which havenot previously been recognized in the industry, and conditions and operationswhich may change in a way which creates a hazard.Hazard prevention and control are triggered by the determination that ahazard or potential hazard exists. Where possible, hazards should be eliminated.Where potential hazards cannot be completely prevented, they must be controlledto prevent actual exposure. When exposure does occur, it must be correctedin a timely manner.Safety and health training need not be elaborate, formal or always solelyrelated to safety and health. Safety and health information and instructionis often most effective when incorporated into other training about performancerequirements and job practices, such as management training on performanceevaluation, supervisors' training on the reinforcement of good work practicesand the correction of poor ones, and employee training on the operationof a particular machine.<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) <T3>Management Commitment</T3>.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Establish a clear goal for the safety and health program and objectivesfor meeting it; communicate them to all employees; and ensure that employeescan see top management involvement.</ITAG>(b)(1)(i) The establishment of clear goals and objectives is integral tothe accomplishment of any desired result. Communicating these goals andobjectives ensures that all members of the organization understand thedirection that the organization must take. In order to ensure the credibilityof management commitment, it is particularly inportant that employees beable to see actual demonstrations of management involvement in safety andhealth concerns. For example, a plant manager who performs periodic ``housekeeping''inspections demonstrates such involvement.<ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Provide for employee involvement in the structure and operationof the program and in decisions which affect their safety and health. </ITAG>(b)(1)(ii) Employee participation does <T3>not</T3> mean transfer of responsibility. The Act clearly places responsibilityfor safety and health protection on the employer in Sec. 5. Participationdoes mean the utilization of the special knowledge and interest that employeeshave to develop and maintain programs to protect themselves and their fellowemployees. OSHA has been many functions through which employees have beeneffectively included in safety and health programs at the worksites inthe VPP. Among these are: Inspecting for hazards and recommending correctionsor controls for hazards found; analyzing jobs to locate potential hazardsand develop safe work procedures; developing or revising safe work rules;training new hires in safe work procedures and rules and/or their peersin newly revised safe work procedures; providing programs and presentationsfor safety meetings; and, assisting in accident investigation. Such functionshave been carried out in a number of organizational contexts_most commonlyin joint labor-management committees but also through such means as laborsafety committees, rotational assignment of employees to such functions,and acceptance of employee volunteers for the functions. Inclusion of employeesin one or more of these approaches, or in any way that fits the individualworksite and provides an employee role that has impact on decisions aboutsafety and health protection, will strengthen the employer's overall programof safety and health protection.<ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Assign and communicate responsibility for all aspects of theprogram, so that managers, supervisors and employees at all organizationallevels know what performance is expected of them.</ITAG>(b)(1)(iii) An effective program will include all members of the organizationin these procedures_managers, supervisors and others_both in planning andin operations. Two-way communication between management and employees,both about organizational goals and objectives and about expectations ofindividuals, is critical. If all persons do not understand what is expectedof them, and why, they are unlikely to perform as desired.<ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) Provide adequate authority and resources to meet the assignedresponsibilities.</ITAG>(b)(1)(iv) If those who are assigned responsibility for ensuring effectivesafety and health program performance are not also given adequate authorityand the resources_in terms of adequate personnel, budget and capital expenditurefunds_to fulfill the responsibility, it is unlikely that they will meetmanagement expectations.<ITAG tagnum="21">(v) Hold managers, supervisors and employees accountable for meetingtheir responsibilities.</ITAG>(b)(1)(v) After assigning responsibility and providing the necessary authorityand resources to accomplish safety and health program goals and objectives,it is essential to hold accountable those who are responsible for achievingthem. Systems of accountability need to include recognition for competentperformance and correction of inadequate performance. When a refusal tofollow safe and healthful practices is at issue, consistently applied disciplinaryprocedures for enforcing those practices are essential.<ITAG tagnum="21">(vi) Review program operations at least annually to evaluate theirsuccess in meeting the goal and objectives, and revise the program and/orthe objectives when they do not meet the goal of effective safety and healthprotection.</ITAG>(b)(1)(vi) A comprehensive program audit is essential periodically to evaluatethe whole set of safety and health management means, methods and processes,to ensure that they are adequate to protect against the potential hazardsat the specific worksite. The audit determines whether policies and proceduresare implemented as planned and whether in practice they have met the objectivesset for the program. It also determines whether the objectives, when met,are adequate to meet the program goal of effective safety and health protection.When either performance or the objectives themselves are found to be inadequate,revisions are made. Without such a comprehensive review, program flawsand their interrelationship may not be caught and corrected.<ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>Worksite Analysis.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) So that all hazards and potential hazards are identified, providefor competent persons: (1) To conduct comprehensive worksite surveys periodically,(2) to analyze new processes, materials and equipment, and (3) to performroutine job or phase hazard analyses.</ITAG>(b)(2)(i) Periodic comprehensive surveys of the worksite provide an opportunityto step back from the routine checks for previously recognized hazardsand look for others. Job hazard analysis in stable work situations commonin general industry, and phase hazard analysis in changing work processessuch as those in construction, provide another important tool for identifyinghazards not previously recognized. Analysis of new processes, materialsand equipment before their use as well as when they are first introducedprovides a check against the introduction of new hazards with them. The frequency with which comprehensive examinations would be needed isunderstood to depend on the complexity, hazardousness, and changeabilityof the worksite. Many successful worksites conduct this review on an annualor biannual basis. Implicit in the provision for all worksite surveys, reviews and analysesis the need for employers to seek competent advice and assistance whenthey lack needed expertise and to use appropriate means methods to identifyand assess all existing and foreseeable hazards. Personnel who performbaseline and periodic comprehensive surveys and analysis of new processes,procedures and equipment may require greater expertise than those who conductroutine inspections, since the former are conducting a broader and deeperreview.<ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Provide for regular site inspections by competent persons andencourage employee reports of hazards, to identify new or previously missedhazards and failures in hazard controls.</ITAG>(b)(2)(ii) Once a comprehensive examination of the workplace has been conductedand hazard controls have been established, routine site inspections arenecessary to ensure that changes in conditions and activities do not createnew hazards and that hazard controls remain in place and continue to beeffective. These inspections also look out for new or previously unrecognizedhazards, but not to the same degree as baseline or other comprehensivesurveys. Numerous specific OSHA standards require inspection of particularequipment, conditions and activities as a safety precaution prior to operationor use. This guideline would make clear that, in effective safety and healthprograms, this generally recognized inspection practice is applied morebroadly to all conditions and activities. Personnel performing regular inspections should possess a degree of experienceand competence adequate to search for hazards described by the comprehensivesurvey. They may not have the degree of competence in analyzing worksiteconditions and operations to identify potential hazards that is requiredof those who perform baseline and comprehensive surveys. They are ableto recognize hazards in the areas they review and to identify reasonablemeans for their correction or control. Such competence should normallybe expected of ordinary employees who are capable of safely supervisingor performing the operations of the specific workplace. Smaller businesseswhich need assistance in the develoment of such competence can receivefree assistance from OSHA and from a nationwide network of OSHA-funded,State-operated consultation projects.<ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Provide for investigation of accidents and ``near miss'' incidentsby competent persons, to identify their causes and means for their prevention.</ITAG>(b)(2)(iii) Accidents and incidents in which employees narrowly escapeinjury clearly expose hazards. Analysis to identify their causes permitsdevelopment of measures to prevent future injury or illness. A review ofinjury experience over a period of time may reveal patterns of injury withcommon roots which can be addressed.<ITAG tagnum="21">(3) <T3>Hazard Prevention and Control.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Establish procedures for ensuring the timely prevention and controlof hazards, however detected, through engineering techniques where feasible,through personal protective equipment, and through safe work procedureswhich are understood by all affected employees and enforced by a clearlycommunicated disciplinary system.</ITAG>(b)(3)(i) Once hazards and potential hazards are detected by any of themeans listed above, they must be systematically prevented or controlled.Where feasible and appropriate, they should be engineered out of the workplace.If that is not appropriate, the degree of exposure should be controlledby personal protective equipment and carefully developed safe work procedures.Those procedures must first be understood and then enforced so that employeesare not tempted to take short cuts and thereby endanger themselves.<ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Provide for equipment maintenance, to prevent hazardous breakdown.</ITAG>(b)(3)(ii) Equipment maintenance is of particular importance in preventingthe development of hazards which go unidentified. A regular schedule ofservicing, replacing or repairing equipment at intervals frequent enoughto avoid foreseeable equipment breakdowns is an integral part of hazardcontrol.<ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Provide for prompt and appropriate correction of hazards towhich, due to breakdowns of hazard prevention and control systems, employeesare exposed.</ITAG>(b)(3)(iii) Factors which may affect the time required for correction ofhazards include: (1) The complexity of abatement technology; (2) the degreeof risk; and (3) the availability of necessary equipment, materials andstaff qualified to complete the correction. Because conditions affectinghazard prevention and control vary widely, it is impractical for OSHA topropose specific time limits for all situations. An effective program willcorrect hazards in the shortest feasible time permitted by the nature oftechnology required and the availability of needed personnel and materials.It will also provide for interim protection when immediate correction isnot possible.<ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) Plan and prepare for emergencies, with training and drills asneeded.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(v) Establish a medical program which includes easy accessibilityof first aid, physician services and emergency medical care nearby.</ITAG>(b)(3) (iv) and (v) Planning and training for emergencies and the availabilityof first aid and emergency medical care are essential in minimizing theharmful consequences of accidents and injuries. Training and drills allowfor appropriate action to become ``second nature'' to employees who maybe called upon to react to the highly stressful conditions of a fire orother life-threatening emergency. The degree of preparation and drill neededwill depend upon the nature of possible emergencies and the complexityof evacuation of the worksite.<ITAG tagnum="21">(4) <T3>Safety and Health Training.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Ensure that all employees understand the hazards to which theymay be exposed and how to prevent harm to themselves and others from exposureto these hazards.</ITAG>(b)(4)(i) The duty to inform employees about workplace hazards and to providetraining that will enable them to avoid work-related injuries or illnessesis specified for chemical hazards in OSHA's standard on Hazard Communicationand is addressed elsewhere in other specific standards such as Sec. 1926.21_thegeneral training requirements for construction.Moreover, OSHA's comprehensive health standards, Secs. 1910.1001-1910.1200,contain provisions for signs, information and training to inform employeesof hazards and of procedures necessary to reduce the risks of hazardousexposures.The rationale for these standards requirements is, however, applicablein relation to all hazards. OSHA has found that successful safety and healthmanagement includes education of employees about all significant hazardsand potential hazards to which they may be exposed and training on howto perform their work without harm from those hazards. The cooperationof employees in identifying and controlling hazards is critical, not onlyfor their own safety and health but for that of others as well.The importance of education and training is reflected by the disproportionatelyhigh injury rates among workers newly assigned to work tasks. Althoughsome of these injuries may be attributable to other causes, a substantialnumber are directly related to inadequate knowledge of job hazards andsafe work practices. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that in 1979,48 percent of workers injured had been on the job less than one year (Ex.2-7).BLS studies show that during 1979 employees injured at work often lackedinformation to protect themselves:(1) Of 724 workers hurt while using scaffolds, 27 percent said they receivedno information on safety requirements for installing the kind of scaffoldon which they were injured (Ex. 2-8).(2) Of 868 workers who suffered head injuries, 71 percent said they hadno instruction concerning the hazards in the workplace that necessitatethe wearing of hard hats (Ex. 2-9).(3) Of 554 workers hurt while servicing equipment, 61 percent said theywere not informed about lockout/tagout procedures (Ex. 2-10).The extent of hazard information needed by workers for self-protectionvaries, but would include: (1) The general hazards and safety rules ofthe worksite, (2) specific hazards, safety rules and practices relatedto particular work assignments and, (3) the employee's role in emergencysituations. Such information and training is particularly relevant to hazardsthat may not be readily apparent to, or within the ordinary experienceand knowledge of, the employee.<ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Ensure that supervisors understand their responsibilities forsafety and health, including: (1) Analysis of the work under their supervisionto identify unrecognized potential hazards, (2) maintenance of physicalprotections in their work areas, and (3) reinforcement of employee trainingon the nature of potential hazards in their work and on needed protectivemeasures, through continued performance feedback and through enforcementof safe work practices when necessary.</ITAG>(b)(4)(ii) First-line supervisors have an especially critical role in safetyand health protection because of their immediate supervision of the workbeing performed. Their training is therefore emphasized separately. Althoughthey may have other safety and health responsibilities, those listed inthe guideline are proposed to merit particular attention.<ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Ensure that managers understand their safety and health responsibilities,as described under ``Management Commitment.''</ITAG>(b)(4)(iii) Because there is a tendency in some businesses to considersafety and health a staff function and to neglect the training of managersin safety and health responsibilities, the importance of managerial trainingis noted separately. Managers who understand both the way and the extentto which effective safety and health protection impacts on the overalleffectiveness of the business itself, and who understand their criticalrole in ensuring effective protection, are far more likely to ensure thatthe necessary safety and health management systems operate effectively.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Issues for Discussion</ITAG>A. <T3>The Nature of the Risk. </T3>What is the extent of risk to employeesresulting from hazards that exist because employers and employees havenot actively and systematically attempted to identify them? Or, if theyhave been identified, what is the extent of risk which results from eachof the following: (1) Where no one in the organization has specific responsibility,authority and/or resources to correct or control them; (2) where employeesand/or supervisors have not been made aware of these hazards or trainedin the necessary precautions to control or avoid them; (3) or where systematicprovisions for controlling them have not been continuously maintained?What is the extent of risk to employees from conditions and operationswhich may foreseeably change in a way which creates a hazard?B. <T3>The Value of Safety and Health Programs. </T3>Are verifiable sourcesof data available to document the value of benefits and the cost of safetyand health programs, apart from those already referenced in this Request?1. How can the value of ``losses avoided'' through effective safety andhealth management best be measured?a. Is the comparison of a site's injury rates with rates for its industrythe most viable measure of ``injuries avoided?'' Given that BLS illnessincidence rates do not capture a significant portion of work-related illnesses,is there an alternative measure for estimating ``illnesses avoided?''b. Are there reasonably accurate data on the costs of injuries and illnesses?What costs should be included in such data? It is generally agreed thatdirect costs, such as medical expenses and workers' compensation claims,are only a fraction of the total cost of an injury or illness. Indirectcosts, such as production time lost by the injured employee and others,hiring and/or retraining replacement workers, reduced employee morale andrelated lower efficiency, accident investigation and increased workers'compensation insurance rates, may be several times greater than the directcosts. A Business Roundtable study (``Improving Construction Safety Performance,''January, 1982) on the costs of a lost-worktime injury for constructionfound that the ratio of indirect to direct costs varies from 4 to 1 toas high as 17 to 1 (Ex. 2-11). Are more current, comparable data availablefor general industry? Are data available for shipyard employment and longshoring?2. How can the costs of effective safety and health management best bemeasured? When safety and health responsibilities are assigned throughoutthe organization, is it possible to determine the costs of activity motivatedby safety and health concerns? How much will the complexity or formalityof the safety and health program affect those cost determinations? Forexample, is it less costly to the employer to have a system of employeereports of hazards which consists of oral notification of supervisors thatto have one involving forms on which the reports are written? The lattersystem may be needed where there are many employees reporting hazards butthe former may be adequate where there are few employees or few hazardsto report.3. Do an employer's beliefs and attitudes regarding accident causationinfluence the nature of loss prevention activities? For example, it hasbeen stated in some quarters that many, perhaps most, accidents are theresult of human carelessness and, hence, are uncontrollable. On the otherhand, it has been OSHA's experience, in the Voluntary Protection Programsparticularly, that effective safety and health management can have a majorimpact in reducing both the opportunities for exposure to hazards and thebehavior of employees in identifying and guarding against hazards. Couldsome official, comprehensive guidance from OSHA be a potentially valuablemeans for expanding the latter attitude and counteracting the former? Arethere other ways that could be more effective?C. <T3>Suitable Language. </T3>1. Do the specific elements suggested coverthe management needs for operating an effective safety and health program?Are there other elements that should be included? Should any of the suggestedbe eliminated? Are there ways in which these elements can be expressedmore clearly or usefully?2. Is the suggested language general enough to cover the needs of the varietyof industries specified, or are there better ways of addressing this issue?If so, please specify and include the rationale for the recommendation.D. <T3>The Most Appropriate Methods for Educating Employers.</T3> OSHA seeksguidance as to the most effective means of educating employers about effectivesafety and health management and its benefits. OSHA is currently developinga course aimed at a broad spectrum of private sector employers to teachthese guidelines or a variation of them. It is also considering outreachthrough trade associations to assist in the design of industry-specificsafety and health management programs. These efforts would complement thesafety and health management assistance provided to small businesses bythe OSHA-sponsored consultation services provided by State governments.OSHA has previously published the elements of an effective occupationalhealth program agreed upon by OSHA, organized labor and industry representatives;voluntary training guidelines; informational pamphlets and significantquantities of safety and health management literature.Are there other methods of promoting understanding of effective safetyand health management that OSHA should consider as well?E. <T3>Incentives for Effective Management.</T3> OSHA is also requesting commenton possible incentives which may stimulate increased employer action toestablish effective safety and health management practices. It is OSHA'sexperience that the most important incentives are the benefits of suchpractices_that is, the reduction in injuries and illnesses and in attendantcosts, and the consequent improvements in productivity. These benefitsmay not appear immediately, however, and employers may not make the necessaryinvestment in organizational change without a clear sense of immediatebenefits. Are there incentives which might encourage employers to makethis investment?OSHA currently offers recognition to employers with outstanding safetyand health management through the Voluntary Protection Programs. The Programfor Inspection Exemption through Consultation provides recognition to smallerbusinesses that demonstrate effective management to the OSHA-funded consultationservices. The OSHA standards on safety and health management in constructionprovide incentives in that industry.Would the publication of formal, comprehensive guidelines as outlined herebe an effective means of motivating employers to improve the managementof worker safety and health protection? Are there voluntary mechanisms,as yet untried by OSHA, which would increase the effectiveness of voluntaryguidelines? If so, what are they?Are there other means of motivating employers to use these management elements,beyond the guidelines, which OSHA should consider?<T2>Authority: This document was prepared under the direction of John A.Pendergrass, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health,U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20210.It is issued under Sec. 41, Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' CompensationAct (33 U.S.C. 941); Secs. 4, 6, and 8, Occupational Safety and HealthAct of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 653, 655, 657); Secretary of Labor's Order No. 12-71(36 FR 8754), 8-76 (41 FR 25059) or 9-83 (48 FR 35736), as applicable;29 CFR Part 1911.</T2><ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, this 8th day of July, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John A.

An effective program will include provisionsfor the identification, evaluation and control or prevention of generalworkplace hazards, specific job hazards and potential hazards arising fromforeseeable conditions. The degree of formality and complexity of an effectiveprogram will vary with the size of the establishment and the complexityof the worksite hazards. Especially in smaller sites, the extent to whichthe program is described in writing is less important than how effectiveit is in practice.(b) <T3>Specific Elements.</T3> An effective occupational safety and healthprogram will include each of the following actions in an appropriate form:(1) <T3>Management Commitment.</T3>(i) Establish a clear goal for the safety and health program and objectivesfor meeting it; communicate them to all employees; and ensure that employeescan see top management involvement.(ii) Provide for employee involvement in the structure and operation ofthe program and in decisions which affect their safety and health.(iii) Assign and communicate responsibility for all aspects of the program,so that managers, supervisors and employees at all organizational levelsknow what performance is expected of them.(iv) Provide adequate authority and resources to meet the assigned responsibilities.(v) Hold managers, supervisors and employees accountable for meeting theirresponsibilities.(vi) Review program operations at least annually to evaluate their successin meeting the goal and objectives, and revise the program and/or the objectiveswhen they do not meet the goal of effective safety and health protection.(2) <T3>Worksite Analysis.</T3>(i) So that all hazards and potential hazards are identified, provide forcompetent persons (1) to conduct comprehensive worksite surveys periodically,(2) to analyze new processes, materials and equipment, and (3) to performroutine job or phase hazard analyses.(ii) Provide for regular site inspections by competent persons and encourageemployee reports of hazards, to identify new or previously missed hazardsand failures in hazard controls.(iii) Provide for investigation of accidents and ``near miss'' incidentsby competent persons, to identify their causes and means for their prevention.(3) <T3>Hazard Prevention and Control.</T3>(i) Establish procedures for ensuring the timely correction and controlof hazards, however detected, through engineering techniques where feasible,through personal protective equipment, and through safe work procedureswhich are understood by all affected employees and enforced by a clearlycommunicated disciplinary system.(ii) Provide for equipment maintenance, to prevent hazardous breakdown.(iii) Provide for prompt and appropriate correction of hazards to which,due to breakdowns of hazard prevention and control systems, employees areexposed.(iv) Plan and prepare for emergencies, with training and drills as needed.(v) Establish a medical program which includes availability of first aidon site and of physician and emergency medical care nearby.(4) <T3>Safety and Health Training.</T3>(i) Ensure that all employees understand the hazards to which they maybe exposed and how to prevent harm to themselves and others from exposureto these hazards.(ii) Ensure that supervisors understand their responsibilities for safetyand health, including: (1) Analysis of the work under their supervisionto identify unrecognized potential hazards, (2) maintenance of physicalprotections in their work areas, and (3) reinforcement of employee trainingon the nature of potential hazards in their work and on needed protectivemeasures, through continued performance feedback and through enforcementof safe work practices when necessary.(iii) Ensure that managers understand their safety and health responsibilities,as described under ``Management Commitment.''<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-15911 Filed 7-14-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
