First National, which was closed by regulators Friday, had assets of $14.9 million. Its sole office is to reopen today as a branch of Farmers State. The FDIC arranged the deposit transfer because of difficulties in sorting out the failed bank's contingent liabilities.    First National held deposits of $11.6 million in 2,500 accounts, including $7,000 in four accounts that exceeded the federal deposit limit of $100,000 for each depositor. Uninsured depositors will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the liquidation of the failed bank's assets.    First National was the nation's 83rd bank to fail this year and the fifth in Minnesota. </TEXT></DOC>
