Now, the questions begin.    The fast-food chain says it is considering a change in the way it pays its ad agencies, perhaps using a bonus system based on merit rather than a straight commission system based on how much it spends. &quot;We generate about $9 million in (ad agency) commissions right now,&quot; says Gary Langstaff, an executive vice president, &quot;and I don't know if we get $9 million worth of service.&quot;    Hardee's is joining a growing debate over how ad agencies should be paid. In recent years, the standard 15% commission, in which the ad agency takes 15% of the amount an advertiser spends on media time and space, has become the exception rather than the rule. Industry estimates vary, but many executives believe 65% or more of clients now use some other form of payment, such as a sliding commission or a fee. Much of the time, that works out to less than a straight 15% commission.    While the commission has been under attack for years, the debate over it is intensifying now because both agencies and their clients are under severe economic pressure. For the past few years, clients have been reining in their ad spending, and have tried to cut commissions after seeing how richly paid were the ad executives involved in the recent agency-merger wave. That in turn prompted ad agencies -- once reluctant to discuss something as vulgar as money -- to begin publicly lashing out at clients for not paying enough.    Ogilvy Group Inc., for example, pulled out of the finals of the Nissan competition last year, complaining that the compensation was far too low. Says Jack Bowen, chairman of ad agency D'Arcy Masius Benton andamp; Bowles: &quot;I'd say we dropped out of three or four competitions in 1987 because of the pay factor.&quot;    Most agencies, meanwhile, are looking for ways to make up the slack. Keith Reinhard, chairman and chief executive officer of Omnicom Group Inc.'s DDB/Needham Worldwide unit, says DDB is exploring sharing licensing proceeds with clients if a character the agency creates becomes as popular, say, as Domino Pizza's &quot;Noids.&quot; Currently, agencies don't profit if their creations become T-shirts or toys.    And negotiated compensation is more common. Today, says Alvin Achenbaum, whose Canter Achenbaum Associates negotiates agency fees for clients, &quot;almost all compensation agreements are negotiated.&quot;    Yet the growing emphasis on compensation threatens to make ad agencies more like commodities, which clients choose according to price rather than quality. Already, a small Philadelphia ad agency, Harris-Edward Inc., has published a price list touting such things as 30-second TV spots for $15,320 apiece and full-page color magazine ads for $5,760 each. No rivals are following that lead, but many acknowledge price proposals could become part of an agency's new-business pitch, right alongside creative ideas and credentials.    Last summer, taking a commodities approach, Godfather's Pizza Inc. dropped J. Walter Thompson Co. even though it was happy with its creative work. &quot;We needed to bring (the price) more in line with what we could afford,&quot; says Charles E. Henderson, vice president of marketing.    The most common compensation arrangement now is a fee or reduced-commission arrangement, or a combination of both. But agencies are trying alternatives. Canter Achenbaum designed an &quot;indemnification&quot; clause for several clients, including American Cyanamid Co.'s Shulton unit, under which the ad agency must pay a seven-figure sum if it drops the client as a result of a merger. Small Messner, Vetere, Berger, Carey has discussed being paid based on a client's sales increases.    Bonus systems are also gaining popularity. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, the RJR Nabisco Inc. unit, has been using one for about a year. Its agencies are happy with the plan, and some are considering similar ones for other clients.    Generally, however, most new compensation structures are vilified by ad agencies, which blame the compensation squeeze for many of their financial woes. Not that the 15% commission is the answer to everyone's problems, either. Clients still using it often demand extra services, like outside research the agency must pay for out of its own pocket.    Moreover, as clients create more brand extensions -- new flavors, for example -- &quot;you've got four products there instead of one,&quot; says Mr. Bowen of DMBandamp;B. &quot;And guess what? They all come out of the same budget, and they aren't paying us any more.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
