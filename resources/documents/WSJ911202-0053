It ended yesterday much the same way.   The weekend's results were contradictory and inconclusive.Retailers were generally optimistic, while consumers werecautious.</LP><TEXT>   The season looked good in the Midwest, not so good in theEast. While unseasonably warm weather hurt some Easternretailers, many Southwest retailers welcomed a cold snap thatspurred sales of winter clothing. Discounting and promotionswere heavy nationwide, but many savvy consumers, recallingretailers' lateseason panic price cuts in recent years, saidthey were waiting for deeper discounts later on.   As usual, this fuzzy picture won't clear up until late inthe shopping season, when nervous retailers get a betterhandle on their sales and inventories and consumers startfeeling guilty about their parsimonious gift-giving. Butnothing that happened over the weekend dispelled the gloomshrouding the U.S. economy.   Consumer confidence is lower currently than at any time inthe 1981 recession. The Conference Board reported late lastweek that the average U.S. household will spend 3% less onChristmas gifts this year than it did last year. Andconsumers were genuinely concerned about the future.   There's so much uncertainty,&quot; said Cathie Olsen, apart-time legal secretary shopping at Sears in Chicago. &quot;Mywhole family gets together on Christmas Eve and some of themdon't know if they're going to have a job next week.&quot;Likewise, Jay Berlunghi, a computer software engineer fromWorcester, Mass., worries about job security. &quot;Next year Idon't know about my job,&quot; he said, &quot;but I'll still have threechildren to feed.&quot;   Still, many retailers reported solid gains for what istraditionally the biggest-selling weekend of the year.Especially optimistic were the discount retailers, who seeconsumer caution leading more shoppers out of the bigregional malls and into the strip shopping centers that thediscounters inhabit.   Dollar General Corp., a 1,500-store chain in the Southeastand Midwest, saw its same-store sales rise more than 10% thisweekend, compared with the Thanksgiving weekend a year ago.Bruce Quinnell, the company's chief financial officer, saidthat the chain, which generally attracts people with incomesunder $25,000, has started drawing consumers who earn as muchas $40,000. &quot;The mall parking lots were jammed with peoplewho looked but did not buy,&quot; he said. &quot;We see people who leftthe malls to go to the strip centers and do actual buying.&quot;   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, alsoexpects strong Christmas sales, although a spokesman said thediscounter probably won't set any records. Wal-Mart hasstocked up on merchandise and hired extra help for theseason. &quot;Wal-Mart always predicted the season would be betterthan the national press was predicting,&quot; said a companyspokesman.   But discounters weren't the only ones to see a ray of hopein the weekend's events.   Among traditional department store chains, Montgomery Wardandamp; Co., the closely held Chicago retailer, posted percentagesales gains &quot;right at a double-digit increase,&quot; said BillMcCarthy, president of stores and marketing. Matthew Howard,senior vice president, marketing, at Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.,said that domestic retail sales for the Thanksgiving weekend&quot;met our expectations and beat last year's sales.&quot;   Dayton Hudson Corp. said sales at its Mervyn's andtraditional department stores were &quot;better than expected,&quot;and that percentage sales increases at Hudson's stores in theDetroit area and Marshall Field's stores in Chicago were inthe &quot;mid-teens.&quot; And J.C. Penney Co. said that Friday'sresults were &quot;very good.&quot;   At the Century City Shopping Center andamp; Marketplace in LosAngeles, auto traffic Friday was 6% ahead of the prior year,said a spokeswoman for the collection of 140 shops andrestaurants. Boosting business, she said, was the fact thatHanukkah began last night. The upscale mall draws heavilyfrom the large Jewish community in Los Angeles.   Even so, most retailers weren't ready to put to rest fearsof a blue Christmas. While many reported elbow-to-elbowshoppers over the weekend, that wasn't always good news. Inmany cases, observers said, there was more browsing thanbuying.   While &quot;there seems to be pretty good traffic in themalls,&quot; said Robert Nourse, president and chief executiveofficer of the Bombay Co., &quot;our store people tell us thatpeople are being very careful about the way they spend theirmoney.&quot; The home furnishing retailer, based in Forth Worth,Texas, reported percentage sales gains in the &quot;high singledigits&quot; for the weekend, but was uncertain whether the salesgains would hold up through the Christmas season.   Also, many of the shoppers were lured by sales, sales andmore sales, along with some expensive promotions. Searslaunched what it called the strongest holiday media plan inits history, built around the slogan &quot;You can count on me&quot;and special holiday-season prices. The campaign kicked offduring Thursday's showing on CBS of the movie, &quot;E.T., TheExtra-Terrestrial,&quot; which was sponsored exclusively by Sears.   Penney held a three-hour after-Thanksgiving sale thatstarted at 8 a.m. Friday and is running advertisementstouting 25% to 50% discounts on men's and women's sweaters.   Filene's Basement Inc. is offering markdowns on itsalready discounted prices. The chain's downtown Boston storewas jammed for most of the weekend, as it offered discountsof as much as 75% on many items. The store was also one ofmany to extend shopping hours, opening at 7:30 a.m. Friday,90 minutes early.   At a Carson Pirie Scott andamp; Co. department store in Chicago,prices were discounted heavily. Still, one shopper said, &quot;youdon't see a lot of bags going out of here.&quot;   In Boston, a Neiman-Marcus department store nestled inglitzy Copley Square knocked nearly $1,000 off its $2,300cashmere designer sweaters. And at a nearby Gucci store, asaleswoman muttered, &quot;Proceed to the closest discounter, theaction seems to be in those places.&quot;   Discounter or not, for most retailers the action focusedon sales. &quot;Is this one marked down?&quot; asked a woman at a LosAngeles-area May Co. department store about a Liz Claibornehandbag. The saleswoman said no. &quot;Too bad,&quot; the shopper said,moving on.   This season's early discounting had some shopperssalivating. &quot;You don't have to wait for sales,&quot; said SueMerrill, a Hillsborough, Calif., shopper. &quot;They'reeverywhere.&quot; But others felt that the best was yet to come.&quot;I'm going to wait a couple of weeks because I know thatstores will be stuck with a lot of merchandise and I shouldbe able to get some good deals at the last minute,&quot; saidCarol Ann Brown, a New Rochelle, N.Y., bank secretary.   Beyond bargain hunting, consumers also seemed to focus onpractical, less costly gifts. Cathy Green, owner of KidsUnlimited, a specialty toy store in Pittsburgh's SquirrelHill neighborhood, reported heavy demand for &quot;classic,quality&quot; gifts such as Tinker Toys and books. &quot;Many peopleare telling me they're going to be spending the winter athome and want toys that will last,&quot; she said. &quot;The trendystuff just isn't that popular this year.&quot;   Other stores reported similar trends, with staples such asbath towels, small appliances and turtleneck sweaters sellingbriskly.   Many shoppers also said they were shying away from creditpurchases this year.   Many consumers said they intend to spend less this yearbecause of the economy and job insecurity. One cost-cuttingtwist mentioned by some shoppers: a lottery system ofgift-giving. Christopher Smith, a 26-year-old graphics artistfrom Chelsea, Mass., said he and his nine siblings held agift drawing this year; so instead of nine gifts, he only hasto buy one. After spending $500 on gifts last year, heexpects to spend about $100 this year.,   But for those who miss the conspicuous consumption of the'80s, take heart. Some remnants of those heady days stilllinger. Among the hot-selling items at Gucci America, a35-store chain owned by Guccio Gucci S.p.A., are $125 and$145 pigskin water-bottle carriers worn around the neck.Explained Corinne Coombe, executive vice president of thechain: &quot;People like to carry their own bottled Evian water.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
