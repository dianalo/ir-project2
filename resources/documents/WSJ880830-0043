Sales of stock, bond and income mutual funds totaled $6.99 billion in July, compared with $8.2 billion in June and $13.2 billion a year earlier, according to the Investment Company Institute.    Jacob Dreyer, the Washington-based trade group's chief economist, said fund redemptions also fell, reflecting sluggish market activity.    Stock fund sales totaled $2.2 billion in July, compared with $2.8 billion in June and $5.4 billion in July 1987. Bond and income fund sales were at $4.8 billion in July, compared with $5.4 billion the previous month and $7.8 billion a year earlier.    For the year to date, total mutual fund sales have fallen 60% to $57.31 billion from $137.51 billion.    Assets of all mutual funds, including money-market funds and short-term municipals, fell to $805.56 billion from a revised $808.6 billion in June and $837.2 billion last July.    Stock, bond and income funds' assets have declined $53.9 billion over the past year, according to the institute, as investors have remained uneasy about such investments since last October's stock market crash. Assets of stock, bond and income funds totaled $477.12 billion in July, off from $531.02 billion a year earlier. And from June to July, assets of these funds fell $4 billion.    Total fund assets, however, got some support from increased investment in money market mutual funds. Investors have continued to shift to these more stable and predictable funds since the crash, and their assets have risen by $23.19 billion in the past year to $262.37 billion.    At $1.2 billion in July, government bond funds, including reinvested dividends, again accounted for the largest share of fund sales. But the figure was down from $1.4 billion last month and almost $2.3 billion a year earlier. Sales of long-term municipal bond funds totaled about $1 billion, the next biggest percentage, compared with $1.1 billion in June and $1.3 billion in July 1987.    Mutual fund redemptions slowed to $6.9 billion from $7.9 billion in June and $8.3 billion in July 1987. Net sales of stock, bond and income funds in July were $92.8 million, compared with $314.2 million in June. They were $4.9 billion in July 1987.    Net sales of stock funds in July were a negative $358.5 million, compared with a negative $216.2 million in June and a positive $2.2 billion a year earlier. Bond and income fund net sales were a positive $451.3 million, compared with $530.4 million in June and $2.7 billion in July 1987.    In July, 10.6% of mutual fund assets were held in cash, compared with 10.1% in June. In July 1987, the proportion was 9.3%. Fund managers typically hold a cash reserve of 9% to 10% of assets to help meet withdrawal requests and to act as a buffer in case the market drops. </TEXT></DOC>
