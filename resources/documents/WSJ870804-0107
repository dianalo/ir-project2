In its constant efforts to steal Western technology, the Soviet Union has now come up with an above-board way to access secrets: use international organizations.    At the current talks in Vienna for the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Soviet Union and its allies have shown an unusual interest in biotechnology, proposing resolutions to increase information and technology transfers between East and West to enhance &quot;peace and security in Europe.&quot; In fact, the intentions are military.    &quot;These same technologies are being used by the Ministry of Defense to develop more effective BW {biological warfare} agents,&quot; says the Defense Department's latest report on &quot;Soviet Military Power.&quot; &quot;With this biotechnological capability, naturally occurring microorganisms can be made more virulent, antibiotic-resistant, and manipulated to render current U.S. vaccines ineffective.&quot;    But Western diplomats, especially those in the U.S. State Department, are behaving as if oblivious to the dangers of transferring biotechnology to a nation that is already using these techniques to create new warfare agents. With much U.S. and European acquiescence, Soviet and East Bloc officials in Vienna have offered resolution after resolution to gain obligatory access through United Nations agencies to Western biotechnology. The proposals include &quot;scientific and technological cooperation,&quot; &quot;commercial transfer of technology,&quot; sales of engineering services and equipment, lifting of existing trade barriers on sensitive technologies and more meetings of international experts.    The problem, as in previous East-West scientific agreements, is that the exchange of information would run in only one direction. The West opens its laboratories and drawing boards to the Soviets and Eastern Europeans, but their doors remain virtually closed. Moreover, the Soviets have in the past used such exchanges to spread disinformation in the West about the real intent of their scientific endeavors.    Despite these past experiences, the State Department has signed on to a resolution that would give away the U.S.'s procedural safeguards for its anti-BW vaccine programs. The measure -- co-sponsored by Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and the U.S. -- would provide &quot;ways and means of facilitating consultation and exchange of information leading to a stock-taking of existing safeguards.&quot; It would further call for &quot;exchange of information and transfer of technology.&quot;    One Defense Department official, concerned about maintaining the secrecy of U.S. vaccines being developed against Soviet biological warfare agents, said that such an agreement would give the Soviets &quot;the keys to the vault. The U.S. would be obligated to give them the keys to our safeguards&quot; for laboratory research and field tests.    In an April speech on &quot;how we are going to enhance the efficiency of our economy,&quot; Mikhail Gorbachev said: &quot;The main thing is to reach within a short period the most advanced level in the key scientific and technological areas,&quot; citing biotechnology in particular. The Soviets, however, know full well that the science of biological engineering can be used for war or for peaceful purposes. Rather than &quot;the most advanced&quot; biotechnology, the average Soviet citizen more urgently needs access to such routine medicines such as penicillin and other standard antibiotics. The proven technology most likely to bring these benefits to the Soviet Union is a freely operating price mechanism.    The Soviets deny that their biotech work has anything to do with biological warfare, just as they denied the use of &quot;yellow rain&quot; against Asians and lied about the anthrax outbreak at Sverdlovsk in 1979. The Kremlin insists that it is abiding by the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, requiring BW disarmament. On the evidence so far, it appears that the West's negotiators are inclined to take them at their word.    The Pentagon's concerns about the Soviet biological-warfare program deserve a better hearing than they've been getting. Otherwise, when the time comes in the fall to sign a new five-year extension on cooperation in Europe, the West may find itself aiding Soviet biotech espionage by handing over valued, and potentially very dangerous, scientific knowledge. </TEXT></DOC>
