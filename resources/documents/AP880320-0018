A car was missing after going off a ferry dock into the water.   ``It's an all-out riot,'' said Anthony Lloyd, a Coast Guardspokesman in Port Aransas. ``They are setting cars on fire. Peopleare hurt on the beach.''   The disturbance began when a motorist hit a girl on the beach atthis popular Gulf Coast vacation spot and tried to leave the scene,said Corpus Christi Department of Public Safety officer A.G.Michniak.   ``There was a hit-and-run accident on the beach that injuredone,'' Michniak said. ``The crowd stopped the car, took out theoccupants and tipped it over and burned it.''   ``They stomped the car, broke all the glass out of it andflipped it over,'' said Tom Frazier, 22, a student at theUniversity of Texas.   At least eight people were arrested, Michniak said.   Coast Guard divers Sunday morning battled a strong rip currentto search for the missing car.   A ferry captain and deck hand watched the car ``drive through abarrier and into the water because there was no ferry to catch thecar. They witnessed the car going down and we were called out. Wehave no idea how many were in the car,'' said Coast Guard spokesmanSteven E. Sander   The car broke in half a barrier similar to those at railroadcrossings and equipped with red flashing lights, he said.   ``Most likely, whatever was in the car is still in the car,'' hesaid.   The car was in water about 18 feet deep. Coast Guard vesselsdragged the water, and divers hunted for the vehicle.   ``We feel it is related to the spring breakers,'' Sander said.``It happens every year. Just drunk college kids not thinking.''   More than 100 law enforcement officers from south Texas and theCoast Guard, using two helicopters and tear gas, responded to thedisturbance on the beach, the Corpus Christi Caller Times reported.   Michniak estimated the crowd on the beach at about 3,000, whileLloyd put it at about 1,000. Lloyd said most of the studentsappeared to be high-school age.   Law enforcement officials in Port Aransas said ambulances wereunable to get through the crowd to assist the injured.   ``There are injuries, but we're unable to pull them out,'' saida Port Aransas police dispatcher, who did not wish to be identified.   Paul Guerra of Port Aransas said he witnessed a stabbing as heleft the beach.   ``I walked by a group on a roadway. All of a sudden, somebodyyelled and a guy fell. He had blood all over his chest,'' Guerrasaid. ``I heard them shout, He's stabbed! He's stabbed!' Theystarted tearing at his clothes, and then the police came runningover.   ``I left,'' Guerra said. ``I hate to say it, but I was afraidfor my life.''   Helicopters from the Coast Guard and the DPS swept the area withsearchlights.   Michniak said the DPS received the first call at 11:35 p.m. anddeclared the disturbance under control at 2:40 a.m. Sunday.   About 30,000 students were staying in this island resort forspring break, Lloyd said.</TEXT></DOC>
