The Assemblies of God said the more specific wording was part ofa rule revision that had been planned for six years. Delegatesapproved the change Wednesday at the denomination's general councilmeeting.   Previously, any offenses involving sexual misconduct fell underthe general statement of ``any conduct unbecoming to a minister orindiscretions involving morals.''   Swaggart was expelled in 1988 for refusing to accept a one-yearsuspension after his tearful confession of ``moral failure.'' Hehad been accused of patronizing a prostitute.   Bakker, founder of the PTL ministry, was stripped of hiscredentials in 1987 after admitting a sexual encounter with churchsecretary Jessica Hahn.   Other causes for disciplinary action are ``dictatorialauthority'' over a congregation, inefficiency, a noncooperativespirit, a habit of running into debt and the remarriage of adivorced clergy member whose former spouse is still living.   A credentials committee will decide whether a minister isrehabilitated or dismissed for an offense, based on the manner andthoroughness of repentance, the attitude of the minister toward thediscipline and willingness to cooperate.   The only busines on the meeting's scheduled Thursday wascommittee reports on Christian educating, dealing with therestructuring of the denomination's division of Christian education.   On Wednesday, the Rev. G. Raymond Carlson was re-elected to hissecond four-year term as general superintendent, the denomination'schief executive officer.   The church has 1.3 million members and an attendance of roughlytwice that.</TEXT></DOC>
