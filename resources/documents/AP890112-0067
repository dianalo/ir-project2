Two Israeli jets roared in at 10:05 a.m. to attack campsbelonging to Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council in MajdalyounValley, four miles east of Sidon.   Israeli military authorities said the bases served as a planningand staging areas for terrorist attacks.   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council, an extremist PLO splinter group,has been blamed for terrorist attacks against Israel and WesternEuropean countries, most notably the Rome and Vienna airportmassacres of December 1985.   A police spokesman said the two Israeli jets in today's raidfired four rockets ``in a few seconds and flew away west toward theMediterranean.'' The spokesman, who cannot be identified understanding rules, said smoke billowed from the valley.   Fatah guerrillas at first turned away ambulances dispatched fromSidon, claiming there were no casualties.   But the police spokesman said the ambulances later were allowedinto Majdalyoun Valley and returned with sirens wailing. He saidthey took an undisclosed number of casualties to a Fatah clinic inthe Druse-controlled Chouf mountains northeast of Sidon.   ``These people (Fatah) are clever in hiding their losses. It isvery difficult to estimate their casualties,'' the spokesman said.   Fatah guerrillas opened up at the raiding jets from twin-barreledanti-aircraft guns, but no hits were observed, he said.   In Israel, the army said in a statement that the bombing followedan earlier raid at 9 p.m. Wednesday. It did not say if the targetwas destroyed, but said the Israeli warplanes had returned safelyfrom both raids.   The attacks were the first two Israeli air raids on guerrillatargets in Lebanon this year. According to a police count, 128people were killed and 356 wounded in 25 Israeli air raids onLebanon in 1988.   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, broke away from PLOchief Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah guerrilla group in 1974 andformed his faction two years later. He is the most wantedPalestinian terrorist in the United States and western Europe.   Fatah opposes Arafat's explicit recognition of Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization dialogue with the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
