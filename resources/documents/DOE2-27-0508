The abundance of Hawaii's natural energyresources makes the state a model laboratory for developing strategiesusing hydrogen and renewable energy to achieve greater independence fromimported oil. This paper discusses opportunities for hydrogen use inthe near- to long-term future. Three categories of hydrogen utilizationexist in Hawaii: chemical (methanol and ammonia), electrical (storageand generation), and transportational (space, aircraft, and ground).Hydrogen can be a bridge transporting energy from an energy-abundantisland to an energy-deficient island. In time, it may even provide Hawaiiwith the means to export energy.</TEXT></DOC>
