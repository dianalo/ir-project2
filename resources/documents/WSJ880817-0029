Although a round of profit-taking near the close caused the day's earlier gains to erode, stocks still managed to recover some of Monday's sharp losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had dropped 33.25 points in the previous session, rose 17.24 to 2021.51.    Between Aug. 3 and Monday, the average had fallen nearly 130 points, and analysts said the severity of the market's downturn had created the potential for stocks to rebound.    Before that potential could be realized, however, the market had to overcome the impact presented by the government's June trade report, released before yesterday's opening. &quot;Out came what everyone thought was bad news, and the market perversely rallied,&quot; said Edward M. Kerschner, chairman of the investment policy committee at PaineWebber.    The report showed the merchandise trade deficit widened sharply to $12.54 billion in June on an adjusted basis from a revised $9.76 billion in May. Although the latest deficit was well above the market's expectations, the report caused stock prices to decline only slightly in early trading.    Traders suggested that expectations of a disappointment from the trade data had been built into the market as a result of Monday's sharp decline in prices. &quot;Everyone expected it to get crunched,&quot; said Edward E. Collins III, executive vice president of institutional trading at Daiwa Securities International. Also, traders noted that the sharp downward revision of the May deficit from $10.93 billion blunted some of the impact of the June figure.    Following the early setback, the market staged a rally that reached its peak in early afternoon, when the Dow Jones industrials showed a gain of nearly 34 points. Prices then pulled back before the market surged again in late trading, which led to the profit-taking.    Broader market averages lagged the Dow Jones industrials, but still managed to post solid gains. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.87 to 260.56 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index climbed 0.91 to 147.49. Among Big Board issues, 884 advanced in price and 579 declined.    Big Board volume rose to 162.8 million shares from 128.6 million Monday, even though dividend-related trading by institutions again was fairly light.    Daiwa's Mr. Collins said he was disappointed that trading activity didn't show more improvement, since the level of volume suggests that the market may have trouble extending its gains. &quot;For us to have a real sustained up move here, you've got to have more volume,&quot; he said.    PaineWebber's Mr. Kerschner said stocks don't appear to be in a position for any lasting rally. He cited the current level of interest rates, especially short-term rates, and the possibility of further increases as factors that will keep the market from making any progress. He noted that his firm expects the Dow Jones industrials to remain stuck in &quot;suspended animation&quot; between the 1800 and 2200 levels for some time.    David B. Bostian Jr., president of Bostian Research Associates, takes a considerably more optimistic view. He said stocks appear to be on the verge of &quot;a dynamic advance,&quot; in which the Dow Jones industrials would have &quot;a 50-50 chance&quot; of exceeding the record of 2722 by the end of the year.    Bostian said his outlook is based in part on a belief that the Fed's recent boost in its discount rate will cause economic growth to slow down quickly without triggering a recession. Also, he said the stock market appears to be undervalued at current levels, based on a comparison of the total valuation of Big Board issues to gross national product.    Pennwalt, a rumored takeover target, jumped 3 to 83 1/4 ahead of a board meeting set for today. Analysts told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that any of three parties could make a bid for the company: Centaur Partners, which owns at least 7.6% of its common shares; Pennwalt's management, which is said to be working with Goldman Sachs on a leveraged buyout offer, and another chemical company, such as Ethyl. Pennwalt declined to comment, and a spokesman for Ethyl couldn't be reached for comment.    Hewlett-Packard fell 1 1/2 to 45 7/8 amid investor skittishness regarding its fiscal third-quarter earnings report, expected to be released today. Analysts told the investor report that the company's level of orders for the quarter will be watched even more closely than its financial results, since the year-ago quarter was its best for U.S. orders.    Gillette dipped 1 3/8 to 33 3/4 following its issuance of one share repurchase right for every seven shares held. Each right allows the holder to sell one common share back to the company for $45. The company said the rights are expected to expire Sept. 19 and have been listed on the Big Board.    Polaroid rose 7/8 to 43 3/8. Its board rejected a sweetened takeover bid from Shamrock Holdings, which has offered to pay shareholders $40 a share and 40% of any proceeds from the company's patent infringement lawsuit against Eastman Kodak. Separately, Shamrock received federal clearance to acquire a controlling stake in the company.    Damon Corp. surged 5 5/8 to 24 1/2. American Magnetics, which along with Ballantrae Partners holds a stake of slightly more than 10% in the company, said it intends to launch a $24-a-share offer for the shares it doesn't already own.    Tyco Laboratories gained 1 1/2 to 31 1/2. The company said it agreed to acquire Mueller Holdings, a manufacturer of water and gas pipe valves and fittings, for $350 million. The purchase price includes the assumption of Mueller's debt.    Lukens lost 1 3/8 to 39 7/8. The company said the United Steelworkers of America will terminate tomorrow a contract extension under which the two sides have been operating since September 1986. The union represents about 1,400 workers at the company's plant in Coatesville, Pa.    U.S. Shoe, which surged 5 7/8 points Monday on news that it will consider the possible sale or restructuring of the company, climbed another 1 3/8 to 25 7/8 in Big Board composite trading of 1.7 million shares.    The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.74 to 294.57. Volume was nearly nine million shares, down from 9.1 million Monday.    Viacom Inc. jumped 2 to 28, after it agreed to sell Cablevision Systems its Long Island and suburban Cleveland cable systems for $550 million. Cablevision also agreed to acquire a 5% interest in Viacom's Showtime-The Movie Channel for an additional $25 million. Cablevision added 1/4 to 33 1/2.    Salem Corp. added 1 to 13. The company reported second-quarter net income of $975,000, compared with year-ago net of $1,305,000, which included a $1.9 million gain from the termination of retirement plans.    Glenmore Distilleries Class B lost 1 to 20 3/8. A group including Baupost Group, a Cambridge, Mass., investment advisory firm, said it lowered its stake in Glenmore to 3.6% of the Class B shares outstanding. The group didn't give a reason for lowering its stake. </TEXT></DOC>
