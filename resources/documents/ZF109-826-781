 GlobalView, the successor to ViewPoint, extends the desktopmetaphor across the network to deliver consistent access to all informationand network resources.andP;  One primary defference between the GlobalViewapproach and the ViewPoint approach is GlobalView's embrace ofindustry-standard platforms.andP;  Yes, Xerox's pilot and Mesa represented someterrific engineering and did amazing things with relatively small amounts ofmemory.andP;  However, the market clearly demanded the need for supportingstandard platforms, and Xerox is beginning to respond.andM;GLOBALVIEW ARCHITECTURE.andP;  The GlobalView architecture consists of five layers(see Illustration 1):andM;* Operating Environment, including SPAR/Unix, Intel DOS and OS/2, and Xeroxpropriratery worksations.andM;* Network Service Layer, which is the critical enabler for Globalview.andP;  Xeroxcurrently supports XNS, with gateways to SNA, TCP/IP, OSI and DECnet.andO;&quot;Century&quot; is a critical word.andP;  As we mentioned in the Panos report, Xerox'sXNS is no longer a competitive advantage.andP;  There are now other &quot;open&quot;platforms for advanced distributed computing of the type delivered by Xerox:OSF DCE and Sun ONC.andP;  It would make a great deal of sense for Xerox toexamine how it could begin to migrate to these standard foundation--when, forexample, it could swap out the Courier RPC in favor of, say, the NCS RPC.andM;* GlobalView Layer, which includes the desktop and the interface to thenetwork resources: filing, mailing, printing, terminal emulation, etc.andM;* Standard Application User Interface Layer, which specifies the behavior andappearance of the environment.andM;* Application Elements Layer, which is where the software tools reside.andO;Xerox has defined three categories within this layer: General purpose,enhanced graphics and specialized applications, and advance/distributedprocessing solutions.andP;  This layer also supports the use of &quot;agents.&quot;andM;(Xerox has finally adopted the increasingly common term &quot;agents&quot; rather thanretaining CUSP-its older user-programming solution.)andM;Applications.andP;  Xerox is bundling all its general purpose businessproductivity applications into what it calls the ViewPak (VP) software.andP;  VPconsists of modules familiar to ViewPoint users:andM;* The compound document editorandM;* Programs for generating graphics, forms and equationsandM;* E-mailandM;* Iconic representation of printers and serversandM;* Terminal emulatorsandM;* Agents for customer programming and task automationandM;* Support for DOS in a windowandM;* Utilities for document and data conversionandM;* HypertextandM;* Shared books for team collaborationandM;Xerox is basically maintaining the same set of enhanced graphics andspeciality applications that it had with ViewPoint: Xerox PublishingIllustrator, Xerox Pro Illustrator, Xerox Chemical Illustrator, and anEquations editor.andP;  It has added an X Environment window for runningthird-party applications on Unix platforms, and offers a Document InterfaceLibrary.andP;  The library facilitates the development of C programs for data anddocument interchange on Unix platforms.andM;The advanced network applications Xerox had begun producing recently arekeeping right up with the new environment: Document Search and Retrieval(DSR) and DocuTeam (formerly Panos).andP;  DocuTran highlights Xerox'scapabilities in machine translation.andP;  (Additionally, the extend applicationssupports double-byte language sets, such as Japanese and Chinese, along withArabic and Hebrew.)andM;HARDWARE.andP;  Hardware offerings include the 6520 workstation andGlobalView-for-the-PC.andM;6520 Workstation.andP;  The 6520 workstation is the result of the previouslyannounced technology alliance between Sun and Xerox.andP;  The SPARC workstationruns at 15.8 MIPS, comes with 8MB of main memory (expandable to 48MB), 200MBinternal storage, a 3.5 1.44MB floppy, and includes SunOS.andM;The environment here supports NFS and TCP/IP and well as XNS.andP;  Prices for the6520 start at $9,995.andM;GlobalView-for-the-PC.andP;  GlobalView-for-the-PC is a hardware/software solutionfor bringing PCs fully into the GlobalView environment.andP;  The packagesconsists of a coprocessor board with 4MB of extra RAM, a 19-inch display, andthe GlobalView software.andP;  Xerox estimates that more than 96 percent of thecurrent base of 80286 and 80386 PCs can utilize this solution.andP;  Users canhot-key among the GlobalView, DOS, and OS/2 environments.andP;  TheGlobalView-for-the-PC package starts at $3,995.andM;COMMENTS.andP;  GlobalView is a very positive step for Xerox.andP;  The company now hasa means of capitalizing on the popular hardware platforms in the market, aswell as catching a ride on the Unix wave with Sun.andM;True, coprocessing boards haven't been the most popular solutions fordelivering advanced software functionality.andP;  NBI didn't do too well with itsome years back.andP;  We believe that GlobalView-for-the-PC will be most popularwith existing customers who would like to expand their Xerox networks by&quot;retreading&quot; existing PCs.andP;  For new purchasers, that SPARC-based 6520 isgoing to be hard to ignore.andM;But, best of all from the industry point of view, the GlobalView applicationsand services are going to have even more opportunity to influence otherdevelopers.andP;  We're starting to see some very creative network applicationsemerge, such as Lotus Notes and the new InfoAlliance from SPC.andP;  Combibe withthat the exploitation of workstation platforms by products such as the newLotus Improv on the NeXT machine, then sir in the power of Xerox's networkservices and applications as a further catalyst, and we could have somethingextremeley exciting brewing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
