Even with the end of the war in the Persian Gulf, oilprices had firmed on the anticipation by traders that theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would act atthe meeting beginning today to reduce production and restorea $21 minimum reference price.</LP><TEXT>   Most of the group's oil ministers believed that suchaction to help prop up prices was in the cards, too, madeurgent because the second quarter's seasonal weak demandwould trigger a price slump without production curbs.   But upon their arrival here, Saudi oil officials took adecidedly different tone, signaling the possibility that theworld's largest oil exporter could be a holdout if it isn'tafforded certain considerations in light of its willingnessto make up the shortfall of oil production during the MiddleEast crisis.   This is the first gathering of all ministers since thePersian Gulf war ended. As such, the meeting is expected toreflect the new alliances brought about by the conflict andset the political tone for the organization's future. Afterrepeated attempts to settle the conflict with Saddam Husseinwithout hostilities, the crisis degenerated into a war thatinvolved five OPEC members, with Iraq on one side and Kuwait,Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on theother. Because of the crisis, most observers are certain OPECwill never be the same again.   Several OPEC members, led by Saudi Arabia, expandedcapacities to more than make up daily losses of four millionbarrels of oil from Iraq and Kuwait, after embargoes tookthat production off the market. Saudi production rose to 8.4million barrels a day from 5.4 million barrels.   Because it accounted for the bulk of the OPEC outputincreases, Saudi Arabia is expected by several others to takethe lead in production cuts. Several formulas advanced bysome of the other countries suggest, in fact, that Saudioutput should drop to around seven million barrels a day orbelow.   But last night, members of the Saudi delegation scoffed atsuch recommendations. Production of &quot;6.5 million or sevenmillion is definitely out of line,&quot; said one official fromthe kingdom. &quot;If {the other OPEC members} aren't willing tobe cooperative, then there won't be any agreement&quot; on newpostwar quotas.   Even though all 13 nations of OPEC are due to berepresented at the ministerial meeting, the delegates cannottake action binding on OPEC unless they upgrade the meetingto an official conference. When asked if he thinks themeeting would be transformed into such a gathering, Saudi oilminister Hisham Nazer said, &quot;I don't think so; we're justcoming to a monitoring committee meeting.&quot;   OPEC is now producing at least 23 million barrels of oildaily. Over the last two weeks, OPEC President Sadek Boussenahas been lobbying hard for output reductions because ofconcern over surplus supplies and weak global economies thatmay soak up less oil in the weeks ahead. Most of the otherministers have voiced similar concerns.   &quot;We need to cut by one to two million barrels a day,&quot; saidYousef bin Yousef, oil minister for the United Arab Emirates,adding that the UAE was willing to join in the outputreductions.   Mr. Boussena is urging that production quotas bere-established and that output cuts total &quot;enough to restorethe $21 as the minimum reference price.&quot; Although world oilprices have recently increased unexpectedly, most of thegains have come in higher-quality lighter crudes, whileseveral OPEC nations produce heavier, less desired grades.OPEC crudes are averaging only slightly more than $16 abarrel, several dollars below the former reference price.   OPEC's own economists, meanwhile, are estimating thatdemand for the group's oil will drop sharply on a seasonalbasis in the second quarter to an average of only 21.4million or 21.5 million barrels a day. As a result, many OPECministers, including Mr. Boussena, see some urgency to therestoration of a production ceiling and the quotas, whichwere scrapped after the Persian Gulf crisis began in August.   The Saudis didn't make it immediately clear how much theymight consider reducing production in any OPEC-coordinatedeffort to restore quotas. &quot;Our minimum production is subjectto negotiation,&quot; one official confirmed, but he said thatSaudi Arabia saw no need for a production ceiling lower than22 million barrels a day.   Some other Saudi sources indicated that they don't see anyneed for production quotas at all at this time. &quot;The crisisisn't over yet,&quot; one high-ranking official said. He citedcontinuation of the economic sanctions against Iraq, andnoted that neither Iraq nor Kuwait is able to produce oil atthis time.   But if there is a renewal of the quota system, the Saudiswant it to take into account the expanded productioncapacities of the kingdom and a few other OPEC members. Atthe very least, the Saudis want the system to be set up prorata, with every nation cutting output by the samepercentage.   Other Saudi sources ruled out several other propositionsfloated here, including one suggestion that the kingdom mighttake over Kuwait's former quota of 1.5 million barrels a dayand produce the oil for the emirate as a loan. The idea wasruled out because the kingdom is hard-pressed to meet theexpenses associated with the war and needs all the revenue itcan raise through its oil production.   The Saudi stance is an unusually hard one for theconservative kingdom, especially at the opening of a meeting.Some of the meeting's attendees are even calling the toughSaudi position a bluff. &quot;I expect them to say that&quot; aboutproduction cuts, said one Persian Gulf delegate, suggestingthat the Saudis may be doing little more than posturing inorder to make any production agreement more favorable.</TEXT></DOC>
