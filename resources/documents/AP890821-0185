And touroperators are designing trips especially geared for grandparents _or great-aunts and -uncles, or surrogate grandparents _ travelingwith youngsters two generations down the line.   Helene Koenig, founder and owner of The Ticket Counter, a travelagency in Chevy Chase, Md., says she decided to create Grandtravelwhen she herself learned a few years ago that she was going to be agrandmother. Grandtravel's offerings range from the Washington areato American Indian country in the Southwest, the Alaskan wilderness,Dutch waterways and canals, New Zealand and Hawaii.   The youngsters usually range in ages from 7 to 14. The oldest``grandparent'' so far has been an unmarried gentleman of 79 who,Mrs. Koenig says, just wanted to see how the idea worked.   Mrs. Koenig matches her itineraries to the energy and interestsof both generations. So it's not surprising that the Tower of Londonand Madame Tussaud's Waxworks are part of a British tour, or thatchildren may enjoy water sports, weather permitting, while theirgrandparents visit the Aalsmeer flower auction in the Netherlands.   But the favorite trip of young and old alike, Mrs. Koenig says,is definitely the African safari. ``You never outgrow your love fora lion,'' she said in a telephone interview.   El Al, the Israeli airline, and AARP, the American Association ofRetired Persons, also are in the act.   El Al aims to give the older generation an opportunity toacquaint the youngsters with their Jewish heritage in Israel. Andagain, keeping in mind the needs of old and young, the itineraryincludes a Biblical Zoo of species of animals that were living inBiblical times, the stalagmite caves southwest of Jerusalem, and achance for the kids to float in the highly saline Dead Sea, as wellas more obvious attractions.   Alice Gregory, marketing manager for the AARP's Travel Service,says its program started only last year, with one devoted to anAmerican heritage area including Washington, D.C., and another to aEuropean destination. It is now planning to include tours coveringnational parks, London, Rome and Amsterdam, and perhaps otherdestinations.   An agent for Saga International, a Boston-based branch of aBritish company of the same name that specializes in travel forseniors, says it has been conducting grandchildren-grandparenttravel ever since it began business in the United States in 1982.The children may not be over 16, the grandparents must be at least60.   In all cases, most of the tours are in summer, when children areout of school.   Mrs. Koenig sees today's grandparents as already sophisticatedtravelers, and ``in really good shape, aerobically fit andnutritionally sound,'' and often more relaxed financially than thegrandchild's own parents. Often, grandparents and grandchildren livefar apart.   Mrs. Ann Callison of Magnolia, Ark., and Mrs. Betty Edwards ofJackson, Miss., are a couple of grandparents who have made tripswith Grandtravel.   Mrs. Callison took grandchildren Christopher and VanessaCallison-Burch, aged 11 and 9 respectively, on the Washington areaheritage trip and says they enjoyed every minute. She told theAssociated Press that she probably would have started taking themplaces on her own, to introduce them to the excitement of travel ata young age just as her parents introduced her, but saw aGrandtravel ad and decided to give it a try. It seems to haveworked, for she planned to add 7-year-old Alexa Callison-Burch tothe party this year, to visit the southwestern American Indianterritory. Mrs. Callison says she finds group travel a good idea foryoungsters because they meet others of their age group.   Mrs. Edwards took 11-year-old Elizabeth Edwards on the NationalPark tour last year. She says she chose group travel because shecannot drive great distances. She also says that although she seesher grandchildren about twice a week at home in Jackson, she saw awhole new facet of Elizabeth on the trip and in the one-on-onerelationship it engendered. She is firmly against taking more thanone child at a time, feeling that a major purpose of such travel isto get closer to one another minus sibling rivalries. This year,it's the turn of Elizabeth's 9-year-old sister, Margaret.Destination: the Southwest Indian country. Grandson Stephen EdwardsJr. is only 5, but Mrs. Edwards says he's already telling everyonethat his turn is coming. His grandmother is guessing he'll choosethe Kenya safari.</TEXT></DOC>
